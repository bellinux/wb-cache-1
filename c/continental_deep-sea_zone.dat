In addition to river-borne inputs (Mahakam), one can observe reworked sediments originating from the continental shelf in the course of its immersion.

40|$|Sediment cores {{collected}} {{in and around}} the Ross Sea, Antarctica, are described and discussed based on sedimentological data, such as visual descriptions, sedimentary structures, magnetic susceptibility, sand contents, and water content. On the Ross Sea Continental Shelf, the core sequences contain two lithologic units, soft diatomaceous mud in the upper and compound glacio-marine sediments in the lower. The lower lithologic unit suggests that highly ice-sheet influenced sedimentation existed in glacial times in the Ross Sea. The core sequences on the <b>continental</b> slope and <b>deep-sea</b> basins off the Ross Sea comprise foraminiferal ooze, siliceous mud, and terrigenous mud, sometimes with laminated parts.

Surface sediments (0 - 1 cm) were sub-sampled and analyzed for nucleic acid content (DNA, RNA) and bacterial density. DNA concentrations in the sediments were high (on annual average, 25. 0 μg g- 1) and declined with increasing water depth, ranging from 3. 5 to 55. 2 μg g- 1. DNA concentrations displayed wide temporal changes also at bathyal depths confirming the recent view of the large variability of the deep-sea environments. Also RNA concentrations decreased with increasing water depth (range: 0. 4 - 29. 9 μg g- 1). The ratio of RNA to DNA did not show a clear spatial pattern but was characterized by significant changes between sampling periods. DNA concentrations were significantly correlated with protein and phytopigment concentrations in the sediment, indicating a possible relationship with the inputs of primary organic matter from the photic layer. Bacterial densities were generally high (range: 0. 9 - 4. 6 x 108 cells g- 1) compared to other deep-sea environments and decreased with increasing water depth. Estimates of the bacterial contribution to the sedimentary genetic material indicated that bacterial-DNA accounted, on annual average, for {{a small fraction of}} the total DNA pool (4. 3 %) but that bacterial-RNA represented a significant fraction of the total sedimentary RNA (26 %). Bacterial contribution to nucleic acids increased, even though irregularly, with increasing depth. In deep-sea sediments, changes in RNA concentrations appear to be largely dependent upon bacterial dynamics. Estimates of the overall living contribution to the DNA pools (i. e. microbial plus meiofaunal DNA) indicated that the large majority (about 90 %) of the DNA in <b>continental</b> and <b>deep-sea</b> sediments of the eastern Mediterranean was detrital. The non-living DNA pools reach extremely high concentrations up to 0. 41 g DNA m- 2 cm- 1.

40|$|Mangrove {{communities}} in the Australian tropics presently occur as narrow belts of vegetation in estuaries and on sheltered, muddy coasts. Palynological data from <b>continental</b> shelf and <b>deep-sea</b> cores indicate a long-term cyclical component of mangrove development and decline at a regional scale, which {{can be linked to}} specific phases of late Quaternary sealevel change. Extensive mangrove development, relative to today, occurs during periods of marine transgression, whereas very diminished mangrove occurs during marine regressions and during rarer periods of relative sea-level stability. Episodes of flourishing mangrove cannot be linked to phases of humid climate, as has been suggested in studies elsewhere. Rather, the cycle of expansion and decline of mangrove communities on a grand scale is explained in terms of contrasting physiographic settings characteristic of continental-shelf coasts during transgressive and regressive phases, in particular by the existence, or lack, of well-developed tidal estuaries.

Phylogenetically and physiologically, these sediment strains resembled the sulfate-producing thiosulfate oxidizers from the Galapagos hydrothermal vents while showing habitat-related differences in growth temperature, rate and extent of thiosulfate utilization, and carbon substrate patterns. The abyssal deep-sea sediments yielded predominantly base-producing thiosulfate-oxidizing isolates related to Antarctic marine Psychroflexus species and other cold-water marine strains of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum, in addition to gamma-proteobacterial isolates of the genera Pseudoalteromonas and Halomonas-Deleya.

40|$|Dynamics of {{biological}} processes on the deep-sea floor are traditionally {{thought to be}} controlled by vertical sinking of particles from the euphotic zone at a seasonal scale. However, {{little is known about the}} influence of lateral particle transport from <b>continental</b> margins to <b>deep-sea</b> ecosystems. To address this question, we report here how the formation of dense shelf waters and their subsequent downslope cascade, a climate induced phenomenon, affects the population of the deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus. We found evidence that strong currents associated with intense cascading events correlates with the disappearance of this species from its fishing grounds, producing a temporary fishery collapse. Despite this initial negative effect, landings increase between 3 and 5 years after these major events, preceded by an increase of juveniles. The transport of particulate organic matter associated with cascading appears to enhance the recruitment of this deep-sea living resource, apparently mitigating the general trend of overexploitation. Because cascade of dense water from continental shelves is a global phenomenon, we anticipate that its influence on deep-sea ecosystems and fisheries worldwide should be larger than previously thought...|$|R

40|$|Submarine canyons in the Bellingshausen and Riiser-Larsen Seas are compared. It {{is pointed}} out that the canyons in the Bellingshausen Sea are so {{incorporated}} to build up a deep-sea fan or an apron slope, that they develop dominantly on an upper fan at the upper continental rise and disappear apparently on a lower fan at the lower <b>continental</b> rise.

On the contrary, the canyons in the Riiser-Larsen Sea have a large-scale entrenching throughout their course and construct a canyon-deep sea channel complex. This is caused by thermal cooling effect of lithosphere to deepen the old ocean basin. Buried canyons observed on the seismic profiles indicate that activation of the canyon formation was triggered by advancement of the Antarctic ice sheet toward {{the outer edge of the}} continental shelf sometime between 4 and 7 Ma BP.

The bottom is a red clay with manganese nodules {{at a depth of}} 5500 - 5800 m. Macrofaunal density ranges from 84 to 160 individuals per m super(2) and is therefore much the same as in Northwest Atlantic Gyre waters. Of the macrofaunal taxa, polychaetes dominate (55 per cent), followed by tanaids (18 per cent), bivalves (7 per cent), and isopods (6 per cent). Meiofaunal taxa were only partially retained by the 297 micrometer screen used in washing. Even then, they are 1. 5 - 3. 9 times as abundant as the microfaunal taxa, with nematodes being numerically dominant by far. Foraminifera seem to comprise an important portion of the community, but could not be assessed accurately because of the inability to discriminate living and dead tests. Remains of what are probably xenophyophoridans are also very important, but offer the same problem. Faunal diversity is extremely high, with deposit feeders comprising the overwhelming majority.

40|$|Abstract: Modern {{and ancient}} euxinic sediments are often enriched in iron {{that is highly}} {{reactive}} towards dissolved sulphide, compared to <b>continental</b> margin and <b>deep-sea</b> sedi-ments. It is proposed that iron enrichment results from the mobilization of dissolved iron from anoxic porewaters into overlying seawater, followed by transport into deep-basin environments, precipitation as iron sulphides, and deposition into sediments. A diagenetic model shows that diffusive iron fluxes are controlled mainly b porewater dissolved iron concentrations, {{the thickness of the}} surface oxygenated layer of sediment {{and to a lesser extent}} by pH and temperature. Under typical diagenetic conditions (pH < 8, porewater Fe 2 + = 10 - 6 g cm- 3) iron can diffuse from the porewaters in continental margin sediments to the oxygenated overlying seawater at fluxes of 100 - 1000 lag cm- 2 a-k The addition of reactive iron to deep-basin sediments i determined by the magnitude of this diffusive flux, the export efficiency (e) of recycled iron from the shelf, the ratio of source area (S) to basin sink area (B) and the trapping of reactive iron in the deep basin.

Microscopic analysis of N. scolopaceus gut contents revealed a predominance of large euphausiid and decapod prey. Other abundant potential prey, such as zooplankton, fish, and cephalopods, were absent from the diet, suggesting discriminatory feeding.

There is also reduced species diversity at the shallowest stations, probably caused by hydrodynamic disturbance, but no clear mid-slope peak in species diversity as described from the northwest Atlantic.

Although arid conditions associated with such a shift are well documented in southern Asia, {{as far south as}} Borneo, debate still exists regarding the precipitation response in southern Indonesia and Australia during HS 1. This study utilizes concentrations of the long-lived nuclide 232 Th as a proxy for detrital riverine input and 230 Th normalization to estimate the history of preserved fluxes reaching the seafloor in the Flores Sea, located between southern Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia. Because the only source of 232 Th to the ocean is continental minerals, this proxy is a robust indicator of continental weathering. The 230 Th normalized burial fluxes of lithogenic and biogenic matter demonstrate that both detrital and biogenic fluxes in the Flores Sea were higher during HS 1 than any other period in the past 22 k. y. High detrital fluxes indicate enhanced precipitation runoff from surrounding landmasses during a period of maximum southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This study further constrains the northern limit of enhanced rainfall associated with a southward shift of Australian monsoon-related rainfall at the time of HS 1 and highlights the value of 232 Th as a proxy of <b>continental</b> input to <b>deep-sea</b> sediment records...|$|R

For example, biogenic silica accumulation rates of 69 g SiO2/cm2/kyr have been reported for the Gulf of California. Due to the laterally confined character of these rapid biogenic silica accumulation zones, upwelling areas solely account for approximately 5% of the dissolved silica supplied to the oceans.

MethodsThis LME is the first in the world to have a complete regional IUCN Red List assessment of the native marine fish. We augmented these data with distributions of marine mammals, marine turtles and seabirds at risk, and we calculated the spatial distributions of species at risk (IUCN densities).

The study is made to get {{better understanding of the}} Plio-Pleistocene outbuilding in reference to glacial-interglacial or/and stadial-interstadial cyclicity, variation in accommodation space, as function of basin subsidence, glacioeustacy, and glacial dynamics and sedimentation. A total of 31 sequences, along with the SS-A to SS-D sequences in the Norwegian Channel, were observed, and are interpreted mainly to represent glacial-interglacial cycles. In terms of seismic stratigraphical geometry and architecture three distinct depositional regimes have been observed in present study and have been named as megasequence I, megasequence II and NSF megasequence. Megasequence I contains steep prograding clinothems. The prograding clinothems are built by glacially derived sediments sourced from the uplifted southwestern mainland Norway. Megasequence II was formed in the Norwegian Channel by fast flowing ice streams gouging the sediment around the coast of southern Norway. The flat successions, overlying a near-margin 1. 1 Ma erosion surface, consist of till, glacial marine and marine sediments. The megasequence NSF (North Sea Fan) consists of prograding wedges that developed by the fast flowing ice streams in the Norwegian Channel. The continued aggradation in the channel subsequently gave rise to progradation of the North Sea Fan. An effort was made to correlate sequences that have been found in the Norwegian Channel with those that have been identified in the North Sea Fan. The environment of deposition for the sequences has been determined using seismic facies.

40|$|Oceanic sediments {{deposited}} on continental margins consist mainly of erosion {{products of the}} nearby exposed continental areas. Detrital input usually dominates their geochemical budget, and the composition of these sediments should record potential changes in their continental sources. However, along margins, mineral sorting associated with transport and sedimentary processes induces significant chemical and isotopic fractionation over a few tens of kilometers. The study of margin sediments should help to quantify the extent of modification of the continental terrigenous supply when it reaches deep oceans. Reported Sr, Nd, Hf and Pb isotopic compositions of fifty-seven sediments from the northernmost part of the Cascade forearc (Ocean Drilling Program, ODP, Sites 888 and 1027) suggest the involvement of two dominant end-members coming from the nearby Canadian Cordillera. Erosion products of the depleted, {{western part of the}} Cordillera dominate the detrital input, while the eastern enriched terranes of the Cordillera contribute only 10 to 28 % of the input. There is no marked change of provenance of sediments during the last 3. 5 Myr and they all appear unaffected by glacial-interglacial climate cycles. The average isotopic compositions of the two sites are slightly different, but are both dominated by continental signature; these values can be used in future studies to identify any subducted sediment contribution to the Cascades Arc. On a finer scale, there are differences in the isotopic signature between samples dominated by clay minerals and those with coarser lithologies. For a given Nd isotopic composition, fine sediments have more radiogenic Sr and Hf isotope ratios than sands, and we interpret the difference as resulting from mineral sorting during transport of the particles. Fine sediments concentrate minerals with radiogenic Sr and Hf such as clays and micas, while coarse-grained detritus carry the unradiogenic mineral component of a given source rock through plagioclase-epidote and zircon. ODP Site 1027 is located 100 km further away from continent than ODP Site 888 and contains more clay. As a consequence, it has significantly more radiogenic Sr and Hf bulk composition than ODP Site 888. Similar differences in isotopic signatures related to the distance to continent certainly occur in other areas in the word, and will account for a large part of differences known between <b>continental</b> sources and <b>deep-sea</b> sediments...|$|R
40|$|Relative abundances of quartz and {{feldspar}} in fine-grained terrigenous sediments {{have been}} used to recognize specific continental sediment sources along northwestern South America and to trace the dispersal of specific grain size fractions from these sources to adjacent <b>continental</b> margin and <b>deep-sea</b> sedimentary environments. Quartz/feldspar ratios are low (∼ 0. 6) for all fractions of sediments derived from southern Peru and northern Chile, but such ratios increase systematically in central and northern Peru as the importance of granitic and related intrusives increases relative to more basaltic extrusives and gabbroic equivalents. Limited published analyses of dusts collected offshore (Prospero and Bonatti, 1969) are also consistent with a latitudinally varying continental sediment source. We find that clay (< 4 µm) and fine silt (8 – 11 µm) dispersal patterns are coincident with offshore wind-driven surface currents, whereas nearly all coarser sedimentary components (32 – 62 µm particles) exhibit limited dispersal normal to the shoreline on the continental margin. Because of the coincidence of wind and surface current patterns, transport of clay and fine silt away from the South American continent could be caused by either mechanism. However, on crossing to the seaward side of the Peru-Chile Trench, sedimentation rates decrease dramatically, silt/clay ratios are higher than expected, and clay mineral assemblages change abruptly. We argue that the trench is an imposing physiographic barrier to the seaward near-bottom advection of suspended particulates, thereby limiting the major influence of hemipelagic sedimentation to the continental margin. Deposition of terrigenous eolian components is clearly dominant seaward of the trench. Regardless of the mechanism responsible for the horizontal transport, rapid settling is required once a terrigenous particle leaves the surface mixed layer. We propose that coarse silt particles settle out of the water column rapidly over the shelf and continental slope, while finer components are incorporated into fecal pellets by large populations of zooplankton and nekton. Our observations that planktonic organisms ingest quartz and feldspar grains in proportions similar to those found on the underlying sea floor and that fecal pellets are ubiquitous in bottom sediments where an oxygen minimum impinges on the continental slope suggest the predominance of fecal pellet transport for these components...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the marine {{phosphorus}} (P) cycle and its response to changing environmental conditions, particularly those associated with glacial-interglacial cycles of the late Pleistocene and Ocean Anoxic Events in the Cretaceous. From a box model of the ocean phosphorus, organic carbon and oxygen cycles, climate change scenarios are applied representing these events. The effects of continental supply of reactive P, oceanic mixing, and sea level on the marine P cycle are examined on glacial-interglacial timescales. Results show that mixing is a dominant forcing during early glaciation and leads to an initial lowering of oceanic primary production, while sea level fall is the dominant forcing during late glaciation, enhancing nutrient supply to the open ocean. Post glacial periods are times of peak productivity, and primary production is generally lower during glaciations relative to post glacial periods, arguing against the biological pump hypothesis for CO 2 drawdown. When shelf erosion during sea level low stands and particulate matter re-routing to the open ocean via submarine river canyons are implemented {{as part of the}} glacial-interglacial transition scenario, the results indicate that deep sea oxygen levels may lower significantly, mainly due to the supply of new material from the shelves and particulate organic matter bypassing the coastal <b>zone.</b> <b>Deep-sea</b> oxygen demand is decoupled from primary productivity in the open ocean and the phosphorus burial does not reflect ocean fertilization. When the box model is adapted to Cretaceous ocean conditions, Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs) can be triggered by enhanced P supply from land, for an ocean with wide continental shelves, slow circulation and high sea surface temperatures. The system is most sensitive to oceanic mixing. Model results imply OAEs can be sustained by P recycling from sediments due to low oxygen in the water column. These results are corroborated by P burial data from the geological record for OAE 2. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that low mixing of ocean waters (poor ventilation) and enhanced sedimentary P recycling are necessary to achieve ocean anoxia. Phosphorus burial in deep sea sediments is investigated as a function of bottom water oxygen and organic matter flux to the sediment water interface, using a mechanistic reactive transport model for sediment diagenesis. Hypoxic, oligotrophic conditions are thus identified as optimum for P recycling from the sediment. The mechanistically derived redox P burial is implemented in the box model of the marine P, oxygen and organic carbon cycles. Results show that, although deep-sea burial of reactive P phases changes, the biogeochemical cycling in the ocean is not impacted...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} and {{dynamics of the}} last British–Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) have hitherto largely been reconstructed from onshore and shallow marine glacial geological and geomorphological data. This reconstruction has been problematic because these sequences and data are spatially and temporally incomplete and fragmentary. In order to enhance BIIS reconstruction, we present a compilation of new and previously published ice-rafted detritus (IRD) flux and concentration data from high-resolution sediment cores recovered from the NE Atlantic <b>deep-sea</b> <b>continental</b> slope adjacent to the last BIIS. These cores are situated adjacent to the full latitudinal extent of the last BIIS and cover Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 2 and 3. Age models are based on radiocarbon dating and graphical tuning of abundances of the polar planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral (% Nps) to the Greenland GISP 2 ice core record. Multiple IRD fingerprinting techniques indicate that, at the selected locations, most IRD are sourced from adjacent BIIS ice streams except in the centre of Heinrich (H) layers in which IRD shows a prominent Laurentide Ice Sheet provenance. IRD flux data are interpreted with reference to a conceptual model explaining the relations between flux, North Atlantic hydrography and ice dynamics. Both positive and rapid negative mass balance can cause increases, and prominent peaks, in IRD flux. First-order interpretation of the IRD record indicates {{the timing of the}} presence of the BIIS with an actively calving marine margin. The records show a coherent latitudinal, but partly phased, signal during MIS 3 and 2. Published data indicate that the last BIIS initiated during the MIS 5 / 4 cooling transition; renewed growth just before H 5 (46 ka) was succeeded by very strong millennial-scale variability apparently corresponding with Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) cycles closely coupled to millennial-scale climate variability in the North Atlantic region involving latitudinal migration of the North Atlantic Polar Front. This indicates that the previously defined “precursor events” are not uniquely associated with H events but are part of the millennial-scale variability. Major growth of the ice sheet occurred after 29 ka with the Barra Ice Stream attaining a shelf-edge position and generating turbiditic flows on the Barra–Donegal Fan at ∼ 27 ka. The ice sheet reached its maximum extent at H 2 (24 ka), earlier than interpreted in previous studies. Rapid retreat, initially characterised by peak IRD flux, during Greenland Interstadial 2 (23 ka) was followed by readvance between 22 and 16 ka. Readvance during H 1 was only characterised by BIIS ice streams draining central dome(s) of the ice sheet, and was followed by rapid deglaciation and ice exhaustion. The evidence for a calving margin and IRD supply from the BIIS during Greenland Stadial 1 (Younger Dryas event) is equivocal. The timing of the initiation, maximum extent, deglacial and readvance phases of the BIIS interpreted from the IRD flux record is strongly supported by recent independent data from both the Irish Sea and North Sea sectors of the ice sheet...|$|R
40|$|Submarine canyons deeply incise the Mediterranean {{continental}} margins, becoming authentic conduits {{between the}} <b>continental</b> shelves and <b>deep-sea</b> basins. Enhanced habitat heterogeneity and organic inputs allow a noticeable benthic biodiversity development, creating authentic “hotspots” of biodiversity. However, if knowledge on distribution {{and composition of}} benthic assemblages dwelling in different canyon systems across the Mediterranean basin is considerably increasing; on the other hand, factors driving their distribution and biodiversity at multiple spatial scales are still difficult to discern and thus far to being well understood. Among these benthic communities, suspension feeders take considerable advantages from environmental features of canyons; because of this, they are often dominant showing dense patches of large Anthozoan. These organisms, along with other components of the benthos such as sponges, ascidians and bryozoans, enhance the three-dimensional development of the habitat, constituting the so called ‘animal forests’ which play a key ecological role in the benthic-pelagic coupling processes. Moreover, due to their slow growth rates, longevity and tridimensional structure, these species are particularly vulnerable towards mechanical injuries inflicted by fishing gears. In this regard, supporting knowledge on their distribution patterns and ecology are {{needed in order to}} develop sound conservation measures. Therefore, through a non-invasive protocol based on ROV footage coupled with multi-beam dataset, this thesis aims to document Sardinian deepwater coral forests communities dwelling along different canyons and other geological features of the Sardinian continental margin. The present work compares local, and regional biodiversity of coral communities inhabiting contrasting and similar geological features of the continental margin, considering different spatial scales and also exploring the role of a subset of environmental descriptors, obtained through the image analysis, in determining the observed patterns. Overall, multi-variate analyses emphasized a higher variability in the composition of coral communities at the smallest spatial scale investigated that overcomes the variability at regional/geographical scale. In particular, in the first study, patterns of observed diversity were significant different within the same geological feature rather than among contrasting geological setting, and the tested environmental variables explained the patterns of observed diversity. In the second study, results suggested that coral community composition differed across canyons within the same area, but not among the three geographical areas, and that variations patterns appeared to be mainly constrained by differences in the hydrodynamic conditions operating on local scales. The last part of the thesis aimed to describe the distribution and demographic features of scleractinian habitat-forming cold water coral Madrepora oculata encountered in the north eastern and southern western canyons of the island of Sardinia. These species are documented {{for the first time in}} the northeast Sardinian continental margin, extending the geographical framework of the recently discovered “Sardinian cold water coral province”. Results revealed that, as for all the best developed CWC situations present in the Mediterranean Sea, the new Sardinian province is clearly dominated by patches of M. oculata occurring with small/medium size colonies in two different type of substrate (rocky wall and inclined silted bottom). Results from the present thesis increase knowledge on deep coral assemblages inhabiting Sardinian submarines canyons, providing new insights on the scale-dependent structure and dynamics of deep dwelling coral assemblages. These results will likely have considerable implications for the spatial development of forthcoming conservation strategies to preserve such biodiversity hotspots...|$|R
40|$|We propose an international, {{collaborative}} surface-ship-based {{effort to}} survey the world 2 ̆ 7 s ocean floors in all the areas not yet thoroughly surveyed by swath bathymetric sonar, sidescan sonar and routine geophysics (magnetics, gravity, subbottom profiler) to precise standards of data quality and navigation accuracy. These new bathymetric and associated measurements will gradually replace the existing non-uniform coverage of surface vessel track and area data, currently combined with uniform but low resolution altimeter-derived depths. The objective is to produce a world ocean database at least {{an order of magnitude}} better in resolution than what exists over much of the world ocean. Currently, the only established international structure with a worldwide mandate for compiling bathymetric data is GEBCO (General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, jointly sponsored by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO and the International Hydrographic Organization). GEBCO continually updates its world ocean maps and grids of depths by incorporating regional maps produced in the IBC (International Bathymetric Chart), localized maps resulting from research projects, data assembled by scientific data groups such as LDEO 2 ̆ 7 s Marine Geoscience Data System, track data submitted to world and national data centers, and inshore data collected by Hydrographic Offices for navigational purposes. Further multibeam data is expected to come from Coastal States who have undertaken mapping of their juridical Continental Shelf to satisfy the requirements of UNCLOS Article 76. This acoustic data is combined with satellite altimetry data to produce maps that have a horizontal resolution that is in places hundreds of meters but over extensive areas no better than approximately 28 km. In other words, the fabric of the world ocean floor is known and portrayed to highly variable resolution. This means that while the first-order plate tectonic/volcanic seafloor fabric (fracture zones, rift valleys, large seamounts and igneous plateaus) is captured for the entire ocean, second order features like abyssal hills, fault-controlled escarpments, lava flows, propagating rift tips, volcanic rift <b>zones,</b> <b>deep-sea</b> channels, mud volcanoes, emergent diapirs, landslide scars and debris flows, pockmarks, and iceberg plowmarks are know only in a few limited areas. Although vigorous efforts have produced maps of high resolution in some areas, there is at present no coherent plan to collect data that would bring the rest of the ocean up to the level of knowledge that is achievable. We solicit interest in organizing an international workshop that would produce a long-term plan to measure depths and associated data in a systematic fashion in the vast oceanic regions sparsely surveyed by surface ships. To meet this ambitious objective, this international project will need to be carefully designed to optimize return of information balanced against economical use of ship time. Societal benefits will include improved assessment of seafloor/subbottom geological resources, geohazard risk (earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanism and submarine landslides), fin and shellfish habitats, submarine cable routing, and navigational hazards. Science will gain understanding of the complex processes that shape and modify the ocean floor and subbottom, including the influence of bottom topography on circulation and the seafloor 2 ̆ 7 s role as benthic biosphere host. Exciting discoveries will attract follow-up academic studies, e. g. with AUVs, sampling, and sea-floor observatories...|$|R
40|$|The International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) {{states in}} its current IODP Science Plan for 2013 - 2023 that the polar regions {{are one of the}} primary target areas for {{scientific}} drilling using the drill vessels Joides Resolution and Chikyu as well as various drilling options in so-called Mission-Specific Platforms. In particular this is expressed in the Science Plan’s Key Theme “Climate and Ocean Change” and its Challenge 1 “How does Earth’s climate system respond to elevated levels of atmospheric CO 2 ” and Challenge 2 “How do ice sheets and sea level respond to a warming climate”: The response of ice sheets to a warmer climate can be reconstructed from sedimentary records of relatively recent interglacial episodes when ice extent was similar, or slightly less than at present, and from much earlier times (34 - 3 Ma) when climate was several degrees warmer than today. Analysis of recently recovered ocean sediment cores suggests that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), with a potential of 4 m sea level rise, is particularly sensitive to climate change and may have collapsed many times over the last 5 million years. Estimates of sea level rise during warm intervals about 3 million years ago suggest the possibility of even larger changes. The Greenland Ice Sheet and WAIS together account for only about 12 m of potential sea level, so estimates greater than 12 m imply a significant loss of ice from the much larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet, containing the equivalent of about 52 m of sea level. Some of the major questions to be urgently addressed are: Did large sections of the West and East Antarctic Ice Sheets collapse the last time when atmospheric CO 2 levels reached 400 ppm? What are the time spans over which past ice sheet collapses occurred, and how much warming was required to push them past their “tipping points”? To answer these questions, sediment cores are needed from the Antarctic shelves and slopes where sediment accumulates rapidly. This information is needed, along with land-based records, to constrain numerical ice sheet models that attempt to predict how ice sheets melt under warmer conditions. Drilling of <b>continental</b> rise and <b>deep-sea</b> sediments at sites close to past ice sheets will provide more direct information regarding regional ice melt history and the timing of ice advance and retreat. Ultimately, the combination of these ice-proximal and ice-distal data with modelling techniques can be used to work out the relative contributions of different ice sheets to past sea level change, providing more realistic scenarios for testing predictive models and a better understanding of ice sheet behaviour in climate change situations. The general drilling strategy in IODP is to target locations ranging from polar seas to low-latitude upwelling zones to explain the behaviour of the climate system during past episodes of global warmth. This is well in line with the SCAR-PAIS approach to development of “ice-to-abyss” data transects, extending from the ice sheet interior to the deep sea in order to link ice core, ice sheet-proximal, offshore, and far-field records of past ice sheet behaviour and sea level, yielding an unprecedented view of past changes in ice sheet geometry, volume, and ice sheet-ocean interactions. About 10 drilling proposals for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, at various stages from pre-proposals to revised and mature full proposals, are currently in the IODP evaluation and implementation system. Some have been forwarded to the Facility Boards for scheduling, and one proposal is already scheduled for drilling. This presentation will give an overview of these proposals and their progress stages, also with regard to the future perspectives and challenges of IODP, and will discuss strategies that may help successful proposals to be considered for drilling. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the non-crustacean {{invertebrates}} dwelling on the deep Mediterranean Sea is of interest for different marine science disciplines, being the diversity of species and their distributions largely unexplored. In fact, the present Thesis conducted an effort {{in order to increase}} valid scientific information not only at taxonomical level, but also at the level of community composition and distribution. Detailed data on the reproductive biology and ethology was required for some group of ecological relevance in order to solve some relevant gaps of information. Ten multidisciplinary oceanographic cruises were conducted between October 2008 and April 2013 to sample the deep seafloor of the western Mediterranean Sea. The sampling areas included the Blanes Canyon and its adjacent open slope, the Palamós (also named La Fonera) and Cap de Creus Canyons, sea hills in the Gulf of Valencia and Eivissa Channel, and landslides on the Eivissa Channel. A total of 223 benthic trawls were completed resulting in a total swept area of 10. 3 km². Samples were also observed by means of two ROV’s. Resulting from these ten cruises, this work evidenced and updated species bathymetrical and geographical distributions ranges of non-crustacean invertebrate species by different methodologies (i. e. traditional and technologically advanced sampling). As a result of that effort, new faunistic reports were described: two first records (i. e. Gracilechinus elegans (Düben & Koren, 1844) Dicopia antirrhinum C. Monniot, 1972), three rare species (i. e. Hedingia mediterranea (Bartolini Baldelli, 1914), Penilpidia ludwigi (von Marenzeller, 1893) and Phascolosoma (Phascolosoma) turnerae (Rice, 1985), and eleven extensions of maximum depth range of distribution. This new record for Dicopia antirrhinum increased the lower depth limit of this genus in the Mediterranean Sea from 500 to 1100 m depth. This finding contributes to the knowledge of the poorly investigated Mediterranean deep ascidian fauna, in sharp contrast with the relatively well-known shallow-water Mediterranean ascidians. We also observed that densities and biomass of non-crustacean invertebrates were pointed to be significantly higher in submarine canyons than in surrounding open slopes. These findings suggest submarine canyon habitats of the north-western Mediterranean Sea as hotspots of benthic megafauna communities. The most abundant group in terms of density was the Phylum Echinodermata. A Phylum largely undescribed in deep Mediterranean waters, when compared with the faunistic data already available for the Atlantic. All specimen sampled of this Phylum were classified, described and their bathymetrical ranges re-defined. These results were compared and extended with the previous published literature, checking, validating (or discarding) all available information. The reproductive pattern of the most abundant species of Asteroidea in the present study, Ceramaster grenadensis was studied. The size pattern distribution of show a depth related trend showing smaller sizes at greater depths (dwarfism), as observed in other species of Atlantic Ocean. Additionally, juveniles were sampled at the deepest range of distribution of the species (i. e. 2250 m). Histological analysis of C. grenadensis gonads, revealed a semicontinous reproductive patterns, with a maximum of reproductive activity in autumn (maximum values of Gonadal Index). This finding coincides with some already published study for other deep-sea Mediterranean Echinoderm species such as B. lyrifera. The in situ faunal sampling with video technologies (i. e. Remotely Operated Vehicles; ROVs) showed the occurrence of different species assemblage compositions in different geomorphological habitats such as, submarine canyons, sea hills and landslides. Benthic cnidarian communities were observed in seamount rocky areas while submarine landslides fauna were mainly composed by vagil fauna as fishes and crustaceans. The description of characteristics seascape units might help to estimate taxonomical group in other similar but presently unexplored deep-sea areas. Finally, this study suggests that an increasing effort combining traditional and technologically-new sampling methods is advisable in order to obtain a more complete overview of species inhabiting the different <b>deep-sea</b> <b>continental</b> margins. En el estudio de la presente tesis se pretende realizar una exhaustiva clasificación taxonómica de las especies de invertebrados no-crustáceos muestreados en el margen catalán profundo, así como determinar sus patrones de distribución y su composición faunística. El material utilizado fue recopilado a lo largo de 10 campañas oceanográficas realizadas entre octubre 2008 y abril 2013 en el Mediterráneo occidental en el marco de los Proyecto Nacionales y Europeos PROMETEO, DOSMARES, BIOFUN, PROMARES y EUROLEON. Las áreas de muestreo incluyeron el Cañón de Blanes y su talud adyacente, los cañones de la Fonera y Cap de Creus, dos montañas submarinas ubicadas en el Golfo de Valencia y el Canal de Ibiza, y dos deslizamientos submarinos del Canal de Ibiza. Adicionalmente se realizó una campaña transmediterránea en la cual se muestrearon tres áreas del Mediterráneo, oeste, central y este. Se utilizaron para la recolección de muestras tanto métodos de muestreos tradicionales (artes de arrastre) como nuevas tecnologías de muestreo visual (ROV). Las profundidades muestreadas mediante ROV fueron de entre los 60 m y los 1100 m de profundidad; y entre los 850 m y los 2850 m mediante muestreos tradicionales. Se obtuvieron 5877 individuos distribuidos en 8 Filos, 18 Clases y 69 especies. En la presente Tesis se describe por primera vez en el Mediterráneo la presencia de dos especies: el equinoideo regular Gracilechinus elegans (Düben & Koren, 1844) y la ascidia carnívora Dicopia antirrhinum C. Monniot, 1972. Igualmente se describió la presencia de tres especies consideradas ‘raras’: las holoturias endémicas Hedingia mediterranea (Bartolini Baldelli, 1914) y Penilpidia ludwigi (von Marenzeller, 1893) así como el sipúnculido Phascolosoma (Phascolosoma) turnerae Rice, 1985. Asimismo se amplió el rango de distribución batimétrica de 11 especies. Los datos se analizaron además de a nivel puramente taxonómico, a nivel poblacional, revelando mayores densidades (individuos • km - 2) y biomasas (kg • km - 2) en zonas de cañones submarinos. También se observó que a nivel faunístico el grupo más abundante fueron los equinodermos, representando el 57 % del total de especímenes recolectados. Si pasamos a considerar los datos obtenido mediante imágenes de ROV, se recopilaron un total de 4520 observaciones faunísticas de los tres hábitats geomorfológicos descritos (un cañón, dos montes y dos deslizamientos submarinos) y entre los cuales se describieron similitudes en cuanto a comunidades faunísticas en función de parámetros tales como la profundidad, geomorfología y tipo de substrato...|$|R
