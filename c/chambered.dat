5|$|An {{excavation}} led by Professor Glyn Daniel in 1937 {{identified the}} site as a <b>chambered</b> long barrow. However, more recently, long barrows have {{been defined as}} having long earthen mounds with wooden internal structures, whereas <b>chambered</b> tombs, while also being covered by a long mound, have internal chambers built of stone. No long barrows with wooden internal structures {{have been identified in}} southeast Wales, perhaps because long barrows were usually built where there was no suitable stone.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental work {{to investigate the}} effect of Re-entrant and Toroidal combustion <b>chambers</b> in a DICI Engine. The two combustion <b>chambers</b> namely Re-entrant combustion <b>chamber</b> (RCC) and Toroidal combustion <b>chamber</b> (TCC) were fitted in a 4. 4 kW single cylinder Direct Injection Compression Ignition (DICI) engine and tests were conducted with diesel. The influences of the combustion <b>chamber</b> geometry characteristics on combustion, performance and emissions characteristics have been investigated. This investigation shows the peak pressure of re-entrant <b>chamber</b> is {{higher than that of}} toroidal <b>chamber.</b> The heat release rate and brake thermal efficiency for re-entrant <b>chamber</b> are slightly higher than that of toroidal <b>chamber.</b> Specific fuel consumption is lower for toroidal <b>chamber</b> than that of re-entrant <b>chamber.</b> The enhancement in reduction of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon is observed for Re-entrant <b>chamber</b> compared to the Toroidal <b>chamber.</b> Oxides of nitrogen are reduced for toroidal <b>chamber</b> than that of re-entrant <b>chamber...</b>|$|R

5|$|This {{disparity}} between the sizes of the megaliths is unparalleled among the other surviving stone circles in the Dorset area, {{and may have been}} a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in south-western Scotland, for example the Loupin' Stones, Ninestane Rigg, and Burgh Hill, all of which share the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting this link between Dorset and south-western Scotland {{is the fact that the}} Grey Mare and her Colts—a <b>chambered</b> long barrow located two and a half miles south-west of the Nine Stones—displays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of <b>chambered</b> long barrows.|$|E
5|$|A {{fluxgate}} gradiometer {{survey in}} July 2009 investigated standing stones {{in the garden}} of the Druids Arms public house known as The Cove, which showed that the stones date from nearly a thousand years before the stone circles.

5|$|In 1993, FN {{introduced}} {{a modified version}} of the P90 with a magazine adapted to use the SS190 cartridge.

5|$|Pottery shards {{found at}} the {{important}} site of Jarlshof also indicate that there was Neolithic activity there although the main settlement dates from the Bronze Age.

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of occupational debris like ceramic sherds over the bones was {{not unique to}} the site but common in <b>chambered</b> tombs from southern England. On {{the basis of an}} example discovered at Kit's Coty House, Ashbee thought it apparent that the contents of the Coldrum's chamber would have been compartmentalised by medial slabs, which served the same purpose as the side chambers of West Kennet and Wayland's Smithy.|$|E
5|$|Addington Long Barrow is a <b>chambered</b> long barrow {{located near}} {{to the village of}} Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow {{consisted}} of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Collapsed stones on the northeastern end of the chamber probably represented a stone chamber in which human remains might have been deposited; none, however, have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Bronze Age {{settlers}} also constructed megaliths {{at various}} sites, {{many of them}} dating from the second millennium BC, although the <b>chambered</b> cairns were replaced by burial cists, found on for example, Inchmarnock.

During the early Iron Age Brythonic culture held sway, there being no evidence that the Roman occupation of southern Scotland extended to these islands.|$|E

5|$|Coldrum Long Barrow is {{comparatively}} {{isolated from}} the other Medway Megaliths; in this it is unique, given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups. It is possible that another <b>chambered</b> tomb was located nearby; a razed, elongated earthen mound with an east–west orientation {{is located in a}} hollow {{at the foot of the}} downs just under a quarter of a mile north of the Coldrum Stones. It may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried. Several large sarsens south of the Coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb, since destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{being used in the}} FN P90 and FN Five-seven firearms, the 5.7×28mm cartridge has subsequently been used {{in a number of other}} weapons, such as the AR-57 and FN PS90 carbines. Excel Arms has developed four firearms <b>chambered</b> in 5.7×28mm, and MasterPiece Arms offers three different firearms in 5.7×28mm. The 5.7×28mm cartridge itself is produced in a number of varieties, two of which—the SS195LF and SS197SR—are currently offered by FN to civilian shooters.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that there was a}} facade in front of the chamber, as is evident at other <b>chambered</b> tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and Wayland's Smithy. It is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber, as was apparent at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.|$|E
