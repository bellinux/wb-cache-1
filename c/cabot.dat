Having discovered North America instead, on his return <b>Cabot</b> spoke of the great quantities of cod to be found near the new land. In 1498 <b>Cabot</b> set sail again from Bristol with an expedition of five ships and is believed to have never returned from this voyage, although recent research conducted at the University of Bristol, suggests that he might have.|$|E

5|$|The {{foundations}} of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms. In 1496, King Henry VII of England, following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration, commissioned John <b>Cabot</b> to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic. <b>Cabot</b> sailed in 1497, {{five years after the}} European discovery of America, but he made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland, and, mistakenly believing (like Christopher Columbus) that he had reached Asia, there was no attempt to found a colony. <b>Cabot</b> led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was ever heard of his ships again.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1420, vessels from Bristol were {{regularly}} travelling to Iceland {{and it is}} speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John <b>Cabot.</b> After <b>Cabot</b> arrived in Bristol, he proposed a scheme to the king, Henry VII, in which he proposed to reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic. He estimated {{that this would be}} shorter and quicker than Columbus' southerly route. The merchants of Bristol, operating under the name of the Society of Merchant Venturers, agreed to support his scheme. They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s, looking for possible trading opportunities. In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port.|$|E

2500|$|A {{poem about}} Boston, {{attributed}} to various people, describes the city thus: [...] "And here's to good old Boston / The {{land of the}} bean and the cod / Where Lowells talk only to <b>Cabots</b> / and <b>Cabots</b> talk only to God." [...] While wealthy colonial families like the Lowells and <b>Cabots</b> (often called the Boston Brahmins) ruled the city, the 1840s brought waves of new immigrants from Europe. These included large numbers of Irish and Italians, giving the city a large Roman Catholic population.|$|R

5|$|Ships {{occasionally}} departed Bristol for Iceland {{as early}} as 1420, and speculation exists that sailors (fisherman who landed on the Canadian coast to salt/ smoke their catch) from Bristol made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John <b>Cabot.</b> Beginning in the early 1480s, the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers sponsored exploration of the North Atlantic in search of trading opportunities. In 1552, Edward VI granted a royal charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port. Among explorers to depart from the port after <b>Cabot</b> were Martin Frobisher, Thomas James, after whom James Bay, on southern coast of Hudson Bay is named and Martin Pring, who discovered Cape Cod and the southern New England coast in 1603.|$|E

5|$|From 1499 to 1508 {{a number}} of other expeditions were {{launched}} from Bristol to the 'New found land', the earliest being undertaken by William Weston. One of these, led by John Cabot's son, Sebastian <b>Cabot,</b> explored down the coast of North America until he was ‘almost in the latitude of Gibraltar’ and ‘almost the longitude of Cuba’. This would suggest that he reached as far as the Chesapeake, close to what is now Washington D.C.|$|E

5|$|Opinions of Hamilton {{have run}} the gamut: both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson viewed him as unprincipled and dangerously aristocratic.

The Kingdom of Evils, a book on psychiatric social work by Southard and Jarrett, was published after his death.

5|$|St. John's {{is one of}} North America's oldest European settlements, with {{fishermen}} {{setting up}} seasonal camps in the early 16th century. Sebastian <b>Cabot</b> declares in a handwritten Latin text in his original 1545 map, that St. John's earned its name {{when he and his}} father, the Venetian explorer John <b>Cabot</b> became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour, in the morning of 24 June 1494 (against British and French historians stating 1497), the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. However, the locations of Cabot's landfalls are disputed. A series of expeditions to St. John's by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early 16th century, and by 1540 French, Spanish and Portuguese ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula. In the Basque Country, it is a common belief the name of St. John's was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in the Basque Country, where one of the fishing towns is called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in Basque, Donibane).|$|E

40|$|Despite being widely {{distributed}} in South America and having relatively large populations, {{little is known}} about the trophic ecology of the South American Tern (Sterna hirundinacea) and <b>Cabot's</b> Tern (Thalasseus acuflavidus). In Brazil, South American and Terns <b>Cabot's</b> breed in mixed colonies from the state of Espírito Santo to Santa Catarina. Here, we describe results of a study of the feeding ecology of these two species during the reproductive seasons of April to October of 2003, 2005 and 2006 from Cardos Island, Santa Catarina, Brazil. A total of 6248, 5140, and 4006 fishes were delivered to chicks or females by South American Terns; and 1157, 628 and 98 fish and or other prey items by <b>Cabot's</b> Terns during the breeding seasons of 2003, 2005, and 2006, respectively. Prey items identified included eight, seven and nine fish families for South American Terns; and, five, three and two families for <b>Cabot's</b> terns, in the three respective years. The number of food deliveries per chick for South American Terns was between 09 : 00 and 10 : 00 am in 2006, and between 11 : 00 and 12 : 00 am in 2005. <b>Cabot's</b> Terns chicks were fed in the early hours of the morning until late afternoon...|$|R
