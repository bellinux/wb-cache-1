5|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass <b>cruet</b> of 1909.|$|E

500|$|Burges was {{a notable}} {{designer}} of Gothic-inspired metalwork and jewellery, {{and he has}} been cited as [...] "Pugin's successor in the Gothic revival style." [...] Although Burges was foremost an architect, Edmund Gosse described his buildings as [...] "more jewel than architecture", and Crook states that [...] "Burges's genius as a designer is expressed to perfection in his jewellery and metalwork." [...] He began with religious artifacts (candlesticks, chalices, pectoral crosses) as individual commissions or as part of the decorative scheme for buildings over which he had complete artistic control. Examples include the chalices for St Michael's Church, Brighton, the statue of the Angel which stands above St Fin Barre's and which was his personal gift to the cathedral, and the Dunedin Crozier. This item, carved in ivory and depicting St George slaying the dragon, was made for the first Bishop of Dunedin. In 1875 Burges published the design in a French magazine as a thirteenth century original, an example of his delight in tricks and jokes. Similarly inventive were his designs for fish plates for Lord Bute, in which a service of eighteen plates is decorated with punning illustrations, such as a skating skate, and a winged perch seated on the branch of a tree. He also undertook commissions for other patrons, including the Sneyd dessert service. On 3 April 1872, Burges produced a gothic-style brooch for the marriage of the Marquess of Bute to Lady Bute. In September 1873, he produced another brooch for the Marchioness, {{in the shape of a}} gothic G, a gold heraldic shield in enamel, encrusted with gems and pearls. He followed this with a necklace and earrings, an attempt to [...] "design in Castellani's archeological style." [...] Another example of the works that Burges created for Lady Bute as a present for her husband, was a silver <b>cruet</b> set, in the form of two medieval retainers carrying tiny barrels of salt and pepper; the answer to the question of [...] "what to give a man who (could) afford everything." ...|$|E

He studied the effects on a large pond in Clapham Common, London. [...] "I fetched out a <b>cruet</b> of oil and dropt a little of it on the water... though not more than a teaspoon full, produced an instant calm over a space of several yards square."

2500|$|The new genre, simply called [...] "underground", had {{explicit}} lyrics about drugs, violence, poverty, friendship, {{love and}} sex. These themes, depicting {{the troubles of}} inner-city life, can still be found in reggaeton. [...] "Underground" [...] music was recorded in marquesinas (Puerto Rican carports) and distributed in the streets on cassettes. The marquesinas were crucial {{to the development of}} Puerto Rico's underground scene because of the state's [...] "fear of losing the ability to manipulate 'taste. Marquesinas were often in public [...] "housing complexes such as Villa Kennedy and Jurutungo". Despite being recorded in housing projects, most of the marquesinas were good quality (which helped increase their popularity among Puerto Rican youth of all social classes). The availability and quality of the cassettes led to reggaeton's popularity, which crossed socioeconomic barriers in the Puerto Rican music scene. The most popular cassettes in the early 1990s were DJ Negro's The Noise I and II and DJ Playero's 37 and 38. Gerardo <b>Cruet</b> (who created the recordings) spread the genre from the marginalized residential areas into other sectors of society, particularly private schools.|$|E

[...] As presented, it shows Richard MacDuff avoiding his boss Gordon Way, the CEO of Wayforward Technologies II, {{by going to the}} Coleridge dinner at his old college St Cedd's. Following the annual reading of [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] and [...] "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" [...] by Coleridge, MacDuff witnesses his former tutor, Professor Urban [...] "Reg" [...] Chronotis, perform an inexplicable magic trick where he makes a <b>cruet</b> disappear and then finds it again by smashing an ancient clay pot that a young girl brought to the dinner, having found it on holiday in Greece. When MacDuff and Prof. Chronotis' adjourn to the professor's lodgings, they find a horse there, which the Professor is alarmed about but unable to explain. MacDuff returns to his London flat and finds himself doing things that are out of character, including climbing a drainpipe to break into the flat belonging to Gordon's sister Susan to erase an embarrassing message he left on her answering machine and later named a suspect in the death of Gordon Way. At that point Dirk Gently, a self-claimed [...] "Holistic Detective" [...] that believes in the [...] "fundamental interconnectedness of all things" [...] and is currently searching for a missing cat, intervenes and sets about solving the mystery, even though MacDuff was not aware that there was one.|$|E
