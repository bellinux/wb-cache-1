5000|$|CamTran {{operates}} bus fare machines {{manufactured by}} GFI. According to CamTran in a Summer 2006 Newsletter called <b>camrecorder,</b> these GFI machines {{were introduced to}} CamTran in March 1992. They take bus tokens, dollar bills, change, and bus passes. These machines cannot give cash change back, they only give back [...] "change cards" [...] in which customers receive a card {{that can only be}} used on CamTran and CamTran+ buses. Customers never get actual cash back from a CamTran bus.|$|E
