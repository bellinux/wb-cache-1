These bees are known as Carniolans, or [...] "Carnies" [...] for short, in English. At present this subspecies is the second most popular among beekeepers (after the Italian bee).|$|E
50|$|This {{led to the}} {{creation}} of more aggressive, high-yield breeds (probably by cross-breeding dark and Buckfast high-yield strains with <b>Carniolan</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees),</b> which, however, were very susceptible to Varroa mite infection and unpleasant to handle and were dropped from use after World War II, but just as in North America, some feral colonies survive.

40|$|In Apis mellifera, {{hygienic}} behavior involves {{recognition and}} removal of sick, damaged or dead brood from capped cells. We investigated whether bees react {{in the same}} way to grouped versus isolated damaged capped brood cells. Three colonies of wild-type Africanized <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> and three colonies of <b>Carniolan</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> were used for this investigation. Capped worker brood cells aged 12 to 14 days old were perforated with the pin-killing method. After making holes in the brood cells, the combs were placed back into the hives; 24 h later the number of cleaned cells was recorded in areas with pin-killed and control brood cells. Four repetitions were made in each colony. Isolated cells were more frequently cleaned than grouped cells, though variance analysis showed no significant difference (P = 0. 1421). Carniolan bees also were somewhat, though not significantly more hygienic than Africanized <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (P = 0. 0840).

50|$|There {{are more}} than 20,000 species of wild bees. Many species are solitary (e.g., mason bees, leafcutter bees (Megachilidae), {{carpenter}} bees and other ground-nesting bees). Many others rear their young in burrows and small colonies (e.g., bumblebees and stingless bees). Some honey bees are wild e.g. the little honeybee (Apis florea), giant honeybee (Apis dorsata) and rock bee (Apis laboriosa). Beekeeping, or apiculture, {{is concerned with the}} practical management of the social species of honey bees, which live in large colonies of up to 100,000 individuals. In Europe and America the species universally managed by beekeepers is the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera). This species has several sub-species or regional varieties, such as the Italian bee (Apis mellifera ligustica), European dark bee (Apis mellifera mellifera), and the <b>Carniolan</b> <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> (Apis mellifera carnica).

40|$|The <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> {{is a major}} insect {{used for}} {{pollination}} of many commercial crops worldwide. Although the use of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> for pollination can disrupt the habitat, the effects on their physiology have never been determined. Recently, <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies have often collapsed when introduced in greenhouses for pollination in Japan. Thus, suppressing colony collapses and maintaining the number of worker bees in the colonies is essential for successful long-term pollination in greenhouses and recycling of <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies. To understand the physiological states of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> used for long-term pollination in greenhouses, we characterized their gene expression profiles by microarray.

Thus, <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies are likely to collapse during pollination in greenhouses when heavily infested with pathogens.

Six fungal strains (A 3, A 4, A 7, A 8, A 9, and A 15) of A. apis were isolated from larvae suffering from chalkbrood disease on Yeast-Glucose-Starch agar (YGPSA) medium.

In vitro and in vivo inhibition assays were carried out to determine the ability of bacterial isolates to inhibit A. apis, the causal agent of chalkbrood disease. The analysis of 16 S rRNA sequences revealed that four bacterial strains (B 2, B 4, B 10, and B 100) belong to Bacillus subtilis species, and two strains (P 1 and P 5) belong to Pseudomonas fluorescence. Significant differences in antagonistic activity of all bacterial strains were observed. B. subtilis isolate B 2 showed the highest antagonistic activity, as measured by the inhibition zone against A. apis, followed by the P 1 strain of P. fluorescence.
