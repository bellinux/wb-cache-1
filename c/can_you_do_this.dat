5000|$|In December 1925, Ray {{was forced}} to file for {{bankruptcy}} after being sued {{by more than a}} dozen creditors for monies owed and back taxes. His production company also declared bankruptcy. Actress Jane Novak later recalled that Ray's wife Clara Grant (whom he married in November 1915) contributed to Ray's egomania and spendthrift ways. The couple lived in a lavish Beverly Hills home equipped with gold doorknobs, several lacquered pianos, black marble bathtubs with gold fixtures and a full sized tree made of semi-precious stones that sat in their bathroom. They employed a full staff of servants and owned a fleet of luxury cars. Grant bought expensive dresses that she refused to wear more than once and traveled in a Rolls Royce with an ermine floor rug. The day before Ray was to file for bankruptcy, the couple held a dinner party with a personal butler for each of their guests at their home that reportedly cost $30,000.

Try to wrap an orange without wrinkling the paper. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this?</b> Why? This same problem sprang up when geographers {{wanted to make a}} map of the Earth’s surface with no length distortions. In the 16 th century, Mercator (a Flemish cartographer whose original name was Gerard Kremer), conceived a projection in which angles are preserved (such kind of projection is called conformal). On this type of map the direction remains true, making it particularly practical for navigation at sea. On Mercator’s projection parallels have increased spacing in proportion to the secant of the latitude. See for example [5] about the Mercator projection and how Kremer developed it. The title of this work refers to the fact that Mercator invented it before the neccesary mathematics was invented. The equations for this projection involve a logarithm (Napier didn’t invent logarithms until 1614). Deriving the equations requir...|$|E

40|$|The {{globalization}} of markets and increased social complexity require a reform of educational systems to develop quality education, able {{to form the}} cosmopolitan and planetary citizen (Morin, 2010). Investing in human capital and training {{is a very interesting}} theme in European environment. The "ET 2020 " shows that education should drive smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of nations. Faced with a steady increase of the complexity of a social reality more and more "liquid" (Bauman, 2002), it is necessary the encounter of scientific and humanistic knowledge, traditionally separated, to find solutions that are consistent with progress, promoting a holistic education. How do you put in the dialogue? And how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in the local reality of the school? To find answers, our research team has carried out a theoretical analysis of argument on the unraveling of the educational phenomena in the concrete teaching practices in Italy, starting with the identification of variables that converge in the teaching-learning process and focusing on disciplinary curriculum separatism. The investigation began with an analysis of the philosophical and pedagogical literature, continuing with the examination of neuroscientific research, to identify the possible educational implications and the possibilities to improve the training offered. Sharing with the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio the noted "Descartes ' error", they identified the effects of Cartesian thought in education-teaching, highlighting how the modern diarchy of mind-body and mind-emotions were reversed in school activities. Our job was to examine: - opportunities for encounter and dialogue between science and philosophy, neuroscientific research offerings (Welsh, 2005; Damasio, 1995; Rizzolatti, 2006); - the separatism between "hard" disciplines, domain of rational logic and science, and "soft" disciplines, domain of corporeality and emotionality in school teaching practices; - prejudice and cultural stereotypes on the concept of "Science" (Popper, 1996); - the educational implications of neuroscience in terms of experiential learning; - the importance of corporeality and emotionality in meaningful learning. The correlation between the data showed the value of active and integrated teaching practices to ensure the holistic formation of developmental topics, and to offer the minds multiple intelligences opportunities for multidimensional learning (Gardner, 2000). In particular, it was pointed out the metacognitive and ludic approach of "serious game", in which the didactic discourse meets semiotics and hermeneutics, chanting the learning stages based on body, investigated in lived triarchy body-mind-emotions (Damasio, 2000; Welsh, 2005) ...|$|E
