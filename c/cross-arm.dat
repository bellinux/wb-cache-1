When he lost that argument, {{he argued that the}} cross should have a {{shortened}} <b>cross-arm</b> and a lengthened shaft, in order to emphasize its verticality amidst the trees of the French countryside. That argument was also unpersuasive.|$|E
25|$|The east-facing <b>cross-arm</b> of {{the church}} {{contains}} the altar, and also contains a half-round apse that is recognisable from outside. The apse contains a mullion which, like the two smaller windows next to the apse, is filled with colourful glass bricks. The red, green, yellow and blue glass bricks provide the only exterior light into the chancel, that is otherwise only lit through the opened doors of the iconostasis, or through it from the inner part {{of the church}}. North of the chancel, at the Northeast side of the building, is a narrow bell-gable with four bells that can be rung from outside using bell ropes.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{match was}} {{the final of the}} tournament for the WWE Women's Championship between Lita and Mickie James. The match was a Lumberjill match, which gained 46% of the vote. The match begun with both Divas {{throwing}} the other outside the ring to try and gain an advantage. Lita dominated the early proceedings, applying a Sleeper Hold until James countered with a <b>Cross-arm</b> Breaker. [...] Lita executed a DDT to win the title.|$|E
40|$|The <b>cross-arming</b> of {{effector}} CTL {{in response}} to cross-presented tumor Ags is predicted to fail {{in the absence of}} CD 40 stimulation. However, questions remain regarding the role of CD 40 signaling and additional CD 4 + T cell-derived signals in this process. To address this, we have analyzed the <b>cross-arming</b> of tumor-specific CTL effectors in vivo in a mouse model of established tumor and tumor regression following CD 40 activation. We found that tumor-specific CTL were constitutively cross-armed in tumor-draining lymph nodes during tumor growth and that systemic CD 40 activation did not alter CTL <b>cross-arming</b> in the tumor-draining lymph nodes. Rather, CD 40 activation induced peripheral dissemination of tumor-specific CTL effectors that required continual CD 40 stimulation to maintain peripheral CTL and tumor regression. These data indicate that CD 40 activation enhances the peripheral survival of constitutively cross-armed CTL and that persistent CD 4 + T cell signals are required for their long-term activity...|$|R
500|$|The {{title is}} a {{reference}} to The Pilgrim's Progress. The episode begins with a cutaway gag featuring Alan Rickman's answering machine. When Madame Claude tells everyone who {{they were in a}} past life, she reveals that Quagmire was Jack the Ripper. Also, when Madame Claude first speaks, Peter says that she sounds like Sebastian the crab from Disney's The Little Mermaid [...] King Stewart III orders to kill the cast of How I Met Your Mother after he is displeased with their performance. Griffin Peterson's act in the talent show is {{a reference to}} the act the Lambda Lambda Lambdas perform at the homecoming in the 1984 film Revenge of the Nerds. As a running gag throughout the episode, Fox promos appear {{on the bottom of the}} screen for made up shows including Shovin' Buddies, Slowly Rotating Black Man, and <b>Cross-Armed</b> Opposites, parodying stereotypical types of Fox mid-show advertising. Griffin Peterson says that he is the happiest guy in the world because he's on his way to get married and there are [...] "290 years separating me from the films of Kevin Smith." [...] A clip is shown of Madonna celebrating her 16th birthday, suggesting she is over 300 years old. During King Stewart's invasion of the settlement the music and lyrics are identical to that of Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles, with Rock Ridge changed to Quahog. A lady says of King Stewart, [...] "I didn't vote for him," [...] alluding to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Harry MacAfee from the film Bye Bye Birdie makes an appearance. Peter's appearance is similar to Kajagoogoo frontman Limahl.|$|R
2500|$|Norton was a forward-pressing fighter/boxer who was {{notable for}} his unusual guard/stance characterised by the cross arm defence. The left arm low across the torso and right hand {{up by the}} right or left ear. But when under heavy {{pressure}} both arms were brought up high across at face level whilst one leant forward. This left the opponent little target in theory. The guard was also used by the legendary Archie Moore. George Foreman later used it very effectively during his famous comeback years. Tim Witherspoon was another practitioner. Joe Frazier even borrowed it for occasions in his third Ali match. The style is named the [...] "cross-armed defense". It tends to look crablike. Norton would bob and weave from a crouch, firing well placed heavy punches. Norton was best when advancing. He'd drag or slide the right foot along from behind. By comparison, most conventional boxers have elbows in at the torso with forearms vertically parallel to each another, the gloves then being both near sides of the face. Most trainers believe the conventional style is a better defense and that the <b>cross-arm</b> style leaves the user open far too often.|$|E
2500|$|The nave and aisles have camber beam {{panelled}} oak roofs dated 1711. The Legh Chapel has a 16th-century panelled roof. In the Legh Chapel is a brass to SirPeter Legh dated 1527. This is {{the only}} known English monumental brass to combine {{the military and the}} sacred. It shows the [...] "Knight and Priest" [...] in clerical vestments worn over armour, with his sword by his side. Also in the chapel are monuments to other members of the Legh family, including one to MrsEllen Legh who died in 1831 by R.J.Wyatt. In the Gerrard Chapel is a damaged font dating from around 1400, and a brass to Peter Gerard who died in 1495. Beneath the floor of this chapel is the family vault but this has not been used since the Reformation. At the east end is a communion table dated 1725. On the north wall is an aumbry. On a window-ledge in the Gerard Chapel is the <b>cross-arm</b> of an Anglo-Saxon preaching cross dating from around 750. The pews, furnishings and glass in the chancel and sanctuary were designed by Pugin. The timber screen between the nave and the tower was erected in 1920 as a First World War memorial. The organ was built around 1838, probably by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool. Since then Rushworth and Dreaper have made various additions. There is a ring of six bells. Five of these were cast from the four existing bells in 1711 by Richard Sanders, and the sixth in 1882 is by John Taylor and Company.|$|E

50|$|Diagnosis {{is based}} on {{physical}} examination and an x-ray. A physical examination can identify point tenderness, pain at the AC joint with <b>cross-arm</b> adduction, and pain relief with an injection of a local anesthetic. The <b>cross-arm</b> adduction will produce pain specifically at the AC joint and will be done by elevating the arm to a 90° angle, flexing the elbow to a 90° angle, and adducting the arm across the chest. The pain in the shoulder is hard to pinpoint of the innervation of the AC joint and the glenohumeral joint. An injury to the AC joint will result in pain over the AC joint, in the anterolateral neck and in {{the region in the}} anterolateral deltoid.|$|E
50|$|The Subskimmer is a Diver Propulsion Vehicle {{which is}} a form of RIB (inflatable boat) with an {{outboard}} petrol (gasoline) engine. It is equipped to inflate and deflate itself as it runs. When submerged it seals its engine and runs with battery-electric thrusters, which are on a rotatable <b>cross-arm,</b> and is deflated. Thus it transforms between a fast light surface boat and a submerged diver propulsion vehicle. The central box contains the pump to deflate and inflate the tubes, and miscellaneous kit. The batteries, being heavy, are in a thick tube along its keel. Its outboard motor has a long snorkel so the Subskimmer can run on motor just submerged to try to avoid detection. Its thrusters are on a rotatable <b>cross-arm</b> which contains navigation kit.|$|E

Normally, only the pantograph on car 951-2 was used.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cross-arm</b> {{pantograph}} {{was fitted}} {{to each of}} the three locomotives to allow them to work from overhead lines erected in some yards, (notably Hither Green marshalling yard, South East London) where it was deemed too dangerous to have 3rd rail, with staff constantly at track level, particularly in war-time blackout. The pantograph was recessed into a cut-out on the roof when not in use, to keep within the loading gauge.|$|E
50|$|The {{straight}} jacket suplex or package German suplex has {{the attacker}} trapping the opponent's arms while performing a German suplex. Variants {{such as the}} <b>cross-arm</b> suplex or X-Plex see the opponent's arms crossed across their chest and held by the attacker. The wrestler then uses the crossed arms as leverage to aid in lifting the opponent up while falling backwards to throw the opponent as in a German suplex.|$|E
5000|$|Claude's brother, Ignace Chappe (1760-1829) was {{a member}} of the Legislative Assembly during the French Revolution. With his help, the Assembly {{supported}} a proposal to build a relay line from Paris to Lille (fifteen stations, about 120 miles), to carry dispatches from the war.The Chappe brothers determined by experiment that the angles of a rod were easier to see than the presence or absence of panels. Their final design had two arms connected by a <b>cross-arm.</b> Each arm had seven positions, and the <b>cross-arm</b> had four more permitting a 196-combination code. The arms were from three to thirty feet long, black, and counterweighted, moved by only two handles. Lamps mounted on the arms proved unsatisfactory for night use. The relay towers were placed from 12 to 25 km (10 to 20 miles) apart. Each tower had a telescope pointing both up and down the relay line. Chappe first called his invention the [...] "tachygraph", which means fast writer. A friend suggested a name meaning a far writer, telegraph.|$|E
50|$|Each aerial for the Beam Wireless Station {{stretched}} to {{nearly half a}} mile (0.78 km) long, and consisted of a row of five 277 ft high lattice masts, erected in a line at 640 ft intervals and {{at right angles to}} the overseas receiving station. These were topped by <b>cross-arm</b> measuring 10 feet high by 90 feet wide (3m x 27.4m), from which the vertical wires of the aerial were hung, forming a 'curtain antenna'.|$|E
50|$|Suspension {{insulator}} - For voltages {{greater than}} 33 kV, it is a usual practice to use suspension type insulators, {{consisting of a}} number of glass or porcelain discs connected in series by metal links {{in the form of a}} string. The conductor is suspended at the bottom end of this string while the top end is secured to the <b>cross-arm</b> of the tower. The number of disc units used depends on the voltage.|$|E
