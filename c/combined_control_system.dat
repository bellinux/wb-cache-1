The combination of cyclically recurring processes with stochastically generated events significantly intervenes into the control, while also affecting {{the choice of the}} right sample period, as it is necessary to process all the generated interruptions within the cycle. The current monograph focuses on the analysis of <b>combined</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> and determination of the stochastic event element of the sample period.

Then at any fixed point (x, g) of the <b>combined</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> we have ν _[n]^* = F_[n](g) for all n.

Thus, for sufficiently large ν_[n]^*, the constraint ν_[n]^* = F_[n](g) can be solved on the domain, and any solution must {{be close to the}} hypersurface g = 1.

30|$|Here we {{show that}} some of our results on {{homogeneous}} recurrent excitatory networks generalize to heterogeneous networks in which each neuron has its own dual control system, target rates, and level of intrinsic noise. In particular, {{we show that}} if the neurons in such a network have target firing rates that set {{at least one of the}} characteristic variances sufficiently high, then when the <b>combined</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> reaches a fixed point, the network behaves like an integrator on short time scales. This condition is robust to variation in individual neuronal parameters, including target firing rates. Since the combined control systems of a heterogeneous network with N neurons is 2 N-dimensional rather than two-dimensional, we do not attempt to prove the stability of fixed points here. However, we have verified the stability of the behavior described below in simulations (data not shown, code available online).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation {{of an active}} structural acoustic control strategy for coupled aircraft-style bays. While structural coupling can destabilize or limit the performance of some model-based decentralized control systems, fullycoupled centralized control strategies are impractical for typical aircraft containing several hundred bays. An alternative is to use classical rate feedback with matched, collocated transducer pairs to achieve active damping. Unfortunately, due to the conservative nature of this strategy, stability is guaranteed {{at the expense of}} achievable noise reduction. Therefore, this paper describes the development of a combined control strategy using robust active damping in addition to a high-authority controller based on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) theory. The <b>combined</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is evaluated on a tensioned, two-bay model using piezoceramic actuators and ideal point velocity sensors.

40|$|Safety and {{productivity}} of the initial flight test phase of a new vehicle have been enhanced by developing the ability to measure the stability margins of the <b>combined</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and vehicle in flight. One shortcoming of performing this analysis is the long duration of the excitation signal required to provide results over a wide frequency range. For flight regimes such as high angle of attack or hypersonic flight, the ability to maintain flight condition for this time duration is difficult. Significantly reducing the required duration of the excitation input is possible by tailoring the input to excite only the frequency range where the lowest stability margin is expected. For a multiple-input/multiple-output system, the inputs can be simultaneously applied to the control effectors by creating each excitation input with {{a unique set of}} frequency components.

40|$|Power {{electronics}} based {{power systems}} are being increasingly {{used in the}} transportation systems such as land, sea/undersea, air, and space vehicles due to their advantages in efficiency, performance, flexibility, and power density. In order to have superior performance, the rectifier-converter systems need to be rigorously regulated. The DC power supply is an important aspect for the automotive industries because of its use {{for a wide range}} of loads and is mandatory for charging the battery. However, DC power supplies experience many problems such as poor power factor, high input current harmonics distortion and un-controlled DC voltage. In this paper, an integrated control scheme is proposed for regulated DC power supply with high power quality for automotive applications.

An improved input power factor correction with a low input current total harmonics distortion has been used to model the power system using a <b>combined</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The proposed control scheme achieves nearly unity power factor with a minimum input current total harmonics distortion and able to supply regulated DC voltage with high power quality.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of this paper. An {{intelligent}} control system is presented {{that uses a}} combination of feedforward and feedback for cutting force control in end milling. Design/methodology/approach: The network is trained by the feedback output that is minimized during training and most control action for disturbance rejection is finally performed by the rapid feedforward action of the network. Findings: The feedback controller corrects for errors caused by external disturbances. The feedforward controller is an artificial neural network (ANN) which approximates the inverse dynamics of the machining process. Research limitations/implications: The dynamic architecture of the neural controller is chosen, and the methods for delay time treatment and training network on line are investigated. The controller was designed and tested using a simulator model of the milling process that includes feed drive model and cutting dynamics simulator. Practical implications: An application to cutting force control in end-milling is used to prove {{the effectiveness of the}} control scheme and the experiments shows that the dynamic performance of the cutting force control is greatly improved by this neural <b>combined</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Originality/value: New combined feedforward and feedback control system of end milling system is developed and tested by many experiments.
