500|$|Bond sneaks into Goldfinger's {{plant and}} discovers Goldfinger smuggles gold by melting {{it down and}} {{incorporating}} it into the bodywork of his car, which he takes with him whenever he travels. Bond also overhears Goldfinger talking to Chinese agent Mr. Ling about [...] "Operation Grand Slam." [...] Leaving, Bond encounters Tilly {{as she tries to}} kill Goldfinger again, but trips an alarm in the process; Oddjob kills Tilly with his hat. Captured, Bond is tied to a <b>cutting</b> <b>table</b> underneath an industrial laser, which begins to slice a sheet of gold in half, with Bond lying over it. Bond lies to Goldfinger that MI6 knows about Grand Slam, causing Goldfinger to spare Bond's life to mislead MI6 into believing Bond has things in hand.|$|E

5000|$|Large {{sheets of}} glass are usually {{cut with a}} {{computer-assisted}} CNC semi-automatic glass <b>cutting</b> <b>table.</b> These sheets are then broken out by hand into the individual sheets of glass (also known as [...] "lites" [...] in the glass industry).|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{distribution}} of Central Nervous System (CNS) tissue contamination on the joints of beef during cutting of 88 carcass halves in a private slaughterhouse was investigated. In conclusion, {{the first time in}} Turkey, the level of contamination of spinal cord tissue as CNS tissue on the joints of beef during cutting the carcasses into the parts was shown. Additionally, high level of contamination risk via the knives used for cutting carcasses, the <b>cutting</b> <b>tables,</b> the moving <b>cutting</b> <b>tables</b> and the aprons was detected...|$|R
5000|$|Hot wire foam <b>cutting</b> <b>tables</b> {{can use a}} {{vertical}} or a horizontal wire, usually with a horizontal table used as a guide or for securing the foam work piece.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} even more development. Traditionally the machines' <b>cutting</b> <b>tables</b> were horizontal, but now {{vertical}} CNC plasma cutting machines are available, providing for a smaller footprint, increased flexibility, optimum safety and faster operation.|$|R
50|$|A {{specialized}} use of CNC Plasma Cutters {{has been}} in the HVAC industry. Software processes information on ductwork and creates flat patterns to be cut on the <b>cutting</b> <b>table</b> by the plasma torch. This technology has enormously increased productivity within the industry since its introduction in the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|A static <b>cutting</b> <b>table</b> {{is a type}} {{of cutting}} plotter used a large flat vacuum table. It is used for cutting non-rigid and porous {{material}} such as textiles, foam, or leather, that may be too difficult or impossible to cut with roll-fed plotters. Static cutters can also cut much thicker and heavier materials than a typical roll-fed or sheet-fed plotter is capable of handling.|$|E
50|$|In {{most parts}} of the U.S., this cut is known as outside or bottom round, as traditionally, a {{hindquarter}} is laid on the <b>cutting</b> <b>table</b> with the outside down or to the bottom, as opposed to the inside being on top. In the U.S. it is also known as a rump roast, which means something different in countries using the British beef cut scheme.|$|E
50|$|The Wardrobe/Costume {{department}} had its {{home in the}} studios central basement area just below the long glazed front window. There was a large work room with another work room containing <b>cutting</b> <b>tables</b> and sewing machines. There was also an office with several dressing rooms either side. There were also several large extras dressing rooms in the basement.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant was}} quickly rebuilt, {{and a year}} later moved Bergans {{into one of the most}} modern textile factories, {{implementing}} electronic control of the chains, and semiautomated and computer-controlled <b>cutting</b> <b>tables.</b> However, it was not possible to achieve profitable operations, and the factory in Nord-Odal, with its 100 employees, was closed in 1990. Production was moved to Asia, and the reconstruction started again.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Ergen founded Arcola Theatre in the London Borough of Hackney with Leyla Nazli. They {{converted}} an old shirt factory {{while teaching}} in Dalston, East London, into a fringe venue. Ergen acquired £5,000 of start-up money and sent invitations {{to all the}} actors and directors he knew {{to join him in}} a paint party. They even recycled <b>cutting</b> <b>tables</b> into benches for the audience.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{planned to have}} its premiere at the International Film Festival in Berlin. As {{it was not yet}} {{completed}} the selection committee of the film festival saw only a raw cut of the film. This led to speculation in the tabloid press of a race against the time and that Wicki had collapsed at the <b>cutting</b> <b>table</b> due to the time pressure. Ultimately the film was finished only seven hours before it premiered at the festival.|$|E
50|$|Used {{extensively}} in bookbinding, a board shear is a large, hand-operated machine for cutting board or paper. Like scissors, a board shear uses two blades to apply shear stress exceeding the paper's shear strength {{in order to}} cut. The stationary blade forms {{the edge of the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>table,</b> with the moving blade mounted on a cutting arm. Originally known as a table gauge shear because its gauge allowed the cutting of consistently-sized materials, the board shear resembles a larger version of the paper cutters commonly found in offices.|$|E
5000|$|The hangar for {{production}} {{and operation of}} the CL160 and engineering team facilities were built on the former Soviet Air Force base at Brand-Briesen Airfield, acquired to enable development and operations. The hangar (360 m long, 220 m wide and 106 m high), a technological marvel in itself, is a freestanding steel-dome [...] "barrel-bowl" [...] construction large enough to fit the Eiffel Tower on its side. The hangar was also equipped with a 180 m <b>cutting</b> <b>table</b> to manufacture the airship's envelope. After the company bankrupted, a tropical theme park was opened there.|$|E
40|$|Global SLS-resolution is a {{well-known}} procedural semantics for top-down computation of queries under the well-founded model. It inherits from SLDNF-resolution the linearity property of derivations, which makes it easy and efficient to implement using a simple stack-based memory structure. However, like SLDNF-resolution it suffers from the problem of infinite loops and redundant computations. To resolve this problem, {{in this paper we}} develop a new procedural semantics, called SLTNF-resolution, by enhancing Global SLS-resolution with loop <b>cutting</b> and <b>tabling</b> mechanisms. SLTNFresolution is sound and complete w. r. t. the well-founded semantics for logic programs with the bounded-term-size property, and is superior to existing linear tabling procedural semantics such as SLT-resolution.

50|$|Some {{plasma cutter}} {{manufacturers}} build CNC <b>cutting</b> <b>tables,</b> {{and some have}} the cutter built into the table. CNC tables allow a computer to control the torch head producing clean sharp cuts. Modern CNC plasma equipment is capable of multi-axis cutting of thick material, allowing opportunities for complex welding seams that are not possible otherwise. For thinner material, plasma cutting is being progressively replaced by laser cutting, due mainly to the laser cutter's superior hole-cutting abilities.|$|R

5000|$|In 1996, the CargoLifter {{company was}} founded in Wiesbaden, who {{intended}} to build airships. While the former north main runway was being demolished, CargoLifter began building the then-largest freebearing hall {{in the world in}} the centre of the site, where they intended to set up production of airships. The hall (360 m long, 220 m wide and 106 m high), was a freestanding steel-dome [...] "barrel-bowl" [...] construction, large enough to fit the Eiffel Tower on its side. The hangar was also equipped with a 180 m <b>cutting</b> <b>table</b> to manufacture the airship's envelope. Construction of the hall was complete in November 2000, at a cost of €78M.|$|E

5000|$|Woody walks about {{town and}} realizes {{that all of}} the {{restaurants}} are closed. He finds one store with a sign in its window that reads: [...] "We stuff birds." [...] He assumes that it is a restaurant when it is actually a taxidermist's shop. He approaches the counter to place his order. From his coat pocket, the taxidermist, an anthropomorphic cat (voice by Hans Conried), removes an ad from the Museum of Natural History announcing a $100,000 reward for a stuffed king-size woodpecker. He secretly places knock-out drops in the food he prepares for Woody. The food puts Woody to sleep, but he recovers on the <b>cutting</b> <b>table.</b> He escapes the taxidermist by climbing onto an elevator; the taxidermist falls down the elevator shaft to the basement, where he abandons his $100 grand ambition.|$|E
5000|$|A {{laser cutting}} bridge {{system in the}} world of {{textiles}} is an industrial machine for cutting and engraving of textile materials (i.e. fabrics). It is formed by a galvanometric laser head and [...] laser source that runs along an horizontal beam (the bridge) supported by two lateral columns and sometimes by central columns. This system is placed over one or more embroidery machines, more frequently multi-head rather than single-head machines, <b>cutting</b> <b>tables,</b> roller devices, to cut out and/or engrave embroidered fabrics.|$|R

50|$|If {{machining}} depth cuts, the {{radial arm saw}} allows one to see the progress. With the (wood) clamped and using the arm (not hand feeding, which is also possible), the cuts are better machined and require no jig setup; the advantage is not widely needed however. Cutting full depth is less convenient, as the saw lowers into the <b>table,</b> <b>cutting</b> the <b>table</b> (often a wood table for that reason).|$|R
5000|$|Mike Dunne and Hugh Hopper then tweaked the raw sounds {{with all}} manner of analog and improvised effects. A big sheet of steel hanging in the studio acting as an {{unconventional}} echo plate. They experimented with tape loops, a trademark of Hopper's music since the early days. A couple of months after the initial sessions they did some further work at a farm in Hertfordshire where the mobile was now installed. Mike Travis laid down a new drumm track on [...] "Spanish Knee" [...] and they polished off the final mixes, all the time trying not to breathe too deeply - the studio was next to the pig shed of the farm. There were sticky flypapers hanging up everywhere, and once a fly landed on the multitrack tape as Travis pushed the Play button. The fly got squashed in the roll of recording tape. That's probably the cause of an analog blip somewhere on the record. Speaking of blips, when the record was on the <b>cutting</b> <b>table</b> to make the master disc, somehow the cutting stylus jumped {{in the middle of}} Elton Dean's solo on [...] "Lonely Sea". Nobody noticed it before several thousand vinyl LPs had been pressed and issued, so all of the released LPs feature a weird leap in the music. In the remastered Cuneiform CD version we get to hear Elton's full solo for the first time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In path {{tracking}} design, {{the dynamic of}} actuators {{must be taken into}} account in order to reduce overshoots appearing for small displacements. A new approach to {{path tracking}} using fractional differentiation is proposed with its application on a XY <b>cutting</b> <b>table.</b> It permits the generation of optimal movement reference-input leading to a minimum path completion time, taking into account both maximum velocity, acceleration and torque and the bandwidth of the closed-loop system. Fractional differentiation is used here through a Davidson-Cole filter. A methodology aiming at improving the accuracy especially on checkpoints is presented. The reference-input obtained is compared with spline function. Both are applied to an XY <b>cutting</b> <b>table</b> model and actuator outputs compared...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A new {{approach}} to path tracking using non integer order differentiation applied to non-time-varying plants is proposed with its application on a XY <b>cutting</b> <b>table.</b> It permits the generation of optimal movement reference-input leading to a minimum path completion time, taking into account both the physical constraints of the actuators (maximum velocity, acceleration and torque) and the bandwidth of the closed-loop system. This reference-input results from the step response of a non integer order filter whose frequency response is that of an implicit generalized derivative filter. This {{new approach}} is complementary to CRONE control which synthesizes a robust control law, and {{which is based on}} real or complex non-integer order differentiation. The reference-input obtained is compared with spline function. Both are applied to an XY <b>cutting</b> <b>table</b> and actuator outputs compared. Copyright © 2000 IFA...|$|E
50|$|Burn <b>tables</b> are CNC <b>cutting</b> torches, usually {{natural gas}} powered. Plasma and laser <b>cutting</b> <b>tables,</b> and Water jet cutters, are also common. Plate steel is loaded {{on a table}} and the parts are cut out as programmed. The support table is made of a grid of bars that can be replaced. Some very {{expensive}} burn tables also include CNC punch capability, with a carousel of different punches and taps. Fabrication of structural steel by plasma and laser cutting introduces robots to move the cutting head in three dimensions around the material to be cut.|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of free-living protozoa in five meat-cutting plants was determined. Light microscopy after enrichment culturing was combined with sequencing of PCR-amplified, {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) -separated 18 S rRNA gene fragments, {{which was used}} as a fast screening method. The general results of the survey showed that a protozoan community of amoebae, ciliates, and flagellates was present in all of the plants. Protozoa were detected mainly in floor drains, in standing water on the floor, on soiled bars of <b>cutting</b> <b>tables,</b> on plastic pallets, and in out-of-use hot water knife sanitizers, but they were also detected on surfaces which come into direct contact with meat, such as conveyer belts, working surfaces of <b>cutting</b> <b>tables,</b> and needles of a meat tenderizer. After 7 days of incubation at refrigerator temperature, protozoa were detected in about one-half of the enrichment cultures. Based on microscopic observations, 61 morphospecies were found, and Bodo saltans, Bodo spp., Epistylis spp., Glaucoma scintillans, Petalomonas spp., Prodiscophrya collini, and Vannella sp. were the most frequently encountered identified organisms. Sequencing of DGGE bands resulted in identification of a total of 49 phylotypes, including representatives of the Amoebozoa, Chromalveolata, Excavata, Opisthokonta, and Rhizaria. Sequences of small heterotrophic flagellates were affiliated mainly with the Alveolata (Apicomplexa), Stramenopiles (Chrysophyceae), and Rhizaria (Cercozoa). This survey showed that there is high protozoan species richness in meat-cutting plants and that the species included species related to known hosts of food-borne pathogens...|$|R
50|$|Gunther von Fritsch, {{the editor}} of the film, arrived and joined the film crew on October 26, 1934. He was enchanted with the town (he landed in Alvarado during a lengthy fiesta with dancing in the plaza and {{fireworks}} every night). His work began immediately, but there were problems. Equipment on hand was primitive as there were no light boxes, <b>cutting</b> <b>tables</b> or bins to organize the film trims, and much had to be improvised. Electricity was unreliable, and when available, it was fluctuating, causing the moviola and projector to run at erratic speeds, a circumstance which hampered timing. Gunther got as much done as he could in Alvarado, then went to Mexico City on November 2 to record the musical score.|$|R

As a child she befriended dressmakers and used the scraps from their <b>cutting</b> <b>tables</b> to fashion clothing for her dolls, which she displayed in a window facing the street. She was unable to persuade her parents to let her pursue a career in art; instead, she {{was sent to the}} University of Lemberg to study philosophy. In addition to her coursework there she worked for a milliner, and saved enough money to run away to Vienna. On the day of her arrival she arranged to study at the Kunstgewerbe Schule (now the University of Applied Arts Vienna) with Josef Hoffmann. To save money for tuition, she slept on a park bench for her first six weeks in the Austrian capital.|$|R
