25|$|The {{island is}} {{a focal point}} for seabirds of various species. Eight species or {{subspecies}} of seabirds nest on it. The most numerous is the red-footed booby, which nests in colonies, using trees on many parts of the shore terrace. The widespread brown booby nests on the ground {{near the edge of the}} seacliff and inland cliffs. Abbott's booby (listed as endangered) nests on tall emergent trees of the western, northern and southern plateau rainforest, the only remaining nesting habitat for this bird in the world. Another endangered and endemic bird, the <b>Christmas</b> <b>frigatebird,</b> has nesting areas on the northeastern shore terraces. The more widespread great frigatebirds nest in semi-deciduous trees on the shore terrace, with the greatest concentrations being in the North West and South Point areas. The common noddy and two species of bosun or tropicbirds, with their brilliant gold or silver plumage and distinctive streamer tail feathers, also nest on the island.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Christmas</b> <b>frigatebird</b> {{was once}} {{considered}} {{to belong to}} the species Fregata aquila but in 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews proposed that the <b>Christmas</b> <b>frigatebird</b> should be considered as a separate species with the binomial name Fregata andrewsi in honour of the English paleontogist Charles Andrews. Of the four other species within the Fregata genus, genetic analysis has shown that the <b>Christmas</b> <b>frigatebird</b> is most closely related to the great frigatebird.|$|E

50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an IBA because it supports visiting, though non-breeding, critically endangered <b>Christmas</b> Island <b>frigatebirds,</b> as well as populations of pink-headed imperial pigeons, streak-breasted honeyeaters, Timor friarbirds, plain gerygones, fawn-breasted whistlers, olive-brown orioles, blue-cheeked flowerpeckers, flame-breasted sunbirds and Timor sparrows.|$|R
50|$|Christmas Island National Park is a {{national}} park occupying most of Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean southwest of Indonesia. The park is home to many species of animal and plant life, including the eponymous red crab, whose annual migration sees around 100 million crabs move to the sea to spawn. Christmas Island is the only nesting place for the endangered Abbott's booby and critically endangered <b>Christmas</b> Island <b>frigatebird,</b> and {{the wide range of}} other endemic species makes the island of significant interest to the scientific community.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Christmas</b> <b>frigatebird</b> {{measures}} 89 - 100 cm in length, has a wingspan of 205 - 230 cm {{and weighs}} around 1550 g. The adult male {{of this species}} is easily identified, since it is all black except for a white belly patch. Other plumages resemble those of the smaller lesser frigatebird, but have whiter bellies and longer white underwing spurs.|$|E
50|$|The {{lesser frigatebird}} was first {{described}} as Atagen ariel by the English zoologist George Gray in 1845 from a specimen collected on Raine Island, Queensland, Australia. The lesser frigatebird {{is one of}} five closely related species belonging to the genus Fregata. The other four are: the great frigatebird (Fregata minor), the <b>Christmas</b> <b>frigatebird</b> (Frigata andrewsi), the magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) and the Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila). The genus is {{the only member of the}} Fregatidae family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Christmas</b> <b>frigatebird</b> {{is a large}} lightly built seabird with brownish-black plumage, long narrow {{wings and}} a deeply forked tail. It has a {{wingspan}} of around 2.15 m. The male has an egg shaped white patch on its belly and a striking red gular sac which it inflates to attract a mate. The female is slightly larger than the male and has a white breast and belly. They feed on fish taken in flight from the ocean's surface (mostly flying fish), and sometimes indulge in kleptoparasitism, harassing other birds {{to force them to}} regurgitate their food. The species is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5000|$|When German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin first {{described}} the great frigatebird in 1789, {{he thought it}} was a small pelican, and so named it Pelecanus minor. Due to the rules of taxonomy, its species name of minor was retained despite being placed in a separate genus by the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1914. This has led to the discrepancy between minor, Latin for [...] "smaller" [...] in contrast with its common name. It is one of five closely related species of frigatebird that make up their own genus (Fregata) and family (Fregatidae). Its closest relative within the group is the <b>Christmas</b> Island <b>frigatebird</b> (F. andrewsi).|$|R
500|$|The type {{species of}} the genus is the [...] Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila). For many years, the {{consensus}} was to recognise only two species of frigatebird, with larger birds as F. aquila and smaller as F. ariel. In 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews delineated five species, which remain valid. Analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA indicated that the five species had diverged from a common ancestor only recentlyâ€”as little as 1.5 million years ago. There are two species pairs, the great and <b>Christmas</b> Island <b>frigatebirds,</b> and the magnificent and Ascension frigatebirds, while the fifth species, the lesser frigatebird, is an early offshoot of the common ancestor of the other four species. Three sub{{species of the}} lesser and five subspecies of the great frigatebird are recognised.|$|R
5|$|Two of {{the five}} species are {{considered}} at risk. In 2003, {{a survey of the}} four colonies of the critically endangered <b>Christmas</b> Island <b>frigatebirds</b> counted 1200 breeding pairs. As frigatebirds normally breed every other year, the total adult population was estimated to lie between 1800 and 3600 pairs. Larger numbers formerly bred on the island, but the clearance of breeding habitat during World War II and dust pollution from phosphate mining have contributed to the decrease. The population of the vulnerable Ascension frigatebird has been estimated at around 12,500 individuals. The birds formerly bred on Ascension Island itself, but the colonies were exterminated by feral cats introduced in 1815. The birds continued to breed on a rocky outcrop just off the shore of the island. A program conducted between 2002 and 2004 eradicated the feral cats and a few birds have returned to nest on the island.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn seabirds, equal bi-parental care is the rule, {{as it is}} {{considered}} crucial for raising chicks successfully because seabirds forage in an environment with unpredictable and highly variable food supply. Frigatebirds forage in poor tropical waters, yet males reduce and even stop parental care soon after chick brooding, leaving the female to provision the chick alone for an extended fledging period. Using bird-borne tracking devices, male and female <b>Christmas</b> Island <b>Frigatebirds</b> (Fregata andrewsi) were investigated during the brooding, late chick rearing and post-fledging period to examine whether sexes exhibit foraging strategies that {{may be linked to}} differential breeding investments. During brooding, males and females showed similar foraging behaviour under average marine productivity of oceanic waters close to the colony, but males shifted to more distant and more productive habitats when conditions deteriorated to continue with reduced chick provisioning. During the late chick rearing period, females progressively increased their foraging range to the more distant but productive marine areas that only males had visited during brooding. Birds spent the non-breeding period roosting in highly productive waters of the Sunda Shelf. The sex-specific utilisation of three different foraging habitats with different primary productivity (oceanic, coastal, and shelf areas) allowed for temporal and spatial segregation in the exploitation of favourable habitats which seems to enable each sex to optimise its foraging profitability. In addition, post-fledging foraging movements of females suggest a biennial breeding cycle, while limited information on males suggests the possibility of an annual breeding cycle...|$|R
40|$|Whereas some {{bird species}} are heavily {{affected}} by blood parasites in the wild, others reportedly are not. Seabirds, in particular, are often free from blood parasites, {{even in the}} presence of potential vectors. By means of polymerase chain reaction, we amplified a DNA fragment from the cytochrome b gene to detect parasites of the genera Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon, and Haemoproteus in 14 seabird species, ranging from Antarctica to the tropical Indian Ocean. We did not detect parasites in 11 of these species, including one Antarctic, four subantarctic, two temperate, and four tropical species. On the other hand, two subantarctic species, thin-billed prions Pachyptila belcheri and dolphin gulls Larus scoresbii, were found infected. One of 28 thin-billed prions had a Plasmodium infection whose DNA sequence was identical to lineage P 22 of Plasmodium relictum, and one of 20 dolphin gulls was infected with a Haemoproteus lineage which appears phylogenetically clustered with parasites species isolated from passeriform birds such as Haemoproteus lanii, Haemoproteus magnus, Haemoproteus fringillae, Haemoproteus sylvae, Haemoproteus payevskyi, and Haemoproteus belopolskyi. In addition, we found a high parasite prevalence in a single tropical species, the <b>Christmas</b> Island <b>frigatebird</b> Fregata andrewsi, where 56 % of sampled adults were infected with Haemoproteus. The latter formed a monophyletic group that includes a Haemoproteus line from Eastern Asian black-tailed gulls Larus crassirostris. Our results are in agreement with those showing that (a) seabirds are poor in hemosporidians and (b) latitude could be a determining factor to predict the presence of hemosporidians in birds. However, further studies should explore the relative importance of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on parasite prevalence, in particular using phylogenetically controlled comparative analyses, systematic sampling and screening of vectors, and within-species comparisons...|$|R
