40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{three issues}} affecting {{the attempt to}} teach digital literary texts in the classroom by observing their implications for pedagogical practice {{in the preparation of}} future teachers. The integrity of the digital object and its reception, which I <b>call</b> <b>portability,</b> is discussed through the modes of engagement with the text and its unlikely or difficult reproducibility as an aesthetic experience in the classroom. In the case of evanescence, both the access to the aesthetic experience and the study as criticism become problematic due to obstacles like geo-referencing, copyright issues, object transience, and obsolescence of software and hardware. Finally, the guidelines for the reading experience not only organize but also impose a priori limits to the perception of the literary object...|$|E
40|$|My final {{bachelor}} {{work which}} is <b>called</b> "The <b>portability</b> of competences acquired through volunteering to management practice" is mainly engaged in management competences, influence of volunteering to their enrich and portability from volunteering to management practice. The theoretical part of work explains the basic conceps of the topic, shows a various perspectives on issue. Main part of practical part {{of work is}} the questionnaire, which is supposted {{to find out if}} management competences are really enrich by volunteering and volunteers are able to portable them to management practice...|$|R
40|$|Parallel {{object-oriented}} software for training large-scale linear and nonlinear Support Vector Machines on multiprocessor systems. It implements a problem decomposition approach for the dual quadratic programming (QP) formulation, where the solver for the inner QP problems {{is based on}} parallel iterative gradient-projection methods. Both the data and the computations are distributed among the available processors. An effective caching strategy is used to save computational time in kernel evaluations. The MPI <b>calls</b> ensure <b>portability</b> {{to a wide range}} of strictly-coupled distributed-memory systems. The software can efficiently handle medium-to-large inner QP subproblems and allows to face very-large and even huge data set in reasonable time...|$|R

Currently all solutions implemented have been constructed on top of PVM, using only standard PVM and UNIX system <b>calls</b> to aid <b>portability</b> and maintainability and as suc...|$|R
25|$|The rise of {{personal}} computers as household appliances {{has made it}} convenient for consumers to convert media (which {{may or may not}} be copyrighted) originally in a physical, analog or broadcast form into a universal, digital form (this process is <b>called</b> ripping) for <b>portability</b> or viewing later. This, combined with the Internet and popular file-sharing tools, has made unauthorized distribution of copies of copyrighted digital media (also called digital piracy) much easier.|$|R
25|$|Before an {{aircraft}} could enter the fuel economy test it {{was required to}} pass a demonstration of <b>portability,</b> <b>called</b> the transport test. Each aircraft had to prove it was capable of going through a standard field gate and then be wheeled along a country road for a mile using not more than two men. Because this limited {{the width of the}} aircraft to 7ft 6in then the designs all featured either detachable or folding wings.|$|R
50|$|Gnulib, also <b>called</b> the GNU <b>portability</b> library, is a {{collection}} of software subroutines which are designed to be usable on many operating systems. The goal of the project is to make it easy for free software authors to make their software run on many operating systems. Since source is designed to be copied from gnulib, it is not a library per-se, as much as {{a collection}} of portable idioms to be used in other projects.|$|R

50|$|In New Zealand, {{local and}} mobile number {{portability}} (LMNP) began on April 1, 2007. The rules governing LMNP {{originate in the}} Number Portability Determination. Ports are authorised, scheduled, and coordinated via a centralised number <b>portability</b> system <b>called</b> IPMS (Industry <b>Portability</b> Management System). All networks update their own routing and confirm this to IPMS. There are now 26 carriers and service providers that participate in LMNP in New Zealand, over a million numbers have been ported.|$|R

40|$|Fingerprints {{in blood}} {{indicate}} a threshold of violence has been surpassed in crime scenarios - making the crime resolution more urgent. There exist multiple processes that enhance a blood fingerprint {{in its original}} position, or in-situ, with reliability so that an image can be obtained. However, blood fingerprint evidence that cannot directly be transported to a laboratory for further analysis, due to the size or mobility of the substrate, <b>calls</b> for <b>portability.</b> In 2010 Zar-Pro Fluorescent Blood Lifting Strips were patented by Jessica Zarate as a "fluorogenic method for lifting, enhancing, and preserving blood impression evidence". The lifted prints are also inherently fluorescent to further increase enhancement and contrast of the print. There are currently no studies comparing Zar-Pro results {{with the results of}} other laboratory enhancement methods. This experiment compared Zar-Pro to other non-portable and frequently used alternatives - blood peak absorption and Hungarian Red enhancement to determine if Zar-Pro gives better blood fingerprint enhancement results than other non-portable alternatives - ALS visualization and Hungarian Red enhancement. In this study, Zar-Pro methods produced more reliable and reproducible results over the Hungarian Red and blood peak absorption methods on white and black ceramic tile. From this study, one can also conclude that ALS peak absorption is better suited for the location of blood prints on a light-colored item of evidence, rather than an enhancement method of blood prints...|$|R
