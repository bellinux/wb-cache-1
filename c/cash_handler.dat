50|$|The {{personal}} banking {{business of}} Girobank {{became part of}} the Alliance & Leicester Building Society. The Business Banking arm continued trading under the name of Girobank as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Alliance and Leicester, being repositioning as a <b>cash</b> <b>handler</b> and credit card processor for retailers and other banks. In 2003 the Girobank brand was dropped, with the business renamed as Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank following further consolidation in the Alliance & Leicester Group. In May 2010 Alliance & Leicester was acquired by Grupo Santander, and the name Alliance & Leicester was replaced by Santander UK.|$|E
40|$|In 2005, some 25, 000 {{counterfeit}} {{euro banknotes}} {{were identified in}} the Netherlands, representing a fictitious amount of two million euro. In collaboration with the TNO research institute, DNB has investigated how accurately cash handlers and consumers with no <b>cash</b> <b>handler</b> experience can distinguish counterfeit euro notes from genuine ones. Also examined was the question whether the use of DNB's educational CD-ROM entitled �Genuine or Counterfeit?' led to improved performance and whether such aids as UV lights or IR cameras helped to identify notes correctly. The {{results show that the}} public is quite capable of recognising a counterfeit note: without practice, members of the general public correctly identified 88 % of counterfeit notes they were given to examine, while after training they scored as high as 96 %. Remarkable scores were recorded by cash handlers operating without aids: even without training they showed themselves expert at sifting the wheat from the chaff (98 % correctly identified counterfeit notes). Recognising genuine euro notes proved slightly more challenging, but here technical aids provided useful services. Practice {{with the help of the}} CD-ROM turned out to benefit untrained consumers in particular. They soon managed to bring their performance up to the level of experienced cash handlers. ��Â banknotes; counterfeits; discrete choice model; experiment; training...|$|E
50|$|Slovenia was {{the first}} country to join the eurozone out of the 10 new member states that joined the European Union in 2004. On 1 December 2006, {{professional}} <b>cash</b> <b>handlers</b> {{were the first to}} get hands on the Slovenian euro coins as special starter packs were available for <b>cash</b> <b>handlers.</b> On 15 December 2006 the general public could buy euro starter kits; 450,000 of these kits were produced; each kit contained 44 coins, amounting to €12.52 (3,000 tolars).|$|R
50|$|Due to {{differences}} in the milling and annealing process, the Canadian variety of the 1981 20-cent coin is distinctive to attentive collectors and even <b>cash</b> <b>handlers.</b> The top and bottom edges of the milling is rounded over, not squared like the Australian and London varieties, and despite being in circulation for well over 25 years, even when well worn, the fields remain shiny, and not dulled like those produced at other mints. These qualities are also observed in Canadian coinage of similar ages.|$|R
50|$|The Bank of Canada {{commissioned}} a research survey of <b>cash</b> <b>handlers</b> {{and the general}} public to determine the effectiveness of the security features on the Birds of Canada and Canadian Journey series banknotes. The research found that participants correctly identified 84% of counterfeit banknotes based only on fluorescence features, 83% based only on microprinting and fine line features, and 80% based only on portrait features. Genuine banknotes were correctly identified 88%, 97%, and 89% of the time, respectively. The optical security device was the most effective security feature, used to correctly identify 98% of counterfeit banknotes and 95% of genuine banknotes.|$|R
50|$|The {{general public}} {{correctly}} identified 72% of counterfeit banknotes, 80% of genuine $10 banknotes and 89% of genuine $20 banknotes. Commercial <b>cash</b> <b>handlers,</b> such as retail cashiers, correctly identified 86% of counterfeit banknotes, 89% of genuine $10 banknotes and 94% of genuine $20 banknotes. Bank tellers correctly identified 89% of counterfeit banknotes, 91% of genuine $10 banknotes and 95% of genuine $20 banknotes. All groups performed better with high-quality notes (that is, {{those that were}} clean and undamaged) with the exception that the general public misidentified many high-quality genuine $10 banknotes as counterfeit, which was attributed to the public's suspicion of new banknotes.|$|R
