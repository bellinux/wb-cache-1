40|$|Today, {{expert systems}} {{are widely used}} in business, science, engineering, agriculture, manufacturing, medicine, video games, and {{virtually}} every other field. In fact, {{it is difficult to}} think of a field in which expert systems are not used today (Lozano-Perez T., Kaelbling L., 2003). In the field of <b>consultation,</b> expert <b>system</b> has been applied very early, for example, MYCIN (Buchanan, B. G. and Shortliffe, E.

Although there are many commercial products of expert system shells that can be applied to build <b>consultation</b> <b>systems,</b> they have shown some drawbacks: 	Accepting only one determined language for knowledge representation. Therefore, once one decided to use an expert system shell, {{it is not easy to}} make a change of it later because of having to edit the whole knowledge base in the new language again. 	Being so passive in comparison with human being. They can only do exactly what the knowledge engineer specified in the knowledge base.

Being able to find out by itself which question should be asked next without any interference from human being. The “Matching” can recognize which information is required for the reasoning, then it creates new rules for them and adds the rules into its knowledge base. 	Being able to find out by itself an optimal reasoning strategy (forward chaining, backward chaining or a mixture of both). It does not need any setting from human being for the reasoning strategy. The “Matching” determines it from the beginning and at run-time. 	Being able to find out syntax errors in rules. This is the evidence that the inference engine understands its rules and understands what it is doing as well. 	Being able to learn from experience to improve its performance Beside concepts and implementation of the adaptive inference engine, a mathematical evaluation on the effectiveness of the new matching algorithm is also presented...|$|R

40|$|Background: Very few {{patients}} are presented to ethics committees, and individual ethics consultations are {{a response to}} this situation. At {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU) in Clínica Alemana, Santiago Chile, an ethics <b>consultation</b> <b>system</b> was organized coordinated with the ethics committee. Aim: To report an evaluation of this ethics <b>consultation</b> <b>system.</b> Material and Methods: Analysis of the frst 50 cases analyzed in the <b>consultation</b> <b>system.</b> Analysis of the responses of intensive care physicians to a questionnaire about the main ethical problems that they face in their work. Results: The <b>consultation</b> <b>system</b> is mainly required by the ICU staff, and reports to the ethics committee. Fifty four percent of patients subjected to consultation were aged over 80 years. The main diagnoses were neurological, oncological or cardiopulmonary problems. The ethical problems identifed were treatment limitation (62 %), proportionality or futility (42 %), need of a peaceful death (36 %), lack of anticipated decisions (28 %), disagreement between physicians and patient’s family (24 %), undefined subrogation (14 %), and abuse of public resources (14 %). Twenty six of 31 ICU physicians answered the questionnaire, using a 1 (min) to 7 (max.) scale. They found that consultation is helpful for decision making (6. 3), useful for improving ethical perception (6. 0), supportive for staff (6. 5), good for patients (6. 3), supportive for families (6. 7), and timely performed (5. 2). Conclusions: As a complement for the ethics committee’s work, consultation is a valid alternative for ethics counselling and a support for physicians and patient’s families.

40|$|During {{interactions}} with human consultants, people {{are used to}} providing partial and/or inaccurate information, and still be understood and assisted. We attempt to emulate this capability of human consultants; in computer <b>consultation</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, we present a mechanism for handling uncertainty in plan recognition during task-oriented consultations. The uncertainty arises while choosing an appropriate interpretation of a user?s statements among many possible interpretations. Our mechanism handles this uncertainty by using probability theory to assess the probabilities of the interpretations, and complements this assessment by taking into account the information content of the interpretations. The information content of an interpretation is a measure of how well defined an interpretation is in terms of the actions to be performed {{on the basis of the}} interpretation. This measure is used to guide the inference process towards interpretations with a higher information content. The information content for an interpretation depends on the specificity and the strength of the inferences in it, where the strength of an inference depends on the reliability of the information on which the inference is based. Our mechanism has been developed for use in task-oriented <b>consultation</b> <b>systems.</b> The domain that we have chosen for exploration is that of a travel agency.

We con ducted key informant interviews to identify drivers, facilitators, barriers and evaluation metrics of diverse eCR systems to inform widespread implementation of this model of specialty care delivery. Methods: Interviews were conducted with leaders of 16 diverse health care delivery organizations between January 2013 and April 2014. A limited snowball sampling approach was used for recruitment. Content analysis was used to examine key informant interview transcripts. Results: Electronic referral systems, which provide referral management and triage by specialists, were developed to enhance tracking and operational efficiency. Electronic <b>consultation</b> <b>systems,</b> which encourage bi-directional communication between primary care and specialist providers facilitating longitudinal virtual co-management, were developed to improve access to specialty expertise. Integrated eCR systems leverage both functionalities to enhance the delivery of coordinated, specialty care at the population level.
