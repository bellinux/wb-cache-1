Digital {{signatures}} provide authentication and non-repudiation in {{a public}} way {{in the sense that}} anyone can verify the validity of a digital signature using the <b>corresponding</b> <b>public</b> key. In this paper, we consider the issues of (1) signature privacy and (2) the <b>corresponding</b> <b>public</b> provability of signature. We propose a new digital signature variant, secret signature, which provides authentication and non-repudiation to the designated receiver only. If required, the correctness of the secret signature can be proven to the public either by the signer or the receiver. We conclude with a discussion to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed cryptographic primitive (e. g., achieving signature privacy in an efficient manner) ...|$|R
