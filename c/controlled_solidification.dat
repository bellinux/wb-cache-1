Solidification fronts interact with objects with different outcomes, from the total rejection to the complete engulfment of objects. Being able to understand and <b>control</b> the <b>solidification</b> dynamics and microstructure is of primary importance in these domains. However, because of the typical space and time-scale, it is still fundamentally difficult to track in situ the development of solidification microstructures where objects interact with a rapidly moving solid/liquid interface.

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} fibrous {{eutectic}} growth in succinonitrile–camphor reveal that {{models of the}} stable range of interfibrous spacings must incorporate the dynamic effects and the instability of the growth front of the fibrous phase, which determines the fineness and regularity of the microstructures. An analytical mathematical model for fibrous eutectic growth has been developed and compared with the experimental results. The selected wavelength scales obey ? = vd 0 lsf(ls/lt), where d 0, ls, lt are the capillary, diffusion, and thermal lengths, respectively. While only at a relatively high growth rate or steep temperature gradient, the scaling law ? 2 V = constant is fulfilled. It is found that the selected band of interfibrous spacings is very narrow.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{foundation for}} the study of local non-equilibrium solute diffusion under rapid solidifica-tion conditions is proposed. The model takes into account the relaxation to local equilibrium of the solute flux and incorporates two diffusion speeds, VDb, the bulk liquid diffusion speed, and VD~, the interface diffusive speed, as the most important parameters governing the solute concentration in the liquid phase and solute partitioning. The analysis of the model predicts complete solute trapping and the transition to a purely thermally <b>controlled</b> <b>solidification,</b> which occur abruptly when the interface velocity V equals the bulk liquid diffusion speed VDb. The abrupt change in the solidification mechan-ism is described by the velocity dependent effective diffusion coefficient D * = D(l- V 2 /V&) and the generalized partition coefficient K*. If V> VDb, then D * = 0 and K * = 1. This implies an uudis-turbed diffusion field in the liquid (diffusionless solidification) and complete solute trapping at V> VDb. The interface diffusion speed v~i governs solute redistribution at a relatively low interface velocity v- v ~ i < VDb. The influence of the local non-equilibrium solute transport on the tempera-ture field and interface stability under rapid solidification conditions is also discussed. 1...|$|E
