5|$|In March 2011 an {{assessment}} of the Greyfriars site began to identify where the monastery had stood, and which land might be available for excavation. A desk-based assessment was <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the archaeological viability of the site, followed by a survey in August 2011 using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The GPR results were inconclusive; no clear building remains could be identified owing to a layer of disturbed ground and demolition debris just below the surface. The survey was useful in finding modern utilities crossing the site, such as pipes and cables.|$|E
5|$|Note 2. The fencing {{programme}} included six individual {{events and}} four team events, though the team events were {{a different set}} than were held in 2004. The International Fencing Federation's rules call for events not held in the previous Games to receive automatic selection and {{for at least one}} team event in each weapon to be held. Voting is <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the fourth event. In 2004, the three men's team events and the women's épée were held. Thus, in 2008, the women's foil and sabre events and men's épée were automatically selected. Men's sabre was chosen over foil by a 45–20 vote.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} called for three {{commuter}} rail modernizations. The New Haven Railroad commuter service would get 144 EMUs, as well as signal improvements, high-level platforms, and renovated cars. The Penn Central Railroad would get 130 EMUs, high-level platforms, and electrified trackage north to the Brewster station. The Erie Lackawanna Railroad in New York State would get new equipment, and a study would be <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether the ELRR could go to Pennsylvania Station. All of these improvements were to extend into Phase II of the project.|$|E
