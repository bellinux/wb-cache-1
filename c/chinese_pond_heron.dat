50|$|The <b>Chinese</b> <b>pond</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardeola bacchus) is an East Asian {{freshwater}} bird of the heron family, (Ardeidae).|$|E
50|$|Various animals also {{live in the}} park, {{including}} nationally protected species, such as the <b>Chinese</b> <b>pond</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardeola bacchus).|$|E
50|$|Its food {{consists}} of insects, fish, and crustaceans. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>pond</b> <b>heron</b> often nests in mixed-species heronries. It lays {{a clutch of}} 3-6 blue-green eggs.|$|E
50|$|The Javan <b>pond</b> <b>heron</b> is {{typically}} 45 cm long with white wings, a yellow bill {{with a black}} tip, yellow eyes and legs. Its overall colour is orange, slaty and white during mating season, and brown and flecked with white out of the mating season. The non-breeding plumage {{is similar to that}} of the <b>Chinese</b> and Indian <b>pond</b> <b>herons</b> and is virtually indistinguishable in the field. It breeds from June to September. It is migratory.|$|R
40|$|In the 2002 {{breeding}} {{season in the}} Deep Bay area, a total of 289 nests of five ardeid species in seven egretries were recorded. Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta 135 nests) and <b>Chinese</b> <b>Pond</b> <b>Herons</b> (Ardeola bacchus 111 nests) were the two dominant species in the Deep Bay area, which comprised 50 % and 42 % of local populations of that species, respectively. The Deep Bay nesting population accounted for {{one third of the}} total number of nests in Hong Kong in 2002. The total nesting population in Hong Kong in 2002 was 972 nests of five species in 19 egretries. No new egretry was discovered in the Deep Bay area but two new egretries at To Kau Wan on Lantau, and Ha Che at Shek Kong were first reported, while the one at Shui Mei was abandoned. Compared with the 2001 figures, a 2 % decrease and 17 % increase in the ardeid nesting population was noted in the Deep Bay area and Hong Kong, respectively. Such a population fluctuation cannot be explained as no prey and wetland quality monitoring can be referenced. ...|$|R
40|$|In the 2003 {{breeding}} {{season in the}} Deep Bay area, a total of 209 nests of four ardeid species in seven egretries were recorded. <b>Chinese</b> <b>Pond</b> <b>Herons</b> (Ardeola bacchus 119 nests) was the dominant species in the Deep Bay area, which comprised 46 % of local populations of that species, respectively. The Deep Bay nesting population accounted for 28. 4 % {{of the total number}} of nests in Hong Kong in 2003. The total nest number in Hong Kong in 2003 was 732 nests of five species in 20 egretries. Ha Mei San Tsuen and Tuen Mun were first reported, while the two at To Kau Wan and Shing Uk Tsuen were abandoned. Compared with the 2002 figures, a 24 % decrease in the nesting population was noted in both the Deep Bay area and Hong Kong. Decline in number of nests at the Mai Po Village egretry may be related to road maintenance works while the abandonment of the Shing Uk Tsuen egretry should relate to an unauthorized site formation nearby. For the nest number decrease in Deep Bay or all over HK, an explanation is difficult to make as no prey and wetland quality monitoring can be referenced...|$|R

Samples of pond sediment, fish, {{and shrimp}} were {{collected}} from the Ramsar site at Mai Po marshes, Hong Kong (south China), and samples of pond sediment, fish, and shrimp, as well as eggs of water birds (<b>Chinese</b> <b>Pond</b> <b>Herons</b> (Ardeola bacchus) and Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta)), {{were collected from}} two smaller wetland sites at Jiangsu Province (mid-China), between 2004 and 2007. Accumulation levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the biota were used to calculate biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) and bioaccumulation factor (BAF). For fish and shrimp, BSAFs of OCPs (3. 8 - 56) were greater than those of PAHs (0. 12 - 6. 3). BSAFs and BAFs of 11 - 79 and 4 - 34, respectively, were registered for OCPs in eggs of the birds and were greater than those for PAHs (0. 11 - 1. 5 and 0. 02 - 1. 3, respectively). Assuming that fish were the main prey of the birds, greater bioaccumulation of OCPs was detected for both bird species (BAFs = 4. 5 - 34), while accumulation of PAHs was only detected in Little Egret (BAF = 1. 3). A significant linear relationship (p < 0. 01) was observed between concentrations of OCPs in bird eggs and in the prey fish. The present study provides a new possibility of using OCP levels detected in prey fish to predict the extent of OCPs contamination in eggs of waterbirds including the endangered species, as a noninvasive method...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is one of}} six {{species of}} birds known as [...] "pond herons" [...] (genus Ardeola).

50|$|On January 2008, a Philippine {{record of}} 17,000 birds (in the 24-hour count) visited the 32,000-hectare Candaba Swamp, {{sanctuary}} for migratory birds. Michael Lu, {{president of the}} Wild Bird Club of the Philippines (WBCP), stated that 80 species of migratory birds were sighted at the 100-hectare fishpond of Mayor Jerry Pelayo in Barangay Doña Simang and in Barangay Paralaya. The rare birds spotted were: the Shrenck’s bittern, great bittern, gadwall, coot, Philippine mallard or ducks, and Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia). Robert S. Kennedy’s book A Guide to the Birds of the Philippines lists endemic and migratory birds which visit the Philippines. Pelayo organized the Ibon-Ebon Festival (“birds and eggs”) on February 1-2. The WBCP recorded three rare species in Candaba swamp: the purple swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio), <b>Chinese</b> <b>pond</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardeola bacchus) and the black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax).|$|E
50|$|Unlike other {{sympatric}} wading birds, the white-shouldered ibis’s foraging {{strategy is}} notably terrestrial and this bird {{has not been}} observed foraging in water. It forages in mud at seasonal pools preferentially covered with short vegetation less than 25 cm high, {{on the ground in}} dry dipterocarp forest preferentially with bare underlying substrate, in fallow rice fields, and more occasionally in river channels with large extents of mud and sand. However, it forages almost exclusively at seasonal pools during the breeding season, probably due to high densities of refuge-seeking prey residing between the frequent cracks in the dry mud and hence high availability of food to feed to chicks. With its downcurved bill which has high penetrating power and easy manoeuvrability, the white-shouldered ibis is well adapted to probing into the cracks potentially harbouring these concealed prey. This feeding adaptation in bill morphology gives this ibis an advantage over other sympatric waders with straight bills, and is therefore commonly followed and kleptoparasitised by species such as cattle egrets Numenius arquata and <b>Chinese</b> <b>pond</b> <b>heron</b> Ardeola bacchus. Individuals of this ibis species feed singly, in pairs, or in family groups (flocks of up to 14 being reported); and flock size is notably greater in the wet (non-breeding) season than the dry (non-breeding) season.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} a {{collection}} brought together by J. G. Kooiman in 1946. After the defeat of Japan, some Dutch biologists, who during the war had worked as prisoners of war on the notorious Burma railroad, biologically explored the Khwae Noi valley. Kooiman joined this party as an ornithologist. The collection might have been larger, but shooting was limited by the exceedingly high prices of cartridges at that time. The lack of field glasses also was an inconvenience. The collection is of interest {{as it is the}} first from this part of Siam. Afterwards the collection was sent to the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, where it was worked out by Junge, who is responsible for the taxonomical part of the paper.
