5|$|Vision is {{the main}} sense of {{orientation}} in humans, and the primary function of camouflage is to deceive the human eye. Camouflage works through <b>concealment</b> (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle. In modern warfare, some forms of camouflage, for example face paints, also offer <b>concealment</b> from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide <b>concealment</b> from radar.|$|E

5|$|During the Peninsular War, Portugal fielded light {{infantry}} units {{known as}} Caçadores, who wore brown-jackets which helped conceal them. The brown color {{was considered to}} be more adequate for a <b>concealment</b> in the landscape of most of Portuguese regions, in general more arid than the greener landscapes of Central and Northern Europe.|$|E

5|$|Military {{camouflage}} {{is part of}} the art {{of military}} deception. The main objective of military camouflage is to deceive the enemy as to the presence, position and intentions of military formations. Camouflage techniques include <b>concealment,</b> disguise, and dummies, applied to troops, vehicles, and positions.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into three parts: <b>concealment,</b> advertisement, and disguise. Part 1, <b>concealment,</b> covers the methods of camouflage, which are colour resemblance, countershading, {{disruptive}} coloration, and shadow elimination. The effectiveness of these, arguments for and against them, and experimental evidence, are described. Part 2, advertisement, covers the methods of becoming conspicuous, especially for warning displays in aposematic animals. Examples are chosen from mammals, insects, reptiles and marine animals, and empirical evidence from feeding experiments with toads is presented. Part 3, disguise, covers methods of mimicry that provide camouflage, as when animals resemble leaves or twigs, and markings and displays that help to deflect attack or to deceive predators with deimatic displays. Both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry are treated as adaptive resemblance, much like camouflage, while a chapter is devoted to the mimicry and behaviour of the cuckoo. The concluding chapter admits that the book's force is cumulative, consisting of many small steps of reasoning, and being a wartime book, compares animal to military camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Brood War {{introduces}} seven new units. Each race {{is given}} access to a unique ground unit: the Zerg can create a defensive unit that can attack from the <b>concealment</b> of its burrow, while the Terrans can train combat medics. The Protoss are able to produce dark templar units, a powerful cloaked melee unit only given to the player in special missions of StarCraft. Protoss players can merge two of these units to create a special spellcaster unit. Each race is also {{given access to}} a dedicated air-to-air attack unit.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is the <b>concealment</b> {{of animals}} or objects of {{military}} interest by {{any combination of}} methods that helps them to remain unnoticed. This includes the use of high-contrast disruptive patterns as used on military uniforms, but anything that delays recognition {{can be used as}} camouflage. Camouflage involves deception, whether by looking like the background or by resembling something else, which may be plainly visible to observers. This article lists methods used by animals and the military to escape notice.|$|E
5|$|During the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), Britain was {{the first}} nation to employ the use of {{herbicides}} and defoliants to destroy bushes, trees, and vegetation to deprive insurgents of <b>concealment</b> and targeting food crops {{as part of a}} starvation campaign in the early 1950s. A detailed account of how the British experimented with the spraying of herbicides was written by two scientists, E.K. Woodford of Agricultural Research Council's Unit of Experimental Agronomy and H.G.H. Kearns of the University of Bristol.|$|E

5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was shocked}} to learn of the high {{attrition}} rate due to well-trained German snipers. It was common for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day. The German snipers could not be located, leaving them free to continue shooting from their place of <b>concealment.</b> He was also dismayed by the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E
5|$|Ships were {{sometimes}} camouflaged in classical times. Mediterranean pirate ships {{were sometimes}} painted blue-gray for <b>concealment.</b> Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout ships were painted bluish-green when gathering intelligence {{along the coast}} of Britain during the Gallic Wars. Ships were sometimes painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while both sides in the American Civil War camouflaged their ships, whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance.|$|E

The PIAT was often also used in combat to knock out enemy positions located in houses and bunkers. It was possible to use the PIAT as a crude mortar by placing the shoulder pad of the weapon on the ground and supporting it.|$|E

5|$|Vehicle {{camouflage}} techniques {{begin with}} paint, which offers at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised {{materials such as}} blankets and vegetation, and erecting nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb near infrared and radar waves. Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints also reflect infrared to help provide <b>concealment</b> from night vision devices.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by June Swann and published in 1996, reveals that the most common place of <b>concealment</b> is the chimney, fireplace or hearth (26.2 per cent), followed by under the floor or above the ceiling (22.9 per cent), and almost as many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around doors and windows, under the stairs, and among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, town houses, manor houses, hospitals, workhouses, factories, public houses, and two Oxford colleges, St John's and Queen's. They have even been found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a Benedictine monastery in Germany and a Baptist church in Cheshire, England.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for <b>concealment</b> to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and {{blend in with the}} ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.|$|E
40|$|The {{tradition}} of placing objects and symbols within, under, on, and around buildings for supernatural protection and good luck, {{as an act}} of formal or informal consecration, or as an element of other magico-religious or mundane ritual, has been documented throughout the world. This thesis examines the material culture of magic and folk ritual in the eastern United States, focusing on objects deliberately concealed within and around standing structures. While a wide range of objects and symbols are considered, in-depth analysis focuses on three artifact types: witch bottles, concealed footwear, and concealed cats. This thesis examines the European origins of ritual <b>concealments,</b> their transmission to North America, and their continuation into the modern era. It also explores how culturally derived cognitive frameworks, including cosmology, religion, ideology, and worldview, as well as the concepts of family and household, may have influenced or encouraged the use of ritual <b>concealments</b> among certain groups.
