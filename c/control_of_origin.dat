40|$|The {{development}} of molecular techniques for genome studies {{has led to}} qualitative progress {{in the selection of}} domestic animals by enabling the use of genetic markers, in addition to phenotypic selection parameters in choosing an animal. Genetic montoring has a wide application in contemporary swine production. Namely, genetic control is in the basis of all procedures pertaining to the selection of parent couples. Genetic monitoring is thus used in the genetic characterization of breeds, lines (evaluation of genetic drift and calculation of genetic distance), identification of transgenic animals (gene introduction), identification and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of an animal. An especially important quality of genetic monitoring is the possibility to use genetic markers in the prenatal test of an animal. The project to map swine genomes has already resulted in the identification of several genes which are significant for resistance to causes of certain diseases (F 18 + E. coli resistent), stress, as well as genes significant for economically important characteristics (RN), which are used as commercial tests in genetic monitoring of swine...|$|E
40|$|Replication {{initiation}} in eukaryotes is {{subdivided into}} two phases—origin licensing and origin firing. These phases have opposite requirements for cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation {{and are therefore}} restricted to different cell cycle phases: origin licensing occurs {{in the absence of}} CDK activity (G 1 phase) and results in the formation of inactive precursors of the replicative DNA helicase at origins of replication. Origin firing occurs upon CDK activation in S phase and results in the activation of the replicative helicase. Central to the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> firing is a three-partite protein complex, which was first identified in budding yeast, but is apparently conserved among eukaryotes, and consists of Sld 3, Dpb 11, and Sld 2 (SDS complex). Both Sld 3 and Sld 2 bind to Dpb 11 in a CDK-phosphorylation-dependent manner and together form the minimal set of CDK substrates required for origin firing. The SDS complex facilitates helicase activation by promoting the association of accessory helicase subunits (Cdc 45 and GINS complex) to form the CMG helicase. Importantly, the SDS complex-mediated CMG formation is a central element to various aspects of replication control, such as the temporal replication program and the regulation of origin firing by the checkpoint...|$|E
40|$|This work {{shows the}} results {{obtained}} by the application of suitable techniques for the acquisition and processing of spectral absorbance data of several vegetable species, allowing its identification –assignment of each spectral signature to one specific plant- which in turn allows the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of products (foodstuffs or not) and their characteristics. Spectral measurements of absorbance were performed on samples of two sugarcane varieties and four citrus types (orange, lemon, tangerine and grapefruit) taken periodically from a controlled crop, using a spectrophotometer FOSS-NIR 6500 {{in the range of}} 400 - 2500 nm by 2 nm. The measured samples were about 240 in the case of sugarcane and 160 in the case of citrus. A Principal Component Analysis was applied to the data by means of STATA 9 software and the results were interpreted in that PCA context. This procedure allowed us not only to clearly identify which variety of sugarcane corresponds to each spectral absorbance function, but also to determine which wavelength or wavebands have significant relevance for that identification. Similarly, this technique allows us to identify and classify the spectral functions coming from different types of citrus. The main conclusion is that the proposed technique is capable to precisely identifying the species each sample comes from; besides, this technique would allow us to determine the nutritional or health condition of them at the moment of the analysis, as could be seen from the obtained results.

40|$|The {{faithful}} {{duplication of}} the genome is a fundamental requirement for cellular propagation. To ensure successful transmission of genetic material to progeny, the preparation for, initiation, and completion of DNA replication are closely coordinated with cell growth. Central to this coordination is the regulated assembly and activation of the pre-Replicative Complex (pre-RC) at specific sites of future initiation, or origins of replication. In cycling cells, pre-RC formation can only occur in G 1 when cyclin-dependent kinase activity is low, whereas activation of assembles pre-RCs can only occur as cells exit G 1 and enter S-phase. The focus of my research has been investigating the parameters that regulate the selection of potential origins and their subsequent activation. My initial insights into the coordination between licensing and cell cycle progression came through the examination of origin usage during the first cell cycle as cells return to growth from quiescence. Surprisingly, I found that yeast retain a subset of pre-RCs at origins in G 0. Although these origins are sufficient to duplicate the genome, additional pre-RCs are normally assembled as cells exit G 0 and use of these additional licensed origins increases viability. Finally, this additional licensing is monitored by a checkpoint that {{is dependent on the}} Rad 53 checkpoint kinase, but is distinct from other cellular surveillance mechanisms that Rad 53 is involved in. I have gained further understanding of the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> usage through a genetic approach that identified novel factors that enhance the replication of weak origins. One factor that I investigated in more detail, acts by redistributing pre-RC formation amongst origins of replication. This perturbation of origin licensing appears to particularly affect replication when cells re-enter the cell cycle from quiescence, by perturbing the re-formation of pre-RCs. by Milan A. de Vries.
