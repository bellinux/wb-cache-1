The ‘audio-lingual’ teaching practices {{used in the present study}} are based on principles explicated by Asher and Horwitz; listening featured heavily, closely followed by reading and speaking practice. The vocabulary items taught were deemed relevant for all learners, regardless of age, and, according to Pfeffer, they are among the most commonly used nouns in everyday German language.|$|E

2500|$|Music has a {{place in}} {{education}} in Turkey, and {{is a part of}} most or all school systems in the country. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation {{in the form of a}} large school band or social clubs and communities for Turkish classical or folk music, known as cemiyets.

Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs Mehter marches at school festivals. [...] However, <b>class</b> <b>time</b> given to music in schools is restricted, and a large proportion of Turkish children and adults seem to have limited musical ability, e.g. they are unable to join a melody singing at the same pitch.|$|E
2500|$|Responses to {{the article}} pointed {{to the need to}} simplify Russian {{spelling}} due to the use of Russian as the language of international communication in the Soviet Union and an increased study of Russian in the Eastern Bloc {{as well as in the}} West. That instruction for non-native speakers of Russian was one of the central concerns of further reform is indicated in the resistance to Efimov's proposal to drop the terminal [...] "ь" [...] (soft sign) from feminine nouns, as it helps learners identify gender category. Additionally, Efimov claimed that a disproportionate amount of primary school <b>class</b> <b>time</b> was devoted to orthography, rather than phonetics and morphology. Efimov asserted that the existing orthography was essentially unchanged since Grot's codification, and that only by bringing orthography closer to phonetic realization, and eliminating exceptions and variants, could appropriate attention be paid to stylistics and the [...] "development of speech culture". The state's focus on proper instruction in Russian, as the national language of ethnic Russians, as the state language, and as the language of international communication continues to the present day.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the primary}} school level, {{students}} spend all <b>class</b> <b>time</b> with their peers, but receive extra material to challenge them. Enrichment {{may be as}} simple as a modified assignment provided by the regular classroom teacher, or it might include formal programs such as Odyssey of the Mind, Destination Imagination or academic competitions such as Brain Bowl, Future Problem Solving, Science Olympiad, National History Day, science fairs, or spelling bees. Programmes of enrichment activities may also be organised outside the school day (e.g. the ASCEND project in secondary science education [...] ). This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned. Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted students to do more work instead of the same amount at an advanced level. On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses like English, Spanish, Latin, Philosophy, Science, etc., or to engage in extra curricular activities. [...] Some perceive there to be a necessary choice between enrichment and acceleration, as if the two were mutually exclusive alternatives. [...] However, other researchers see the two as complements to each other.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{findings}} emerge when {{observed and}} self-report procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini’s [...] "irrational" [...] and [...] "postponement" [...] criteria. They {{also sought to}} measure this behavior objectively. During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised <b>class</b> <b>time</b> could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified {{with the number of}} practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = −0.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = −0.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = −0.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, {{may not be the most}} appropriate measure to use in all cases. It was also found that procrastination itself may not have contributed significantly to poorer grades. Steel et al. noted that those students who completed all of the practice exercises [...] "tended to perform well on the final exam no matter how much they delayed." ...|$|E

60|$|To-day, again, {{they have}} Professor Butcher, and I hear {{he has a}} prodigious deal of Greek; and they have Professor Chrystal, who is a man filled with the mathematics. And doubtless these are set-offs. But they cannot {{change the fact that}} Professor Blackie has retired, and that Professor Kelland is dead. No man's {{education}} is complete or truly liberal who knew not Kelland. There were unutterable lessons in the mere sight of that frail old clerical gentleman, lively as a boy, kind like a fairy godfather, and keeping perfect order in his class by the spell of that very kindness. I have heard him drift into reminiscences in <b>class</b> <b>time,</b> though not for long, and give us glimpses of old-world life in out-of-the-way English parishes when he was young; thus playing the same part as Lindsay--the part of the surviving memory, signalling out of the dark backward and abysm of time the images of perished things. But it was a part that scarce became him; he somehow lacked the means: for all his silver hair and worn face, he was not truly old; and he had too much of the unrest and petulant fire of youth, and too much invincible innocence of mind, to play the veteran well. The time to measure him best, to taste (in the old phrase) his gracious nature, was when he received his class at home. What a pretty simplicity would he then show, trying to amuse us like children with toys; and what an engaging nervousness of manner, as fearing that his efforts might not succeed! Truly, he made us all feel like children, and like children embarrassed, {{but at the same time}} filled with sympathy for the conscientious, troubled elder-boy who was working so hard to entertain us. A theorist has held the view that there is no feature in man so tell-tale as his spectacles; that the mouth may be compressed and the brow smoothed artificially, but the sheen of the barnacles is diagnostic. And truly it must have been thus with Kelland; for as I still fancy I behold him frisking actively about the platform, pointer in hand, that which I seem to see most clearly is the way his glasses glittered with affection. I never knew but one other man who had (if you will permit the phrase) so kind a spectacle, and that was Dr. Appleton.[5] But the light in his case was tempered and passive; in Kelland's it danced, and changed, and flashed vivaciously among the students, like a perpetual challenge to goodwill.|$|E
