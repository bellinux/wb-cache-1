40|$|Abstract — Hou et al have {{introduced}} a framework to serve clients over wireless channels {{when there are}} hard deadline constraints along with a minimum delivery ratio for each client’s flow. Policies based on “debt, ” called maximum debt first policies (MDF) were introduced, and shown to be throughput optimal. By “throughput optimality ” it is meant that if there exists a policy that fulfils a set of clients with a given vector of delivery ratios and a vector of <b>channel</b> <b>reliabilities,</b> then the MDF policy will also fulfill them. The debt of a user {{is the difference between}} the number of packets that should have been delivered so as to meet the delivery ratio and the number of packets that have been delivered for that client. The maximum debt first (MDF) prioritizes the clients in decreasing order of debts at the beginning of every period. Note that a throughput optimal policy only guarantees that lim infT→ ∞ 1 T ∑T t= 1 1 {client n’s packet is delivered in frame t} ≥ qi, where the right hand side is the required delivery ratio for client i. Thus, it only guarantees that the debts of each user are o(T), and can be otherwise arbitrarily large. This raises the interesting question about what is the growth rate of the debts under the MDF policy. We show the optimality of MDF policy in the case when the <b>channel</b> <b>reliabilities</b> of all users are same, and obtain performance bounds for the general case.

40|$|Many {{emerging}} {{applications of}} networks require delay guarantees for packet deliveries. It is particularly challenging {{to provide services}} for these applications over wireless channels, since wireless transmissions are usually unreliable. In this dissertation, we provide a theory that formulates and addresses the problem of serving flows with delay guarantees over unreliable wireless channels. The core of this theory is an analytical model that jointly considers several practical aspects of flows with delay guarantees: traffic patterns, per-packet delay bounds, throughput requirements, and <b>channel</b> <b>reliabilities.</b> The model can also address fading channels and the usage of rate adaptation. Based on this model, we obtain solutions for three important mechanisms: admission control, packet scheduling, and utility maximization. In addition, we address the scenario of broadcasting flows with delay constraints and incorporate various network coding mechanisms. We also extend models used in the real-time system literature and discuss the scheduling problem for a multimedia server...|$|R

40|$|The {{reliability}} function of memoryless channels with noiseless feedback and variable-length coding {{has been found}} to be a linear function of the average rate in the classic work of Burnashev. In this work we consider unifilar channels with noiseless feedback and study upper bounds for the <b>channel</b> <b>reliability</b> function with variable length codes. In unifilar channels the channel state is known to the transmitter but is unknown to the receiver. We generalize Burnashev's analysis and derive a similar expression which is linear in average rate and depends on the channel capacity, as well as an additional parameter which relates to a sequential binary hypothesis testing problem over this channel. This parameter is evaluated by setting up an appropriate Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, an upper bound for this parameter is derived using a simplified MDP. Numerical evaluation of the parameter for several binary input/state/output unifilar channels hints at the optimal transmission strategies. Such strategies are studied in a companion paper to provide lower (achievable) bounds on the <b>channel</b> <b>reliability</b> function...|$|E
40|$|The {{correction}} impulse method (CIM) is {{very effective}} to achieve low error rates in turbo decoding. It {{was applied for}} transmission over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels, where the correction impulse value must be a real number greater than the minimum distance of the turbo code. The original version of CIM {{can not be used}} for channels modeled as Middleton additive white Class-A impulsive noise (MAWCAIN), because of nonlinearity of <b>channel</b> <b>reliability.</b> Thus, in this paper we propose two ways to modify the method such that it improves the system performances in the case of aforementioned channels. In the first one, the value of the correction impulse is chosen to maximize the <b>channel</b> <b>reliability.</b> It depends on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the error rates are significantly improved compared to those obtained by using the correction impulse value applied for AWGN channels. The second version is based on the least squares method and performs an approximation of the correction impulse. The approximated value depends on the SNR and the parameter A of the MAWCAIN model.
