He also nearly won Dover but ended up being passed by Tony Stewart with three laps remaining. In the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway, Montoya was in second place behind eventual race winner Martin Truex, Jr., but ran out of fuel on the final lap and dropped 32 positions, finishing 34th.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} {{sets the}} tone for Flashman's life. Over the following 60 years or so, he is involved in many of the major military conflicts of the 19th century — always in spite of his best efforts to evade his duty. He is often selected for especially dangerous jobs because of his heroic reputation. He meets many famous people, and survives some of the worst military disasters (the First Anglo-Afghan War, Charge of the Light Brigade, the Siege of Cawnpore, Battle of the Little Bighorn, Battle of Isandlwana), always <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> more heroic laurels. The date of his last adventures seems to have been around 1900. He dies in 1915.|$|E
25|$|Financially, Gremlins was a success. Produced on an $11 million budget, it {{was more}} {{expensive}} than Spielberg had originally intended but still relatively cheap for its time. The trailer introduced the film to audiences by briefly explaining that Billy receives a strange creature as a Christmas present, by going over the three rules, and then <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> {{the fact that the}} creatures transform into terrible monsters. This trailer showed little of either the mogwai or the gremlins. In contrast to this, other advertisements concentrated on Gizmo, overlooked the gremlins, and made the film look similar to Spielberg's earlier family film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} match of the pay-per-view, Electroshock, Heavy Metal and Joe Líder faced La Maniarquía, {{consisting}} of Chessman, Último Gladiador and Silver King, who in Mexico City {{is forced to}} wrestle under the ring name Silver Cain {{as a way of}} being able to wear his mask, in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match. La Maniarquía was accompanied to the ring by their mascot Maniaquito and their La Sociedad stablemate, AAA World Mixed Tag Team Champion Jennifer Blake, while Heavy Metal was accompanied by his valet Nanyzh Rock, midget companion Lokillo and musician Charly Montana. While every one of them followed the earlier agreement between Joaquin Roldán and Konnan and did not interfere in the match, Joe Líder's partner Nicho el Millonario, seeking revenge on La Maniarquía, ran in and tried to replace Heavy Metal, who had been taken out of the match by Chessman, which led to Roldán <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> security and having them remove Nicho from the arena. Soon afterwards, Heavy Metal returned to the match and threw Último Gladiador from the top rope through a cello, given to him by Montana, while Electroshock superbombed Chessman through a table. Heavy Metal followed up by performing a diving elbow drop on Gladiador, after which the técnico duo scored a double pin on their opponents to win the match.|$|E

500|$|After Mrs Lycett Green had {{finished}} her testimony {{on the fifth}} day, her place was taken by Mrs Wilson. On examination by Russell, Mrs Wilson stated that she thought she saw Gordon-Cumming cheat twice by adding additional counters to his stake. When Clarke cross-examined her, he asked if anyone had placed a stake of £15. Mrs Wilson stated that only her husband had placed such an amount, but Wilson had not played on either night as he disliked both the game and high-stakes gambling. Havers, Grayson and Shankland consider it [...] "rather shocking really, considering that she had sworn to tell the truth,... to find her <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> this... lie spoken, apparently, with the complete self-assurance that {{the other members of}} her family had shown".|$|E

O'Hara played a British woman who leaves her diplomat husband in England for an Italian pianist (Brazzi). She had high {{expectations}} for the film but soon realized that Brazzi was miscast. During the production O'Hara witnessed a robbery taking place nearby at jewellery store nearby in Milan. She was so frustrated with the finished film, which was a box office flop, that she cried. O'Hara made her last picture with James Stewart the following year in the comedic western, The Rare Breed.

500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; {{no one wants to be}} their own thing anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs.

500|$|Highlighting {{a general}} malaise with the show, Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post deemed Sue's boredom with cheerleading a meta-reference {{to the series}} itself. Both she and Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club noted {{negatively}} the repetition of familiar storylines, such as the football team vs. glee club rivalry and Sue's attempts to destroy the club. VanDerWerff observed that Glee [...] "keeps tossing the same elements into the hat and <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> similar results, as though the only thing anybody’s putting any effort into are the musical numbers." [...] He graded the episode a [...] "C", calling it [...] "boring". Time James Poniewozik also commented on the repetitive premise, suggesting that the jocks versus geeks plot was the one {{most likely to be}} accessible to the new audience. He found the episode [...] "easily forgettable" [...] overall, criticizing the flat characterization, but noted that even when the series frustrates him, he continues to love Glee for, not in spite of, its inconsistency.|$|E
