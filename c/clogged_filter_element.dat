40|$|AbstractIn today's {{maintenance}} planning, {{fuel filters}} are replaced or cleaned {{on a regular}} basis. Monitoring and implementation of prognostics on filtration system {{have the potential to}} avoid costs and increase safety. Prognostics is a fundamental technology within Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM). Prognostic models can be categorised into three major categories: 1) Physics-based models 2) Data-driven models 3) Experience-based models. One of the challenges in the progression of the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure is the inability to observe the natural <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure due to time constraint. This paper presents a simple solution to collect data for a <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure. Also, it represents a simple state-based prognostic with duration information (SSPD) method that aims to detect and forecast <b>clogging</b> of <b>filter</b> in a laboratory based fuel rig system. The progression of the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure is created unnaturally. The degradation level is divided into several groups. Each group is defined as a state in the failure progression of <b>clogging</b> <b>filter.</b> Then, the data is collected to create the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> progression states unnaturally. The SSPD method consists of three steps: clustering, clustering evaluation, and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Prognosis results show that the SSPD method is able to predicate the RUL of the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> accurately...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{modelling}} of {{the variation}} in the pressure drop across a HEPA filter during cake filtration in the presence of humidity was studied. A semi-empirical model was developed that considers the pressure drop across the <b>clogged</b> <b>filter</b> as the sum of the pressure drops across the clean filter and across the cake, which is itself decomposed into several successive layers. The pressure drop across each layer of particles depends on its state of equilibrium with the air humidity. The model includes the specific resistance of each layer of particles and its variation when the cake is exposed to a flow of moist air. This model applies for relative humidity below the deliquescent point of the aerosol if it is hygroscopic. The results show good agreement between the calculated values and experimental values for flat <b>filters</b> <b>clogged</b> with aluminium oxide and sodium chloride test aerosols. The model also revealed the influence of filtration time on the evolution of the pressure drop across a <b>clogged</b> <b>filter</b> in the presence of humidity, especially with a hygroscopic aerosol...|$|R

40|$|Separation of solids from fluid {{is a vital}} {{process to}} achieve the desired level of {{purification}} in industry.

40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> can be used directly as inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> {{and the development of a}} new type of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R
