40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} potential of visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to derive soil <b>colour</b> <b>groups</b> as a new methodology that might assist in soil type classification. A fibre-optic VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (306. 5 - 1710. 9 nm) {{was used to measure}} the light properties in reflectance mode of 342 dry soil samples collected from fields in Belgium and Northern France. The colour of soil samples was measured with the Munsell soil colour charts, dividing soil samples into two groups of 236 and 106 samples belonging to Hue 2. 5 Y and Hue 10 YR, respectively. Factorial Discriminant Analysis (FDA) was performed separately on each Hue data using the first five Principal Components (PCs) of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) carried out on <b>colour</b> <b>groups</b> defined a priori. Considering the 2. 5 Y Hue group, soil samples were classified successfully into four <b>colour</b> <b>groups</b> with a correct classification (CC) of 87. 3 % and 81. 8 % for the calibration and validation spectra, respectively Lower accuracy was observed for the 10 YR Hue group for classification into three groups, since 79. 6 % and 75. 0 % of samples were correctly classified for calibration and validation sample sets, respectively Establishing four <b>colour</b> <b>groups</b> by combining both Hue groups decreased the classification accuracy considerably. in order to improve the classification accuracy, the first 5 PCs and first 2 PCs of PCA performed on soil spectra and on the total carbon (Tot-C), extractable phosphorous (Ext-P) and texture index (71), respectively, were pooled (concatenated) into a signal matrix and analysed newly by the FDA. This led to improvement of the classification results of four Hue 2. 5 Y groups (CC of 82. 1 % and 89. 1 %) and three Hue 10 YR groups (CC of 84. 1 % and 82. 4 %). However, best concatenation results of four groups for the combination of both Hue groups were obtained when only Tot-C and Ext-P were considered without Ti, obtaining a CC of 84. 2 % of the validation data sets. This suggests that the VIS-NIR spectroscopy combined with chemometric tools has the potential of identifying different soil <b>colour</b> <b>groups</b> for a large geographical area. (c) 2007 IAgrE.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine the effect}} of shell colour in eggs acquired from Ross- 308 broiler breeders on the interior and exterior quality of the egg, the antibody content of the egg yolk, and growth performance. The shell colours of a total of 1350 eggs were classified, using a colorimeter, into three groups: dark (E 67). The difference between groups with respect to egg weight, shape index, shell weight, and Haugh unit value was significant. Egg yolk antibody content (IgY) was 6. 658 mg/mL in the dark <b>colour</b> <b>group,</b> 5. 130 mg/mL in the medium <b>colour</b> <b>group,</b> and 5. 242 mg/mL in the light <b>colour</b> <b>group.</b> Among incubation characteristics, the fertility rate as, in order, 94. 66 %, 92. 14 %, and 87. 92 % in dark, medium, and light shell colour eggs, and the hatchability was 87. 00 %, 84. 28 %, and 80. 57 %, in the same order. No significant difference was observed between groups with respect to hatchability of fertile eggs and embryonic mortality rates. No significant difference was observed between groups for live weight, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio either. The eggshell colour has an effect on yolk antibody content and on the hatchability, but it has no influence on hatchability of fertile eggs, Haugh unit and growth performance...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported examining {{the effects of}} <b>colour</b> <b>grouping,</b> <b>colour</b> change and target colour foreknowledge under preview search conditions (Watson and Humphreys, 1997). In Experiment 1 we manipulated the colour homogeneity of the old items at initial presentation, and the colour these items subsequently changed into. In all cases participants knew the colour of the target. We found that when the old items changed into the same colour as the new search set, search performance was affected. In Experiment 2 participants {{did not know the}} colour of the target. Here we found evidence for a negative colour-based carry-over effect that slowed search for new targets carrying the colour of the old items. This occurred even when the old items changed their original colour and the new target was a singleton. Collectively the results suggest an important role for both <b>colour</b> <b>grouping</b> and colour-based inhibition in the successful rejection of old distractors. The consequence of this, however, is that new stimuli that may carry the critical attribute may take longer to detect.

40|$|The colours of the edible part {{of fruit}} and {{vegetables}} indicate the presence of specific micronutrients and phytochemicals. The extent to which fruit and vegetable <b>colour</b> <b>groups</b> contribute to CHD protection is unknown. We therefore examined the associations between fruit and vegetables of different colours and their subgroups and 10 -year CHD incidence. We used data from a prospective population-based cohort including 20 069 men and women aged 20 – 65 years who were enrolled between 1993 and 1997. Participants were free of CVD at baseline and completed a validated 178 -item FFQ. Hazard ratios (HR) for the association between green, orange/yellow, red/purple, white fruit and vegetables and their subgroups with CHD were calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. During 10 years of follow-up, 245 incident cases of CHD were documented. For each 25 g/d increase in the intake of {{the sum of all}} four colours {{of fruit and}} vegetables, a borderline significant association with incident CHD was found (HR 0 · 98; 95 % CI 0 · 97, 1 · 01). No clear associations were found for the <b>colour</b> <b>groups</b> separately. However, each 25 g/d increase in the intake of deep orange fruit and vegetables was inversely associated with CHD (HR 0 · 74; 95 % CI 0 · 55, 1 · 00). Carrots, their largest contributor (60 %), were associated with a 32 % lower risk of CHD (HR 0 · 68; 95 % CI 0 · 48, 0 · 98). In conclusion, though no clear associations were found for the four <b>colour</b> <b>groups</b> with CHD, a higher intake of deep orange fruit and vegetables and especially carrots may protect against CH...|$|R

40|$|Intrageneric {{diversity}} of 556 streptomycetes {{isolated from the}} rhizosphere of tropical legume was determined by using molecular taxonomic method based on 16 S rDNA. A total of 46 isolates were taken to represent 37 <b>colour</b> <b>groups</b> of the isolates. 16 S rDNA were amplified and subsequently sequenced and the sequences data were aligned with streptomycete sequences retrieved from the ribosomal data base project (RDP) data. Phylogenetic trees were generated by using the PHYLIP software package and the matrix of nucleotide similarity and nucleotide difference were generated by using PHYDIT software. The results confirmed and extended the value of 16 S rDNA sequencing in streptomycete systematic. The 16 S rDNA sequence data showed {{that most of the}} tested <b>colour</b> <b>group</b> representatives formed new centers of taxonomic variation within the genus Streptomyces. The generic assignment of these organisms was underpinned by 16 S rDNA sequence data which also suggested that most of the strains represented new centers of taxonomic variation.

Therefore, the combination of selective isolation and molecular taxonomic procedures used in this study provide a powerful way of uncovering new centers of taxonomic variation within the genus Streptomyces...|$|R
40|$|This {{body of work}} {{examines}} the effects of pre-cues on visual search for targets defined by a colour-orientation conjunction. Cueing the identity of targets enhanced the efficiency of search, with stronger effects from cueing the colour of the target compared to cueing its orientation, even though the targets were balanced for search efficiency within both orientation and colour dimensions. The colour advantage remained when {{the response to the}} target was task-irrelevant and occurred whether information was presented as visual cues or verbal cues. There was, however, evidence of automatic priming from the physical nature of cue stimuli playing a substantial role in guiding search, particular when based on the cue’s colour. Eye movement data from uncued trials indicated fixations were initially directed to a subset of items with the same colour. Cues were assumed to direct fixations within this colour-grouped array. Colour cueing effects reinforced the parsing of stimuli <b>grouped</b> by <b>colour,</b> while orientation cues enhanced local orientation disparities within the <b>colour</b> <b>groups.</b> The findings suggest that the advantage for colour cueing may be due to a combination of more efficient early segmentation of search items into <b>colour</b> <b>groups</b> and stronger grouping arising within these groups.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>colour</b> <b>group</b> on the {{morbidity}} due to Schistosoma mansoni was examined in two endemic areas situated in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Of the 2773 eligible inhabitants, 1971 (71. 1 %) participated in the study: 545 (27. 6 %) were classified as white, 719 (36. 5 %) as intermediate and 707 (35. 9 %) as black. For each <b>colour</b> <b>group,</b> {{signs and symptoms of}} individuals who eliminated S. mansoni eggs (cases) were compared to those who did not present eggs in the faeces (controls).

There was no evidence of a modifier effect of colour on diarrhea, bloody faeces or abdominal pain. A modifier effect of colour on hepatomegaly was evident among those heaviest infected (> 400 epg) : the adjusted odds ratios for palpable liver at the middle clavicular and the middle sternal lines were smaller among blacks (5. 4 and 6. 5, respectively) and higher among whites (10. 6 and 12. 9) and intermediates (10. 4 and 10. 1, respectively).
