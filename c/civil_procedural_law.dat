Since the fall of the Soviet Union that is no longer the case, and most scholars have classified the Russian legal system as a civil law system.

40|$|European {{co-operation}} {{has resulted}} in many new and challenging opportunities for legal scholars who, since the so-called codification period, have become used to operating in a purely national context. This applies also to scholars {{in the field of}} civil procedure, who, for a considerable period of time, have resisted leaving the purely national domain. These scholars have devoted {{a great deal of attention}} to the question whether or not harmonisation of <b>civil</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>law</b> is a feasible option, and, if so, in what manner harmonisation should be achieved. The contributors to this book - the general introduction of which is made available here - seek to further the harmonisation debate by exploring some of the main trends in the development of <b>civil</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>law</b> during the last two centuries in several European countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, England and Wales, The Netherlands and Belgium). Two of the central issues that are addressed by the contributors are the extent to which the various procedural models have influenced each other and the extent to which common traditions in <b>civil</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>law</b> may be distinguished in Europe. Each general chapter in this book is supplemented by three chapters devoted to specific procedural topics: Conciliation, Party Interrogation as Evidence and the Role of the Judge. In addition, extensive bibliographical references are included. ...|$|E

5000|$|In jurisprudence, {{procedural}} {{defenses are}} forms of defense challenging {{the legitimacy of}} the legal proceeding. A party argues that it should not be held liable for a legal charge or claim brought against them by some legal process, because it has been found such a process is illegitimate. Procedural defenses are built into legal systems as incentives for systems to follow their own rules. In common law jurisdictions the term has applications in both criminal <b>law</b> and <b>civil</b> <b>law.</b> <b>Procedural</b> defenses do not settle questions of guilt or innocence in a criminal proceeding, and are independent of substantive findings for or against a plaintiff or defendant in a civil proceeding. As examples: Defendants might claim there is something about the method of bringing them to be judged, that is unable to result in justice done to someone in their situation. They might claim the process is incompatible with the goals of the justice system.|$|R
50|$|Habeas corpus {{still remains}} {{a problem for}} the convicts who need to {{participate}} in the hearings on civil jurisdiction. Addressing this issue, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine passed a ruling on 12.04.2012 in the case on constitutional appeal of the citizen A.Troyan concerning official interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of Ukraine. (The case re: equality of parties to the trial). Mr.Troyan approached the CCU seeking official interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of Ukraine concerning the right of an incarcerated convict to be brought to court to participate in the hearing of civil jurisdiction (the equal rights of parties to the lawsuit). The Court responded that “personal participation of a convict serving his/her sentence in a penitentiary institution, as a party to the trial, meets the requirement of complete, comprehensive, objective and un-biased hearing. This participation of a convict, as a party to the cases heard in the courts of all jurisdictions, specializations and instances should be ensured by the respective <b>procedural</b> <b>law.</b> Decision on a convict’s participation as a party to the trial should be made by a court in the order and under conditions determined by the respective procedural law.” Hence the convict has “the equal right to protection of his rights and freedoms in court and to participation in the hearing of his case in the order defined by the respective <b>procedural</b> <b>law</b> in the courts of all jurisdictions, specializations and instances”. So, on the one hand the Court ruled that the convict has the right to participate in the hearing on his case, but only in accordance with the order established by the respective <b>procedural</b> <b>law.</b> But the very core of the problem {{lies in the fact that}} neither <b>civil</b> <b>procedural,</b> nor administrative <b>procedural</b> <b>law</b> properly regulates this matter. That is why the CCU Decision, instead of improving the situation, provided formal grounds for depriving the convicts of their right to participate in the hearings on their cases until the respective <b>procedural</b> <b>law</b> is passed.|$|R
