The group had included a medley of soul standards in the show, one of which, The Drifters' [...] "Under the Boardwalk", was a solo spot for Ruffin. Impressed, Robinson decided to produce a single with Ruffin singing lead.

Robinson thought that if he could write just the perfect song for Ruffin's voice, then he could have a smash hit.

5000|$|Jeff Glassman is a theatre artist, {{actor and}} {{composer}} of movement from Chicago, living in Urbana, Illinois. From 1971-1986 {{he was a}} founding member of the United Mime Workers [...] experimental theatre <b>collective</b> [...] and <b>toured</b> in the United States, Eastern and Western Europe, Mexico and Cuba. He innovated several different ways of organizing, composing and notating movement and speech for theatre. This includes ways of composing movement and speech separately in time and space involving a three-dimensional grid system. He has taught [...] "Inventing Systems for Theatre and Music" [...] at The Evergreen State College. Continuously since 1991 he has collaborated extensively with movement-based theatre artist Lisa Fay through originating ideas, techniques and new performance works. They invent ways for disengaging normal relations of speech to gesture, for separating characters into parallel time-place frames of reference, and for bringing the elements back together in novel arrangements. They tour often as the Lisa Fay and Jeff Glassman Duo in the US and South Korea and conduct performance residencies (see web site) http://www.lisafayandjeffglassmanduo.org.|$|R
40|$|The first State of Ontario’s Protected Areas Report (2011) {{identified}} visitor impacts {{as one of}} {{the known}} threats to the maintenance or restoration of ecological integrity in Ontario’s provincial parks. Algonquin Provincial Park (APP) sustains the impacts of nearly million visitors per year (Ministry of Natural Resources, 2010), more than any other provincial park in Ontario. To mitigate these visitor impacts, APP has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with The Friends of Algonquin Park and the Algonquin Backcountry Recreationalists to be the first provincial park in Ontario to officially adopt and deliver the Leave No Trace (LNT) program in Spring 2011. Due to limited funding, staff, and time, tour operators operating in APP may also be potentially important delivery-agents of the LNT program. Research shows that interpretation, through personal contact, is an effective visitor management tactic {{that can be used to}} encourage visitors to adopt an enhanced conservation ethic and modify their behaviour, such as LNT principles, in order to reduce their ecological impacts on the protected area. This case study used three methods to examine the type of interpretation currently delivered by a tour operator offering guided canoe trips in APP: (1) literature and documentation review; (2) focused interviews to determine the general manager’s, guides, and clients knowledge and use of LNT principles; and (3) participant observation to identify the actual LNT messages delivered and behaviour modelled by guides. The findings of this study reveal that guides are somewhat familiar with the LNT program and are practicing at least one of the seven LNT principles while canoe trip guiding. While litter and campfire-related impacts are identified as the most commonly observed visitor-related impacts by the guides, guides are more apt to properly dispose of waste, but still rely solely on campfires to cook all the meals at the campsite as well as having a nightly pleasure fire, despite having to collect appropriate firewood along portage trails or around the perimeter of the lake, due to barren campsites. These findings show that tour operators can play a much greater role in delivering the LNT program; however, guides require additional LNT training, in order to strengthen their role as delivery-agents of the LNT program in APP. Enhancing tour operators role in delivering LNT program will require greater involvement in VMP through collaborative planning, the establishment of a tour operators association to represent the <b>collective</b> interests of <b>tour</b> operators, and the use of a business licence scheme to ensure tour operators are incorporating the LNT program into guided canoe trips...|$|R
