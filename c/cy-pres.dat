5|$|Jurisdiction over {{charitable}} disputes {{is shared}} equally between the High Court of Justice and the Charity Commission. The Commission, the first port of call, is tasked with regulating and promoting charitable trusts, {{as well as}} providing advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters. Where the Commission feels there has been mismanagement or maladministration, it can sanction the trustees, removing them, appointing new ones or temporarily taking the trust property itself to prevent harm being done. Where there are flaws with a charity, the High Court can administer schemes directing the function of the charity, or even, under the <b>Cy-près</b> doctrine, change the purpose of the charity or gift altogether.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied <b>cy-près.</b> The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cy-près</b> {{doctrine}} in English law {{is an element}} of trusts law dealing with charitable trusts. The doctrine provides that when such a trust has failed because its purposes are either impossible or cannot be fulfilled, the High Court of Justice or Charity Commission can make an order redirecting the trust's funds to the nearest possible purpose. For charities with a worth under £5,000 and no land, the trustees (by a two-thirds majority) may make the decision to redirect the trust's funds. The doctrine was initially an element of ecclesiastical law, coming from the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), but similar and possibly ancestral provisions have been found in Roman law, both in the Corpus Juris Civilis and later Byzantine law.|$|E
5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, {{since there is no}} question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds should be subject to <b>cy-près</b> or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E
5|$|Both the High Court and the Charities Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about when {{money has been}} left for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to {{how it should be}} administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of <b>Cy-près.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>cy-près</b> {{doctrine}} {{is the idea}} that, where a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes {{as close as possible}} to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{the failure}} of a {{charitable}} trust, the gift may be held on resulting trust for the donor, as in Chichester Diocesan Fund v Simpson, or submitted to variation under the <b>cy-près</b> doctrine. As in Simpson v Simpson, if property is given to somebody who is incapable of acting, it will also be held on resulting trust for the donor.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the Charities Act 1960, {{situations}} where the <b>cy-près</b> doctrine applied were limited to cases where the trust's purpose was either impossible or impracticable. The 1960 Act, however, provides in Section 13(1) (now part of the Charities Act 1993) that <b>cy-près</b> can apply where the original purposes have: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>cy-près</b> {{is a form}} of variation of trusts; it allows the original purpose of the trust to be altered. The doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy pres comme possible (as close as possible), and is typically used where the original purpose of the charity has failed, and results in the trust purpose being altered to the nearest realistic alternative. Prior to the Charities Act 1960, this [...] "failed purpose" [...] situation was the only time when <b>cy-près</b> could be applied; it required the original purpose to be impossible or impractical. With the 1960 Act (the relevant provisions of which are now included in the 1993 Act), <b>cy-près</b> can be applied where the original purposes have: ...|$|E
500|$|Later in 2010, Frank and the CCAF, citing American Law Institute {{guidelines}} on <b>cy-près,</b> objected to Apple's settlement of a securities class action over their backdating, arguing that {{giving money to}} third parties affiliated with the class counsel instead of to the class was a breach of fiduciary duty. Frank stated that [...] "the magnitude of the settlement compared to the original claims demonstrates {{that it is an}} extortionate nuisance settlement, being made because it would cost more to defend the suit than to pay the attorneys to go away." [...] In response to CCAF's objection, the parties amended the settlement by reallocating the $2.5 million originally proposed as <b>cy-près</b> to class members; the court awarded CCAF attorneys' fees for their role in winning $2.5 million for the class.|$|E
500|$|Cases {{of initial}} failure are where, {{rather than an}} {{established}} charitable trust failing, a gift has failed {{at the moment of}} its creation by having an invalid purpose. This raises different questions, as {{it is a matter of}} deciding [...] "has the original charitable gift failed, and, if it has, can the money be applied <b>cy-près</b> or must it go on resulting trust to the settlor's estate"? ...|$|E
500|$|Failures {{that lead}} to an {{application}} for <b>cy-près</b> are of two sorts; subsequent failure, where the trust, constituted properly, failed {{after a period of}} action, and initial failure, where the trust fails at creation. Subsequent failure cases are designed to have the charity's funds applied to more effective purposes, and as such money already donated to the charity cannot be returned to the next of kin of the original money; in Re Wright, it was said that [...] "once money has been effectually dedicated to charity... the testator's next of kin or residuary legatees are for ever excluded". Schemes for initial failure, on the other hand, ask the court to decide whether the gifts should be returned to the testator's estate and next of kin or be applied to a new purpose under <b>cy-près.</b> When deciding if a gift has failed, there is a distinction made between gifts to unincorporated bodies and incorporated bodies, as laid down in Re Vernon's Will Trust. This is because gifts to an unincorporated body must be treated as gifts to that body's purpose, not to the body itself, since unincorporated bodies cannot hold property. As such, the gift does not revert to the next of kin because even if the body is dissolved, the gift's purpose is (presumably) still valid.|$|E
500|$|The <b>cy-près</b> {{doctrine}} {{applies to}} {{two types of}} situations: subsequent failures and initial failures. Subsequent failures are where money has already been applied to a charitable purpose, and that purpose has failed. It does not allow the next of kin of the original donor to recover any money, as said in Re Wright: [...] "Once money has been effectually dedicated to charity, whether in pursuance of a general or a particular charitable intent, the testator's next of kin or residuary legatees are forever excluded". The courts instead simply {{determine whether or not}} the reason for failure falls within Section 13, based on the basic intention underlying the original gift.|$|E
500|$|This {{definition}} was {{amended by}} the Charities Act 2006 to replace [...] "the {{spirit of the}} gift" [...] with [...] "the appropriate considerations," [...] which are defined as [...] "(on the one hand) {{the spirit of the}} gift concerned, and (on the other) the social and economic circumstances prevailing {{at the time of the}} proposed alteration of the original purposes". In the case of extremely small charitable trusts (where the charity has an income of less than £5,000 and holds no land) the trustees may agree by a two-thirds majority to transfer the property to another charity, without involving the High Court or Commission. This is contained in Sections 74-5 of the 1993 Act. Once the decision is reached, public notice must be given, and the Commission informed. <b>Cy-près</b> powers are now enacted in the Charities Act 2011.|$|E
500|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that the doctrine descends from Roman law. The Corpus Juris Civilis mentions a process that redirected money collected to celebrate a person's life in some way that violated law to a purpose within the law. It also gives a similar justification: [...] "t would be unjust that the amount which [...] has destined to that end should revert to the heirs. Therefore, let ... an investigation be made to ascertain how the trust may be employed so that the memory of the deceased may be preserved in some other and lawful manner." [...] The Byzantine Empire used a system similar to <b>cy-près</b> when dealing with piae causae, charitable corporations, whereby if the corporation fell its possessions were to be transferred to the Papal treasury and spent on a purpose {{as close as possible to}} that of the original corporation.|$|E
500|$|Among CCAFs {{cases are}} those {{challenging}} an emerging trend known as <b>cy-près.</b> [...] Created by American {{courts in the}} 1970s as a mechanism to distribute funds to stand-in organizations and causes in cases in which it would be impractical to distribute class action settlement funds directly to the entire class of plaintiffs, the practice has been criticized {{from time to time}} for redirecting funds that would otherwise go to the parties to the case. [...] In one case, CCAF challenged a settlement that would have directed $2.5 million out of a total $16.5 million settlement Apple Inc. was to pay to shareholders for backdating employee stock option grants, to unrelated law school programs on corporate governance. According to Frank, in March 2010, two attorneys from the Kabateck Brown Kellner firm published an op ed in the Los Angeles Daily Journal attacking the litigation against impermissible cy pres awards as part of a [...] "corporate" [...] campaign. Frank firmly stated on the Manhattan Institute run website Point of Law.com that the [...] "Center for Class Action Fairness has never taken a dollar of for-profit corporate money." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{founding}} of the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center occurred in 1963 when {{the board of the}} trust went to the Dauphin County Orphans Court with the <b>cy-près</b> doctrine (cy près is a French phrase meaning [...] "As close as possible"). It was a gift from the Milton Hershey School Trust to the people of Pennsylvania, with an initial endowment of $50 million and only one restrictionthe hospital had to be built in Hershey. The hospital is a teaching hospital, with an annual budget exceeding the initial construction cost.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, {{the parties}} amended the {{settlement}} agreement. [...] The amended agreement included several significant changes: limited the scope to foreign {{books that are}} registered with the U.S. Copyright Office or published in the UK, Canada, or Australia, [...] added board members to the Books Rights Registry from the UK, Canada, and Australia, gave the rightsholder the ability to renegotiate the revenue share, gave Google added flexibility in discounting, created a fiduciary to hold payments due to orphan works. [...] If the rightsholder is never ascertained, the funds are distributed <b>cy-près</b> instead of redistributed among rightsholders, and {{increased the number of}} public licenses allowed for a library.|$|E
2500|$|The mayors of Gillingham, Rochester and Chatham {{set up a}} {{memorial}} fund, inviting public donations through the local and national press [...] "to be devoted, among other things, to defraying the funeral expenses, caring for the boys who may be disabled, and then to such worthy cause or causes {{in memory of the}} boys who lost their lives, as the mayors may determine". Donations of nearly £9,000 were received. Over £2,300 was spent, but the mayors could not decide how to apply the balance of the funds. A court case later decided that the fund was not charitable and was not saved by the Charitable Trusts (Validation) Act 1954; that the <b>cy-près</b> doctrine could not be applied; that the fund's objects were too uncertain for it to be a valid trust; that the fund was not bona vacantia; and as a result that the funds should be returned to the donors under a resulting trust. Every year on the Sunday closest to the event, the Chatham Marine Cadet Unit still holds {{a memorial}} parade at the cemetery in which the cadets were laid to rest.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, the California Supreme Court {{endorsed}} <b>cy-près</b> {{mechanisms in}} class action settlements, and other American courts followed. <b>Cy-près</b> mechanisms allow {{money to be}} used to promote the interests of class members, rather than reverting to a defendant, which could be seen as a windfall to a defendant charged with breaking the law. Judge Richard Posner has argued that the term is a misnomer in the class action context, because <b>cy-près</b> awards serve a punitive effect. Some commentators have criticized the use of <b>cy-près</b> settlements; the American Law Institute's Draft of the Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation proposes limiting <b>cy-près</b> to [...] "circumstances in which direct distribution to individual class members is not economically feasible, or where funds remain after class members are given a full opportunity to make a claim".|$|E
5000|$|However, the UTC further {{provides}} {{that the court}} may not apply <b>cy-près</b> where [...] "a provision {{in the terms of}} a charitable trust...would result in distribution of the trust property to a noncharitable beneficiary" [...] and also that <b>cy-près</b> may not be used to violate the rule against perpetuities.|$|E
50|$|In jurisdictions {{which have}} {{retained}} the English <b>cy-près</b> doctrine {{but do not}} have an equivalent state body to the Charity Commission for England and Wales (or in relation to foreign charities' assets in the United Kingdom), charity trustees may seek the approval of the Court to their entry into <b>cy-près</b> arrangements to avoid later accusations of breach of trust.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cy-près</b> {{doctrine}} {{applied in}} England and Wales limited the strictness {{of the rules}} of mortmain under which property disposed of otherwise than to a legal heir was subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances. Following abolition of mortmain, the modern application of the <b>cy-près</b> doctrine has predominantly occurred in relation to charities, as these are the most important trusts for a general purpose (not private benefit) permitted under English law.|$|E

50|$|The Charity Commission for England and Wales has the {{statutory}} power {{to apply the}} <b>cy-près</b> doctrine {{on behalf of a}} charity where, for example, no trustees remain in a charity or the necessary mandate cannot be agreed. These powers extend to a corporate charity or unincorporated association (which the common law rules may not cover). Similar powers apply to the equivalent bodies in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The <b>cy-près</b> doctrine will not be applied where a charity has alternative powers to redirect its funds under its constitution.|$|E
50|$|The amended {{agreement}} created a fiduciary to hold payments due to orphan works. If the rightsholder was never ascertained, the funds {{would have been}} distributed <b>cy-près</b> instead of distributed among other rightsholders.|$|E
5000|$|The UTC provides, in part, that [...] "if a {{particular}} charitable purpose becomes unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve, or wasteful...the court may apply <b>cy-près</b> to modify or terminate the trust...in a manner {{consistent with the}} settlor’s charitable purposes".|$|E
50|$|The UTC codifies that <b>cy-près</b> {{applies only}} to {{charitable}} trusts where the original particular purpose of the trust has become impossible or impracticable, and {{the terms of the}} trust do not specify what is to happen in such a situation.|$|E

50|$|When the {{original}} {{objective of the}} settlor or the testator became impossible, impracticable, or illegal to perform, the <b>cy-près</b> doctrine allows the court to amend {{the terms of the}} charitable trust as closely as possible to {{the original}} intention of the testator or settlor to prevent the trust from failing.|$|E
50|$|Until 1995, {{the trust}} was only {{permitted}} {{to use its}} income for expenditure on its bridges.
