40|$|Abstract. The ultra-microduplex {{structure}} was fabricated {{in the high}} carbon steel with a fully pearlitic structure after severe plastic deformation. The sizes of ferrite grains and cementite particles were about 0. 4 µm and 0. 1 ~ 0. 2 µm, respectively. The mechanical properties of the ultra-microduplex structure were investigated using mini-tensile tests and the morphologies of fracture surfaces were observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The {{results show that the}} tensile strength of the ultra-microduplex structure and the lamellar pearlite are almost at the same level, but after warm deformation, the yield strength was obviously increased and correspondingly, the elongation and the reduction of area were 19. 2 %, 32. 1 %, respectively, which are markedly higher than those of the lamellar pearlite. The tensile fracture of the ultra-microduplex structure is typical ductile fracture, however the fracture of original lamellar pearlite appears a mixture of <b>cleavage</b> <b>fractures</b> and quasi <b>cleavage</b> <b>fractures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Using the first-principles method {{based on}} density {{functional}} theory, {{the effect of}} helium irradiation on Ti 3 SiC 2 has been investigated. It was observed that helium atoms prefer to accumulate within the layers where Si atoms have been dislodged creating 2 -dimensional channels and bubbles which strongly promotes <b>cleavage</b> <b>fractures</b> between adjacent Ti Si layers. At high temperature the He atoms diffuse out of these bubbles enabling the diffusion of the mobile Si back to their original sites and the annealing of the material {{back to the original}} structure.

40|$|Plastic {{deformation}} of TiN thin films with (111) and (200) preferred orientation was determined {{based on their}} hardness anisotropy. Hardness was measured {{by means of the}} nano-indentation technique. Plastic {{deformation of}} TiN films was caused by the indentation of the trigonal diamond tip, and evidence of this phenomenon was provided by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation and transmission electron diffraction (TED) analysis. The influence of the differences in residual stress and grain size on hardness anisotropy was restrictive, and hardness anisotropy {{can be explained by the}} anisotropy of yield stress as calculated using Schmid's law. This relationship suggests the existence of a { 100 } slip system in the TiN crystal.

40|$|Abstract. Degradation of <b>cleavage</b> <b>fracture</b> {{toughness}} for {{low carbon}} steels due to pre-straining and irradiation was investigated {{on the basis}} of the local fracture criterion approach. Formulation of <b>cleavage</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness through the statistical modelling proposed by BEREMIN has been simplified by the present authors to the expression involving yield stress and <b>cleavage</b> <b>fracture</b> stress of materials. A few percent pre-strain induced by cold rolling deteriorates significantly the <b>cleavage</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness. Ductile-brittle transition temperature is increased to more than 7 c higher by 8 % straining in 5 OOMPa class high strength steel. Quantitative prediction of degradation has been successfully examined through the formulation of the <b>cleavage</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness. Analytical and experimental results indicate that degradation in toughness is caused by the increase of flow stress in pre-strained materials. Quantitative prediction of degradation of toughness due to irradiation has been also examined for the past experiments {{on the basis of}} the local fracture criterion approach. Analytical prediction from variance of yield stress by irradiation is well consistent with the experimental results. 1...|$|E

The <b>cleavage</b> <b>fracture</b> {{toughness}} {{of several}} {{reactor pressure vessel}} (RPV) steels {{was measured by the}} ASTM E 1921 master curve method using small bend (pre-cracked Charpy V-notched) specimens.

Micro-structural and fracto-graphical observations were performed on <b>cleavage</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces and polished-and-etched specimens as well. The measured <b>cleavage</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness was strongly related to the distance from the crack tip to the cleavage initiation site, cleavage initiation distance (CID), which was slightly beyond the local peak stress region.

These simulations show that the force of adhesion in metallic nano-contacts is reduced when adsorbate monolayers are present at the metal—metal junctions. Our results are {{in agreement with the}} conclusions of very accurate point-contact experiments carried out in this field. Our fracture simulations reveal that at low temperatures <b>cleavage</b> <b>fractures</b> can occur in both an elemental metal and an alloy.
