Lucite is machinable by coating the surface with an ink which is semi‐opaque to the green and yellow laser light. The repetition rate of the laser was 10 kHz with approximately 0. 35 mJ/pulse and 3. 5 W average power at the <b>copper</b> vapor <b>laser</b> wavelengths for a pulse width of 40 ns.

40|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1966 copper vapour lasers (CVLs) {{have developed}} into a mature technology with applications including high-speed imaging, micro-machining, non-linear frequency conversion to the ultraviolet, and pumping of solid-state laser materials. However, the performance characteristics of conventional CVLs are fundamentally limited by kinetic processes at play within the gain medium and hence, these devices largely failed {{to keep pace with}} advances in visible solid state lasers during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. In 1996 a new subclass of CVL, termed a kinetically enhanced or KE-CVL, was developed that used a ternary gas mixture (HCl–H₂–Ne) to tailor the kinetic processes that limit laser performance.
