50|$|The Java Telephony API (JTAPI) {{supports}} telephony <b>call</b> <b>control.</b> It is an extensible {{application programming interface}} (API) {{designed to}} scale {{for use in a}} range of domains, from first-party <b>call</b> <b>control</b> in a consumer device to third-party <b>call</b> <b>control</b> in large distributed call centers.|$|E
50|$|From around 2001 to 2003, {{there was}} an effort to {{harmonize}} the not yet standardized JAIN APIs for <b>call</b> <b>control</b> with the comparable and by then standardized Parlay APIs. A number of difficulties were encountered, but perhaps the most serious was not technical but procedural. The Java Community Process requires that a reference implementation be built for every standardized Java API. Parlay does not have this requirement. Not surprisingly, given the effort that would have been needed to build a reference implementation of JAIN <b>call</b> <b>control,</b> the standards community decided, implicitly if not explicitly, that the Parlay <b>call</b> <b>control</b> APIs were adequate and work on JAIN <b>call</b> <b>control</b> faded off. Nonetheless, the work on JAIN <b>call</b> <b>control</b> did have an important impact on Parlay since it helped to drive the definition of an agreed-upon mapping of Parlay to the Java language.|$|E

50|$|In the {{traditional}} telephony context, third party <b>call</b> <b>control</b> allows one entity (which {{we call the}} controller) {{to set up and}} manage a communications relationship or telephone call between two or more other parties. Third party <b>call</b> <b>control</b> (referred to as 3pcc) is often used for operator services (where an operator creates a call that connects two participants together) and conferencing.|$|E
50|$|Third party <b>call</b> <b>control</b> is {{possible}} using only the mechanisms specified within RFC 37251. Indeed, many different call flows are possible, {{each of which}} will work with SIP compliant user agents. However, there are benefits and drawbacks {{to each of these}} flows. The usage of third party <b>call</b> <b>control</b> also becomes more complex when aspects of the call utilize SIP extensions or optional features of SIP. In particular, the usage of RFC 3312 2 (used for coupling of signaling to resource reservation) with third party <b>call</b> <b>control</b> is non-trivial, and is discussed in Section 9 of RFC 3725 3. Similarly, the usage of early media (where session data is exchanged before the call is accepted) with third party <b>call</b> <b>control</b> is not trivial; both of them specify the way in which user agents generate and respond to SDP, and {{it is not clear how}} to do both at the same time. This is discussed further in Section 8.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a survey on different studies {{done in the}} field of <b>Call</b> Admission <b>Control.</b> Necessity of <b>Call</b> Admission <b>Control</b> is to provide better QoS. This paper provides an overview of different two techniques used for CAC. In recent years, considerable efforts have focused on the Channel Allocation and <b>Call</b> Admission <b>Control</b> (CAC) problems and many schemes that range from static to dynamic strategies have been proposed in the literature. <b>Call</b> Admission <b>Control</b> is a scheme to reduce the network congestion and provide the desired Quality of Service (QoS) to users in service.

50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>control</b> software, {{because of}} its central place in the {{operation}} of the telephone network, is marked by both complexity and reliability. <b>Call</b> <b>control</b> systems will typically require many thousands of person years in development. They will contain millions of lines of high level code. However they must and do meet reliability requirements that specify switch down time of only a few minutes in forty years.|$|E
50|$|In a VoIP network, <b>call</b> <b>control</b> is one {{of three}} major {{categories}} of communications traffic, the other two being call signaling and media communications. <b>Call</b> <b>control</b> uses Q.931, a connection protocol for digital networks, especially VoIP systems. Messages are transmitted as octets as specified in ITU H.245, which resolves the type of call media to be used (for example, conventional call, videoconferencing, or VoIP), and then manages the connection after it has been established. <b>Call</b> <b>control</b> functions include, but are not limited to, the determination of master/slave status for the endpoints, monitoring of the status of the endpoints, modification of the parameters of a connection, termination of a connection, and restarting a terminated or failed connection.|$|E
50|$|X.21 (sometimes {{referred}} to as X21) is an interface specification for differential communications introduced in the mid-1970s by the ITU-T. X.21 was first introduced {{as a means to}} provide a digital signaling interface for telecommunications between carriers and customers' equipment. This includes specifications for DTE/DCE physical interface elements, alignment of <b>call</b> <b>control</b> characters and error checking, elements of the <b>call</b> <b>control</b> phase for circuit switching services, and test loops.|$|E
40|$|<b>Call</b> {{admission}} <b>control</b> {{criteria are}} not only important for <b>call</b> admission <b>control</b> itself, but also {{can be an important}} input to network topological design. In this paper, we show the difference in terms of network cost incurred by adopting different <b>call</b> admission <b>control</b> schemes in network topological design. We compare two <b>call</b> admission <b>control</b> schemes. Scheme 1 uses equivalent bandwidth as its <b>call</b> admission <b>control</b> criterion and Scheme 2 is based on modeling the volatility of call traffic using Reflected Brownian Motion. Though Scheme 2 increases the complexity of network topological design, it can give lower network costs. Our experimental results show that for the same traffic mix, the network cost can be as little as 10 % and as much as 35 % lower when Scheme 2 is used instead of Scheme 1. The differences between the pair of resulting networks suggests that network topological design can be used as one of the criteria for choosing the <b>call</b> admission <b>control</b> scheme.

30|$|Different {{types of}} {{integral}} equations arise in various problems {{of theory and}} applications in mechanics, physics, biology, economics, medicine etc. (see, e.g. [1 – 12] and references therein). Many processes have exterior influences <b>called</b> <b>control</b> efforts or the system’s disturbances. Therefore mathematical models of such processes include an additional parameter which is <b>called</b> the <b>control</b> or disturbance vector depending {{on the character of}} the exterior influences.|$|R

Control Interval sizes are measured in bytes [...] - [...] for example 4 kilobytes [...] - [...] while Control Area sizes are measured in disk tracks or cylinders. Control Intervals are the units of transfer between disk and computer so a read request will read one complete Control Interval. Control Areas are the units of allocation so, when a VSAM data set is defined, an integral number of Control Areas will be allocated.|$|R
