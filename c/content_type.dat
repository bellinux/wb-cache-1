25|$|As Windows cannot {{examine the}} files on {{the device to}} {{determine}} <b>content</b> <b>type,</b> it is left to the manufacturer {{to decide how to}} proceed. A manufacturer can register Handlers against their particular device, can add their device to a group of devices (e.g.: ZipDrives) or allow a device class (e.g.: all devices which are Video Cameras) to handle their device for them. This determines which Handlers will be listed in the AutoPlay dialog when their device is discovered.|$|E

Large {{quantities of}} double eagles {{were found in the}} vaults of European banks beginning in the 1940s, and were placed on the numismatic market.

2500|$|Beginning in PDF 1.3, FDF {{can be used}} {{to define}} a {{container}} for annotations that are separate from the PDF document they apply to.

2500|$|When the {{connection}} starts, the record encapsulates a [...] "control" [...] protocol—the handshake messaging protocol (<b>content</b> <b>type</b> 22). This protocol {{is used to}} exchange all the information required by both sides for the exchange of the actual application data by TLS. It defines the format of messages and the order of their exchange. These may {{vary according to the}} demands of the client and server—i.e., there are several possible procedures to set up {{the connection}}. This initial exchange results in a successful TLS connection (both parties ready to transfer application data with TLS) or an alert message (as specified below).|$|E
2500|$|The dialog {{shows the}} result of a user placing a DVD into a DVD reader, in this case the D: drive. AutoPlay has {{determined}} that content is most likely a DVD movie and presents a set of actions to the user based on that decision. These actions are called Handlers and there are sets of Handlers associated with various types of content. The user can now make their decision and click OK to proceed. However, if they also tick the [...] "Always do the selected action" [...] tick box at this point, they will not be prompted the next time that particular <b>content</b> <b>type</b> is seen on that particular drive; the selected application will automatically start.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} class files into the three <b>content</b> <b>types,</b> the PerceivedType value {{associated}} with various file extensions {{is used to}} make the category determination.

2500|$|The TLS {{protocol}} exchanges records—which encapsulate {{the data}} to be exchanged in a specific format (see below). Each record can be compressed, padded, appended with a message authentication code (MAC), or encrypted, all depending {{on the state of}} the connection. Each record has a <b>content</b> <b>type</b> field that designates the type of data encapsulated, a length field and a TLS version field. The data encapsulated may be control or procedural messages of the TLS itself, or simply the application data needed to be transferred by TLS. The specifications (cipher suite, keys etc.) required to exchange application data by TLS, are agreed upon in the [...] "TLS handshake" [...] between the client requesting the data and the server responding to requests. The protocol therefore defines both the structure of payloads transferred in TLS and the procedure to establish and monitor the transfer.|$|E
