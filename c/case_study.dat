50|$|A case study—or case report—is an {{intensive}} {{analysis of a}} person, group, or event that stresses developmental factors related to the context. <b>Case</b> <b>studies</b> may be descriptive or explanatory.

40|$|Abstract Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this article is to present an analyze of <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> about {{entrepreneurship}} and strategy in Sweden. The overall purpose is to find out how many <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> there are, when they were written, and what type of <b>cases</b> <b>studies</b> there are about this subjects in Sweden, an inventory. Design/methodology/approach - The method used in this paper is qualitative secondary research from databases. The databases consist of Web of Science, Scopus, Diva, Google scholar and Emerald insight. Other secondary data are from research books and popular science sources. Implications/Findings - According to this study there is a lack of <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> about entrepreneurship and strategy in Sweden. This should implicate for more further <b>studies</b> within <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> and the creation of <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> should increase. Most of the <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> are written in the 2000 s and most of the cases are exploratory or descriptive. Originality/value - This paper is supposed to give accurate information about <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> in the determined area of research and give knowledge to companies and be helpful for further researches. Keywords - Sweden, <b>case</b> <b>studies,</b> entrepreneurship, strategy. Paper type - Research paper. ...|$|R

In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a <b>case</b> <b>study</b> that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like.

40|$|<b>Case</b> <b>studies</b> undeniably {{have great}} {{educational}} merits and provide real-world insight {{in a way}} that many textbooks do not, but can cases replace textbooks in the context of education? This literature review set out to answer this question and to determine in what ways <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> would have to change {{in order to be able}} to replace textbooks. Multiple sources, primarily existing <b>case</b> <b>studies,</b> were studied in order to determine what qualities of textbooks make them suitable for education and how these are reflected by <b>case</b> <b>studies,</b> and how well some <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> hold up to the standards of textbooks established. Several <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> were briefly reviewed with these criteria in mind, and the conclusion was drawn that while <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> certainly do have great educational significance and they do have their place in the classroom or lecture hall, as they are now they should not replace textbooks. It was concluded that despite their many strengths <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> need to put greater focus on teaching empirical theory as well as its practical applications in order to replace textbooks, but they should certainly continue to be used as literature in higher education...|$|R

40|$|<b>Case</b> <b>studies</b> may {{represent}} a valuable source of data for testing the theoreti-cal propositions related to community policing.
