A pioneer of modern landscape photography, his topics are unusual: {{a field of}} <b>corn</b> stubble, <b>thistles,</b> or twigs lying in the snow. Much of his recent work includes photographs from Iceland and Greenland, some with stark images of minerals and rocks. While he is extremely attentive to angle, light and exposure, he never manipulates his photographs once they have been taken. He has successfully exhibited across Denmark {{for many years and}} more recently in New York, London and Paris.|$|R
