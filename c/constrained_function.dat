In red light, this is replaced by blue colored phycocyanin, which absorbs red light better.

40|$|Among the {{standard}} books distributed with ACL 2 is the consider-hint {{book in the}} hints subdirectory, which implements a heuristic for computing functional instantiations. The implementation of the hint involves four basic algorithms: a second-order pattern matching algorithm that can compute instantiations for <b>constrained</b> and defined <b>functions</b> that call <b>constrained</b> <b>functions,</b> a process for generating variants of a term obtained by applying equations, a process for extending second-order matching through definitions so that when instantiating defined functions the algorithm can pick up appropriate bindings for the <b>constrained</b> <b>functions</b> inside the definitions, and an algorithm for sorting among likely functional substitutions. The second-order matching algorithm is an incomplete and slightly extended implementation of the Huet-Lang algorithm. We describe the four basic algorithms involved in guessing functional instantiations. We briefly suggest further work required to make the utility robust and suggest a new feature that could be added to ACL 2 if this utility were sufficiently robust.
