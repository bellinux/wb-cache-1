40|$|Clinical {{breakpoints}} {{are used}} in clinical microbiology laboratories to categorize microorganisms as <b>clinically</b> susceptible (S), <b>intermediate</b> (<b>I)</b> or resistant (R) dependent on the quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility {{as indicated by the}} MIC value determined in a well-defined standard test system. The laboratory report, with the designations of S, I or R for each antimicrobial agent, provides guidance to clinicians with respect to the potential use of agents in the treatment of patients, and clinical breakpoints should therefore distinguish between patients that are likely or unlikely to respond to antimicrobial treatment. In Europe, clinical breakpoints are set by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), following a defined procedure. This includes evaluation of efficacy in experimental settings and clinical studies to derive pharmacodynamic targets such as the fAUC/MIC ratio or %fT > MIC required for efficacy, the pharmacokinetic properties of the agent, Monte Carlo simulations to estimate exposures of the antimicrobial agent in the target patient population and commonly used dosing regimens. The probability of target attainment is subsequently determined for a range of pharmacodynamic targets and the results from the Monte Carlo simulations. The breakpoints derived are subsequently evaluated with respect to the wild-type population of the target microorganisms, specific resistance mechanisms and other relevant data. In this paper, we provide an overview of the EUCAST process and considerations for setting pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic breakpoints. These are the breakpoints that in the EUCAST breakpoint tables are referred to as 'non-species-related breakpoints'...|$|R

40|$|After {{infection}} with bacteriophage T 7, parental and newly synthesized deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) exhibit an extremely fast sedimentation rate in neutral sucrose gradients. This fast-sedimenting component (<b>intermediate</b> <b>I)</b> has a sedimentation constant of about 1, 500 S and contains T 7 DNA {{as determined by}} DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that the fast-sedimenting material is metabolically active {{and serves as a}} precursor to the formation of T 7 DNA. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>I</b> contains about 2. 5 to 7 % of the total 3 H-labeled protein formed between 3 and 9. 5 min after T 7 infection.

Three medical oncologists independently reviewed the retrospectively acquired patient data and prospectively made decisions on the theoretically planed treatment for each time point, according to the recommendations of St Gallen Consensus Guidelines 2005.

40|$|A {{replication}} {{complex for}} the vegetative {{synthesis of the}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the temperate phage P 22 previously has been described. This complex is an association of parental phage DNA, most of the newly synthesized phage DNA made during pulses with 3 H-thymidine, and other cell constituents, and has a sedimentation rate in neutral sucrose gradients of at least 1, 000 S. The complex {{is one of the}} <b>intermediates,</b> <b>intermediate</b> <b>I,</b> in the synthesis and maturation of phage P 22 DNA after infection or induction. Evidence supporting the replicative nature of <b>intermediate</b> <b>I</b> is presented. Phage replication is repressed in lysogenic bacteria. On superinfection of P 22 lysogens with nonvirulent phage, little association of the input phage DNA with a rapidly sedimenting fraction is demonstrable. However, after induction with ultraviolet light, the superinfecting parental phage DNA quickly acquires the rapid sedimentation rate characteristic of intermediate I; phage DNA synthesis follows; and progeny phages are produced. Infection with a virulent mutant of P 22 produces progeny phages in lysogens. Its DNA associates with <b>intermediate</b> <b>I.</b> In mixed infection with the virulent phage, replication of nonvirulent phage P 22 is still repressed, even though the virulent replicates normally. The nonvirulent input DNA does not associate with <b>intermediate</b> <b>I.</b> The repressor of the lysogenic cell prevents replication by interfering with the physical association of template material with <b>intermediate</b> <b>I.</b> A phage function is required for association of phage template with the replication machinery...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe role {{of native}} contact {{topology}} in the folding of a TIM barrel model {{based on the}} α-subunit of tryptophan synthase (αTS) from Salmonella typhimurium (Protein Data Bank structure 1 BKS) was studied using both equilibrium and kinetic simulations. Equilibrium simulations of αTS reveal the population of two <b>intermediate</b> ensembles, <b>I</b> 1 and I 2, during unfolding/refolding at the folding temperature, Tf= 335 K. Equilibrium <b>intermediate</b> <b>I</b> 1 demonstrates discrete structure in regions α 0 -β 6 whereas <b>intermediate</b> <b>I</b> 2 is a loose ensemble of states with N-terminal structure varying from at least β 1 -β 3 (denoted I 2 A) to α 0 -β 4 at most (denoted I 2 B). The structures of I 1 and I 2 match well with the two intermediate states detected in equilibrium folding experiments of Escherichia coli αTS. Kinetic folding simulations of αTS reveal the sequential population of four <b>intermediate</b> ensembles, <b>I</b> 120 Q, I 200 Q, I 300 Q, and I 360 Q, during refolding. Kinetic <b>intermediates</b> <b>I</b> 120 Q, I 200 Q, and I 300 Q are highly similar to equilibrium αTS <b>intermediates</b> <b>I</b> 2 A, I 2 B, and I 1, respectively, consistent with kinetic experiments on αTS from E. coli. A small population (∼ 10 %) of kinetic trajectories are trapped in the <b>I</b> 120 Q <b>intermediate</b> ensemble and require a slow and complete unfolding step to properly refold. Both the on-pathway and off-pathway <b>I</b> 120 Q <b>intermediates</b> show structure in β 1 -β 3, which is also strikingly consistent with kinetic folding experiments of αTS. In the off-pathway <b>intermediate</b> <b>I</b> 120 Q, helix α 2 is wrapped in a nonnative chiral arrangement around strand β 3, sterically preventing the subsequent folding step between β 3 and β 4. These results demonstrate the success of combining kinetic and equilibrium simulations of minimalist protein models to explore TIM barrel folding and the folding of other large proteins...|$|R
40|$|Physiological {{properties}} of the murG gene product of Escherichia coli were investigated. The inactivation of the murG gene rapidly inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis in exponentially growing cells. As a result, various alterations of cell shape are observed, and cell lysis finally occurs when the peptidoglycan content is 40 % {{lower than that of}} normally growing cells. Analysis of the pools of peptidoglycan precursors reveals the concomitant accumulation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) and, to a lesser extent, that of undecaprenyl-pyrophosphoryl-MurNAc-pentapeptide (lipid <b>intermediate</b> <b>I),</b> indicating that inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis occurs after formation of the cytoplasmic precursors. The relative depletion of the second lipid intermediate, undecaprenyl-pyrophosphoryl-MurNAc-(pentapeptide) GlcNAc, shows that inactivation of the murG gene product does not prevent the formation of lipid <b>intermediate</b> <b>I</b> but inhibits the next reaction in which GlcNAc is transferred to lipid <b>intermediate</b> <b>I.</b> In vitro assays for phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase and N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase activities finally confirm the identification of the murG gene product as the transferase that catalyzes the conversion of lipid <b>intermediate</b> <b>I</b> to lipid <b>intermediate</b> II in the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway.

The reaction of C 500 S containing a vacant type I copper center produced <b>intermediate</b> <b>I</b> in an EPR-silent peroxide-bound form.

Reactions of the recombinant CueO and E 506 Q afforded intermediate II, a fully oxidized form different from the resting one, with a very broad EPR signal, g < 2, detectable only at cryogenic temperatures and unsaturated with high power microwaves.

Substitutions of Glu 463 with Gln or Ala were attributed to virtually complete loss or significant reduction in enzymatic activities due to an inhibition of the proton transfer steps to dioxygen. The single turnover reaction of the Glu 463 Gln mutant afforded the highly magnetically interacted intermediate II (native intermediate) with a broad g = 1. 96 electron paramagnetic resonance signal detectable at cryogenic temperatures. Reactions of the double mutants, Cys 457 Ser/Glu 463 Gln and Cys 457 Ser/Glu 463 Ala afforded the <b>intermediate</b> <b>I</b> (peroxide <b>intermediate)</b> because the type I copper center to donate the fourth electron to dioxygen was vacant {{in addition to the}} interference of proton transport due to the mutation at Glu 463.

Dimeric forms relative abundance varies during cell growth {{and in response to}} environmental changes, suggesting that each dimer plays different physiological roles. Unlike other HU proteins which melt through a single step (N 2 2 D), E. coli dimers melt according to a two-step mechanism (N 2 I 2 2 D). The native dimer, N 2, melts partially into a dimeric <b>intermediate,</b> <b>I</b> 2, which in turn yields the unfolded monomers, D.

Our objective {{was to determine the}} cost of supportive treatment/care for patients with low and <b>intermediate</b> <b>I</b> risk myelodysplastic syndrome in respect to private healthcare plans in Brazil. METHOD: We adapted the National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment guidelines for intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients to the Brazilian reality, adopting a decision tree to explore treatment combinations. Then, we calculated the costs for each branch of the tree, according to national prices. We also estimated total costs for a cohort of 100 patients, distributed across treatment combinations according to the expected epidemiology. We assumed a horizon of one year of treatment. RESULTS: The mean cost of treatment for low and <b>intermediate</b> <b>I</b> risk myelodysplastic {{syndrome is}} US$ 42, 758 /patient/year. This cost can vary from US$ 24, 282 to US$ 121, 952, according to patient characteristics and the treatment used.

40|$|An {{unresolved}} {{issue of}} peroxidase activity {{is the role}} played by the hydrogen bond between the proximal histidine ligand and a highly conserved aspartate group. It has been postulated that this hydrogen bond imparts imidazolate character to the axial ligand, increasing its donating ability and stabilizing the high valent compound <b>I</b> <b>intermediate.</b> A general feature of biological compound <b>I</b> <b>intermediates</b> is that they display weaker spin couplings than model systems. To understand how the Asp-His hydrogen bond affects the electronic structure of the compound <b>I</b> <b>intermediate</b> and to establish a connection between it and the decreased coupling strengths observed in peroxidases, we have perfomed density functional calculations on imidazole- and imidazolate-ligated perferryl porphyrin species. It was found that the imidazolate compound <b>I</b> <b>intermediate</b> possesses an imidazolate-based radical, while the imidazole compound <b>I</b> <b>intermediate</b> possesses a porphyrin-based radical. Delocalizaton of the radical onto the axial ligand was found to reduce the strength of the spin coupling...|$|R
