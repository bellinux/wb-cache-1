40|$|A common {{industrial}} ventilation and pollution problem results when a thermally buoyant polluted plume of air must be exhausted {{away from a}} work area to allow achievement of air pollution standards. Generally, a close fitting <b>canopy</b> <b>hood</b> {{is one of the}} most effective means of exhaust containment; however, physical restrictions or the operation itself often prevent such an arrangement, and a hood located to the side of the operation is required. This arrangement requires the exhaust to bend and contain the vertically rising plume with a horizontal sweep of exhaust air across the surface of the operation. A review of available literature revealed a lack of the necessary theory and data needed to design a side draft hood based on plume dynamics. The purpose of this study, then, is to develop the theory relating the side draft hood size and required exhaust volume to the hot source characteristics and to test the theory in the laboratory...|$|E

40|$|One form of waterproof, {{breathable}} apparel is manufactured from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane {{laminated fabric}} using a specific process to seal seams {{that have been}} sewn with traditional techniques. The sealing process involves applying waterproof tape to the seam by feeding the seam through two rollers while applying hot air (600 20 C). This study addressed the potential for exposure to particulate matter from this sealing process by characterizing airborne particles in a facility that produces more than 1000 lightweight PTFE rain jackets per day. Aerosol concentrations throughout the facility were mapped, breathing zone concentrations were measured, and hoods used to ventilate the seam sealing operation were evaluated. The geometric mean (GM) particle number concentrations were substantially greater in the sewing and sealing areas (67, 000 and 188, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23)) compared with that measured in the office area (12, 100 particles cm 2 ? 23). Respirable mass concentrations were negligible throughout the facility (GM = 0. 002 mg m 2 ? 23) in the sewing and sealing areas). The particles exiting the final discharge of the facility's ventilation system were dominated by nanoparticles (number median diameter = 25 nm; geometric standard deviation of 1. 39). The breathing zone particle number concentrations of the workers who sealed the sewn seams were highly variable and significantly greater when sealing seams than when conducting other tasks (p < 0. 0001). The sealing workers' breathing zone concentrations ranged from 147, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23 to 798, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23, and their seam responsibility significantly influenced their breathing zone concentrations (p = 0. 03). The finding that particle number concentrations were approximately equal outside the hood and inside the local exhaust duct indicated poor effectiveness of the <b>canopy</b> <b>hoods</b> used to ventilate sealing operations.

The case- 2 (flange attached + double hood) can be improved in terms of collection performance, but {{is expected to increase}} in hood static pressure by about 70 % more than the existing structure, so it was shown that its site applicability is not good. It is judged that the shape of case- 3 (flange attached + double cone attached) is most suitable to improve the suction efficiency.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of engineering controls {{for the production}} or use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was investigated at two facilities. These controls assessments are necessary to evaluate {{the current status of}} control performance and to develop proper control strategies for these workplaces. The control systems evaluated in these studies included ventilated enclosures, exterior hoods, and exhaust filtration systems. Activity-based monitoring with direct-reading instruments and filter sampling for microscopy analysis were used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} control measures at study sites. Our study results showed that weighing CNTs inside the biological safety cabinet can have a 37 % reduction on the particle concentration in the worker's breathing zone, and produce a 42 % lower area concentration outside the enclosure. The ventilated enclosures used to reduce fugitive emissions from the production furnaces exhibited good containment characteristics when closed, but they failed to contain emissions effectively when opened during product removal/harvesting. The exhaust filtration systems employed for exhausting these ventilated enclosures did not provide promised collection efficiencies for removing engineered nanomaterials from furnace exhaust. The exterior hoods were found to be a challenge for controlling emissions from machining nanocomposites: the downdraft hood effectively contained and removed particles released from the manual cutting process, but using the <b>canopy</b> <b>hood</b> for powered cutting of nanocomposites created 15 %- 20 % higher ultrafine (< 500 nm) particle concentrations at the source and at the worker's breathing zone. The microscopy analysis showed that CNTs can only be found at production sources but not at the worker breathing zones during the tasks monitored.

40|$|This work strived to {{increase}} knowledge of assessing airborne nanoparticles {{in the workplace}} by characterizing nanoparticle concentrations in a workplace using direct-reading instruments, evaluating a DC 2000 CE diffusion charger, {{and the creation of}} a personal diffusion battery (pDB). Direct-reading instruments were used with aerosol mapping and task monitoring to evaluate airborne nanoparticle concentrations in an apparel company that produces waterproof jackets composed of polytetrafluoroethylene membrane laminated fabric. Jacket production required that sewn seams be sealed with waterproof tape applied with hot air (600 °C). Particle number concentrations were greater in the sewing and sealing areas than the office area while respirable mass was negligible throughout the facility. The breathing zone particle number concentrations of the workers who sealed the sewn seams were highly variable and significantly greater when sealing seams than when conducting other tasks (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). The effectiveness of the <b>canopy</b> <b>hoods</b> used to ventilate sealing operations was poor. These measurements support the idea that work places were hot processes are conducted may have substantially greater concentrations of airborne nanoparticles than background measurements even with control measures in place. Laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate a commercially available diffusion charger, the DC 2000 CE, that measures nanoparticle surface area concentration. The surface area concentrations of unimodal and multimodal polydispersed aerosols measured by the DC 2000 CE were less than the surface area concentrations measured by the reference instruments. The differences in results were attributed to a difference of measuring active versus geometric surface area concentration and the design of the DC 2000 CE. The maximum measurable active surface area concentration (2, 500 mm 2 m- 3) was found to be greater than the manufacturer stated maximum (1000 mm 2 m- 3). Moving or vibrating a DC 2000 CE while taking measurements can cause the appearance of increased surface area concentration results. The DC 2000 CE has limitations that must be acknowledged when using the DC 2000 CE to measure airborne nanoparticle surface area concentrations in a workplace. A four stage pDB (3. 2 kg) composed of a screen-type diffusion battery, solenoid valve system, and an electronic controller was developed. The pDB was combined with a CPC and a data inversion was created that could be used to solve for the number median diameter, geometric standard deviation, and particle number concentration of a unimodal distribution. The pDB+CPC with inversion was evaluated using unimodal propylene torch exhaust and incense exhaust. For particle number concentration of particles with diameters less than 100 nm, the pDB+CPC with inversion results were between 86...|$|R

40|$|Background: Stress {{places a}} {{metabolic}} burden on homeostasis and {{is linked to}} heightened sympathetic activity, increased energy expenditure and pathology. The yogic state is a hypometabolic state that corresponds with mind-body coherence and reduced stress. This study aimed to investigate metabolic responses to stress and different yoga practices in regular yoga practitioners (YP), non-yoga practitioners (NY) and metabolic syndrome patients (MS). Methods: YP (n = 16), NY (n = 15) and MS (n = 15) subjects underwent an experimental protocol that comprised of different 5 -minute interventions including mental arithmetic stress test (MAST), alternate nostril breathing (ANB), Kapabhati breathing (KB) and meditation (Med) interspersed with 5 minutes of quiet resting (neutral condition (NC)). During the intervention periods continuous body weight adjusted oxygen consumption (VO 2 ml/min/kg) was measured using open circuit indirect calorimetry with a <b>canopy</b> <b>hood.</b> Results: This is the first study to report oxygen consumption (OC) in yoga practitioners during and after MAST {{and the first to}} report both within and between different populations. The results were analysed with SPSS 16 using 3 X 9 mixed factorial ANOVAs. The single between-subject factor was group (YP, NY and MS), the single within-subject factor was made up of the nine intervention phases (NC 1, MAST, NC 2, ANB, NC 3, KB, NC 4, Med, NC 5). The results demonstrated that the regular YP group had significantly less OC and greater variability in their OC across all phases compared to the MS group (p =. 003) and NY group (p =. 01). All groups significantly raised their OC during the mental arithmetic stress, however the MS group had a significantly blunted post-stress recovery whereas the YP group rapidly recovered back to baseline levels with post stress recovery being greater than either the NY group or MS group...|$|E
40|$|Evacuation {{systems in}} {{steelmaking}} plants {{contribute to the}} security of the operators around the furnace and help to gain the emission levels stated in the environmental regulations, furthermore {{play a major role in}} the mass and heat balance of the factory. The aim of the dissertation is to study both primary and secondary emission capture systems of an electric arc furnace steelmaking plant by means of 3 D computational thermal fluid dynamics calculations. The overall performance of the post-combustion chamber, and consequently the primary line, is controlled by the size of the gap downstream the fourth hole of an electric are furnace. The impact of the opening coefficient (ratio between the gap area and the total area) on the post-combustion chamber performance has been investigated by means of a comprehensive 3 D steady CFD simulation comprising radiative heat exchanges and detailed chemical reactions. It was found that there is not a unique value of the opening coefficient capable of optimizing all the relevant quantities of the evacuation process. A value of the opening coefficient in the range 0. 40 - 0. 52 appears advisable. The impact of the (mostly unknown) boundary conditions was also assessed and inefficiencies of the assumed post-combustion geometry have been highlighted. The secondary line's capturing efficiency during the charging phase was simulated with both transient and steady-state solvers with different turbulent models, namely the standard k-e and the Large Eddy Simulation models. The results revealed that steady-state simulations provide sufficient information for designing and optimizing the geometry of the secondary capture system. The simulations also pointed out several geometries, which cause significant pressure drop and, as a result, diminish capturing ability of the <b>canopy</b> <b>hood</b> and the additional evacuation system. The boundary conditions were imposed with the help of experimental measurements in the simulated steelmaking factory...|$|E

40|$|Possibly the world's first {{research}} on breathing problems among snow crab processing workers {{took place in}} Newfoundland in the 1970 's. Preventing/mitigating these problems {{is of paramount importance}} as the snow crab industry is a major contributor to the regional economy in rural Newfoundland and Labrador communities. Crab asthma is caused by overexposure to the dusts, mists, fumes or aerosols that are generated during various processes. During these processes, proteins in the crab may become airborne and can enter the lungs and breathing tubes. A recent study suggests that very low levels of allergen will need to be achieved in crab processing plants to prevent respiratory symptoms from occurring among sensitized workers. Prior to the study described in this report, there had been no air sampling of allergen levels in snow crab processing plants in Newfoundland and Labrador. Air sampling has been carried out in four crab processing plants in Newfoundland and Labrador to identify the problematic areas. Allergen contamination concentrations have been identified and related to specific areas of the processing plants and to the individual processes themselves. [...] A variety of ventilation methods have been examined with local exhausting of the workplace comprising the majority of the investigated techniques. Centerline velocity profiles for overhead, slotted, and <b>canopy</b> local exhaust <b>hoods</b> proposed in previous research have been examined. Numerical modeling of the cleaning, sawing, and batch cooling processes was carried out in both an idealistic and realistic plant domain to determine the airflow patterns in and around these individual processes, as well as determining possible capture velocities from imposed velocity profiles. Velocity profiles have been obtained for the space {{in the vicinity of the}} hood face rather than just along the centerline.
