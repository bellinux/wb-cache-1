5|$|The <b>Curia</b> of Other Municipalities {{consisted}} of 8764 electors from amongst small-scale rural landowners. There were {{two stages of}} voting for this <b>curia.</b> In the first stage, the suffrage was determined {{in the same manner}} as with the <b>Curia</b> of the Cities: those in the two-thirds highest tax bracket, with a high level of education, or an important office, were eligible. These voters elected the electors, who then elected seventy-four deputies to the Diet, each holding a constituency equivalent to a rural district.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{citizens}} were organized into {{three types of}} voting units: curiae, centuria, and tribus or tribes. These corresponded to three different kinds of assemblies: the Curiate Assembly, the Centuriate Assembly, and the Tribal Assembly. Each unit (<b>curia,</b> century or tribe) cast one vote before their assembly. The majority of individual votes in any century, tribe, or <b>curia</b> decided how that unit voted.|$|E
5|$|The electors {{were then}} told {{to break up}} the Convention and {{assemble}} into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar. The baskets that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted the ballots, and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any <b>Curia,</b> Tribe, or Century decided how that <b>Curia,</b> Tribe, or Century voted. Each <b>Curia,</b> Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.|$|E

As the Republic continued, the <b>curiae</b> grew too large to meet conveniently at the <b>Curiae</b> Veteres, and a new meeting place, the <b>Curiae</b> Novae, was constructed. A few of the <b>curiae</b> continued to meet at the <b>Curiae</b> Veteres due to specific religious obligations.|$|R

The practice of accepting or inviting amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs or submissions has {{been included in}} the rules of procedure and evidence of the ICTY, the ICTR, the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the International Criminal Court. This article examines the role of amicus <b>curiae</b> before international criminal courts, including: how and when amicus are granted permission to appear; how amicus <b>curiae</b> are used by these international courts; the influence, if any, of amicus briefs on decisions and judgments; and whether the role of amicus <b>curiae</b> in international criminal courts has diverged from the traditional concept of an amicus <b>curiae.</b> Also considered are the arguments in support of the continued role of amicus <b>curiae</b> before international criminal tribunals...|$|R

40|$|The {{past several}} decades have {{witnessed}} a remarkable {{increase in the number}} of amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs filed at the U. S. Supreme Court. While scholars debate the effectiveness of amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs, they generally agree on the effectiveness of briefs filed by executive attorneys. A plethora of studies address the amicus <b>curiae</b> brief activity of the solicitor general, but relatively few examine state attorneys general. State attorneys general are the legal representatives of the states and have become increasingly successful as amici since the early 1980 s. I explore state attorney general amicus <b>curiae</b> brief activity and argue that existing theories of amicus <b>curiae</b> participation by the solicitor general and interest groups, are inadequate for state attorneys general because of the unique institutional context in which state attorneys general operate. State attorneys general, I argue, must balance political, legal, and administrative factors when filing amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs. I also recognizes that amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs are not a singular event and are instead a process in which actors make several decisions across a variety of contexts. Within each context each factor takes on a different weight. I conclude state attorneys general are strategic political actors who consider political, legal, and administrative factors in their amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs...|$|R
50|$|An amicus <b>curiae</b> (literally, {{friend of}} the court; plural, amici <b>curiae)</b> is {{someone who is not}} a party to a case and is not {{solicited}} by a party, but who assists a court by offering information that bears on the case. The decision on whether to admit the information lies at the discretion of the court. The phrase amicus <b>curiae</b> is legal Latin.|$|R

It is incumbent upon arbitration tribunals to allow these issues to be raised in connection to the dispute so that the procedural and substantive requirements to file leave for amicus <b>curiae</b> can be undertaken.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{founding}} of the republic, the Centuriate Assembly became the principle Roman assembly in which magistrates were elected, laws were passed, and trials occurred. During his Consulship in 509 BC, Publius Valerius Publicola enacted a law (the lex Valeria) which guaranteed due process rights to every Roman citizen. Any condemned citizen could evoke his right of Provocatio, which appealed any condemnation to the Centuriate Assembly, and which was a precursor to habeas corpus. Also around this time, the Plebeians assembled into an informal Plebeian Curiate Assembly, which was the original Plebeian Council. Since they were organized {{on the basis of the}} <b>Curia</b> (and thus by clan), they remained dependent on their Patrician patrons. In 471 BC, a law was passed due to the efforts of the Tribune Volero Publilius, which allowed the Plebeians to organize by Tribe, rather than by <b>Curia.</b> Thus, the Plebeian Curiate Assembly became the Plebeian Tribal Assembly, and the Plebeians became politically independent.|$|E
5|$|The Exchequer of Pleas or Court of Exchequer was a {{court that}} dealt with matters of equity, a set of legal {{principles}} based on natural law and common law in England and Wales. Originally part of the <b>curia</b> regis, or King's Council, the Exchequer of Pleas split from the <b>curia</b> during the 1190s, to sit as an independent, central court. The Court of Chancery's reputation for tardiness and expense resulted in much of its business transferring to the Exchequer. The Exchequer and Chancery, with similar jurisdictions, drew closer together over the years, until an argument was made during the 19th century that having two seemingly identical courts was unnecessary. As a result, the Exchequer lost its equity jurisdiction. With the Judicature Acts, the Exchequer was formally dissolved as a judicial body by an Order in Council of 16December 1880.|$|E

40|$|Submitting amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs is a mean {{by which}} {{non-governmental}} organisations (NGOs) can influence {{procedures in the}} WTO. In those briefs, NGOs present facts and ideas concerning a dispute. A panel or the appellate body may take the briefs into consideration or disregard them. This essay examines cases from which amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs in the WTO have developed, including {{an analysis of the}} legal reasoning made by panels and the appellate body.   The conclusion of this essay, de lege lata, is that amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs can be considered by panels because of their right to “seek information” under article 13 DSU. The same rule does not apply for procedures in the appellate body and there is no similar rule that can be applied in the same way. Thus, the acceptance of amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs in the appellate body is questionable.   Furthermore, I conclude, de lege ferenda, that amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs should not be allowed in the appellate body because of its character of being a superior instance. However, amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs are useful for procedures in panels and should continue to be allowed...|$|R

5|$|This {{system of}} limited {{suffrage}} caused the predominantly Polish landowning class {{to dominate the}} Diet. Whilst they only made up about 0.4% of the population, they held 28.2% of {{the seats in the}} Diet. Small-scale rural landowners, on the other hand, made up about 95% of the population, but held only 52.3% of the seats in Diet. This system also skewed representation for different ethnicities in the Diet. Whilst Ruthenians made up about 40% of the population of Galicia, they only held 15% of the seats in the Diet, as they lived primarily in rural communities. Reform of the suffrage system in late 1913 added a fifth <b>curia</b> for the upper peasantry, which had the right to elect twenty deputies. Due to the outbreak of the First World War, no further elections to the Diet took place, and hence the fifth <b>curia</b> existed only on paper.|$|E

Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the <b>Curia</b> at the time as a pagan redoubt.|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{debate over}} the use of amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs at the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) raises interesting questions about the influence of the U.

Comparing the controversy regarding the use of amicus <b>curiae</b> briefs before WTO Panels and the Appellate Body with the history and evolution of the institution of amicus <b>curiae</b> before the U.

5|$|Henry's {{itinerant}} royal court comprised various parts. At {{the heart}} was Henry's domestic household, called the domus; a wider grouping was termed the familia regis, and formal gatherings {{of the court}} were termed <b>curia.</b> The domus was divided into several parts. The chapel, headed by the chancellor, looked after the royal documents, the chamber dealt with financial affairs and the master-marshal was responsible for travel and accommodation. The familia regis included Henry's mounted household troops, up to several hundred strong, who came from {{a wider range of}} social backgrounds, and could be deployed across England and Normandy as required. Initially Henry continued his father's practice of regular crown-wearing ceremonies at his <b>curia,</b> but they became less frequent as the years passed. Henry's court was grand and ostentatious, financing the construction of large new buildings and castles with a range of precious gifts on display, including the King's private menagerie of exotic animals, which he kept at Woodstock Palace. Despite being a lively community, Henry's court was more tightly controlled than those of previous kings. Strict rules controlled personal behaviour and prohibited members of the court from pillaging neighbouring villages, as had been the norm under William Rufus.|$|E

Within the court were his officials, ministeriales, his friends, amici, and the familiares regis, the king's informal inner circle of confidants and trusted servants. Henry's familiares were particularly important to the operation of his household and government, driving government initiatives and filling the gaps between the official structures and the king.|$|E
