30|$|In this paper, a load <b>curve</b> <b>smoothing</b> {{strategy}} {{based on}} a unified state model of different DSRs is developed for the demand response. Based on the state models of different DSRs, a unified state model is first developed to describe the response characteristics of the DSRs with a unified mathematical expression. Then, a load <b>curve</b> <b>smoothing</b> strategy using the unified state model is proposed to coordinate different types of DSRs to smooth the power fluctuations caused by the DGs. A control matrix is introduced to manage the power outputs of different DSRs, where the comfort levels of the power consumers and the response order are considered. The power fluctuation rate is introduced as an indicator to evaluate the load power variations of the tie-line in a residential region. The unified state model in the proposed load <b>curve</b> <b>smoothing</b> strategy can determine the real-time response capacity and the response states {{of different types of}} DSRs, and the complexity for managing large quantities of DSRs is significantly reduced. Compared with the existing researches, comparative studies show that the unified state model based load <b>curve</b> <b>smoothing</b> strategy takes better advantage of the response characteristics of different types of DSRs and has a better smoothing control effect.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the unified}} state model, the power {{fluctuations}} of the tie-line of the residential region are effectively decreased with the load <b>curve</b> <b>smoothing</b> control.

30|$|Renewable energy based {{distributed}} generation (DG) {{has the potential}} to reach high penetration levels in the residential region. However, its integration at the demand side will cause rapid power fluctuations of the tie-line in the residential region. The traditional generators are generally difficult to manage rapid power fluctuations due to their insufficient efficiency requirements and low responding speed. With an effective control strategy, the demand side resources (DSRs) including DGs, electric vehicles and thermostatically-controlled loads at the demand side, are able to serve as the energy storage system to smooth the load fluctuations. However, it is a challenge to properly model different types of DSRs. To solve this problem, a unified state model is first developed to describe the characteristics of different DSRs. Then a load <b>curve</b> <b>smoothing</b> strategy is proposed to offset the load fluctuations of the tie-line of the residential region, where a control matrix deduced from the unified state model is introduced to manage the power outputs of different DSRs, considering the response order and the comfort levels. Finally, a residential region with households is used to validate the load <b>curve</b> <b>smoothing</b> strategy based on the unified state model, and the results show that the power fluctuation rate of the tie-line is significantly decreased. Meanwhile, comparative study results are shown to demonstrate the advantages of the unified state model based load <b>curve</b> <b>smoothing</b> strategy.|$|E
