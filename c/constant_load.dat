40|$|The {{study of}} {{failure of a}} rock under <b>constant</b> <b>loading</b> is {{essential}} to the design and construction of excavations in the rock for mines, tunnels, and nuclear waste repositories. The <b>constant</b> <b>loading</b> test on granite with acoustic emission monitoring clearly shows the progressive damage process. The inelastic volumetric strain is proportional to cumulative acoustic emission counts, which indicate that the damage within granite is attributed to micro-cracking or micro-fracturing within granite. Three creep phases can be determined more easily from the cumulative acoustic emission count. Source location analysis also shows the progressive damage process under <b>constant</b> <b>loading.</b> During primary creep, cracks distribute randomly and then cluster into several nucleation zones. During secondary creep, some clusters become more active while others decay off. During tertiary creep, the activities of the active cluster become stronger until the sample fails. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, the {{existence}} of crack closure and its sufficiency for crack growth prediction is investigated by multi-resolution in-situ optical microscopy experiment and SEM experiment. In in-situ optical microscopy testing, the digital image correlation analysis is {{used to measure the}} plastic zone size in front of the crack tip. In in-situ SEM testing, the crack tip opening displacement and the crack growth kinetics are investigated. Besides, crack closure behavior under <b>constant</b> <b>loading</b> with a single overload is studied in in-situ SEM test. This experimental methodology is applied to two different metallic materials (aluminum alloys and steels). Detailed imaging analysis and experimental results are presented and compared. It is found that first, there exists crack closure phenomena for aluminum alloys, but not for steels in our current researches; second, the crack closure will significantly change the crack tip plasticity behavior; third, the crack closure concept is able to account for crack growth kinetics uniquely for <b>constant</b> <b>loading,</b> but it is insufficient for <b>constant</b> <b>loading</b> with a single overload. Finally, the necessarily and the insufficiency of crack closure for crack growth prediction is discussed...|$|R
