The effects of <b>cocoa</b> <b>hulls</b> on clayey and sandy ferrallitic soils were monitored during their decomposition trough incubations {{to study the}} interest of their use in soil fertilization. Two quantities of hulls: 1. 39 g and 2. 78 g which corresponded to 5 g C. kg- 1 (D 5) and 10 g C. kg- 1 (D 10) respectively, were brought to 100 g of each soil and compared to the non-amended control soil (D 0). The experimental design was in Fischer blocks with six treatments and three replications. Carbon (C) mineralization and soil chemical parameters were measured. Results showed that <b>cocoa</b> <b>hulls</b> significantly influenced C mineralization. It increased significantly with D 5 and decreased with D 10 {{as compared to the}} control. Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) varied from 3. 94 to 5. 65 cmolc. kg- 1 with D 5 and 5. 19 to 6. 31 cmolc. kg- 1 with D 10 and the sum of exchangeable bases varied from 3. 13 to 4. 14 cmol. kg- 1 with D 5 and 6. 52 to 7. 27 cmol. kg- 1 with D 10. Soil texture influenced significantly C mineralization, CEC and the sum of exchangeable bases with higher values obtained with clayey soils than with sandy soils. The study showed that <b>cocoa</b> <b>hulls</b> can be used to improve soil chemical characteristics, thereby soil fertilization in the Oumé region. However, the quantity must be controlled since there exists a threshold beyond which C mineralization is inhibited. Further studies should be undertaken with the aim to determine this threshold...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to present a possible use of roasted <b>cocoa</b> <b>hulls,</b> which currently represents an industrial surplus in the grain processing industries, and is sold with companies that produce concentrates for animals. On daily processing plants will produce about 4 tons of roasted cocoa peel, this would be a great source to produce fiber for human consumption. The present investigation was consist in obtaining raw fiber from roasted cocoa peel, and through specific laboratory tests to assess their possible use for human consumption, thus able to incorporate this product into the production process. In relation to the environment, minimize the impact of the production process, because it would be taking advantage of a normal by product of production, which elsewhere is a waste that could be coming to the landfill, creating a burden on the soil resource and that despite biodegradable, while decomposition is classified as a contaminant of this medium...|$|E

40|$|Avaliaram-se os efeitos da adição de 15 % de casca de café, farelo de cacau ou farelo de mandioca, com base na matéria natural (peso/peso), à forragem verde de capim-elefante no momento da ensilagem sobre o consumo de nutrientes e o desempenho de 20 ovinos Santa Inês em confinamento. Os animais tinham 5 meses de idade, peso inicial de 22, 27 ± 3, 24 kg e o peso final foi de 28, 6 ± 3, 78 kg. Utilizou-se um delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente ao acaso, com quatro tratamentos e cinco repetições. Os tratamentos foram: capim-elefante ensilado sem aditivo ou ensilado com 15 % de casca de café, farelo de cacau ou farelo de mandioca. A utilização da casca de café, do farelo de cacau e do farelo de mandioca na ensilagem de capim-elefante aumentou o consumo de matéria seca. Os maiores consumos de proteína bruta foram observados nas silagens contendo farelo de cacau e farelo de mandioca. Os consumos de fibra em detergente neutro foram semelhantes e o consumo de nutrientes digestíveis totais foi maior na silagem contendo farelo de mandioca. A conversão alimentar dos animais não foi afetada pela inclusão dos aditivos na ensilagem. A inclusão de farelo de mandioca na ensilagem de capim-elefante aumenta o ganho de peso (140, 5 g/dia) em ovinos Santa Inês. The {{effects of}} the addition of 15 % of different addictives (coffee <b>hulls,</b> <b>cocoa</b> meal and cassava meal) to green elephant grass forage, in natural matter basis (weight/weight), at the ensilage moment on the consumption of nutrients {{and the performance of}} twenty Santa Inês sheep under feedlot system were evaluated. The animals had 5. 0 months of age, initial weight of 22. 27 ± 3. 24 kg and final weight of 28. 6 ± 3. 78 kg. The treatments were: T 1 = elephant grass ensiled without addictive; T 2 = elephant grass ensiled with 15 % coffee hulls; T 3 = elephant grass ensiled with 15 % cocoa meal; T 4 = elephant grass ensiled with 15 % cassava meal. The use of the addictives coffee <b>hulls,</b> <b>cocoa</b> meal and cassava meal in elephant grass ensilage increased the dry matter intake. The greatest crude protein intakes were observed with silage containing cocoa meal and cassava meal. Neutral detergent fiber intakes were similar, and the total digestible nutrients intake was higher in silage containing cassava bran. The feed conversion rate of the animals was not affected by the inclusion of addictives in ensilage. Diet containing elephant grass ensiled with cassava meal showed higher weight gain along the period and per day, however, no difference was observed in the feed conversion rate. The addition of cassava meal in ensilage of elephant grass provided weight gain of 140. 5 g/day in Santa Inês sheep...|$|R
40|$|Publisher Summary Studies using a mixed fiber diet have {{emphasized}} the strong impact of dietary fibers (DF) on gut microbiota. As an example, a high-fiber diet containing 40 % soya cake, 20 % crude potato starch, 19 % wheat bran, and 5 % each of apple pectin and carob gum, given for 4 weeks to rats, led to a daily fecal output of anaerobes 71 times higher than a fiber-free diet. Similarly, daily excretion of total fermentation products was 20 times higher, with an increase of propionate and butyrate proportions. It is estimated that apples could provide 10 %– 30 % of the daily intake of fiber. Using a diet containing 100 g of apple fiber/kg, {{it has been shown}} that soluble dietary fiber (SDF) excreted in feces of rats was 10. 9 % of the SDF ingested, which suggests a low resistance to fermentation of this fraction, while only 43 % of the ingested insoluble fiber was fermented. The effects of five DF from different sources (carrot, wheat bran, <b>cocoa</b> seed, pea <b>hull,</b> and oat husks) have been assessed in human microbiota-associated (HMA) rats. HMA rats are initially germ-free rats colonized after weaning with the fecal microbiota of a healthy human volunteer. Use of this animal model is justified by the phylogenetic and metabolic differences between rats and human microbiota and the knowledge that HMA rodents globally retain the characteristics of the human donor microbiota. All of the diets contained 100 g fiber/kg and were given for 8 weeks. Both carrot and cocoa led to a higher proportion of acetate and a lower proportion of propionate in the cecum, and to a large production of methane. The concentration of lactate was significantly higher in rats fed on the carrot-fiber diet...|$|R
