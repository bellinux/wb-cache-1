One sits on the forward edge of the <b>cushion</b> or <b>mat</b> in order to incline one's pelvis forward, making it possible to center the spine and provide the necessary support. Only the most flexible people can achieve this asana without a support under their pelvis (and likewise does the Dalai Lama explicitly advise).|$|R

40|$|There is {{very little}} {{research}} on the sport of wrestling, despite the high physical and mental demands. There is {{a high risk of}} injury with the sport, with the knee being the most common site of injury. This study compares the effectiveness of wearing a thick knee pad, a thin knee pad, and no knee pad during a wrestling penetration shot on knee impact forces. A penetration shot is a very common movement in the sport and one that is regularly practiced during a training session. The motion involves stepping forward with one leg, striking the knee of that leg to the ground, and following through with the trail leg into a standing position. This study was completed in the Biomechanics Lab and involved video tracking of markers on the right leg and a force platform to measure knee impact forces. A <b>cushioned</b> <b>mat</b> was placed over the force platform and participants were asked to perform a penetration shot with the knee striking over the force platform. Vertical and anterior/posterior ground reaction forces were recorded using Vicon Nexus 1. 8. 5 software. Maximum knee impact forces and rates of loading with the two knee pads and no knee pad will be compared...|$|R
50|$|Azorella macquariensis is a {{perennial}} cushion-forming herb. Individuals form <b>cushions</b> and <b>mats</b> that may vary {{in size from}} a few centimetres to several metres in diameter and up to 60 cm in height. It is a keystone species dominating Macquarie's feldmark habitat, {{in which it is}} the only vascular plant, forming a major structural component of the vegetation. The feldmark community covers about half the island in the most wind-exposed areas of the plateau some 200-400 m above sea level. The plant flowers from December to February and fruits from January to April. It turns brown and ceases to grow during winter (from June to August).|$|R
60|$|It was in silence, accordingly, that Theodorick {{motioned to}} the Scot {{to take his place}} on one of the low chairs, while Sheerkohf placed himself, after the custom of his nation, upon a <b>cushion</b> of <b>mats.</b> The hermit then held up both hands, as if blessing the {{refreshment}} which he had placed before his guests, and they proceeded to eat in silence as profound as his own. To the Saracen this gravity was natural; and the Christian imitated his taciturnity, while he employed his thoughts on the singularity of his own situation, and the contrast betwixt the wild, furious gesticulations, loud cries, and fierce actions of Theodorick, when they first met him, and the demure, solemn, decorous assiduity with which he now performed the duties of hospitality.|$|R
5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto <b>cushioned</b> landing <b>mats.</b> The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|R

A few rich settles and bancals, choicely carved and decorated with glazed leather hangings of the sort termed or basane, completed the furniture of the apartment, save that at one side of the dais there stood a lofty perch, upon which a cast of three solemn Prussian gerfalcons sat, hooded and jesseled, as silent and motionless as the royal fowler who stood beside them.|$|R
50|$|The puna flora is {{characterized}} by its unique assemblages of <b>cushion</b> and <b>mat</b> forming species. Many of these species, most notably the large Azorella compacta (Yareta) has been heavily harvested for fuel and medicinal use. The vegetation with the puna grassland displays complex patterns of spatial variation, despite the low cover and overall density. The puna belt which ranges from wet puna {{in the north of}} the Andes to dry puna to the southwestern Andes is composed mostly by poaceae (Grasses) and shrubs of the asteraceae (daisy) family. Other representative grasses include species Jarava ichu (“Paja Brava”), Calamagrostis vicunarum (“Crespillo”), and Festuca dolichophylla (“Chillihua”).There are several main rock unit formations in the Puna with distinct soil conditions {{that can be used to}} identify the main flora of each area.

40|$|Background & objectives: The common bedbug Cimex lectularius Linnaeus 1758 (Hemiptera:Cimicidae) is a {{globally}} re-emerging pest {{of serious}} public health concern. We investigated bedbuginfestation in randomly selected apartments in Gbajimba community in Guma Local Governmentarea in Benue state, Nigeria. Methods: Beddings and furniture (bed frames, pillows, mattresses, <b>cushion</b> chairs, <b>mats,</b> mosquitonets and bamboo beds) were thoroughly inspected for bedbug infestation using the hand-pickingtechnique. Data were analysed using chi-square analysis {{for differences in}} the infestation levels inharbourages and sampling locations. Results: Only 16 % of the apartments investigated showed no evidence of bedbug infestation asegg cases and faecal marks were sighted in 62. 2 % of apartments surveyed. The highest infestationrate was observed in Angwan Jukun area and infestation here was higher compared to other studylocations within the town though {{the difference was not}} statistically significant ( 2 = 7. 92, df = 6,p > 0. 05). Bamboo beds harboured the highest number of bedbugs collected, accounting for 35. 8 %,while other harbourages like iron bed frames and sleeping mats had 23 and 22. 7 % infestationrates respectively. The infestation rates in these household items were significantly higher thanother items inspected ( 2 = 11. 8, df = 4, p > 0. 05). Interpretation & conclusion: This study demonstrates the urgent need for identification of evidencesof infestation and bedbug management involving community participation in inspection, detectionand education, including physical removal and exclusion as well as pesticide application...|$|R
40|$|Presented at a Special Seminar: MSPO Student Presentations on April 11, 2007 at the Coon Building, Room 115 Runtime: 15 : 55 minutesWheelchair {{cushions}} {{are designed}} to protect skin by reducing and distributing pressure. Pressure sensors and buttock models are used in standardized testing of wheelchair cushions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore how the presence of a thin pressure measurement <b>mat,</b> <b>cushion</b> construction, and buttock model design affect interface pressure (IP), envelopment, and immersion. Aspects reported here are the effect of model design on IP and envelopment and the interaction between model design and cushion construction. Testing was performed with two indenters and seven cushions. Conclusion: Wheelchair cushions deform in response to a loaded indenter. The result is a change in the shape of the indenter-cushion interface, which may not be consistent across loading trials. This is influenced by cushion stiffness and the unloaded shape of the cushion. The data suggests that model design influences the pressure redistribution properties of cushions. Therefore, development of standardized tests should consider the interaction between models and cushions. Stephen Sprigl...|$|R
