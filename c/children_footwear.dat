40|$|The {{theme of}} this paper is "The quality {{assurance}} of the <b>children</b> <b>footwear</b> during production". The objective is the elevation of the difficulty and intensity of the production of the <b>children</b> <b>footwear,</b> but also to find the key for the customer - how to choose the right footwear for the child. Children foot is very sensitive and could be easily damaged during a very short period so having good shoes is really important. First, I will explain the footwear theory, then I will focuse on the czech legislation and finally what the czech producer can do so that the small customer would receive good quality shoes...|$|E

40|$|The {{constitution}} of India, {{as a part}} of the fundamental rights, has laid down that the State shall direct its policy towards protection of childhood and youth against exploitation and shall not be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any hazardous employment. India has the largest number of urban and rural child workers in the world. The Government of India acknowledges at least 17. 5 million working <b>children.</b> 2 <b>Footwear</b> industry is also one of the major export oriented industry employing a large number of <b>children.</b> The <b>Footwear</b> Industry is a significant segment of the Leather Industry in India. India ranks second among the footwear producing countries next to China. The industry is labour intensive and is concentrated in the small and cottage industry sectors. While leather shoes and uppers are concentrated in large-scale units, the sandals and Chappals are produced in the household and cottage sector. The major production centers India are Chennai, Ranipet, Ambur in Tamil Nadu, Mumbai in Maharashtra, Kanpur and Agra in Uttar Pradesh, Jalandhar in Punjab and Delhi. The processes in the footwear making include last making, pattern cutting, clicking, Sewing, Assembling and Finishing. Children between 10 and 15 years old are mainly employed in assembling shoes. Some 80 percent of the children work for contractors at home. Children work on soling (fixing upper portions of shoes to leather or rubber soles) with glue. Children in cramped poorly lit rooms suffer from continuous skin contact with industrial adhesives and breathing vapors from glues. The children working in the footwear industry are exposed to physical factors like poor illumination, noise and poor ventilation, and chemicals like leather dust, benzene that is used as a solvent in glues and p-tert butyl phenols, which is used in neoprene adhesives. Thus most children suffer from respiratory problems, lung diseases and skin infections through constant exposure to glue and fumes. They are also exposed to risk of nasal cancer, neurotoxicity and adverse physical factors. It is recommended to stop child labour and let the child be bread eater rather than bread earner...|$|R
50|$|A recent Cochrane Library {{systematic}} review includes 11 studies investigating {{the effects of}} children’s <b>footwear.</b> <b>Children</b> wearing shoes were found to children walk faster by taking longer steps with greater ankle and knee motion and increased tibialis anterior activity. Shoes were also found to reduce foot motion and increase the support (weight-bearing) phases of the gait cycle. During running, shoes were found to reduce swing (non-weight-bearing) phase leg speed, attenuate some shock, and encourage a rearfoot strike pattern. The long-term effect of these gait changes due to footwear on growth and development are currently unknown. The impact of footwear on gait should be considered when assessing children’s gait and evaluating the effect of shoe or in-shoe interventions.|$|R
30|$|A 2 -year, 4 -month-old Afro-Caribbean boy {{presented}} to our clinic {{with a history}} of abnormal gait and a size discrepancy in the legs noticed by the mother. He was born at term by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery following an uneventful pregnancy. No abnormalities were noted at birth, and he had achieved normal developmental milestones. From the age of 6  months, the patient’s mother noticed that his left leg appeared different to the right; as he grew, it appeared that the right leg grew faster than the left. This difference became more apparent when the child started walking, and the mother noticed the gradual onset of a painless limp and leaning towards the left side. She also noticed a difference {{in the size of the}} feet when the <b>child</b> started using <b>footwear,</b> with the left shoe always being too big for the left foot. At this stage, the mother noticed that the child was occasionally tripping when walking or running and that the lower left leg was much thinner than the right.|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} static footprints of 2300 {{children between}} the ages of four and 13 years to establish the influence of footwear on the prevalence of flat foot. The incidence among <b>children</b> who used <b>footwear</b> was 8. 6 % compared with 2. 8 % in those who did not (p < 0. 001). Significant differences between the predominance in shod and unshed children were noted in all age groups, most marked in those with generalised ligament laxity. Flat foot was most common in children who wore closed-toe shoes, less common in those who wore sandals or slippers, and least in the unshod. Our findings suggest that shoe-wearing in early childhood is detrimental to the development of a normal longitudinal arch. In Europe and America flat foot is a common reason for attendance at a children’s orthopaedic clinic (Sharrard 1979), but in India children are seldom brought for treatment for flat foot. The few children who do attend with this complaint are from affluent urban families and they all wear shoes.

40|$|Abstract Background Wearing {{shoes of}} {{insufficient}} length during childhood {{has often been}} cited as leading to deformities of the foot, particularly {{to the development of}} hallux valgus disorders. Until now, these assumptions have not been confirmed through scientific research. This study aims to investigate whether this association can be statistically proven, and if children who wear shoes of insufficient length actually do have a higher risk of a more pronounced lateral deviation of the hallux. Methods 858 pre-school children were included in the study. The study sample was stratified by sex, urban/rural areas and Austrian province. The hallux angle and the length of the feet were recorded. The inside length of the children's footwear (indoor shoes worn in pre-school and outdoor shoes) were assessed. Personal data and different anthropometric measurements were taken. The risk of hallux valgus deviation was statistically tested by a stepwise logistic regression analysis and the relative risk (odds ratio) for a hallux angle ≥ 4 degrees was calculated. Results Exact examinations of the hallux angle could be conducted on a total of 1, 579 individual feet. Only 23. 9 % out of 1, 579 feet presented a straight position of the great toe. The others were characterized by lateral deviations (valgus position) at different degrees, equalling 10 degrees or greater in 14. 2 % of the children's feet. 88. 8 % of 808 children examined wore indoor footwear that was of insufficient length, and 69. 4 % of 812 children wore outdoor shoes that were too short. A significant relationship was observed between the lengthwise fit of the shoes and the hallux angle: the shorter the shoe, the higher the value of the hallux angle. The relative risk (odds ratio) of a lateral hallux deviation of ≥ 4 degrees in children wearing shoes of insufficient length was significantly increased. Conclusions There is a significant relationship between the hallux angle in <b>children</b> and <b>footwear</b> that is too short in length. The fact {{that the majority of the}} children examined were wearing shoes of insufficient length makes the issue particularly significant. Our results emphasize the importance of ensuring that children's footwear fits properly. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on an orthopedic foot defects by preschoolers and their prevention. The foot is an important executive organ, which fulfill many functions. The main functions of the foot are standing and moving. Equally important function of the foot {{is the ability to}} feel the information about the terrain on which one we are moving. Through receptors located in the foot flows this information constantly into the central nervous system, where are they evaluate together with information from the whole body. On the ground of this information is happening a large number of subsequent complex processes - e. g. correction of the center of gravity, control of the position and of the body movement. Nowadays many <b>children</b> wear inappropriate <b>footwear</b> and they don´t have enough proprioceptive stimuli. As a consequence of this, the foot stops being functional and it can lead to the inception of various orthopedic disorders. Incorrect foot positioning will be reflected in the position of the entire body, since as the foot works across the whole attention to the prevention right in this period of life, as long as the pathological stereotypes are not fixed jet. In the theoretical part have I describes the basic information, that leads {{to the understanding of the}} issue. Here is described the anatomy of the foot, her development and function. Further the work is aimed at acquired orthopedic foot defects, at the possibility of prevention and at the foot examination. The last chapter {{is focused on}} the development of preschooler. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to inform what kind of orthopedic defects children can have. This bachelor thesis also maps out which are the most common defects and suggest preventive arrangements that protect the children against the development of the orthopedic foot defects. In the practical part was the qualitative research executed. In the research were the foot imprints of the preschoolers taken and then were three case studies before and after the therapy evaluated. To collected the data I used an interview to obtain medical history, method of observation and input and output kinesiology analysis. The therapy lasted for ten weeks and was prepared on the basis of sensomotoric stimulation with the elements of the game so that the children manage to keep attention. The results of this bachelor work shows that at all three probands during the exercises the condition of the foots had improved and also the stability of the whole body had improved. This bachelor work could be beneficial to current and future physiotherapists who are interested in this problematic. Furthermore, this work can function as a base for further and more detailed processing of this topic. It could be also applied in the development of education - kinetic methods in kindergartens. Even the parents, that want to prevent the origin of orthopedic disorders at their kids foots, could use this work as an inspiration...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{a global}} public health problem that affects both {{children}} and adults. The consequences and complications of bearing additional mass place {{an enormous amount of}} stress on the human body. Musculoskeletally, the feet must endure this excessive mass throughout the tasks of daily living as the feet are the terminus of the body for both stance and gait. Previous studies have reported that obese children display different foot structural characteristics and generate higher plantar pressures, particularly under the midfoot and forefoot, compared to non-obese children. It has been speculated that these higher plantar pressures may potentially place the feet of obese children at risk of injury, although this notion has not been confirmed. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a shoe to cater for the unique structural and functional characteristics of the obese child and to examine whether the experimental shoe improved the level of shoe fit, comfort and decreased the high forefoot plantar pressures experienced by obese children when walking. To achieve this aim, the thesis was divided into two Experimental Sections, incorporating the development and assessment of the experimental footwear. In Experimental Section 1 foot shape, foot structure and function were evaluated in 437 children (aged 7 - 12 years) attending 27 primary schools in New South Wales to form a database of information regarding the feet of Australian children. Gender and age were found to affect the foot measurements obtained for these children, confirming that children’s feet develop at different rates and proportions. The boys displayed larger foot dimensions compared to the girls and, as anticipated, the older children displayed larger foot dimensions compared to the younger children. When these data were compared to adult foot dimension values they highlighted differences in proportion between adult and children’s feet, indicating the need to develop a children’s shoe last, as shoes manufactured as scaled-down versions of adult shoes will not correctly fit the foot shape of children’s feet. From this normative database the foot dimensions, plantar shape and plantar pressure variables for 45 obese children and 45 age and gender–matched controls were compared to establish the effect of obesity and gender on foot structure and function. The obese children displayed significantly greater values for 17 out of the 26 foot/leg dimensions, as well as an increased plantar contact area compared to their matched non obese counterparts. As no interaction was identified between gender and obesity, it was confirmed that the effects of obesity were not moderated by gender. In comparison to the non-obese children, the obese children generated higher forces, force-time integrals, peak pressures, pressure-time integrals and increased plantar contact area when walking compared to the non-obese children. Based on these results it was recommended that a shoe should be designed to cater for the larger foot dimensions characteristic of obese children and to cushion the larger plantar pressure distributions generated when these children walk. A survey was also undertaken to identify factors that influence the purchasing of children’s shoes. Parents indicated that fit and comfort were important factors influencing their footwear purchases for their child, even though few parents regularly had their child professionally fitted for shoes. It was anticipated that shoes would need to be replaced because the child had outgrown them, although there was also a high proportion of shoes being replaced because they had been worn out. An experimental shoe was designed to cater for obese children based on the foot structure, function and survey data. The two main design parameters included in the shoes were an increase in forefoot width to cater for the large foot dimensions of obese children and variations in midsole hardness to cushion the high plantar pressures. Six experimental shoes were evaluated by 14 children who were classified as either overweight and obese children or non-overweight children. Experimental Section 2 investigated how variations in shoe width and midsole hardness affected the fit, comfort, plantar pressures and gait in the two subject groups. A shoe fit assessment revealed no noticeable differences between the experimental shoes by the children. The shoe comfort and fit parameters, which were assessed via a visual analog scale, demonstrated that these parameters, when used in the evaluation of footwear, relied on individual perceptions of the wearer. The overweight/obese children did report slightly higher shoe fit and comfort values when wearing the wide shoe compared to the narrow shoe although this difference was not significant. However, the non-overweight children reported higher fit and comfort values than the overweight/obese children when wearing the wide shoes. In general, the plantar pressure distributions at the foot/shoe interface were lower than the previous barefoot values, indicating that footwear moderated the plantar pressure distributions generated during walking. Changes in shoe width and midsole density were found to to have negligible affect on the in-shoe plantar pressure variables and spatio-temporal gait parameters, which may be attributable to the small differences reported in shoe fit assessment. The soft shoes resulted in lower peak pressures being generated under the forefoot but higher peak pressures for the heel and midfoot. The overweight/obese <b>children,</b> regardless of <b>footwear</b> condition, altered their gait to cope with the stresses placed on their feet during walking. Clearly, further research is required to develop shoes to cater for the unique feet of obese children and to better dissipate loading during gait. It was concluded that a shoe based on the unique foot structure, shape and function of obese children is required by these children. However, the difficulty in designing such a shoe that is universally suitable for obese children because of differential foot development, are acknowledged. Further, perceptions of shoe fit and shoe comfort are highly subjective variables, compounding appropriate shoe design. This thesis highlighted that without good levels of shoe fit, it is difficult to achieve optimal shoe comfort. Although a shoe was developed based on the unique features of obese children’s feet, more modifications are required to the experimental shoes, especially in shoe width, in order to improve shoe fit...|$|R
