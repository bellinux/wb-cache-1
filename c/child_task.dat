50|$|The process {{mechanism}} invokes {{a procedure}} as an asynchronous task {{and in this}} case a separate stack is set up starting at the lexical level of the processed procedure. As an asynchronous task, there is no control over exactly when control will be passed between the tasks, unlike coroutines. Note also that the processed procedure still has access to the enclosing environment {{and this is a very}} efficient IPC (Inter Process Communication) mechanism. Since two or more tasks now have access to common variables, the tasks must be synchronized to prevent race conditions, which is handled by the EVENT data type, where processes can WAIT on an event until they are caused by another cooperating process. EVENTs also allow for mutual exclusion synchronization through the PROCURE and LIBERATE functions. If for any reason the <b>child</b> <b>task</b> dies, the calling task can continue - however, if the parent process dies, then all child processes are automatically terminated. On a machine with more than one processor, the processes may run simultaneously. This EVENT mechanism is a basic enabler for multiprocessing in addition to multitasking.|$|E

40|$|<b>Child</b> <b>task</b> {{completion}} {{is often}} considered when measuring {{academic achievement and}} graduation or secondary education obtainment. Although {{it is a good}} predicator of these things, the line and distinction between task completion and academic achievement is blurry. This study is a secondary analysis of data collected in the Fragile Families Study. I focus this project on two questions: 1) Are ecological factors (individual, family, and school) associated with task completion in children; and 2) Is task completion associated with academic achievement. Based on previous research and personal observation my hypotheses are: (H 1) Ecological factors such as parental closeness to child, parental involvement in school, low financial strain and parenting stress, and school and neighborhood advantage will have a positive association with <b>child</b> <b>task</b> completion. In contrast, lack of parental closeness, parental involvement, high financial strain, and school and neighborhood disadvantage will have a negative association with task completion. Factors such as gender and race/ethnicity will have no association with task completion. (H 2) Greater levels of task completion are positively associated to academic achievement. Preliminary results show that: 1) there is a significant negative relationship between parenting stress and <b>child</b> <b>task</b> completion, 2) at the bivariate level family poverty threshold is not associated with <b>child</b> <b>task</b> completion, and 3) on average females had higher levels of task completion compared to males...|$|E

40|$|The {{scheduling}} {{of tasks}} within a parallel program onto the underlying available processors has been studied for some time. To date, solutions to this problem generally assume that communication only occurs at the start or end of each parallel task, i. e., the <b>child</b> <b>task</b> can only start its execution when all its parent tasks complete and have sent data to it. This is termed "non-preemptive task scheduling". This paper examines {{the problem of the}} preemptive parallel program which is represented by a preemptive task model.

40|$|Cloud Computing {{refers to}} a {{paradigm}} whereby services are offered via internet using pay as you go model. Services are deployed in data centers and the pool of data centers is collectively referred to as “Cloud”. Data centers make use of scheduling techniques to optimally allocate resources to various jobs. Different scenarios require different scheduling algorithms. The selection of a particular scheduling algorithm depends upon various factors like the parameter to be optimized (cost or time), quality of service to be provided and information available regarding various aspects of job. Workflow applications are the applications which require various sub-tasks to be executed in a particular fashion in order to complete the whole task. These tasks have parent child relationship. The parent task needs to be executed before its <b>child</b> <b>task.</b> Workflow scheduling algorithms are supposed to preserve dependency constraints implied by their nature and structure. Resources are allocated to various sub-tasks of the original task by keeping into account these constraints. In this paper, various workflow scheduling algorithms have been surveyed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{study was to}} {{investigate}} the longitudinal relations among maternal supportiveness, child task-approach behavior, and cognitive development for children with developmental risks. The participants (N = 400) in this study were a subset of the National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project. The current study used structural equation modeling analyses including growth-curve models.;Findings are that maternal supportiveness was moderately stable from the time the children were 14 to 36 months of age, but stability of child task-approach behavior was weak between 14 and 24 months of age. Child task-approach behavior became stronger as children grew older. Earlier maternal supportiveness influenced later child task-approach behavior, but earlier child task-approach behavior did not influence later maternal supportiveness. Child task-approach behavior across time influenced the initial level of child cognition and the rate of cognitive development from 14 to 36 months of child age. Earlier maternal supportiveness influenced the initial level of child cognition, and later maternal supportiveness influenced the rate of cognitive development. Maternal education and age were positively related to maternal supportiveness. The initial level of child cognition and earlier <b>child</b> <b>task</b> approach behavior were related negatively to the rate of cognitive development.;This study provides evidence that mothers 2 ̆ 7 supportive interactions are important in children 2 ̆ 7 s cognitive development, as well as their task-approach behaviors, and children 2 ̆ 7 s task approach behaviors influence their rate of cognitive development. These findings support providing intervention services for low-income mothers, especially those who are young or less well educated in order to enhance their interactions with their children. Also, this study supports the potential utility of improved capabilities for the early diagnosis of developmental delays and more sensitive eligibility criteria for early intervention services...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} C++ {{a library}} function template task_region and a library class task_region_handle with member functions run and wait that together enable developers to write expressive and portable fork-join parallel code. 2 Document status and history This revision of this proposal {{has been approved}} by the Parallelism and Concurrency study group (SG 1) at the June 2014 meeting and is expected to be reviewed by the Library Evolution working group and Library working group at the November 2014 meeting. It is tentatively targeted at a future Parallelism TS. 2. 1 Changes from N 3991 to N 4088 This paper contains no interface changes. The wording describing the asynchronous nature of run has been improved. Formal wording has also been added making explicit the thread-switching nature of most interface functions. 2. 2 Changes from N 3832 to N 3911 The main change from the previous revision of this paper is the addition of the task_region_handle class as an explicit means of communicating from a task_region to the spawn point of a <b>child</b> <b>task.</b> A change in this vein was requested at the February 2014 Issaquah meeting as a way to avoid “magic ” or “out-of-band communication. ” It was also suggested that requiring an explicit handshake between these parts of a task region {{would make it easier for}} compilers and linkers to avoid combining disparate implementations of the library proposed herein. An additional change is that the type of parallelism described in N 3832 was “terminally strict ” whereas the type of parallelism described in this paper is “fully strict ” (see Strict Fork-join Parallelism, below). The change was made because terminal strictness was deemed to present implementation difficulties for little gain in expressiveness. These changes created an issue not present in the original paper: potential violations of fully-strict fork-join parallelism. A few sentences in the formal wording and a new issue in the issues section was added to the paper in response.

The goals of this research were to: conduct a more extensive and systematic assessment of behavioural generality following basic behavioural training; determine how certain task characteristics affect such generalization; determine if certain forms of additional training (i. e., self-management training) enhance such generalization; assess the longterm maintenance and setting generality of parent skills following training; assess the role of individual characteristics in the initial and generalized effects of training; and provide an analysis of both therapist and client costs associated with such training.;The research design was a multiple-baseline across families with multiple generalization probes across <b>child</b> <b>tasks.</b> Parent training was administered in two successive phases: basic training followed by self-management training. Direct observations of parent/child teaching interactions provided measures of parents 2 ̆ 7 ability to implement behavioural teaching skills and measures of the generality of these skills {{across a variety of}} child tasks.;Although all parents showed marked increases in their ability to effectively implement behavioural teaching skills in an easy target task during basic training, different parents showed different patterns of generalized teaching to non-target <b>child</b> <b>tasks.</b> During self-management training, parents who had not yet generalized accurate teaching to all non-target tasks did so, while parents who had already demonstrated generalized teaching with certain tasks often showed additional increases. Changes in children 2 ̆ 7 s correct responding to parental teaching generally parallelled changes in parent behaviour. Changes in parent and child behaviour were maintained over a 4 -month follow-up period. Parents also demonstrated high rates of accurate teaching with new <b>child</b> <b>tasks</b> in the home setting, up to 5 months following the termination of training. Pretraining measures of parent stress were significantly correlated with parent and child behaviour change. Overall, parent satisfaction with the training program was very high.;It was postulated that the self-management procedures were successful because they promoted the transfer of stimulus control from the parent trainer to the parent. Overall, this research helped to identify a socially valid training approach that is effective in promoting generalized and maintained behaviour change at a cost that is not prohibitive. The clinical implications of this training approach were discussed...|$|R

Then, we propose a dynamic scheduling algorithm called Reuse Processors Algorithm (RePA). The main objective of RePA is to reduce the communication and redistribution costs by trying to map <b>child</b> <b>tasks</b> to processors which are assigned to parent tasks (reuse processors).
