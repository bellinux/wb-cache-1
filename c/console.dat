These were replaced by Wii and Nintendo DS advertisements. However, when the game was released on the Wii U's Virtual <b>Console</b> in 2016, the Kawasaki banners were restored. The Virtual <b>Console</b> versions of the game were generally very well received, with reviewers considering the game {{to be just as}} much fun as it was on the Nintendo 64.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} types of video game <b>consoles,</b> {{including}} home video game <b>consoles,</b> handheld game <b>consoles,</b> microconsoles and dedicated <b>consoles.</b> Although Ralph Baer had built working game <b>consoles</b> by 1966, it was nearly a decade before the Pong game made them commonplace in regular people's living rooms. Through evolution over the 1990s and 2000s, game <b>consoles</b> have expanded to offer additional functions such as CD players, DVD players, Blu-ray disc players, web browsers, set-top boxes and more.|$|R
25|$|Prior to Rise of Irons {{launch and}} due to the {{expansion}} only being released for current <b>consoles</b> (PS4 and One), players' accounts on legacy <b>consoles</b> (PS3 and 360) were split from current <b>consoles.</b> Accounts were previously shared across <b>consoles</b> of the same family.

5|$|The {{original}} <b>console</b> in {{the series}} was the first video game <b>console</b> to ship 100 million units, 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. Its successor, the PlayStation 2, was released in 2000. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling home <b>console</b> to date, having reached over 155 million units sold as of December 28, 2012. Sony's next <b>console,</b> the PlayStation 3, was released in 2006 and has sold over 80 million consoles worldwide as of November 2013.

5|$|A 1983 {{industry}} crash, {{caused by}} the market being overrun with low-quality products, prompted {{a higher degree of}} regulation by future <b>console</b> manufacturers: when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was launched in the United States in 1985, Nintendo of America instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The <b>console</b> itself also included a lockout chip to enforce this requirement and prevent the <b>console</b> from loading unlicensed games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among <b>console</b> makers, although Nintendo of America also had stringent content policies, frequently censoring blood, sexual content, and references to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.|$|E
5|$|A {{dedicated}} <b>console</b> {{version of}} Tank II was announced by Atari at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1977, but was cancelled {{by the end}} of the year; the joysticks for the game, designed by Kevin McKinsey, became the standard joystick controllers for the Atari 2600 (1977). The Atari 2600 game Combat, released in 1977, includes several variations of Tank, including ones with bouncing shots or invisible tanks. Combat was initially developed as a <b>console</b> version of the arcade game, like the cancelled dedicated <b>console</b> version, with additional plane-based game modes added during development. Despite Atari's cancellation of the dedicated <b>console</b> version of Tank, a dedicated <b>console</b> game inspired by Tank was still released in 1977 by Coleco: the Telstar game Telstar Combat! plays four variations of Tank, and was released prior to the Atari 2600 and Combat.|$|E

The <b>console</b> used novel plasma bargraph meters which displayed both average and peak sound levels, combining the characteristics of fast peak meters and slower VU meters. Clair Brothers built 10 of the consoles, the first live sound <b>console</b> to incorporate parametric equalisation.|$|E

5|$|Sega {{was one of}} {{the primary}} {{competitors}} to Nintendo in the video game <b>console</b> industry. A few of Sega's early consoles outsold their competitors in specific markets, such as the Master System in Europe. Several of the company's later consoles were commercial failures, however, and the financial losses incurred from the Dreamcast <b>console</b> caused the company to restructure itself in 2001. As a result, Sega ceased to manufacture consoles and became a third-party video game developer. The only <b>console</b> that Sega has produced since is the educational toy <b>console</b> Advanced Pico Beena in 2005. Third-party variants of Sega consoles have been produced by licensed manufacturers, even after production of the original consoles had ended. Many of these variants have been produced in Brazil, where versions of the Master System and Genesis are still sold and games for them are still developed.|$|E
