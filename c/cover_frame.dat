It was specifically chosen to decrease the overall height of the vehicles regardless of the increase in the size of the transmission and propeller shaft humps, since each row had to <b>cover</b> <b>frame</b> rails as well. Several models had the differential located not by the customary bar between axle and frame, but by a ball joint atop the differential connected to a socket in a wishbone hinged onto a crossmember of the frame.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of technology {{made it easier}} to send the data accurate and faster to the destination. The most important factor of information technology and communication is the security of the information. This security can be achieved through steganography. Steganography is art and science of invisible communication. This paper mainly focuses on audio and video steganography. Video Steganography hides secret data within a video and audio steganography deals with hiding secret data within audio. The secret data is first compressed, encrypted and then embed into the cover frames {{in such a way that}} eight bits of the secret data are divided into 2, 2, 2, 2 and then embedded into the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) pixel values of the cover frames respectively and the remaining 2 bits are inserted in the next pixel of <b>cover</b> <b>frame</b> and so on. The proposed technique is compared with existing LSB (Least Significant Bit) based steganography and the results are found to be encouraging...|$|E
40|$|Video Steganography is {{a method}} of hiding data into a {{carrying}} Video file. This data can be text, audio, image or a video itself. The video based Steganography {{is better than the}} other existing methods because of its high data security and it can accommodate large amount of secret data. The Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) Algorithm based data insertion into a video make the video Steganography a robust method of embedding information in a carrier file. The DWT technique converts the cover image as 4 x 4 blocks in which LL, LH, HL, and HH sub band images are developed. In the current project, using the DWT technique we hide the data in the specific location of the selected frame and by using LSB algorithm we replace the last bit of the original pixel value of the selected region with the secret data. Once the data is embedded into the seleted Frame it is called as a Stego frame. This stego frame is inserted in the place of the <b>cover</b> <b>frame</b> and the video is reconstructed. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} {{issue in the}} world is the manner in which to safely transmit the secret information and prevent the detection of information. Steganography is a system that hides information in an application cover carrier like image, text, audio, and video. In this paper we use the video steganography. In this technique first convert the video into frames, then out of that frames select one frame, that frame is called as cover image. Then take a secrete image which has to be transmitted. This secrete image is convert into gray image and encrypt that image with the help of secrete key. Thus, we get the encrypted image. This encrypted image is embed into the cover image by using improved LSB technique. The output is called the stego image. This stego image is then add to that video at the place of cover image and rebuilt the video. This rebuilt video is then send to the receiver side where the receiver receives the original image by decrypting that image. Video Steganography is a technique to hide any image into a carrying Video file. The use of the video based Steganography can be more eligible than other multimedia files, because of its size and memory requirements. The improved least significant bit is an important technique for embedding information in a carrier file. In this technique, the cover image divided into three different channels i. e. RGB then hide the secrete image into these channels by inserting specific bits in red, specific bits in green and specific bits in blue channels.

40|$|Abstract: The {{growth of}} high speed {{computer}} networks {{and that of}} the Internet, in particular, has increased the ease of Information Communication. In comparison with Analog media, Digital media offers several distinct advantages such as high quality, easy editing, high fidelity copying, compression etc. So, Information Security is becoming an inseparable part of Data Communication. In order to address this Information Security, Steganography plays an important role. In present times, confidential information such as medical records and banking or financial data and military information is at a risk because of malicious security threats. The kind of information especially targeted is the one where the issue of authentication and authorization is a critical factor. Steganography is the art and science of information within a video. In this paper, a hash based least significant bit (LSB) technique has been proposed. A spatial domain technique where the secret information is embedded in the LSB of the <b>cover</b> <b>frames.</b> Eight bits of the secret information is divided into 3, 3, 2 and embedded into the RGB pixel values of the <b>cover</b> <b>frames</b> respectively. A hash function is used to select the position of insertion in LSB bits. The proposed method is analyzed in terms of both Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) compared to the original cover video as well as the Mean Square Error (MSE) measured between the original and steganographic files averaged over all video frames. Video Steganography is one proposed system which is based on video Steganography, cryptography and compression, ensures secure and large amount of data transfer between the source and destination...|$|R
