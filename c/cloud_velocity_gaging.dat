The fragment clouds were generated by hypervelocity impact of aluminum projectiles on 1 mm thick AlMg 3 plates. Projectile diameters ranged from 2. 0 mm to 4. 4 mm. At impact velocities of around 7 km/s- 1, kinetic energies varied between 269 J and 2950 J. Container gas pressures were between 0. 1 bar and 10 bar N 2. The fragment cloud was photographed employing an {{image converter camera}} in a shadowgraph technique with a frame separation of 1 µs. By evaluation of the pictures, fragment <b>cloud</b> <b>velocities</b> were measured and shapes of the fragment clouds could be characterized {{as a function of}} projectile diameters and pressures.

The plasma clouds are observed as large structures in the time series recorded by Langmuir probe and reference probe. By using the method of conditional averaging, the structures are accentuated. The electron cloud formed by arcing {{was found to be}} characterized by a steep drop from zero current to a minimum, then relaxation towards zero current. Additionally, we found the magnitude of the amplitude to the electron cloud to be decreasing when the distance between the arc and the movable probe is increased. The average electron <b>cloud</b> <b>velocity</b> was found to be ve = 1 : 32 106 ms����� 1. The ion cloud formed by arcing was found to be characterized by a current above the steady state, which then increases logarithmically to a maximum, and then relaxes back to the steady state. However, the ion cloud measurement revealed a negative spike before the ion cloud, which indicates the electrons from an arc are energetic enough to be recorded by a negatively biased probe. The average ion <b>cloud</b> <b>velocity</b> was found to be vi = 119 : 2 ms����� 1, however the uncertainty was large due to high scattering.

There are enhancements in rotation measure of approximately 100 rad m^(- 2) which are generally well correlated with decelerated Hα emission. We estimate a lower limit on the line-of-sight component {{of the field of}} approximately 8 μG along a decelerated filament; this is a lower limit due to our assumptions about the geometry. No RM excess is evident in sightlines dominated by HI or Hα at the velocity of the Smith Cloud. The smooth Hα morphology of the emission at the Smith <b>Cloud</b> <b>velocity</b> suggests photoionization by the Galactic ionizing radiation field as the dominant ionization mechanism, while the filamentary morphology and high (approximately 1 Rayleigh) Hα intensity of the lower-velocity magnetized ionized gas suggests an ionization process associated with shocks due to interaction with the Galactic interstellar medium.

Our temperature map shows large-scale nonuniformities characteristic of the ongoing merger, in agreement with earlier ASCA results. The brightness edge {{turns out to be}} a boundary of a large cool gas cloud moving through the hot ambient gas, very similar to the "cold fronts" discovered by Chandra in A 2142. The higher quality of the A 3667 data allows the direct determination of the <b>cloud</b> <b>velocity.</b> At the leading edge of the cloud, the gas density abruptly increases by a factor of 3. 9 +- 0. 8, while the temperature decreases by a factor of 1. 9 +- 0. 2 (from 7. 7 keV to 4. 1 keV). The ratio of the gas pressures inside and outside the front shows that the cloud moves through the ambient gas at near-sonic velocity, M= 1 +- 0. 2 or v= 1400 +- 300 km/s. In front of the cloud, we observe the compression of the ambient gas with an amplitude expected for such a velocity. A smaller surface brightness discontinuity is observed further ahead, ~ 350 kpc in front of the cloud. We suggest that it corresponds to a weak bow shock, implying that the <b>cloud</b> <b>velocity</b> may be slightly supersonic. Given all the evidence, the cold front appears to delineate the remnant of a cool subcluster that recently has merged with A 3667. The cold front is remarkably sharp. The upper limit on its width, 3. 5 arcsec or 5 kpc, is several times smaller than the Coulomb mean free path. This is a direct observation of suppression of the transport processes in the intergalactic medium, most likely by magnetic fields.

40|$|High-dispersion IUE far-UV spectra were {{obtained}} for five stars in the LMC and two stars in the SMC. At Magellanic <b>Cloud</b> <b>velocities,</b> all the spectra exhibit very strong interstellar lines of Al III, Si IV, and C IV, {{in addition to the}} usual lower ionization stage lines associated with H I region absorption. In two stars interstellar N V is also detected at the 50 mA level. From a consideration of the strength, width, and radial velocity of these high ionization stage lines, it is argued that regions of hot halo gas have probably been detected in front of the Magellanic Clouds. The regions detected exhibit absorption characteristics very {{similar to that of the}} Milky Way corona described previously by Savage and de Boer (1979). A cloud detected in the line of sight to HD 5980 in the SMC at a radial velocity of 300 km/s is of unknown origin...|$|R
