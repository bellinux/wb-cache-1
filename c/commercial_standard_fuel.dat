40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{combustion}} of reforming gas in a small size Internal Combustion Engine. Therefore, mathematical models of both reforming process and internal combustion engine were implemented. In particular, steams reforming of glycerol to produce synthesis gas and spark ignition four strokes ICE were studied. The reforming process mathematical model was verified using experimental data. Synthesis gas was used to feed the ICE with different syngas and engine configuration. On the basis of the comparison with the experimental results, it is possible to state that the mathematical model is validated. Engine performance and pollutant emission evaluation was carried out using the integrated mathematical models with reference to the engine running on <b>standard</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>fuel.</b> The results highlight a reduction in engine performance and, {{at the same time a}} reduction of pollutant emissions in terms of CO and CO 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{research}} includes principles of operation, areas of enhancement, and the fabrication processes of micro direct ethanol fuel cells. This research spreads light on the technology of fuel cells, offers methods to aide {{the performance of the}} direct ethanol fuel cell, and provides the method to produce an enhanced micro direct ethanol fuel cell power supply. The proposed micro direct ethanol fuel cell provides power independent of its orientation and without external fluid pumps. In satisfying these details the fuel cell system is entirely sealed within a small package fabricated using rapid prototyping technology and operates solely on natural forces such as gravity, capillary forces and diffusion. Alloying the standard platinum catalyst with tin and controlling the growth of its shape enhances the direct fuel cells operation to oxidize ethanol more efficiently and prevents carbon dioxide poisoning over a longer period than the <b>standard</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>fuel</b> cell catalyst...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} study demonstrated that AVLIS-enriched uranium converted to UO{sub 3 } {{can be used}} to prepare UO{sub 3 } pellets having densities in the range required for commercial power reactor fuel. Specifically, the program has demonstrated that MDD (Modified Direct Denitration) -derived UO{sub 2 } powders can be reduced to sinterable UO{sub 2 } powder using reduction techniques that allow control of the final powder characteristics; the resulting UO{sub 2 } powders can be processed/sintered using standard powder preparation and pellet fabrication techniques to yield pellets with densities greater than 96 % TD; pellet microstructures appear similar to those of power reactor fuel, and because of the high final pellet densities, it is expected that they would remain stable during in-reactor operation; {{the results of the present}} study confirm the results of a similar study carried out in 1982 (Davis and Griffin 1992). The laboratory processes were selected on the basis that they could be scaled up to <b>standard</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>fuel</b> processing. However, larger scale testing may be required to establish techniques compatible with commercial fuel fabrication techniques...|$|R
40|$|Homogenous-charge, {{compression-ignition}} (HCCI) combustion is a {{new method}} of burning fuel in internal combustion (IC) engines. In an HCCI engine, the fuel and air are premixed prior to combustion, like in a spark-ignition (SI) engine. However, rather than using a spark to initiate combustion, the mixture is ignited through compression only, as in a compression-ignition (CI) engine; this makes combustion in HCCI engines much more sensitive to fuel chemistry than in traditional IC engines. The union of SI- and CI-technologies gives HCCI engines substantial efficiency and emissions advantages. However, one major challenge preventing significant commercialization of HCCI technology is its small operating range compared to traditional IC engines. This project {{examined the effects of}} fuel chemistry {{on the size of the}} HCCI operating region, with an emphasis on the low-load limit (LLL) of HCCI operability. If commercialized, HCCI engines will have to operate using <b>standard</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>fuels.</b> Therefore, investigating the impact of fuel chemistry variations in commercial gasolines on the HCCI operability limits is critical to determining the fate of HCCI commercialization. To examine these effects, the operating ranges of 12 gasolines were mapped in a naturally-aspirated...|$|R
40|$|For {{over fifty}} years, the H Canyon {{facility}} at the Savannah River Site (SRS) has performed remotely operated radiochemical separations of irradiated targets to produce materials for national defense. Although the materials production mission has ended, the facility {{continues to play}} an important role in the stabilization and safe disposition of proliferable nuclear materials. As part of the US HEU Disposition Program, SRS has been down blending off-specification (off-spec) HEU to produce LEU since 2003. Off-spec HEU contains fission products not amenable to meeting the American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) <b>commercial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>standards</b> prior to purification. This down blended HEU material produced 301 MT of ~ 5 % enriched LEU which has been fabricated into light water reactor fuel being utilized in Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reactors in Tennessee and Alabama producing economic power. There is still in excess of ~ 10 MT of off-spec HEU throughout the DOE complex or future foreign and domestic research reactor returns that could be recovered and down blended for beneficial use as either ~ 5 % enriched LEU, or for use in subsequent LEU reactors requiring ~ 19. 75 % enriched LEU fuel...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere {{are many}} {{different}} ways to convert biomass into liquid fuels, mostly referred to as bio-oils. This paper presents the analysis of bio-oils produced by hydrothermal liquefaction and fast pyrolysis of beech wood. Both processes have a wide panel of parameters that can be optimised influencing the oil quality. Results of the analysis show that both oils have high acidities. Iodine values indicate {{a high degree of}} unsaturations. These two qualities seem to be inversely proportional in the case of pyrolysis oils. In the case of hydrothermal conversion, additives to adjust the pH such as sodium hydroxide increase oil yields, lower its viscosity but do little to further improve the quality of the oils. For pyrolysis oils, increasing the severity does reduce acidity but at the expense of more unsaturations and a loss in yield. The results show that without extensive upgrading or refining, <b>commercial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>standards</b> cannot be met. Specific norms and standards are being elaborated for pyrolysis used in specific installations. This paper shows how detailed analysis can help to optimise process parameters with an objective that goes beyond the mass or energy yield. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This study aims to calibrate the FARSITE fire spread model considering a set of recent wildfires that occurred in northern Iranian forests. Site-specific fuel models in the study areas were selected by sampling the main natural vegetation type complexes and assigning <b>standard</b> <b>fuel</b> models. Overall, simulated fires presented reliable outputs that accurately replicated the observed fire perimeters and behavior. <b>Standard</b> <b>fuel</b> models of Scott and Burgan (2005) afforded better accuracy in the simulated fire perimeters than the <b>standard</b> <b>fuel</b> models of Anderson (1982).
