40|$|Why do {{secondary}} school students differ in their text comprehension? This is an important question because many {{secondary school}} students are unable to achieve the level of text <b>comprehension</b> <b>required</b> to enable learning from their school book texts. This thesis contributes to answering this question by focusing on individual differences that could explain why {{secondary school students}} differ in their comprehension of expository texts. In earlier research, sentence reading fluency, general vocabulary knowledge and metacognitive knowledge {{have been identified as}} important components of skilled reading comprehension. This thesis examines whether knowledge of connectives, text reading fluency, text structure inference skill and reading motivation are components that add {{to the understanding of the}} individual differences in reading comprehension. Furthermore, it is examined whether the contribution of these four components depends on readers’ language backgrounds (monolinguals versus bilinguals) or on their level of other cognitive resources. The results show that knowledge of connectives and text structure inference skill have an additional contribution to eighth graders’ expository text comprehension, whereas text reading fluency and reading motivation do not. Language background and cognitive resources do not impact the contribution of any of the four components with one exception: the contribution of knowledge of connectives is reinforced by readers’ metacognitive knowledge. This book contributes to our understanding of expository text comprehension skill and as such hopes to contribute to a better reading proficiency of secondary school students...|$|E

For this reason, reading skills should be taught in universities for the students to be able to cope with comprehension problems. This case study aims to find out whether or not reading skills has a role on the reading comprehension ability of Turkish EFL students.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this study is}} on the student with reading {{comprehension}} difficulties and the classroom teacher whose responsibility it is to help that student "read to learn". While special reading teachers could provide valuable supplementary reading instruction, they are no substitute for competent classroom teachers whose sensitivity to the total reading effort across the curriculum has been reinforced by a working knowledge of corrective reading procedures. The advantage lies in the unlimited opportunity which the classroom teacher has to observe day-by-day learning, spot incipient problems, administer the proverbial ounce of prevention, or distribute the needed pound of cure with regularity and consistency. [...] The concept of "reading to learn" is a fundamental component of the reading development process but is contingent upon the acquisition of basic reading comprehension skills. This writer suggests {{it may well be that}} the inherent comprehension difficulties of many disabled readers are caused not by the gradual increase in the degree of difficulty of comprehension materials as they progress beyond the elementary grades, but instead are caused in part by a difference in the kind of <b>comprehension</b> <b>required</b> by content area materials. This understanding sets the perspective for the teaching of reading comprehension in the content areas. A corrective reading program which utilizes appropriate questioning strategies and techniques can assist students in "learning to read" proficiently, and hence ensures that their "reading to learn" endeavours will meet with greater success. To teach well, educators must teach the learner how to do what is required of him and do so in such a way that he develops an understanding of the processes involved. [...] The application of the various aspects discussed in this paper will be contingent upon the learner and the specific learning situation. The corrective reading program described in this thesis, with accompanying techniques and strategies for implementation, is viewed as a framework whereby students may become proficient readers and, ultimately, independent learners. That there will continue to be students who have problems in reading comprehension seems inevitable, so long as multiple differences in students continue to exist. However, developing the abilities of the classroom teacher in corrective reading procedures could become a major force in reducing the quantity and scope of the disabled reader problem in our educational system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Expected {{knowledge}} contributions: My {{study can}} contribute to a broader approach to reading comprehension tests and a proactive approach to reading comprehension strategies for a transition stage between year groups. Background: At {{the beginning of the}} fall semester in 2016 there was DLS reading comprehension screening of all students in year 7. This was to detect students who possibly were in need of special education. The result showed that approximately half of the students were below the normal expected level for their age, ie between stanine 1 - 3. This was considered remarkable since almost all the students had passed the goals for reading comprehension in the national tests conducted during the Spring Term in Grade 6. The question arose as to what this difference in reading competence was due to. In the theory, reading ability of the students should not fall dramatically during the summer holidays. It is likely that other and more demands are placed on reading ability as a student changes educational stage and meets other types of text. Purpose and Issues: The purpose of the study is to compare the subsample of the national test for grade 6, which deals with reading comprehension with the DLS test that examines students' reading comprehension in grade 7. What are the similarities and differences regarding texts´ readability, the type of question and the type of reading comprehension process required to answer the questions? Is it possible to distinguish an increased demand on reading skills, and how can we prepare our students for the reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>required</b> during a stage transition? Based on this, my research questions are: * What similarities /differences are there in the texts´ readability? * What similarities /differences are there in the kind of questions in the texts? * What kind of reading process is needed to answer the questions? Theory: The texts have been analyzed using theories of readability, question types, and reading comprehension processes. Reading comprehension is discussed in a sociocultural, cognitive and special educational perspective. Method: I have made a qualitative text analysis in which I examined the subsample of the national tests in year 6 reading comprehension and compared this with the screening of reading comprehension, DLS, which is in grade 7. I have compared the texts´ legibility calculated from lix, the type of questions and reading comprehension processes required by the reader in order to answer the questions. The text analysis is done according to Hellspong and Ledin's (1997) text analysis model where the linguistic design is analyzed. Results: The results show that there is a difference in the readability of the texts. The texts in the national exam have on average a lower degree of difficulty than the texts in DLS reading comprehension test. However, the national test consists of both narrative texts and factual texts. The narrative texts have a significantly lower lix value than the factual texts. The factual texts in the national test have a lix value equivalent to the factual texts in DLS reading comprehension test. Factual texts thus generally appear to be of a higher difficulty than narrative texts as they contain more concepts. One conclusion I can draw is that this could be a possible reason for the big difference between the results of the national test and DLS reading comprehension test. There is also a big difference in the type of questions to the texts. The majority of questions to the national exam are open-ended questions of inference. The result is the opposite of the DLS reading comprehension test, where the majority of questions are text-controlled multiple choice questions with four options. Another conclusion I can draw is that the two reading comprehension tests measure different parts of the students' reading comprehension. The DLS reading comprehension test focuses on surface reading comprehension while the national exam focuses on both superficial and deep reading comprehension. As for reading comprehension processes, there are also major differences in the test. The tests impose different demands on reading comprehension processes. I conclude that the questions for the factual texts belong to the text-based understanding of the process more than to the interpretive and evaluative process. Implications: No single reading comprehension test is in itself a reliable instrument for assessing students' reading comprehension. A combination of methods is needed in which the pedagogue gains a greater understanding of the student's thought processes and the reading strategies that the student uses. One way to prepare students for the transition from middle school to high school can be to work with factual texts and reading comprehension strategies...|$|E

This study addresses the issue of pragmatic comprehension of language by analysing the differences or similarities in processing literal and non-literal (ironic) language. The aim of the study is specifically to investigate neuropsychological correlates (ERPs) of irony decoding. Previous outcomes of RT (Reading Times) responses studies showed that non-conventional ironies took longer to process than literal interpretations of the same sentences. That seems to indicate irony <b>comprehension</b> <b>requires</b> more complicated processes. ERPs studies on non-literal language processing revealed the presence of N 400, a negative component associated to semantic integration of the discourse (Kutas & Federmeier, 2002). Participants and Methods: In our study, 120 sentences, equally shared in literal and ironic (with true or false content) trials, were presented to 10 subjects. Results: ERPs morphological analyses showed, for any trials, two negative peaks at 300 ms (N 3) and 400 ms (N 4) latencies, with an amplitude increase for both components in the ironic condition. These findings suggest that literal and ironic decoding is qualitatively similar, but irony <b>comprehension</b> <b>requires</b> extra inferential processes thus resulting in an increasing of the demand for the cognitive system.
