40|$|AbstractSolar cell {{concepts}} with passivated, locally contacted {{rear side}} have gained much interest {{over the last}} years due to the development of advanced passivation techniques. However, there are still open questions regarding the understanding of the local Al-Si contact formation and its influence on the local back-surface-field formation for industrial screen-printed aluminum pastes. In this work we show that the geometry of the rear pattern (contact size and <b>contact</b> <b>spacing)</b> strongly influences the Al-Si interaction in the local contact openings: Si diffuses in Al through narrow dielectric barrier openings and spreads laterally to a determined limit determined by the firing temperature. We found that the <b>contact</b> <b>spacing</b> can affect the tendency for formation of Kirkendall voids below the Al-Si contacts instead of an eutectic layer. When decreasing the <b>contact</b> <b>spacing</b> and therefore the overlap of Al {{on each side of the}} local opening, the melt saturates faster and the formation of a deep (high-quality) local back-surface-field is increased. This may minimize the presence of voids. This physical observation helps on the design of the rear pattern for rear passivated solar cells and gives further understanding of the Al-Si interaction during the firing process...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the technical performance of laminectomy and percutaneous spinal cord stimulation leads with similar <b>contact</b> <b>spacing</b> by computer modeling. Monopolar and tripolar (guarded cathode) stimulation with both lead types in a low-thoracic spine model was simulated using UT-SCS software. Dorsal column and dorsal root fiber thresholds were calculated as well as the area of recruited fibers in the dorsal columns, the rostrocaudal span of recruited dorsal root fibers and the energy consumption at discomfort threshold. Tripolar stimulation is superior to monopolar stimulation in the recruitment of the dorsal columns, a percutaneous lead recruits a similar to 12 % larger dorsal column area than a laminectomy lead does. This difference is reduced when the <b>contact</b> <b>spacing</b> of the lead models is the same. A percutaneous lead with significant wire impedance (140 Ohms) consumes similar to 115 - 240 % more energy, whereas the same lead with negligible wire impedance consumes similar to 40 - 85 % more energy. A deterioration of all performance parameters is predicted when a percutaneous lead is placed more dorsally in the epidural tissue. When positioned next to the dura mater, a percutaneous lead has a similar performance (fiber recruitment in the dorsal columns and the dorsal roots) as a laminectomy lead with similar <b>contact</b> <b>spacing,</b> but substantially higher energy consumption. The superior clinical performance of the laminectomy lead is most probably due to the difference in volume and insertion technique of the two lead types...|$|E

A heuristic search of the adjacency graph produces a sequence of contact states that can be traversed {{in the presence of}} pose uncertainty, thus maneuvering the assembly past the problematic configuration.

40|$|Objective: When using {{spinal cord}} {{stimulation}} (SCS) for chronic pain management, precise longitudinal {{positioning of the}} cathode is crucial to generate an electrical field capable of targeting the neural elements involved in pain relief. Presently used methods have a poor spatial resolution and lack postoperative flexibility needed for fine tuning and reprogramming the stimulation field after lead displacement or changes in pain pattern. We describe in this article a new method, "electrical field steering," to control paresthesia in SCS. The method takes advantage of newer stimulator design and a programming technique allowing for "continuous" adjustment of contact combination while controlling stimulation current for each contact separately. - Method: Using computer modeling we examined how stimulation of dorsal column (DC) and dorsal root (DR) fibers was influenced by changing the current ratio of the cathodes of a dual (––) and a guarded dual cathode (+––+) configuration programmed on a percutaneous lead with 9 and 4 mm center-to-center <b>contact</b> <b>spacing.</b> - Results: A cathodal current ratio could be found for which DC or DR fiber recruitment and thus, most likely, paresthesia coverage was maximized. The DR threshold profiles shifted longitudinally, thus following the shift in the electrical field during steering. The profiles had a constant shape when the <b>contact</b> <b>spacing</b> was small and a varying shape for wider contact separation. Generally, the wider contact separation provided less DC and more DR fiber recruitment. - Conclusions: By means of cathodal steering on a longitudinal contact array, the group of excited DC and DR fibers, and thus paresthesia coverage, can be controlled when using SCS. With widely spaced contacts, superposition of the electrical field from each steering contact is limited. To precisely control segmental paresthesia (DR stimulation), a small <b>contact</b> <b>spacing</b> is necessary...|$|E

40|$|A new {{computer}} haptics algorithm {{to be used}} in general interactive manipulations of deformable virtual objects is presented. In multimodal interactive simulations, haptic feedback computation often comes from contact forces. Subsequently, the fidelity of haptic rendering depends significantly on <b>contact</b> <b>space</b> modeling. <b>Contact</b> and friction laws between deformable models are often simplified in up to date methods. They do not allow a "realistic" rendering of the subtleties of <b>contact</b> <b>space</b> physical phenomena (such as slip and stick effects due to friction or mechanical coupling between contacts). In this paper, we use Signorini's contact law and Coulomb's friction law as a computer haptics basis. Real-time performance is made possible thanks to a linearization of the behavior in the <b>contact</b> <b>space,</b> formulated as the so-called Delassus operator, and iteratively solved by a Gauss-Seidel type algorithm. Dynamic deformation uses corotational global formulation to obtain the Delassus operator in which the mass and stiffness ratio are dissociated from the simulation time step. This last point is crucial to keep stable haptic feedback. This global approach has been packaged, implemented, and tested. Stable and realistic 6 D haptic feedback is demonstrated through a clipping task experiment...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePlane strain {{indentation}} {{of single}} crystals by a periodic array of flat rigid contacts is analyzed. The {{calculations are carried}} out with the mechanical response of the crystal characterized by conventional continuum crystal plasticity or by discrete dislocation plasticity. The properties used in the conventional crystal plasticity description are chosen so that both theories give essentially the same response in plane strain compression. The indentation predictions are then compared, focusing in particular {{on the effect of}} contact size and spacing. The limiting cases of frictionless contacts and of perfectly sticking contacts are analyzed. Conventional continuum plasticity predicts a size-independent response. Unless the <b>contact</b> <b>spacing</b> to size ratio is very small, the predicted deformation mode under the contacts is a wedging mechanism of the type described by slip line theory, which is only weakly sensitive to friction conditions. For the micron scale contacts analyzed, discrete dislocation plasticity predicts a response that depends on the contact size {{as well as on the}} <b>contact</b> <b>spacing</b> to size ratio. When contacts are spaced sufficiently far apart, discrete dislocation plasticity predicts that the deformation is localized beneath the contacts whereas for more closely spaced contacts deformation occurs by shear bands extending relatively far into the crystal. Unless the contacts are sufficiently close together so that the response is essentially one of plane strain compression, the mean contact pressure predicted by discrete dislocation plasticity is substantially greater than that predicted by conventional continuum crystal plasticity and is more sensitive to the friction conditions...|$|E

40|$|Multi-finger caging {{offers a}} {{rigorous}} and robust approach to robot grasping. This thesis provides several novel algorithms for caging polygons and polyhedra {{in two and}} three dimensions. Caging refers to a robotic grasp that does not necessarily immobilize an object, but prevents it from escaping to infinity. The first algorithm considers caging a polygon in two dimensions using two point fingers. The second algorithm extends the first to three dimensions. The third algorithm considers caging a convex polygon in two dimensions using three point fingers, and considers robustness of this cage to variations in the relative positions of the fingers. This thesis describes an algorithm for finding all two-finger cage formations of planar polygonal objects based on a contact-space formulation. It shows that two-finger cages have several useful properties in <b>contact</b> <b>space.</b> First, the critical points of the cage representation in the hand’s configuration space appear as critical points of the inter-finger distance function in <b>contact</b> <b>space.</b> Second, these critical points can be graphically characterized directly on the object’s boundary. Third, <b>contact</b> <b>space</b> admits a natural rectangular decomposition such that all critical points lie on the rectangle boundaries, and the sublevel sets of <b>contact</b> <b>space</b> and free space are topologically equivalent. These properties lead to a caging graph that can be readily constructed in <b>contact</b> <b>space.</b> Starting from a desired immobilizing grasp of a polygonal object, the caging graph is searched for the minimal, intermediate, and maximal caging regions surrounding the immobilizing grasp. An example constructed from real-world data illustrates and validates the method. A second algorithm is developed for finding caging formations of a 3 D polyhedron for two point fingers using a lower dimensional contact-space formulation. Results from the two-dimensional algorithm are extended to three dimension. Critical points of the inter-finger distance function are shown to be identical to the critical points of the cage. A decomposition of <b>contact</b> <b>space</b> into 4 D regions having useful properties is demonstrated. A geometric analysis of the critical points of the inter-finger distance function results in a catalog of grasps in which the cages change topology, leading to a simple test to classify critical points. With these properties established, the search algorithm from the two-dimensional case may {{be applied to the}} three-dimensional problem. An implemented example demonstrates the method. This thesis also presents a study of cages of convex polygonal objects using three point fingers. It considers a three-parameter model of the relative position of the fingers, which gives complete generality for three point fingers in the plane. It analyzes robustness of caging grasps to variations in the relative position of the fingers without breaking the cage. Using a simple decomposition of free space around the polygon, we present an algorithm which gives all caging placements of the fingers and a characterization of the robustness of these cages. </p...|$|R

Dielectric film deposition at low temperature (≤ 400 ºC) is widely used for c-Si surface passivation and in this case emitters are induced by the positive fixed charge,Qf, at the c-Si/dielectric interface. In this work, we use 2 -D simulations to explore solar cell structures with inversion layer emitters placed between local n+-emitters. The local diffusions could be defined by laser processing, resulting in potentially low-temperature processed structures.

When performed on devices with different <b>contact</b> <b>spacing,</b> this allows the extraction of the contact resistance, the semiconductor sheet resistance, and the metal sheet resistance. For this, a 2 -D distributed resis-tive network model has been developed. We demonstrate this technique in Mo/n+-InGaAs contacts with contact lengths from 19 to 450 nm where we have measured an average contact resistivity of 0. 69 ± 0. 3 · μm 2.
