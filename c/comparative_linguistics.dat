5|$|In 1928 {{he first}} {{presented}} a paper at the International Congress of Americanists {{in which he}} presented his translation of a Nahuatl document held at the Peabody Museum at Harvard. He also began to study the <b>comparative</b> <b>linguistics</b> of the Uto-Aztecan language family, which Edward Sapir had recently demonstrated to be a linguistic family. In addition to Nahuatl, Whorf studied the Piman and Tepecano languages, while in close correspondence with linguist J. Alden Mason.|$|E
5|$|While Darwinian {{evolution}} {{never became}} an issue for northern Presbyterians as most accommodated themselves {{to some form of}} theistic evolution, the new discipline of biblical interpretation known as higher criticism would become highly controversial. Utilizing <b>comparative</b> <b>linguistics,</b> archaeology, and literary analysis, German proponents of high criticism, such as Julius Wellhausen and David Friedrich Strauss, began questioning long-held assumptions about the Bible. At the forefront of the controversy in the PCUSA was Charles A. Briggs, a professor at PCUSA's Union Theological Seminary in New York.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians {{developed}} {{the idea that}} the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones sparked the rise of <b>comparative</b> <b>linguistics.</b> The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, research on this family was thus more advanced than Indo-European research. But the rise of Indo-European <b>comparative</b> <b>linguistics</b> absorbed so much attention and enthusiasm that Uralic linguistics was all but eclipsed in Europe; in Hungary, the only European country that would have had a vested interest in the family (Finland and Estonia being under Russian rule), the political climate was too hostile for the development of Uralic <b>comparative</b> <b>linguistics.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Comparative</b> <b>linguistics</b> {{includes}} {{the study of}} the historical relationships of languages using the comparative method to search for regular (i.e. recurring) correspondences between the languages' phonology, grammar and core vocabulary, and through hypothesis testing; some persons with little or no specialization in the field sometimes attempt to establish historical associations between languages by noting similarities between them, {{in a way that is}} considered pseudoscientific by specialists (e.g. African/Egyptian comparisons).|$|E
25|$|<b>Comparative</b> <b>linguistics</b> {{reveals that}} the Mon–Khmer are of Austroasiatic descent. Genetic {{research}} suggests that Y-DNA Haplogroup O2a is the primary marker associated with the Austroasiatic ethnicities, suggesting that some 35,000 years ago, the Austroasiatic people were homogeneous with the Sino-Tibetan, Austronesian, and Hmong–Mien peoples (prior {{to the evolution of}} Y-DNA Haplogroup O into its present clades), sharing a common homeland in Southeast Asia. The coastal immigration theory suggests that the Mon–Khmer probably first entered Thailand from the Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|The Tibeto-Burmans in Southeast Asia {{primarily}} took a {{migration route}} from western China, expanding southward into the Himalayas of Tibet, and southeast into Burma. <b>Comparative</b> <b>linguistics</b> {{suggests that the}} Tibeto-Burman ethnic groups {{are part of a}} larger ethnicity referred to as Sino-Tibetan. The Sino-Tibetan, Hmong–Mien, Tai, and Austronesian ethnicities all have a high incidence of Y-DNA haplogroup O, which suggests a common ancestral ethnicity along the lines of 35,000 years ago in an area within the borders of the present-day Peoples Republic of China.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{relatedness}} {{implies a}} common origin or proto-language and <b>comparative</b> <b>linguistics</b> aims to construct language families, to reconstruct proto-languages and specify {{the changes that}} have resulted in the documented languages. To maintain a clear distinction between attested and reconstructed forms, comparative linguists prefix an asterisk to any form that is not found in surviving texts. A number of methods for carrying out language classification have been developed, ranging from simple inspection to computerised hypothesis testing. Such methods have gone through a long process of development.|$|E
25|$|According to the Migration Theory {{that was}} based {{primarily}} on <b>comparative</b> <b>linguistics,</b> the proto-Finns migrated from an ancient homeland somewhere in northwestern Siberia or western Russia to {{the shores of the}} Baltic Sea around 1000 BC, at which time Finns and Estonians separated. The Migration Theory has been called into question since 1980, based on genealogy, craniometry and archaeology. Recently, a modified form of the Migration Theory has gained new support among the younger generation of linguists, who consider that archaeology, genes or craniometric data cannot supply evidence of prehistoric languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{technique of}} <b>comparative</b> <b>linguistics</b> {{is to compare}} phonological systems, morphological systems, syntax and the lexicon {{of two or more}} languages using techniques such as the comparative method. In principle, every difference between two related languages should be explicable to a high degree of plausibility and systematic changes, for example in phonological or morphological systems are expected to be highly regular (i.e. consistent). In practice, the comparison may be more restricted, e.g. just to the lexicon. In some methods {{it may be possible to}} reconstruct an earlier proto-language. Although the proto-languages reconstructed by the comparative method are hypothetical, a reconstruction may have predictive power. The most notable example of this is Saussure's proposal that the Indo-European consonant system contained laryngeals, a type of consonant attested in no Indo-European language known at the time. The hypothesis was vindicated with the discovery of Hittite, which proved to have exactly the consonants Saussure had hypothesized in the environments he had predicted.|$|E

500|$|Whorf {{conducted}} {{important work}} on the Uto-Aztecan languages, which Sapir had conclusively demonstrated as a valid language family in 1915.
