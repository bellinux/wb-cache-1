5|$|Dyrwood is cursed by the Hollowborn Plague: <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> born without souls, {{leaving them}} totally unresponsive {{in a way}} similar to a {{permanent}} vegetative state. Many people blame animancers, the scientists who study and manipulate souls. Investigating the curse, the Watcher discovers that the Hollowborns' souls have in fact been stolen by a cult known as the Leaden Key, led by a priest named Thaos, and that Thaos is framing animancers for the Plague. This eventually leads to a riot {{in the capital city}} where animancers are lynched and their college is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E

They also see the three Cyclopes that Jason Grace, Piper McLean, and Leo Valdez encountered in The Lost Hero. During the trip, the trio learns that the goddess Gaea is awakening from several millennia of slumber {{with a plan to}} destroy the gods and the world along with them. Her seven Giant <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> woken, each of whom is matched to fight a their counterpart god. Each Giant has the skills to oppose one god and they can only be defeated if the gods and the demigods join forces. This proves to be difficult. Percy and his friends manage to defeat the Alaskan Giant and save Camp Jupiter from destruction. During their journey, Hazel and Frank become true heroes who know how to use their powers and have self-confidence. Percy regains his memory on their return to Camp Jupiter and finds an army of monsters (including Stheno, Euryale, and the three Cyclopes) led by Polybotes attacking it. Percy successfully defeats him with the help of Terminus, his Cyclops half-brother, Tyson and the hellhound, Mrs. O'Leary. At the end of the book, the Greek airship, Argo II arrives setting up the plot for The Mark of Athena.|$|E

As the civilians have been prevented from access to food and medical aid, more than 170 families were evacuated, yet the <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> used as bait by the Libyan army forces in order to prevent their families fleeing away to use them as a part of their militant operations.

500|$|From {{the start}} of the {{invasion}} onward, TNI forces engaged in the wholesale massacre of Timorese civilians. At {{the start of}} the occupation, Fretilin radio sent the following broadcast: [...] "The Indonesian forces are killing indiscriminately. Women and <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> shot in the streets. We are all going to be killed.... This is an appeal for international help. Please do something to stop this invasion." [...] One Timorese refugee told later of [...] "rape [...] cold-blooded assassinations of women and children and Chinese shop owners". Dili's bishop at the time, Martinho da Costa Lopes, said later: [...] "The soldiers who landed started killing everyone they could find. There were many dead bodies in the streets – all we could see were the soldiers killing, killing, killing." [...] In one incident, a group of fifty men, women, and children – including Australian freelance reporter Roger East – were lined up on a cliff outside of Dili and shot, their bodies falling into the sea. Many such s took place in Dili, where onlookers were ordered to observe and count aloud as each person was executed. It is estimated that at least 2,000 Timorese were massacred in the first two days of the invasion in Dili alone. In addition to Fretilin supporters, Chinese migrants were also singled out for execution; five hundred were killed in the first day alone.|$|E
500|$|Likewise, {{in their}} article [...] "Wake up call from 'Stars on the Ground'" [...] for the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T.

They also felt it blended [...] "modern professional knowledge" [...] with a [...] "humane approach" [...] in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the [...] "present age where everyone is in a restless hurry". The pair wrote, [...] "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading {{to a state of}} mass scale mindlessness even as <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" [...] The film depicts how [...] "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan [...] "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities". Overall, the pair found a [...] "naive oversimplification" [...] in the film. With India [...] "only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability", however, they [...] "easily [...] under artistic license".|$|E

500|$|Critics {{disagreed}} {{about how}} successful {{the film was}} in capturing the novel's ambiguity, {{which is part of}} the enduring appeal of James's story. For Tim Dowling, a columnist for The Guardian, the film failed in this regard. The novella, Dowling explained, can be understood as a straightforward ghost story, but it can also be understood as a story about Ann's madness, and there is further ambiguity concerning whether the <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> controlled by Quint and Jessel, or whether the children are controlling Ann. He suggested that [...] "there's probably a subtlety to all this ambiguity on the page which, when translated to the screen, just looks like having it both ways." [...] As a result, [...] "the narrative was at times more evasive than ambiguous". Whittaker felt that the film failed to appropriately present the novella's ambiguity and implicit themes, saying that the adaptation [...] "feels oddly obligated to fill in all those blanks, and it's really the script's fault". Sutcliffe expressed a similar view; for example, he noted that [...] "when the governess sees Quint on the tower for the first time so do we, and the thing that really haunts us as we read the story—uncertainty—vanishes to be replaced by a much duller kind of fretfulness, about when something is next going to pop out at us." [...] By contrast, Chater and Teeman (both writing for The Times) felt the ambiguity of the film was praiseworthy, with Chater asking whether the ghosts truly exist or are just a manifestation of [...] "hysterical imagination", and Teeman suggesting that viewers will be more likely to believe (with Dr Fisher) that Ann's retelling is accurate. The Scotsmans Whitelaw praised Welch's ability to balance the various subtexts of the film while still delivering an effective narrative.|$|E

40|$|Australian {{teachers}} are mandated to report instances of child maltreatment should they suspect a <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> maltreated. Some {{teachers are}} reluctant {{to make a report}} based on suspicion alone. This review examines the barriers that may prevent teachers from reporting. It is suggested that to overcome these barriers and form a reasonable belief that a <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> maltreated, teachers may attempt to seek out proof by questioning the suspected victim. Inappropriate questioning can have detrimental consequences such as wrongful reporting when maltreatment is not occurring, or worse, no report made when a <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> maltreated. Based on the review of the literature presented in this paper and given the changing landscape of mandatory reporting in Australia, research is recommended. First, to determine if the barriers for reporting still hold true and, secondly, to establish the motivations of teachers who may question a child when they suspect maltreatment, along with exploration on how they approach this task...|$|R
