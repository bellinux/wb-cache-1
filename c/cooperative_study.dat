500|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} {{is largely}} preventable by screening. Current guidelines require that all babies {{of less than}} 32weeks gestational age or having a birth weight less than [...] should be screened for retinopathy of prematurity at least every two weeks. The National <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Study</b> in 1954 showed a causal link between supplemental oxygen and retinopathy of prematurity, but subsequent curtailment of supplemental oxygen caused an increase in infant mortality. To balance the risks of hypoxia and retinopathy of prematurity, modern protocols now require monitoring of blood oxygen levels in premature infants receiving oxygen.|$|E
