5|$|Artistic design, {{including}} <b>character</b> and monster creations, {{was handled}} by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from Final Fantasy through Final FantasyVI. Amano also handled title logo designs {{for all of}} the main series and the image illustrations from Final FantasyVII onward. Tetsuya Nomura was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura's designs were more adaptable to 3D graphics. He worked with the series from Final FantasyVII through Final FantasyX; for Final FantasyIX, however, <b>character</b> designs were handled by Shukō Murase, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa. Nomura is also the <b>character</b> designer of the Kingdom Hearts series, Compilation of Final FantasyVII, and Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy.

5|$|Because he was {{developed}} to be Naruto's opposite, Kishimoto remarked that Sasuke was the most memorable <b>character</b> for him to design.

He also considered Sasuke his most challenging <b>character</b> to create, because his design gave Kishimoto a number of problems. He lacked a proper idea of what Sasuke's face should look like, and his initial drafts of Sasuke appeared too old or mature for a <b>character</b> {{the same age as}} Naruto. Original designs of Sasuke had a number of necklaces and ties around his arms and legs a result of Kishimoto's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible. Realizing he could not draw such a complex <b>character</b> on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to be a basic contrast of Naruto's costume.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{development}} of Final Fantasy X, game scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{was concerned about the}} relationship between the player and the main <b>character</b> in a Final Fantasy title and wanted {{to try to make the}} story easier to follow. Since the player and the main <b>character</b> find themselves in a new world, Nojima wanted Tidus' understanding of that world to track the player's progress in the game. Nojima felt that Tidus was the easiest <b>character</b> to draw in the first half of Final Fantasy X, because <b>character</b> and player learn about the storyline together. Nojima created a brief description of Tidus for <b>character</b> designer Tetsuya Nomura, and Nomura created a sketch for input from Nojima and other staff members. Nomura was asked to design Tidus differently from the game's theme so he would stand out. Movie director Hiroshi Kuwabara noted the difficulty the developers had in making Tidus and the other main characters realistic. The staff wanted to use an undead person as a playable <b>character,</b> and Tidus was meant to be that <b>character.</b> During Final Fantasy X development, however, Nojima saw a film with a similar idea for its protagonist. The role of an undead person was then given to a secondary <b>character,</b> Auron.|$|E

During the series' debut season, both the <b>character</b> and Hatcher's performance received positive critical reception; however, as the series progressed, the <b>character</b> was received less favorably by critics and fans.
