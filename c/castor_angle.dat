50|$|In May 1896 Arthur Krebs {{patented}} a new automobile, {{fitted with}} an electromagnetic gearbox and a {{layout of the}} front wheels which re-centred them when the steering wheel was left alone, today {{this is known as}} the <b>Castor</b> <b>angle.</b> The Panhard et Levassor company acquired a license to build 500 cars under the name of Clement-Panhard between 1898 and 1902 featuring this innovation.|$|E
50|$|The Saxon-Motodd (marketed as Telelever by BMW) has a {{wishbone}} that mounts to {{the frame}} and supports the monoshock unit. This relieves the forks of any braking and suspension forces. With a Telelever, the trail and <b>castor</b> <b>angle</b> (rake) increases during braking instead of decreasing as with traditional telescopic forks. BMW's boxer twins have been equipped with Telelever forks since 1994, but some newer boxers like the BMW R nineT have reverted to conventional telescopic forks for aesthetic and packaging reasons.|$|E
50|$|The {{caster angle}} or <b>castor</b> <b>angle</b> is the angular {{displacement}} of the steering axis from the vertical axis of a steered wheel in a car, motorcycle, bicycle or other vehicle, measured in the longitudinal direction. It is the angle between the pivot line (in a car an imaginary line {{that runs through the}} centre of the upper ball joint to the centre of the lower ball joint) and vertical. Car racers sometimes adjust caster angle to optimise their car's handling characteristics in particular driving situations.|$|E
5000|$|The Telelever system's main {{benefit is}} that it {{separates}} the steering function from the braking and suspension functions Braking forces are taken back via the wishbone, thereby eliminating brake dive. During braking, the trail and <b>castor</b> <b>angle</b> (rake) increases instead of decreasing as with traditional telescopic forks.Some riders used to conventional forks reported that the Telelever can initially lack [...] "feel", and {{that the absence of}} dive is initially disconcerting; but the R1100S BoxerCup Replika (a model with its own race series) shows that the Telelever fork provides responsive and predictable handling.|$|E

40|$|Steering {{performance}} parameters are the measures defined {{in this thesis}} to quantify the steering behavior of vehicles. The parameters are important for the earlier stages of the design process and therefore a good understanding on how these parameters may change when designing the suspension is vital. The objective of this work {{is to establish a}} general frame that describes the relation between the steering {{performance parameters}} and the suspension design factors regardless of the suspension type. The work was done by studying one steering performance parameter, namely forces in the steering rack under a simulated driving condition. A population of different suspension configurations with different design factors was studied. A model of a McPherson suspension, including both kinematics and steering forces, was developed in Matlab to simulate these scenarios and gather all the necessary data for the study. Different suspension configurations with different design factors were simulated in this environment and the output forces and other steering parameters were statistically post processed to find trends and confidence intervals to find the relations. The objective of the statistical analysis was to find a model that isolated the effect of each suspension design factor on the different steering performance parameters. Linear regression models were used to fit the data and variability of the estimators was specially studied. The result of the study evidenced the difficulty of this problem. There is only statistically significant relation between castor trail and <b>castor</b> <b>angle</b> with all the steering performance parameters studied. The statistical study also reveals a close relation of the suspension design factors between themselves and the same for the steering performance parameters...|$|E
