50|$|The victors were {{concerned}} {{not just with}} carrying away the collection and thus stripping the <b>Calvinist</b> <b>party</b> {{of one of its}} most important intellectual symbols; they also had wanted to eliminate all documentation of its provenance. The capture of the Palatine library was a carefully orchestrated symbolic act of looting in the Thirty Years' War, and triggered further acts of similar confiscations throughout the course of the hostilities.|$|E
50|$|The Coronis {{had been}} {{primarily}} {{prepared for the}} Synod of Dort, which sat from 13 November 1618 until 9 May 1619. At this synod the position of Ames was anomalous. The High Church party in England had induced Vere to dismiss him from the chaplaincy; {{but he was still}} held in reverence. It was arranged he should attend the synod, and he was retained by the <b>Calvinist</b> <b>party</b> at four florins a day to watch the proceedings. He was adviser to Johannes Bogerman, the synod's President.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{scholars}} in party research have {{focused attention on}} questions of adaptation and change. This article isolates one particular phenomenon of party change—party merger—and presents a heuristic framework which seeks to explain why parties merge. The heuristic framework identifies three different types of factors that may act as catalysts for parties to merge: intra-party factors (within parties), inter-party factors (between potential merging partners), and contextual factors. These three different types of factors and their complex interplay are discussed and subsequently examined {{with reference to the}} merger process of two small Dutch <b>Calvinist</b> <b>parties,</b> the GPV and RPF, into the ChristenUnie...|$|R

5000|$|Reactions were predictable: Telegraaf {{columnist}} Leo Riemens {{referred to}} the show as [...] "filth" [...] and [...] "pornography", and letters to the various editors struck the same chords. Other newspapers, though, were more positive, and the commentary in parliament by SGP representative C. N. van Dis (the Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij is a small, orthodox, <b>Calvinist</b> <b>party),</b> who strongly criticized the Minister of Culture Marga Klompé for allowing women to be degraded, did not meet with approval in parliament or the press. The VPRO anticipated angry letters from some of its members, and had prepared a standard reply in which the organization said it understood that not everyone would agree with the show's message, but that it {{wanted to be an}} [...] "open organization" [...] which could adjust to the rapidly changing attitudes toward society's norms.|$|E
50|$|In 1615 {{he added}} to his other preferments the rectory of St. Christopher-le-Stocks {{in the city of}} London, which he held till 1620. In January 1616 he was {{presented}} to the fifth stall as a Canon of Christ Church Cathedral, which he exchanged for the eighth stall 16 December 1618, holding it in commendam till 1632. In 1618 he received from his patron, Bishop King, the prebendal stall of Wildland in St. Paul's Cathedral, holding with it the office of divinity reader. As canon of Christ Church he resided chiefly at Oxford, and, though not the head of a house, served the office of vice-chancellor in 1621-4. As vice-chancellor he used his authority to oppose the <b>Calvinist</b> <b>party</b> in the university, and he secured a D.D. degree for the royalist Robert Sibthorpe. He encouraged the Doctrine of Grace, which rejected predestination and moved towards a more universal truth and divine forgiveness. However, in his early career he still held onto Calvinism.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 18th century, Enlightenment {{ideas of}} the power of reason and free will became {{widespread}} among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, <b>Calvinist</b> <b>parties.</b> When the Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected to the chair in 1805, and the liberal Samuel Webber was appointed to the presidency of Harvard two years later, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, Arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas).|$|R

Nevertheless, after much struggle the Unitarian Henry Ware was elected in 1805, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional, Calvinist ideas at Harvard to the dominance, of liberal, Arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas). The appointment of Ware, with the election of the liberal Samuel Webber to the presidency of Harvard two years later, led Jedidiah Morse and other conservatives to found the Andover Theological Seminary as an orthodox, trinitarian alternative to the Harvard Divinity School.|$|R
2500|$|The Reformed Political Party ( [...] , SGP) is an {{orthodox}} <b>Calvinist</b> political <b>party</b> in the Netherlands. The term Reformed {{is not a}} reference to political reform, but is a synonym for Calvinism—a major branch of Protestantism. The SGP is the oldest political party in the Netherlands in its current form, and has for its entire existence been in opposition. The party has, owing to its orthodox political ideals and its traditional role in the opposition, been called a testimonial party.|$|R
50|$|He did {{his best}} in his Via media, The Way of Peace (1619), to persuade the two <b>parties</b> (<b>Calvinist</b> and Arminian) to accept a compromise. His later defence of the English Church, and episcopacy as Biblical, {{entitled}} Episcopacy by Divine Right (1640), was twice revised at Laud's dictation.|$|R

In some elections, it forms an alliance with the <b>Calvinist</b> Reformed Political <b>Party</b> (SGP), which, unlike the CU, is a testimonial party.|$|R
50|$|He was {{appointed}} Professor of Theology at the University of Heidelberg in 1557. He served as {{dean of the}} theological faculty, and Frederick III tapped him {{to serve on the}} church council due to his Reformed opinions. In June 1560, he participated in a disputation with Saxon Lutherans from the court of John Frederick II on the Lord’s Supper, chiefly against Johann Stössel. He also he participated in the Maulbronn Colloquy in April 1564, a debate with the Lutheran theologians of Württemberg, chiefly Jakob Andreae, over the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. There is currently no consensus on how large a role should be attributed to Boquin in the composition of the Heidelberg Catechism, although he was certainly a prime theological authority in that period alongside the principal author Zacharias Ursinus. He supported the doctoral promotion of the Englishman George Withers at the University of Heidelberg in 1568, which in part helped to ignite the controversy over church discipline between the <b>Calvinist</b> disciplinist <b>party</b> and Thomas Erastus.|$|R
40|$|This chapter investigates whether {{changes in}} {{religious}} and class voting in the Netherlands {{can be interpreted}} by social and political factors. From the social perspective we focus on compositional changes, education, changes in the class structure, and religious integration. From the political perspective we {{examine the impact of}} merging political parties and changes in party positions. Employing Election Surveys (1971 – 2006) and Manifesto-data, reveals that the rise of the class of social-cultural specialists is important for understanding changes in the class–vote relationship. Although party positions are relevant they do little to explain the decline in class-based voting. Weakening religious integration largely explains the decline of political boundaries between non-religious voters and Catholics and <b>Calvinists.</b> After taking <b>party</b> positions into account the effect of the CDA-merger no longer reduced religious based voting, suggesting that the merger resulted in a revised ideological choice set facing voters. Furthermore, religious voting increases when traditional moral issues in manifestos are emphasized...|$|R
50|$|In 1922 he {{accepted}} the political leadership of the Anti Revolutionary <b>Party</b> (<b>Calvinist)</b> from Dr. Abraham Kuyper. Already one year later he succeeded resigning minister Dirk Jan de Geer as Minister of Finance. In 1925 Colijn also became prime minister, but a year later Colijn had to step down when the House of Representatives accepted a resolution by Gerrit Hendrik Kersten of the Protestant Reformed Political Party which called for diplomatic ties with the Vatican to be broken. This was unacceptable to the Roman-Catholic State Party then in government. Colijn {{then returned to the}} Senate, and from 1927 to 1929, he served as head of the Dutch delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva. At the elections of 1929 he was elected for the House of Representatives, and immediately became Parliamentary leader of his party. This proved to be a success: at the elections of 1933 the ARP gained two seats, and Colijn became Prime Minister again. From 1933 - 1939 he served four more times as prime minister. During the 1930s his government faced the effects of the Great Depression, which took a heavy toll on the Netherlands. Colijn's government responded to the economic crisis with a very strict fiscal policy, which may have further weakened the Dutch economy. Colijn's decision to adhere to the Gold Standard until 1937, long after most of the trading partners of the Netherlands had dropped it, also played a role in lengthening the economic crisis. In 1939, his latest cabinet, with Protestant and liberal ministers but without Catholic ministers, lasted only three days before a government crisis.|$|R
