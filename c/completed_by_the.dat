5|$|A {{population-based}} study <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> National Alcohol Research Center {{found that}} women who identify as lesbian or bisexual are less likely to abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The {{central part of the}} shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.|$|E

A {{majority of the}} film focuses on events surrounding Ip Man {{that took place in}} Foshan in the 1930s and 1940s during the Sino-Japanese War. Since the buildings in modern-day Foshan are architecturally different from the ones of the film's period, the filmmakers decided to shoot the film in Shanghai.|$|E
5|$|The 104 designation, {{whether it}} be US104 or NY104, has shifted from surface streets to expressways and super twos, {{particularly}} from Rochester east to Oswego.

5|$|The {{end of the}} Indian Wars further {{expanded}} acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses {{for international}} markets. Mainland expansion was <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.|$|E
5|$|The first Zephyr (9900) was <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Budd Company on April 9, 1934, {{powered by}} an eight-cylinder, 600-horsepower (447kW), 8-201-A model Winton engine. Like the {{diesel-electric}} locomotives that soon displaced the steam locomotive on American railroads, this engine powered an electrical generator; the electricity it generated was then fed to electric traction motors {{connected to the}} axles in the train's front truck.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} {{conditions}} {{were the most}} controversial, though after {{one and a half}} years, a compromise was reached: only buildings actually in use would be repaired, and pensions would be paid, but only when the officers actually retired.

The transfer was intended to be <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of 1885, but was not finalised until 31 March 1886.|$|E
