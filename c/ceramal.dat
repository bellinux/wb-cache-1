40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is {{to demonstrate that the}} resistance of ceramic and <b>ceramal</b> materials to thermal shock can he determined by analyzing the nonsteady thermal stresses in the material. First the nonuniform temperature distribution is computed by using the heat conduction equation. This temperature distribution is then used to compute the thermal stress. The material parameters which enter into the calculations are the coefficients of thermal conduction and of thermal expansion, the ultimate strength, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio of the material. These quantities together with the heating conditions then specify the resistance to thermal shock. The theory is verified by comparing the results with NACA test data...|$|E
40|$|Some results, {{following}} Gibbs and Murnaghan, on {{the general}} thermodynamical properties of a continuous and isotropic medium are reviewed in Part I. These discussions lead to the formulation of various thermodynamic functions for a thermo-elastic solid in small strain. The expression for the free energy is useful, in particular, for approximate solutions of thermal stress problems involving either steady or transient heating. Also in Part I, a rather general condition is established under which the inertia effect due to transient thermal expansions may be neglected. Conditions under which temperature distributions may be calculated independently of stresses and strains are also given. Attention {{is given to the}} order of approximations involved in such simplifications. The general results in Part I are applied to two problems in Part II and Part III. The problem of thermal shock, a type of failure due to sudden heating or cooling, is studied in Part II. The analytic results obtained there are compared with the experimental results on thermal shock carried out by N. A. C. A. investigators on circular ceramic and <b>ceramal</b> dics. The correlation between theory and experiment is considered satisfactory. Thermal stresses in thin cylindrical shells and plates are formulated and discussed in Part III. It is assumed that the temperature varies only across the thickness, and the Young's modulus may be an arbitrary function of temperature. A convention regarding the choice of the reference surface is introduced, by means of which the present theory becomes comparable to the ordinary theory of plates and shells. Methods based on similarity considerations are devised such that the resulting stresses and strains in a shell or plate caused by temperature gradient and external loads can be predicted by experimenting with a similar specimen at a uniform temperature. These considerations are motivated by the necessity to overcome the difficulties both in analytic calculations and experimental measurements of stresses and strains at elevated temperatures, especially when transient heating and complicated loads are involved. Such a situation arises, for example, in the combustion chamber of a rocket engine, where stresses produced by supporting seats are often too complicated to compute by purely analytical methods. </p...|$|E
40|$|Zirconium boride ZrB 2 <b>ceramals</b> were {{investigated}} for possible gas-turbine-blade application. Included {{in the study}} were thermal shock evaluations of disks, preliminary turbine-blade operation, and observations of oxidation resistance. Thermal shock disks of the following three compositions were studied: (a) 97. 5 percent ZrB 2 plus 2. 5 percent B by weight; (b) 92. 5 percent ZrB 2 plus 7. 5 percent B by weight; and (c) 100 percent ZrB 2. Thermal shock disks were quenched from temperatures of 1800 degrees, 2000 degrees, 2200 degrees, and 2400 degrees F. The life of turbine blades containing 93 percent ZrB 2 plus 7 percent B by weight was determined in gas-turbine tests. The blades were run at approximately 1600 degrees F and 15, 000 to 26, 000 rpm.
