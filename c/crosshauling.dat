The two sectors share a pair of domestic productive facton, including labor and perhaps natural resources, energy, or skilled labor. A higher price o f inkmotional capital in one secror auxs that capital to leave the cconomy, but may lead to capital ctosshauling. Prices of damesuc factors are altered, which raises the potential of using taxcs on interoationalcapird to influence income distribution With the higher price of intwtional capital, output may rive in oue sixlor and fa 11 in the othet, or both outputs may rise Qr ffl. D q a e s of factor intensily and factor substitution determine whether <b>crosshauling</b> of capital or another partem of international capital movemenl occurs. Resource booms and varioun condiiions of Dutch disease are also studied. 1...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a working}} paper. We examine the R&D and export {{decisions}} of two ex ante symmetric firms in symmetric countries, with both unit trade costs and fixed entry {{costs to the}} export market. When both trade costs are low, {{there will be a}} symmetric, cross-hauling duopoly, but if fixed costs are fairly high, unit trade costs are low and R&D is relatively cheap, there will be an asymmetric entry equilibrium, in which the exporting firm carries out higher R&D, has lower costs and larger profits. With higher R&D costs and/or higher unit trade costs, there will also be a zone where <b>crosshauling</b> duopoly and non-trading are simultaneously Nash equilibria...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper we}} intend to present aims to {{estimate}} the trade flows existing between the seven Portuguese regions, considering 49 distinct commodities. This estimation {{is based on the}} construction of a multi-regional model that requires the elaboration of an Input-Output table for each one of the regions. These tables were achieved by using non-survey methods, having the Portuguese table as a starting point. However, it was possible to work, on a great part of the estimation procedure, with a considerable high level of detail: 291 commodities and 276 industries. The first proxy to the trade flows was obtained considering that the interregional net exports corresponded to the difference between total resources (supply) and total employment (demand) of the 49 commodities. These values were then modified in order to consider the existence of <b>crosshauling.</b> Finally, gravitational models were used to get to the final values of the trade flows between the seven regions. ...|$|E
40|$|Future {{transport}} networks serving next generation accesses {{are expected to}} carry both fronthaul (FH) and backhaul (BH) traffic simultaneously. This new concept of network which integrates the FH and BH traffic over the same transport substrate is called <b>Crosshaul.</b> A <b>Crosshaul</b> network will use heterogeneous technologies, such as fiber, mmWave, or microwave, and selects the most appropriates ones depending on the use case. Moreover, the softwarization/virtualization trend on the networking industry indicates that Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) will process and exchange both BH and FH data plane traffic. This paper presents performance measurements on promising technologies {{for the implementation of}} a <b>Crosshaul</b> network. We investigate to which extent the requirements to carry FH traffic are satisfied by mmWave links, software and multi-layer hardware switches...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we use {{a spatial}} {{competition}} model developed by Pal (1998) to analyze producer imposed retail price ceilings and producer assigned exclusive geographic sales territories. Two wholesale distributors are presumed to each have a single collection point respectively from which they supply retail outlets at many locations. Each wholesaler chooses the quantity to ship to each outlet and the retail prices attain market clearing levels. Given {{that the costs of}} shipping depend on distance, this system results in a kind of waste in that the products are not shipped exclusively from the nearest collection point. As pointed out by Matsumura (2002) this wasteful <b>crosshauling</b> can be prevented if the manufacturer assigns exclusive geographic territories to the distributors. But the costs of administering an exclusive territory system may well outweigh any savings in shipping costs. In this instance a manufacturer stipulated price ceiling may be the preferred alternative. By controlling not only the manufacturer price but also the retail priceat each location, the manufacturer can deter wasteful cross-hauling and expand the overall channel profit, while also conferring enlarged consumer surplus...|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of both fronthaul and backhaul {{into a single}} transport network (namely, 5 G-Crosshaul) is envisioned for the future 5 G transport networks. This requires a fully integrated and unified management of the fronthaul and backhaul resources in a cost-efficient, scalable and flexible way through the deployment of an SDN/NFV control framework. This paper presents the designed 5 G-Crosshaul architecture, two selected SDN/NFV applications targeting for cost-efficient resource and energy usage: the Resource Management Application (RMA) and the Energy Management and Monitoring Application (EMMA). The former manages 5 G-Crosshaul resources (network, computing and storage resources). The latter is a special version of RMA with {{the focus on the}} objectives of optimizing the energy consumption and minimizing the energy footprint of the 5 G-Crosshaul infrastructure. Besides, EMMA is applied to the mmWave mesh network and the high speed train scenarios. In particular, we present the key application design with their main components and the interactions {{with each other and with}} the control plane, and then we present the proposed application optimization algorithms along with initial results. The first results demonstrate that the proposed RMA is able to cost-efficiently utilize the <b>Crosshaul</b> resources of heterogeneous technologies, while EMMA can achieve significant energy savings through energy-efficient routing of traffic flows. For experiments in real system, we also set up Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for both applications in order to perform real trials in the field...|$|R
