40|$|Abstract. —Although the {{proposition}} that higher taxa should correspond to <b>clades</b> is widely accepted, current nomenclature does not distinguish clearly between different <b>clades</b> in nested series. In particular, the same name is often applied to a total <b>clade,</b> its crown <b>clade,</b> and <b>clades</b> originating with various nodes, branches, and apomorphies in between. An integrated system of <b>clade</b> names is described based on categories of <b>clades</b> defined with respect to lineages that have survived to the present time. In this system, the most widely known names are applied to crown <b>clades,</b> the names of total <b>clades</b> are formed by adding a standard prefix to {{the names of the}} corresponding crowns, and the names of apomorphy <b>clades</b> describe the specific apomorphies with which they originated. Relative to traditional approaches, this integrated approach to naming <b>clades</b> is both more precise concerning the associations of names with particular <b>clades</b> and more efficient with regard to the cognitive effort required to recognize the names of corresponding crown and total <b>clades.</b> It also seems preferable to five alternatives {{that could be used to}} make the same distinctions.

40|$|Haemostasis is {{a highly}} {{regulated}} system, involving a myriad of cell types (endothelium, immune cells, platelets, etc.), proteins (enzymes, receptors, etc.) and signalling molecules (sterols, nucleotides, etc.). Haematophagous organisms, such as ticks, have evolved a number of strategies to overcome host haemostatic responses to feed effectively. Salivary apyrases are a class of nucleotide-metabolising enzymes that blood-feeding parasites utilise to modulate extracellular nucleotides, like ATP and ADP, to prevent platelet activation and aggregation. This specific enzyme function has evolved in blood-feeding parasites from the ecto-ATPdase/CD 39 (E-NTPDases) -, Cimex-type- and 5 ’-nucleotidase/CD 73 enzyme families. Furthermore, most arthropod apyrases are ascribed to the 5 ’-nucleotidase/CD 73 enzyme family. The salivary apyrase from Ornithodoros savignyi has not been characterised to a specific enzyme family {{and the presence of}} 5 ’-nucleotidase homologs have not been demonstrated. Therefore, in this study 5 ’-nucleotidase homologous transcripts were identified from O. savignyi salivary gland DNA, using a 5 ’-nucleotidase specific degenerate primer and RACE protocols. Two full-length putative 5 ’-nucleotidase isoforms were identified that shared significant sequence identity and similarity to a 5 ’-nucleotidase from R. (B.) microplus and putative apyrases from I. scapularis and R. appendiculatus. Utilising computational tools, iso-electric points, molecular weights and cellular localisation were determined. The isoforms were predicted to be soluble secreted proteins, which correlated with the trend observed for parasitic apyrases in the 5 ’-nucleotidase family. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5 ’-nucleotidase family revealed that the O. savignyi 5 ’-nucleotidase isoforms <b>claded</b> monophyletically with the putative apyrases from I. scapularis and R. appendiculatus, excluding the 5 ’-nucleotidase from R. (B.) microplus. Molecular modelling of these two proteins showed a similar protein structure to a periplasmic ecto- 5 ’-nucleotidase from E. coli. The similar architecture revealed a high conservation of key residues involved in dimetal coordination, catalysis and substrate binding, therefore a similar catalytic mechanism was proposed. It was hypothesised that the isoforms identified may be putative apyrases. To test this hypothesis, the 5 ’-nucleotidase isoform I was recombinantly expressed in yeast. Cross-reactivity was demonstrated with a polyclonal anti-apyrase antibody produced from O. savignyi native apyrase. The latter implied that the native apyrase may {{be a member of the}} 5 ’-nucleotidase enzyme family. However, no sequence information for native apyrase was available for comparison and therefore native enzyme was purified with ion exchange chromatography. Subsequent, Edman N-terminal sequencing and MS/MS analysis with purified enzyme identified peptide sequence fragments that shared a high degree of sequence identity with both 5 ’-nucleotidase isoforms. It was concluded that native apyrase is a mixture of the isoforms identified from O. savignyi salivary gland DNA. These results represent the first confirmation of a tick apyrase that belongs to the 5 ’-nucleotidase family of enzymes. Further confirmation will be achieved by testing activity of the recombinant protein and future experiments may assess the potential of this protein as a vaccine candidate.
