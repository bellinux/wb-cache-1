5|$|In November 1125 Taizong {{ordered his}} armies {{to attack the}} Song. The {{defection}} of Zhang Jue two years earlier served as the <b>casus</b> <b>belli.</b> Two armies were sent to capture the major cities of the Song.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} Russian merchants within Shamakhi were {{subsequently}} {{used as a}} <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> for the Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723, leading to the cessation of trade between Iran and Russia and the designation of Astrakhan as the new terminus on the Volga trade route.|$|E
5|$|The {{ostensible}} reason given {{was that}} Britain {{was required to}} safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the 1839 Treaty of London. The German invasion of Belgium was, therefore, the <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> and, importantly, legitimized and galvanized popular support for the war.|$|E
5|$|Using a Magyar {{invasion}} in {{the lands of}} the neighbouring Slavs in 896 as a <b>casus</b> <b>belli,</b> Simeon headed against the Magyars together with his Pecheneg allies, defeating them completely in the Battle of Southern Buh and making them leave Etelköz forever and settle in Pannonia. Following {{the defeat of the}} Magyars, Simeon finally released the Byzantine prisoners in exchange for Bulgarians captured in 895.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius' {{accession}} as Emperor {{did little}} to reduce the Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign by attempting {{to make peace with}} the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original <b>casus</b> <b>belli,</b> had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious. According to historian Walter Kaegi, it is conceivable that the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by destroying the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to conclusively prove this.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{began to}} plan his revenge. With {{the help of}} Pembroke, the King formed a small {{coalition}} of his half-brothers, {{a few of the}} earls and some of the senior clergy, and prepared for war. Edward started with Bartholomew of Badlesmere, and Isabella was sent to Bartholomew's stronghold, Leeds Castle, to deliberately create a <b>casus</b> <b>belli.</b> Bartholomew's wife, Margaret, took the bait and her men killed several of Isabella's retinue, giving Edward an excuse to intervene. Lancaster refused to help Bartholomew, who was his personal enemy, and Edward quickly regained control of south-east England. Alarmed, Lancaster now mobilised his own army in the north of England, and Edward mustered his own forces in the south-west. The Despensers returned from exile and were pardoned by the royal council.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to his homeland, Pyrrhus {{found himself in a}} {{difficult}} position. His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and crippled his army, leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment. In order to secure funds to pay his troops, Pyrrhus planned a war against Antigonus II Gonatas, the new king of Macedon. Citing Antigonus' refusal to provide him with aid during his Italian expedition as a <b>casus</b> <b>belli,</b> Pyrrhus invaded Macedon in the spring of 274 BC. He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry although their numbers were probably augmented by Gallic mercenaries. It has been speculated that by invading Macedon, Pyrrhus was acting as the agent of the monarchs of Ptolemaic Egypt, Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, however N. G. L. Hammond posits that this is highly unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Zanzibar War was a {{military}} conflict fought between the United Kingdom and the Zanzibar Sultanate on 27 August 1896. The conflict lasted between 38 and 45 minutes, marking it as the shortest recorded war in history. The immediate cause {{of the war was}} the death of the pro-British Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini on 25 August 1896 and the subsequent succession of Sultan Khalid bin Barghash. The British authorities preferred Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan. In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886, a condition for accession to the sultanate was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British consul, and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> and sent an ultimatum to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.|$|E
5|$|The <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> {{have been}} stated as a Burmese attempt to expand their {{territory}} eastwards after a political crisis in Ayutthaya {{as well as an}} attempt to stop Siamese incursions into the upper Tenasserim coast. The war, according to the Burmese, began in January 1547 when Siamese forces conquered the frontier town of Tavoy (Dawei). Later in the year, the Burmese forces led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein retook the Upper Tenasserim coast down to Tavoy. Next year, in October 1548, three Burmese armies led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung invaded Siam through the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces penetrated up to the capital city of Ayutthaya but could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. But the Burmese negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the return of two important Siamese nobles (the heir apparent Prince Ramesuan, and Prince Thammaracha of Phitsanulok) whom they had captured.|$|E
5|$|Ivan IV {{regarded}} the Livonian Confederation's {{approach to the}} Polish–Lithuanian union for protection under the Treaty of Pozvol as <b>casus</b> <b>belli.</b> In 1554 Livonia and Russia had signed a fifteen-year truce in which Livonia agreed not to enter into an alliance with Poland–Lithuania. In January 1558, Ivan reacted with the invasion of Livonia. The Russians were seen by local peasants as liberators from the German control of Livonia. Many Livonian fortresses surrendered without resistance while Russian troops took Dorpat in May, Narva in July, and laid siege to Reval. Reinforced by 1,200 landsknechte, 100 gunners and ammunition from Germany, Livonian forces successfully retook Wesenberg (Rakvere) along {{with a number of}} other fortresses. Although the Germans raided Russian territory, Dorpat, Narva and many lesser fortresses remained in Russian hands. The initial Russian advance was led by the Khan of Kasimov Shahghali, with two other Tartar princes {{at the head of a}} force that included Russian boiars, Tartar and pomest'e cavalry as well as cossacks, who at that time were mostly armed foot soldiers. Ivan gained further ground in campaigns during the years 1559 and 1560. In January 1559, Russian forces again invaded Livonia. A six-month truce covering May to November was signed between Russia and Livonia while Russia fought in the Russo-Crimean Wars.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg's {{resources}} were worn out after {{over a decade}} of continuous war. Alfonso and the pope could not provide for him fully, while Venice continued to undermine Skanderbeg. The latter considered war with Skanderbeg since he maintained his alliance with Aragon. Relations with the Italian state worsened further when Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's elusive ally in the north, captured Dagnum. Even though Skanderbeg {{did not participate in}} this, Venice used it as a <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> to launch an expedition against Skanderbeg. War never started but Albanian-Venetian relations sunk to their lowest point. The Venetian rectors continued to provoke Skanderbeg {{at a time when he}} had grown relatively weak due to his nephew and one of his most important officers, Hamza Kastrioti, deserting and joining the Ottomans. Hamza had become dissatisfied with Skanderbeg's growing power and, upon being received by the sultan, was offered control over much of Albania once conquered. Stung by the betrayal, Skanderbeg offered an ultimatum to Venice where they had to halt their provocations or begin war. Since a crusade was anticipated against the Ottomans, Venice did not want to seem pro-Ottoman and eased their stance towards Albania.|$|E
5|$|Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing) led a coup against Emperor Xizong {{and became}} fourth emperor of the Jin dynasty in 1150. Wanyan Liang {{presented}} {{himself as a}} Chinese emperor, and planned to unite China by conquering the Song. In 1158, Wanyan Liang provided a <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> by announcing that the Song had broken the 1142 peace treaty by acquiring horses. He instituted an unpopular draft that {{was the source of}} widespread unrest in the empire. Anti-Jin revolts erupted among the Khitans and in Jin provinces bordering the Song. Wanyan Liang did not allow dissent, and opposition to the war was severely punished. The Song had been notified beforehand of Wanyan Liang's plan. They prepared by securing their defenses along the border, mainly near the Yangtze River, but were hampered by Emperor Gaozong's indecisiveness. Gaozong's desire for peace made him averse to provoking the Jin. Wanyan Liang began the invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war. Jurchen armies personally led by Wanyan Liang left Kaifeng on October 15, reached the Huai River border on October 28, and marched {{in the direction of the}} Yangtze. The Song lost the Huai to the Jurchens but captured a few Jin prefectures in the west, slowing the Jurchen advance. A group of Jurchen generals were sent to cross the Yangtze near the city of Caishi (south of Ma'anshan in modern Anhui) while Wanyan Liang established a base near Yangzhou.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} both iron and blood soon became apparent. By 1862, when Bismarck made his speech, {{the idea of}} a German {{nation-state}} in the peaceful spirit of Pan-Germanism had shifted from the liberal and democratic character of 1848 to accommodate Bismarck's more conservative Realpolitik. Ever the pragmatist, Bismarck understood the possibilities, obstacles, and advantages of a unified state. He also understood the importance of linking that state to the Hohenzollern dynasty, which for some historians remains one of Bismarck's primary contributions {{to the creation of the}} German Empire in 1871. While the conditions of the treaties binding the various German states to one another prohibited Bismarck from taking unilateral action, the politician and diplomat in him realized the impracticality of such an action. In order to get the German states to unify, Bismarck needed a single, outside enemy that would declare war on one of the German states first, thus providing a <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> to rally all Germans behind. This opportunity arose with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Historians have long debated Bismarck's role in the events leading up to the war. The traditional view, promulgated in large part by late 19th and early 20th century pro-Prussian historians, maintains that Bismarck's intent was always German unification. Post-1945 historians, however, see more short-term opportunism and cynicism in Bismarck's manipulation of the circumstances to create a war, rather than a grand scheme to unify a nation-state. Regardless, Bismarck was neither villain nor saint: by manipulating events of 1866 and 1870, he demonstrated the political and diplomatic skill that had caused Wilhelm to turn to him in 1862.|$|E
25|$|In September 1823, the <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> was Burma occupying Shalpuri Island near Chittagong, {{which was}} {{claimed by the}} East India Company.|$|E
25|$|At the Treaty of London, Britain {{also made}} a {{guarantee}} of Belgian neutrality {{that would be the}} stated <b>Casus</b> <b>belli</b> of Britain's entry into World War I.|$|E
25|$|The Bosnian {{uprising}} (also {{known as}} Great Bosnian Uprising) was a revolt of Bosniak ayans (landlords) against the Ottoman Empire. The <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> were reforms {{implemented by the}} Sultan to abolish the ayan system.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{phenomenon}} of jihadism that presents jihad (offensive or defensive) as the <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> for insurgencies, guerrilla warfare and international terrorism, {{dates back to}} the 20th century and draws on early-to-mid-20th century Islamist doctrines such as Qutbism.|$|E
25|$|The <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> was {{the raids}} of the Crimean Tatars on Ukraine {{in the end}} of 1735 and the Crimean khan's {{military}} campaign in the Caucasus. In 1736, the Russian commanders envisioned the seizure of Azov and the Crimea.|$|E
25|$|A heat-seeking missile {{launched}} by a Grumman F11F Tiger that accidentally strikes the port area of Latakia, Syria, setting off secondary explosions, gives the Soviet Union the <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> for preemptive nuclear strikes against the United States in Alas, Babylon, the post-apocalyptic 1959 novel by Pat Frank.|$|E
25|$|Inspectors withdrew in 1998, and disbanded the {{following}} year amid allegations that the United States had used the commission's resources to spy on the Iraqi military. Weapons inspector Scott Ritter later stated that Operation Rockingham had cherry-picked evidence found by the United Nations Special Commission; evidence, he says, that was later used {{as part of the}} <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|British {{negotiations}} with the Iroquois would both prove critical and lead to a Crown policy limiting {{the west of the}} Alleghenies settlements below the Great Lakes, which gave many American would-be migrants a <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> for supporting the American Revolution. The 1778 raids and resultant 1779 decisive Sullivan Expedition reopened the Ohio Country to westward emigration, which began almost immediately, and by 1800 white settlers were pouring westwards.|$|E
25|$|The Lao kingdoms {{remained}} independent until 1779 {{when they}} then would become vassals to Thailand. However, the kingdoms maintained their monarchical roots and {{a degree of}} autonomy. For instance, Vientiane also had a tributary relationship with the Vietnamese court at Huế, a relationship that, {{in the wake of}} the failed Laotian Rebellion for independence (1826–1829) of Anouvong, the last king of Vientiane, became a <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> for the Siamese–Vietnamese War (1831–34).|$|E
25|$|A German {{ultimatum}} was delivered, {{this time}} to Belgium on 2 August, requesting free passage for the German army {{on the way to}} France. King Albert of Belgium refused the German request to violate his country's neutrality. On 3 August, Germany declared war on France, and on Belgium on 4 August. This act violated Belgian neutrality, the status to which Germany, France, and Britain were all committed by treaty; German violation of Belgian neutrality provided the <b>casus</b> <b>belli.</b>|$|E
25|$|However the Sasanians {{used the}} {{deposition}} of the Byzantine emperor Maurice as a <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> {{to attack the}} Empire. After many gains, the Sassanians were defeated at Issus, Constantinople and finally Nineveh, resulting in peace. With {{the conclusion of the}} over 700 years lasting Roman–Persian Wars through the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, which included the very siege of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, the war-exhausted Persians lost the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah (632) in Hilla (present day Iraq) to the invading Muslim forces.|$|E
25|$|The <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> {{were over}} {{the control of}} the Tenasserim coast and its trade, and the Siamese support for ethnic Mon rebels of the fallen Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. The newly founded Konbaung Dynasty had wanted to {{reestablish}} Burmese authority in the upper Tenasserim coast (present-day Mon State) where the Siamese had provided support to the Mon rebels and deployed their troops. The Siamese had refused Burmese demands to hand over the rebel Mon leaders or to stop their intrusions into what the Burmese considered their territory.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{the local}} persecutions of missionary priests of the Paris Foreign Missions Society {{was often a}} pretext for French {{military}} intervention in Asia. In Vietnam, the persecutions were used by the French government to justify the armed interventions of Jean-Baptiste Cécille and Rigault de Genouilly. In China, the murder of Father Auguste Chapdelaine became the <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> for the French involvement in the Second Opium War in 1856. In Korea, persecutions were used to justify the 1866 French campaign against Korea.|$|E
25|$|A second Burmese–Siamese war {{erupted in}} 1563. Maha Chakkraphat's refusal {{to grant the}} Burmese king Bayinnaung with two white {{elephants}} served as the <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> of the conflict. The Burmese first took Phitsanulok, Sawankhalok, Kamphaeng Phet and Sukhothai thus turning them into tributary states, denying Ayutthaya a valuable allies. Ayutthaya's capital was then sacked, while Maha Chakkraphat was forced to become a priest in Bago, Burma. However, he was soon allowed to return home on a pilgrimage during which he abandoned priesthood and returned into power.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, {{this led}} to Israel's {{participation}} alongside Britain and France {{in the war against}} Egypt sparked by the Suez Crisis, while in 1967 90% of Israeli oil passed through the Straits of Tiran. Oil tankers that were due to pass through the straits were delayed. The straits' closure was cited by Israel as an additional <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> leading to the outbreak of the Six-Day War. Following peace treaties signed with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994, Eilat's borders with its neighbors were finally opened.|$|E
25|$|This war was the {{continuation}} of the war of 1759–1760. The <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> of this war was also the control of the Tenasserim coast and its trade, and the Siamese support for the rebels in the Burmese border regions. The war began in August 1765 when a 20,000-strong northern Burmese army invaded northern Siam, and was joined in by three southern armies of over 20,000 in October, in a pincer movement on Ayutthaya. By late January 1766, the Burmese armies had overcome numerically superior but poorly coordinated Siamese defences, and converged before the Siamese capital.|$|E
25|$|Details of the {{incident}} became known to the Japanese public on 17 July 1931. With the news coming soon after the Wanpaoshan Incident, public opinion was further inflamed, increasing anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan. The Japanese military was quick to capitalize on this upsurge in public opinion to demand a stronger foreign policy against China. Some influential and outspoken officers, including Kanji Ishiwara, demanded that {{the incident}} {{be used as a}} <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> to enable the Japanese Army to resolve Japan's position in Manchuria. Chinese authorities eventually agreed to investigate the case, and (per the Lytton Report) diplomatic progress appeared to be made until the Manchurian Incident later that year.|$|E
25|$|Roman Armenia {{refers to}} the rule of parts of Greater Armenia by the Roman Empire, from the 1st century AD to the end of Late Antiquity. While Armenia Minor had become a client state and {{incorporated}} into the Roman Empire proper during the 1st century AD, Greater Armenia remained an independent kingdom under the Arsacid dynasty. Throughout this period, Armenia remained a bone of contention between Rome and the Parthian Empire, as well as the Sasanian Empire that succeeded the latter, and the <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> for several of the Roman–Persian Wars. Only in 114–118 was Emperor Trajan able to conquer and incorporate it as a short-lived province.|$|E
25|$|Over the {{following}} decades, another central dispute over states' rights {{moved to the}} forefront. The issue of slavery polarized the union, with the Jeffersonian principles often being used by both sides—anti-slavery Northerners, and Southern slaveholders and secessionists—in debates that ultimately led to the American Civil War. Supporters of slavery often argued {{that one of the}} rights of the states was the protection of slave property wherever it went, a position endorsed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1857 Dred Scott decision. In contrast, opponents of slavery argued that the non-slave-states' rights were violated both by that decision and by the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Exactly which—and whose—states' rights were the <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> in the Civil War remain in controversy.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} 1873 treaty and the {{imposition}} of the 10 centavos tax {{proved to be the}} <b>casus</b> <b>belli,</b> there were deeper, more fundamental reasons for the outbreak of hostilities in 1879. On the one hand, there was the power, prestige, and relative stability of Chile compared to the economic deterioration and political discontinuity which characterised both Peru and Bolivia after independence. On the other, there was the ongoing competition for economic and political hegemony in the region, complicated by a deep antipathy between Peru and Chile. In this milieu, the vagueness of the boundaries between the three states, coupled with the discovery of valuable guano and nitrate deposits in the disputed territories, combined to produce a diplomatic conundrum of insurmountable proportions.|$|E
25|$|Constantine had, in a {{previous}} war (in 316), defeated Licinius at the Battle of Cibalae and conquered from him all the Balkan Peninsula, {{with the exception of}} Thrace. A peace had been arranged but {{the relationship between the two}} emperors remained uneasy. By 324 Constantine was ready to renew the conflict and when his army, in pursuit of a raiding Visigothic, or possibly Sarmatian, force, crossed into Licinius' territory an opportune <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> was created. The reaction of Licinius to this incursion was overtly hostile and this induced Constantine to go on to the offensive. Constantine invaded Thrace in force; his army was smaller than that of Licinius, but it contained many battle-hardened veterans and, as he had control of the Illyrian region, the finest quality of new recruits.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{momentary}} respite, by {{the autumn of}} 1321 the tensions between Edward and the baronial opposition led by Thomas of Lancaster, were extremely high, with both sides retaining mobilised forces across the country. At this point, Isabella undertook a pilgrimage to Canterbury, during which she left the traditional route to stop at Leeds Castle, a fortification held by Bartholomew de Badlesmere, steward of the King's household who had by 1321 {{joined the ranks of}} Edward's opponents. Historians believe that the pilgrimage was a deliberate act by Isabella on Edward's behalf to create a <b>casus</b> <b>belli.</b> Lord Badlesmere was away at the time, having left his wife Margaret in charge of the castle. When the latter adamantly refused the Queen admittance, fighting broke out outside the castle between Isabella's guards and the garrison.|$|E
25|$|Saigō did insist, however, that Japan {{should go}} to war with Korea in the Seikanron debate of 1873 due to Korea's refusal to {{recognize}} the legitimacy of the Emperor Meiji as head of state of the Empire of Japan, and insulting treatment meted out to Japanese envoys attempting to establish trade and diplomatic relations. At one point, he offered to visit Korea in person and to provoke a <b>casus</b> <b>belli</b> by behaving in such an insulting manner that the Koreans would be forced to kill him. However, the other Japanese leaders strongly opposed these plans, partly from budgetary considerations, and partly from realization of the weakness of Japan compared with the western countries from what they had witnessed during the Iwakura Mission. Saigō resigned from all of his government positions in protest and returned to his hometown of Kagoshima.|$|E
