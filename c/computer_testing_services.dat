Japan is no exception to this global trend, and a variety of standardized tests for measuring learners’ English skills are available in the country: the Test of English as a Foreign Language Internet-based Test (TOEFL iBT®; Educational <b>Testing</b> <b>Service</b> 2015 a), TOEFL Junior® Comprehensive (Educational <b>Testing</b> <b>Service</b> 2015 b), Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC; Educational <b>Testing</b> <b>Service</b> 2015 d), International English Language Testing System (IELTS; British Council, IDP, IELTS Australia, & Cambridge English Language Assessment, n.d.), Cambridge English exams (University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate 2015), and the Pearson Test of English Academic (Pearson 2014), all of which are known worldwide; and the Test in Practical English Proficiency (EIKEN; Eiken Foundation of Japan, n.d.a.), Global Test of English Communication (GTEC) for STUDENTS (Benesse 2000 – 2015 b), GTEC <b>Computer</b> Based <b>Testing</b> (CBT; Benesse 2000 – 2015 a), and the Computerized Assessment System for English Communication (CASEC; Japan Institute for Educational Measurement, n.d.), all of which target the domestic market.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Recent {{developments}} in technology {{have made the}} creation of <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>tests</b> of personality a possibility. Despite the advances promised by <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>testing,</b> personality testing has lagged behind the ability <b>testing</b> domain regarding <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>testing</b> and adaptation. A principal reason why personality tests have not enjoyed computer adaptive adaptation is because few working <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>tests</b> are available for study or comparison to their original fixed form counterparts. In addition, personality tests tend to be predominantly based on classical test theory, whereas item response theory {{is required for the}} development of a <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>test.</b> Despite these impediments, numerous attitudinal measures have been adapted to function as <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>tests</b> and have demonstrated good psychometric properties and equivalence to their fixed form counterparts. As <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>testing</b> holds numerous advantages both psychometrically and practically, the development of a <b>computer</b> adaptive personality <b>test</b> may further advance psychometric testing of personality. Research Purpose: This study aimed to address the lack of progress made in the field of <b>computer</b> adaptive personality <b>testing</b> through the evaluation and simulated testing of a hierarchical personality inventory, namely the Basic Traits Inventory (BTI), within a <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>test</b> framework. The research aimed to demonstrate the process of <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>test</b> preparation and evaluation (study 1 and study 2); as well as the simulation of the scales of the BTI as <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>tests</b> (study 3). This was conducted to determine whether the BTI scales could be used as <b>computer</b> adaptive <b>tests,</b> and to determine how the BTI computer adaptive scales compare to their fixed form counterparts. Research Design: A sample of 1962 South African adults completed the BTI for selection, development and career counselling purposes. The instrument was investigated on a scale by scale basis with specific emphasis placed on scale dimensionality (study 1) and scale fit to the one-dimensional Rasch item response theory model (study 2). These factor analytic and item response [...] . D. Phil. (Industrial Psychology...|$|R
