40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 120 - 123). It {{was identified}} that potential improvements in recoveries {{were to be}} found in the better use of the regrind stages at a number of Anglo-Platinum concentrators. Historically, these concentrators used to operate in an open <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration,</b> over a relatively short period, the circuits were changed to closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> because of the reported benefits of operating in this configuration. The effect of closing the circuit had, however not been quantified in these concentrators. This dissertation looks at quantifying the effects of each configuration with the purpose of drawing meaningful comparisons between them. The <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> studied are open circuit, I-stage and 2 -stage closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations.</b> The primary difference between these configurations is the network of hydrocyclones. This study pays special attention to the effect of cyclone performance on the regrind circuit performance. Comparisons were made between the open and the 2 -stage closed circuits in three concentrators, and surprisingly the closed circuit did not show any improvement over the open <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration</b> from a combination efficiency perspective. The cyclones performance was analysed, and it was observed that the cyclones were operating inefficiently, most likely because the cyclones employed were not appropriate for regrind circuits. A further comparison was made between the I-stage and 2 -stage <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> and the I-stage closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration</b> proved to be more efficient than the 2 -stage closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration.</b> Simulations were conducted to predict the performance of the <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> by using more appropriate cyclones which are smaller in size. These cyclones are currently being used in a similar application in another concentrator. The simulations indicated that significant improvements in comminution performance could be realised with the utilisation of more appropriate cyclones, to achieve the closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration...</b>|$|R

The circuits use an advanced indium phosphide (InP) double heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) process with a multilayer back-end. Several amplifiers in the frequency range from 80 to 300 GHz with state-of-the-art performance are presented. The amplifiers utilize different transistor configurations: common-emitter, common-base, and cascode. One of the amplifiers, a five-stage <b>common-emitter</b> <b>circuit,</b> demonstrates 24 dB gain at 255 GHz with a minimum noise figure of 10. 4 dB at 265 GHz. This is the lowest reported noise figure for amplifiers in bipolar technology operating at such high frequencies.
