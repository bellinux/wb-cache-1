5|$|Hack, Starflight and the Ultima series were Adams' main influences. The roguelike Hack (1985) {{because of}} its {{randomly}} generated levels, deceased character persistence and detailed mechanics. Adams cited Ultima series as the inspiration for his generated worlds. The body part and wound system was inspired by 1990 role-playing game Cyberpunk 2020. He prefers modeling on individual elements, rather than entire systems, for better simulations with the outcomes being under his control. He said midpoint displacement generates the elevation {{of the world and}} its initial basic elements use fractals, which give it an overall natural look. He further explained that he made an algorithm to simulate rain shadows which occur in areas at the side of mountain deserts. For the distinct personalities of each unit, he took it from NEO PI-R test of which he admitted knowing little about. The feature of <b>carps</b> eating dwarves was unexpected when the game was released. He had written them having the same size and <b>carps</b> were designed to be carnivorous. A part of the game he felt tough, was implementing an A* search algorithm for pathfinding in any in-game character which, depending on their numbers and complexity of the path, can cause a heavy load on a computer. Adams composed the game's flamenco-inspired music.|$|E
5|$|Goldfish, {{domestication}} of: In ancient China, {{various species}} of carp (collectively known as Asian <b>carps)</b> were domesticated {{and have been}} reared as food fish for thousands of years. Some of these normally gray or silver species {{have a tendency to}} produce red, orange or yellow color mutations; this was first recorded in the Jin Dynasty (265–420). During the Tang Dynasty (618–907), it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and watergardens. A natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver coloration. People began to breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety, keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water. Goldfish were introduced into Europe during the 17th century, and into North America in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (<b>carps,</b> catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

One and two year old grass <b>carp</b> exhibited higher survival rates and better growth rates than {{the same age}} hybrid grass <b>carp.</b> The presence of grass <b>carp</b> or hybrid grass <b>carp</b> decreased both Secchi disc transparencies and dissolved oxygen values. Grass <b>carp</b> had a greater negative effect upon these measurements because they removed the vegetation quicker than the hybrid grass <b>carp.</b> These apparent detrimental effects on water quality are necessary trade-offs for vegetation removal by any method. Grass <b>carp</b> and hybrid grass <b>carp</b> utilized Chara sp., Potamogeton pectinatus, Hydrodicton sp., Rhizoclonia sp., and Pithophora sp. Two year old hybrid grass <b>carp</b> required approximately twice {{as much time as}} the same age grass <b>carp</b> to eliminate dense growths of the vegetation listed above. One year old hybrid grass <b>carp</b> were slightly less effective than one year old grass <b>carp</b> at controlling these same plant species. However, it was extremely difficult for one or two year old hybrid grass <b>carp</b> to totally eliminate dense growths of these plant species except at high stocking densities.

25|$|The {{families}} of Cypriniformes are traditionally {{divided into two}} superfamilies. Superfamily Cyprinioidea contains the <b>carps</b> and minnows (Cyprinidae) and, according to some, also the mountain <b>carps</b> as the family Psilorhynchidae. In 2012 Maurice Kottelat reviewed the superfamily Cobitioidea and under his revision it now consists of the following families: hillstream loaches (Balitoridae), Barbuccidae, Botiidae, suckers (Catostomidae), true loaches (Cobitidae), Ellopostomatidae, Gastromyzontidae, sucking loaches (Gyrinocheilidae), stone loaches (Nemacheilidae), Serpenticobitidae and long-finned loaches (Vaillantellidae).|$|E

The organic and inorganic wastes produced as a byproduct of culturing could also be minimized by integrating freshwater snail and aquatic plants, such as water spinach, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Carp was a {{scion of}} the old boyar class in Moldavia: his family has attested roots {{going back to the}} 17th century, and {{believed}} by some to have originated in the Baltic region. The <b>Carps</b> were related to other noble houses, including the Cozadinis, the Racovițăs and the Kostakis. They owned the manorial estate of Țibănești, formed over the centuries by the accumulation of yeomen farmland and still a lucrative business in their lifetime. Carp's father, also known as Petre (Petru), was a Spatharios of the Princely Court, then Stolnic. Educated abroad during the earliest wave of Westernization, fascinated by Enlightenment ideals and the Carboneria, he took part in political agitation before the Moldavian Revolution of 1848. His wife, Petre P. Carp's mother, was Smaranda Radul, from the boyar branch of Dealu Mare. The couple had another son, who died at birth.|$|E
50|$|Most {{cypriniformes}} have {{scales and}} teeth on the inferior pharyngeal bones {{which may be}} modified {{in relation to the}} diet. Tribolodon is the only cyprinid genus which tolerates salt water. Several species move into brackish water but return to fresh water to spawn. All of the other cypriniformes live in continental waters and have a wide geographical range. Some consider all cyprinid fishes <b>carp,</b> and the family Cyprinidae itself is often known as the <b>carp</b> family. In colloquial use, <b>carp</b> usually refers only to several larger cyprinid species such as Cyprinus carpio (common <b>carp),</b> Carassius carassius (Crucian <b>carp),</b> Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass <b>carp),</b> Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (silver <b>carp),</b> and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (bighead <b>carp).</b> <b>Carp</b> have long been an important food fish to humans.

Wild spats are harvested either by broadcasting empty mussel shells on the seabed or by the use of long, small-mesh nets filled with mussel shells supported on steel frames. The oyster larvae preferentially settle out on the mussel shells. Juvenile oysters are then grown on in nursery trays and are transferred to open waters when they reach [...] in length.|$|E
