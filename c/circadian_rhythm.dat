5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythm,</b> control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythm</b> is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E

Our attention is directed to the core molecular model generating <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> in Drosophila, proposed by Goldbeter [1], for our approach to be illustrated. We consider two cases when the <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> are subjected to periodic forcing by light/dark (LD) cy-cles and when the <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> are under continuous darkness (DD). First, we propose conditions/algorithms for (local) robust stability, and show that the <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> generated by the core molecular model are (locally) robustly stable, in both LD and DD cases.

40|$|This paper reviews {{some of the}} {{compelling}} evidence of disrupted <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> in individuals with mood disorders (major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and bipolar disorder) and that treatments such as bright light, designed to alter <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms,</b> are effective in treating these disorders.

While this evidence is suggestive of an etiological role for altered <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> in mood disorders, it is compatible with other explanations, including that disrupted <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> and mood disorders are effects of a common cause and that genes and proteins implicated in both simply have pleiotropic effects.

The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function.

Furthermore, Gilliam noted that spore prints were more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur.|$|E

40|$|In mammals, <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> {{of various}} organs and tissues are {{synchronized}} by pacemaker neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus.

To further delineate {{the function of the}} adrenal glands and the interactions of <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> in putative master synchronizing organs and their target tissues, here we report a simple co-culture system using a dual-color luciferase assay to monitor <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> separately in various explanted tissues and fibroblasts. In this system, <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> of organs and target cells were simultaneously tracked by the green-emitting beetle luciferase from Pyrearinus termitilluminans (ELuc) and the red-emitting beetle luciferase from Phrixothrix hirtus (SLR), respectively.

5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} secretes a basal level of {{cortisol}} {{but can also}} produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest {{in the early morning}} and lowest in the evening {{as a result of the}} <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythm</b> of ACTH secretion. Cortisone is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11β-HSD on cortisol. The reaction catalyzed by 11β-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other {{mushrooms}} {{known to}} release spores {{in response to}} a <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythm,</b> spore release in M.rotula is dependent upon sufficient moisture. Dried mushrooms may revive after rehydrating and continue to release spores for up to three weeks—a sustained spore production of markedly longer duration than other typical agarics. There are several species of Marasmius with which M.rotula might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish them. Although M.rotula mushrooms are not generally considered edible, they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is attracting research interest for possible use in bioengineering applications.|$|E
5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythm</b> can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Replacement pullets were {{reared in}} {{environmentally}} controlled chambers {{in which the}} lighting schedule was 14 L: 7 D, 14 L: 10 D or 14 L: 14 D. Both temperature and humidity were constant throughout the experiment. Neither body weight nor age at sexual maturity were altered by these lighting schedules. It was concluded that a unifying hypothesis to explain the various effects of photoperiods on growth and sexual maturity would probably not involve <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms.</b> Poultry Science 56 : 1039 - 1040, 1977 In recent years, {{a large body of}} evidence has a c c u m u l a t e d which implicates <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> in the control of most physiological systems. In birds, <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> have been recognized in the mechanisms which control the timing of ovulation (Morris, 1973) and in the mechanism which controls the sensitivity of the gonads to photostimulation (Follett, 1973). Body temperature is also subject to circadian rhythmicity (Cain and Wilson, 1974). The plasma concentrations of corticosterone are also regulated by <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> (Boissin and Assenmacher, 1970) and such functions as energy metabolism and food intake are also influenced by <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> (Aschoff and Pohl, 1970). More recently, John and George (1972) have identified <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> in plasma concentrations of free fatty acids. In general, <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> will adapt to light-dark cycles which recur at 20 to 30 h. intervals. Beyond these limits, the rhythms usually revert to an endogenous rhythm which approximates 24 h. Biological growth can be viewed as the end product of intermediary metabolism. In view of the apparent ubiquitous occurrence of <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> in the substrates of and mechanisms controlling metabolism, it was hypothesized that growth should be regulated by <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms.</b> In an attempt to demonstrate this hypothesis, replacement pullets were reared under light-dark cycles which recurred at 21, 24 and 28 h. intervals...|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the hormones}} in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythm,</b> into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; {{most of these are}} stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the releasing hormone rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector hormone glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve endings to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve endings would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.|$|E

50|$|While {{teaching}} at the University of Houston, Hardin, along with fellow scientists Balaji Krishnan and Stuart Dryer, investigated <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> of olfaction in Drosophila. Previous experiments had shown that Drosophila antennae demonstrate <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms.</b> However, the mechanism for <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> in the antennae was unknown. To determine the mechanism of rhythms in antennae, Hardin and his team kept wild-type and mutant flies, per01 and tim01, in 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycles and measured olfaction in the antennae with an electroantennogram (EAG), that measures the average output of an insect antenna to its brain for a given odor, over a 24-hour period. Only the wild-type flies demonstrated rhythmicity in the electrical activity, which indicated that <b>circadian</b> <b>rhythms</b> {{were present in the}} olfactory response.
