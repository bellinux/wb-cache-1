The fatwa also went into specific practical <b>challenges</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.|$|E
5|$|The FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II (in the {{indigenous}} language Mapuche, Pulqúi: Arrow) was a jet fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank {{in the late}} 1940s in Argentina, under the Perón government, and built by the Fábrica Militar de Aviones (FMA). Embodying many of the design elements of the wartime Focke-Wulf Ta 183, an unrealized fighter project, the FMA envisioned the IAe 33 Pulqui II as a successor to the postwar Gloster Meteor F4 in service with the Fuerza Aérea Argentina. The Pulqui II's development was comparatively problematic and lengthy, {{with two of the}} four prototypes being lost in fatal crashes. Despite one of the prototypes being successfully tested in combat during the Revolución Libertadora, the political, economic and technical <b>challenges</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> the project meant that the IAe 33 was unable to reach its full potential, and the Argentine government ultimately chose to purchase F-86 Sabres from the United States in lieu of continuing development of {{the indigenous}} fighter to production status.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} <b>challenges</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> {{pediatric}} safety and quality efforts {{is that most of}} the work on patient safety to date has focused on adult patients. In addition, there is no standard nomenclature for pediatric patient safety that is widely used. However, a standard framework for classifying pediatric adverse events that offers flexibility has been introduced. Standardization provides consistency between interdisciplinary teams and can facilitate multisite studies. If these large-scale studies are conducted, the findings could generate large-scale intervention studies conducted with a faster life cycle.|$|E

25|$|Despite being granted {{unprecedented}} {{access to}} many remote and protected areas, {{one of the}} main <b>challenges</b> <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> the filmmakers was finding wildlife. Although 15% of China's territory has some form of protection, this is not a guarantee of safety for wildlife, as reserves were often found to be under-equipped and under-staffed. In addition, they encountered a lack of local expertise and specialist knowledge, as few of China's zoologists were naturalists with an interest in observing wildlife. Producers even struggled to film the courting behaviour of one of the country's commonest creatures, the rice-paddy frog. Consequently, the team's attempts to find and film wildlife were not always successful.|$|E
