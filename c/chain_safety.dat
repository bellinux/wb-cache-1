50|$|National Food <b>Chain</b> <b>Safety</b> Office (NFCSO) is the {{integrated}} food safety authority of Hungary, established on 15 March 2012.|$|E
50|$|In Hungary, the National Food <b>Chain</b> <b>Safety</b> Office {{controls}} the food business operators including agricultural producers, food processors, retailers, caterers, input material suppliers and private laboratories. Its activities also cover risk assessment, risk communication and related research.|$|E
40|$|Operating motor {{vehicles}} on public roads {{may be one}} of your biggest liability exposures. While {{you may not be able}} to prevent all mishaps, you must do everything possible to protect yourself and others. One easily preventable type of mishap is separation of trailers from towing vehicles, resulting in spectacular crashes and often to tragic results. In fact, Tennessee’s <b>safety</b> <b>chain</b> law was passed as a direct result of several fatal trailer separations. All states have require <b>safety</b> <b>chains</b> for wagons and trailers used on public roads, and commercial vehicles are required by federal law to have <b>safety</b> <b>chains.</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>chains</b> ar...|$|R

50|$|Fostering {{national}} and international relations was another important responsibility of HFSO. Before {{the establishment of the}} National Food <b>Chain</b> <b>Safety</b> Office, this institution had been the Hungarian partner organization of the European Food Safety Authority. In addition, HFSO was the designated contact point in the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF), the World Health Organization (WHO) Food Safety Emergency Network (INFOSAN Emergency) and FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of safety-critical embedded systems {{is supported by}} a number of development tools, which are increasingly integrated into automated tool <b>chains.</b> <b>Safety</b> standards require these tool chains to be qualified, which is costly and requires a large effort. To reduce cost and effort tool chains can be composed of pre-qualified tools and then themselves pre-qualified by identifying the parts of tool chain software that have an impact on safety more exactly. In this paper we propose the use of a modeling language to describe this tool chain composition. This allows us to reduce effort even further by automatically analyzing the tool <b>chain</b> model for <b>safety</b> issues. It also promises to reduce the effort and cost of later steps in the deployment of the tool chain by formalizing the communication of safety issues and automating the generation of code for tool chain software.

It was created by Royal Order on May 23, 2001, as part of the plans of the Verhofstadt I Government to modernise the federal administration.|$|E
50|$|The Hungarian Food Safety Office (HFSO) {{operated}} as the Hungarian partner {{institution of}} the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) from 2003 to 2012 in conformity with the EU requirements. One of its priority {{was to assess the}} health risks derived from food and indirectly from feed, to liaise with international and Hungarian authorities, and to communicate with the public on food safety issues. From 2012, these tasks are performed by the National Food <b>Chain</b> <b>Safety</b> Office, which was established by the integration of the Central Agricultural Office and HFSO.|$|E
50|$|From 2012 NFCSO is {{responsible}} for the control of the whole food chain from farm to fork, including soil protection, agricultural production, forestry, food processing, retail and catering. Besides this, the most significant suppliers of the food chain are also registered by NFCSO (for instance private laboratories, input material suppliers). The National Food <b>Chain</b> <b>Safety</b> Office operates the food chain laboratory system and the national reference laboratory network. The work of the directorates is coordinated by the president of NFCSO, also acting as deputy chief veterinary officer of Hungary. The activities of NFCSO is supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture and personally the chief veterinary officer of Hungary.|$|E

50|$|Miller in 1910 {{designed}} {{a device that}} prevented cars from rolling backward down the lift hill {{in the event of}} pull chain breakage. It attached to the track and clicked onto the rungs of the chain. Known as the <b>safety</b> <b>chain</b> dog, or <b>safety</b> ratchet, it evolved into the device on the underside of cars that makes that distinctive clinkety-clank sound of wooden coasters.|$|R

50|$|The shaft is {{open and}} well defined behind a chain wire safety fence (14m x 14m) that was erected in the late 1960s by the Charters Towers City Council. A {{temporary}} wire <b>chain</b> <b>safety</b> fence {{has been placed on}} the eastern side presumably to render safe this side from subsidence. The shaft {{is open and}} intact. 50 metres to the south-west is a brick magazine. Substantial foundations for mine machinery associated with the mine lie to the north. The Day Dawn PC No. 4 is in evidence to the east as has a temporary safety fence around it. The USL on which the shaft lies is heavily grassed and is generally clear of other built or natural features.|$|E
40|$|Food {{supply chain}} is {{characterized}} by the complexity of covering a large range of aspects, which determines the diffi-culty of its safety risk prevention and control. Every step in food supply chain involves human activities, therefore the human participation becomes one of the critical elements that impact the food supply <b>chain</b> <b>safety</b> risk. From the per-spective of human behavior as a cut-in point, the matter of food supply <b>chain</b> <b>safety</b> risk prevention and control is dis-cussed and analyzed, referring to related theories of organizational behavior. Based on the discussion on attitude and motivation, two main factors that influence human behavior, approaches of controlling human behavior are summarized from two aspects, which are respectively correcting the food supply chain participants ’ attitudes and providing them with incentives, so as to reach the goal of food supply <b>chain</b> <b>safety</b> risk prevention and control...|$|E

50|$|Some <b>chains</b> show <b>safety</b> {{features}} as safety links as on micro chisel saws. These links keep the saw {{close to the}} gap between two cutting links and lift the chain when the space at the safety link is full with saw chips. This lifts the chain and let it cut slower.|$|R

40|$|Fruit and Vegetable Supply Chain Management (F&V SCM) {{requires}} more intelligent technology to improve postharvest loss prevention; however, the current technology {{has to be}} improved to reduce the lead times and perishability dynamics in an intelligent F&V supply chain. This {{can be achieved by}} developing a more accurate environmental monitoring using advanced measurement techniques and by introducing new gold nanoparticle sensors (Au-NP-sensors) which would allow direct sensing of rotting or decaying. This paper presents the possibility how to measure the impact of these technologies on the management of fruit and vegetable supply chains, i. e. from packaging, warehousing to fruit and vegetable distribution, and thus improving the supply <b>chain</b> <b>safety</b> by tracking and tracing cargo and its environment. The evaluation of these new technologies is proposed through the Net Present Value approach of extended MRP models...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringUncertainty in {{a modern}} supply chain {{structure}} originates at the supplier, manufacturing process and the consumer. Different types of products and supply chain structures add {{to the complexity of}} managing a supply <b>chain.</b> <b>Safety</b> stock in a supply chain acts like a shock absorber against these uncertainties. Current safety stock models are very effective in tackling strategic level problems, however are inept to understand the relation between the placement of safety stock in a supply chain and tactical level uncertainties. A bottleneck in a supply chain determines the capability of a supply chain. The shifting of stage bottlenecks is tactical level uncertainty. This thesis addresses the impact of placement of safety stock on shifting bottleneck stages. Simulation models establish the effects of varying stock levels on shifting bottleneck stages in capacitated assembly environment...|$|E
