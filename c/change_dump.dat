40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the reconstruction methods applied after total gastrectomy in terms of postoperative symptomology and nutrition. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on 31 patients who underwent total gastrectomy due to gastric cancer in 2. Clinic of General Surgery, SSK Ankara Training Hospital. 6 different reconstruction methods were used and analyzed in terms of age, sex and postoperative complications. One from esophagus and two biopsy specimens from jejunum were taken through upper gastrointestinal endoscopy from all cases, and late period morphological and microbiological changes were examined. Postoperative weight <b>change,</b> <b>dumping</b> symptoms, reflux esophagitis, solid/liquid dysphagia, early satiety, postprandial pain, diarrhea and anorexia were assessed. Results: Of 31 patients, 18 were males and 13 females; the youngest one was 33 years old, while the oldest- 69 years old. It was found that reconstruction without pouch was performed in 22 cases and with pouch in 9 cases. Early satiety, postprandial pain, dumping symptoms, diarrhea and anemia were found most commonly in cases with reconstruction without pouch. The rate of bacterial colonization of the jejunal mucosa was identical in both groups. Reflux esophagitis was most commonly seen in omega esophagojejunostomy (EJ), while the least-in Roux-en-Y, Tooley and Tanner 19 EJ.

In line with this, mass migration explained most {{of the variation in}} waste dumping. The waste dumping also affected the bioaccessibility of mixed-compound pollutants that further positively impacted the level of ARGs. The influence of various bioaccessible compounds on ARG abundance followed the order: antibiotics>nutrients>metals>organic pollutants.

This thesis investigates, how thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing in particular can provide valuable information, which is required to assist the landuse planning in identifying and classifying critical areas. In order to establish the mining of the lignitic seams the overburden Quaternary and Tertiary sediments had been removed and dumped in conveyor bridge dumps. The Tertiary sediments contain the mineral pyrite, which reacts to sulfuric acid under wet oxidizing conditions. The acidification of the dumps is not only strongly affecting the chemical characteristics of groundwater and residual lakes but also the stability of slopes leaving the risk of slides and subsidences.

In Chapter I, the relationship between exchange rate <b>changes</b> and <b>dumping</b> is analyzed, {{as well as the}} effect of the imposition of a binding antidumping law on output, price, profits, and market share of a foreign and a domestic firm. Depreciation of the domestic currency is shown to exacerbate dumping, and imposition of the law results in an increased domestic price and a reduced foreign share of the market. Decision-making with respect to exchange rate uncertainty is introduced, and this is shown {{to increase the amount of}} exchange rate pass-through relative to the certainty case when the antidumping law is enforced. ^ Chapter II contains a welfare analysis of the effects of imposing a binding antidumping law which are shown to be negative. A temporary penalty and the strategic behavior which it induces is also analyzed, and results are derived showing that the domestic price will increase and imports will fall, even if the penalty is not actually applied. The welfare effects of this law are also negative. A different model where current market share determines future profitability is investigated with respect to when dumping occurs and how the imposition of an antidumping law affects market outcomes. ^ In Chapter III, the link between exchange rate changes in the 1980 s and the increased use of U. S. antidumping statutes is empirically analyzed specifically for the U. S. chemical industry. Factors which influence the decision to file a petition are investigated, and import penetration and unit value data as well as domestic production data are analyzed to evaluate how firm behavior changes during the course of the antidumping investigation. Evidence that targeted importers lose market share to both competing importers and the domestic industry is strong in many cases. ^ Each chapter includes a literature review of research relevant for the issues discussed, as well as suggestions for future research.

Further, there is poor understanding of the fate of rainfall infiltration; the proportion that goes into storage within the dump and the proportion that emerges {{from the base of}} the dump as seepage. In addition, there is poor understanding of the size of rainfall event necessary to trigger base seepage and the time delay before base seepage emerges following the rainfall event, and how these parameters <b>change</b> as the <b>dump</b> wets-up.

Deconvolving natural and anthropogenic changes to water quality is hampered {{by the lack of}} long term, dated water quality data but such records are required for forward modelling of reef health to aid their management. Reef corals provide an excellent archive of high resolution geochemical (trace element) proxies that can span hundreds of years and potentially provide records used through the Holocene. Hence, geochemical proxies in corals hold great promise for understanding changes in ancient water quality that can inform broader oceanographic and climatic changes in a given region. This article reviews and highlights the use of coral-based trace metal archives, including metal transported from rivers to the ocean, incorporation of trace metals into coral skeletons and the current 2 ̆ 7 state of the art 2 ̆ 7 in utilizing coral trace metal proxies as tools for monitoring various types of local and regional source-specific pollution (river discharge, land use <b>changes,</b> dredging and <b>dumping,</b> mining, oil spills, antifouling paints, atmospheric sources, sewage).

However, coral-based water quality reconstructions have suffered from a lack of understanding of so-called vital effects and early marine diagenesis. The main challenge is to identify and eliminate the influence of extraneous local factors in order to allow accurate water quality reconstructions and to develop alternate proxies to monitor water pollution.

As others have already noted at this session, and need not be repeated here, we have a "gigantic " accumulation of solid wastes and an equivalent collection of real and imaginary facts.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact and recovery {{associated with the}} long and uninterrupted disposal of large volumes of moderately contaminated dredged material from the port of Rotterdam was studied at nearby dumping sites in the North Sea. Observations were made on sediment contamination, ecotoxicity, biomarker responses and benthic community <b>changes</b> shortly after <b>dumping</b> at the 'North' site had ceased and {{at the start of}} disposal at the new dumping site 'Northwest'. During the period of dumping, very few benthic invertebrates were found at the North site. Concentrations of cadmium, mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and tributyltin (TBT) in the fine sediment fraction (< 63 mum) from this site were 2 - 3 times higher than at the reference site. In four different bioassays with marine invertebrates the sediments showed no acute toxic effects. In tissue (pyloric caeca) of resident starfish Asterias rubens, residual levels of mercury, zinc, PCBs and dioxin-like activity were never more than twice those at the reference site. Four different biomarkers (DNA integrity, cytochrome P 450 content, benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activity and acetylcholinesterase inhibition) were used on the starfish tissues, but {{no significant differences were found}} between North and the reference site. Minor pathological effects were observed in resident dab Limanda limanda. One year after dumping had ceased at the North site, a significant increase in the species richness and abundance of benthic invertebrates and a concomitant decrease in the fine sediment fraction of the seabed were observed. After 8. 2 million m(3) of moderately contaminated dredged material had been dumped at the new dumping site Northwest, the species richness and abundance of benthic invertebrates declined over an area extending about 1 - 2 km eastwards. This correlated with a shift in sediment texture from sand to silt. The contamination of the fine sediment fraction at the Northwest location doubled. It is concluded that marine benthic resources at and around the dumping sites have been adversely affected by physical disturbance (burial, smothering). However, no causal link could be established with sediment-associated contaminants from the dredged spoils. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Deoxycytidylate (dCMP) hydroxymethylase (CH) catalyzes the {{formation}} of 5 -hydroxymethyl-dCMP (Hm 5 CMP) from dCMP and methylene tetrahydrofolate (CH 2 THF), analogous to the reaction between dUMP and CH 2 THF catalyzed by thymidylate synthase (TS), an enzyme of known structure. The amino acid sequence identity between invariant TS residues and CH is at least 50 %. Most of the residues which contact the dUMP and CH 2 THF in TS are conserved in CH. It is hypothesized that CH is homologous to TS in both structure and mechanism. The project described in this thesis tests this hypothesis. In-vitro studies on catalysis by CH variants. The roles of three residues in catalysis by CH have been tested using site-directed mutagenesis. Conversion of Cys 148 to Asp, Gly or Ser decreases CH activity at least 105 fold, consistent with a nucleophilic role for Cys 148 (analogous to the catalytic Cys in TS). In crystalline TS, hydrogen bonds connect O 4 and N 3 of bound dUMP to the side chain of an Asn; the corresponding CH residue is Asp 179. Conversion of Asp 179 in CH to Asn reduces kcat/KM for dCMP by 104 fold and increases kcat/KM for dUMP 60 fold, changing the nucleotide specificity of the enzyme. Other {{studies have shown that}} the specificity of TS was <b>changed</b> from <b>dUMP</b> to dCMP by conversion of the appropriate Asn to Asp. Based on the crystal structure of TS, a Glu residue (also conserved in CH) is proposed to catalyze formation of the N 5 iminium ion methylene donor by protonation of N 10 of CH 2 THF. In CH and TS, overall turnover and tritium exchange are tightly coupled. Replacement of Glu 60 in CH or Glu 58 in TS uncouples these catalytic steps. Conversion the Glu 60 / 58 to Gln or Asp results in a 5 - 50 fold decrease in the ability to catalyze tritium exchange, consistent with an inability to catalyze formation of the N 5 iminium ion, but also results in a 104 - 105 decrease in product formation. This suggests that Glu 60 / 58 is also involved in a step in catalysis after nucleotide and folate binding and proton removal from carbon 5 of the nucleotide. Isotope effect studies. The observed value of the α-secondary tritium inverse equilibrium isotope effect (EIE = 0. 8) on formation of the complex between FdUMP, CH 2 THF and both wild-type CH and CH(D 179 N) indicates that carbon 6 of FdUMP is sp 3 hybridized (tetrahedral) in the ternary complex. This is consistent with the hypothesis that that carbon 6 is bonded to Cys 148 in the complex. Removal of Cys 148 in CH prevents complex formation with FdUMP. Lack of an observed α-secondary tritium kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for position 6 of dCMP for both enzymes suggests that the intrinsic KIE is masked by other rate-limiting steps or that rehybridization follows the first irreversible step. An observed KIE on carbon 6 of dUMP by CH(D 179 N) suggests the rate-limiting steps for the two nucleotide substrates is different. In-vivo studies catalysis by CH variants. In order to prevent recombination between CH deficient T 4 phage and plasmid borne copies of CH variants, the gene coding for CH, gene 42, was deleted from the T 4 chromosome. The T 4 Δ 42 phage requires wild-type CH expressed from a plasmid to kill their host cell. CH variants C 148 G, D 179 N, E 60 Q, and E 60 D, all which exhibit at least 2000 fold lower activity in vitro, do not complement the T 4 Δ 42 phage in vivo.

It is proposed that shortening the C-terminal loop seen in the structure of TS changes the solvent structure of the CH active-site such that it becomes more hydrated. Differences in the solvent structure of the active-site may account for differences in the catalytic specificity between CH and TS, respectively, hydration versus reduction. In order to test the hypothesis that these catalytic differences between TS and CH lie within the C-terminal portion of the enzyme, the N-terminus of the CH(D 179 N) variant was fused to the C-terminus of the wild-type TS to create a chimeric CH/TS enzyme. The chimeric enzyme was predicted to have specificity for dUMP and a active-site solvent structure similar to that for wild-type TS. However, the resulting protein cannot be overproduced to significant levels and does not have any detectable TS activity in vivo...|$|R
40|$|All {{research}} and development has a story behind it, says Jacqueline Quinn, environmental engineer at Kennedy Space Center. For Quinn, one such story begins with the Saturn 1 B launch stand at Kennedy and ends with a unique solution to a challenging environmental problem. Used {{in a number of}} Apollo missions and during the Skylab program, the Saturn 1 B launch stand was dismantled following the transition to the Space Shuttle Program and stored in an open field at Kennedy. Decades later, the Center s Environmental Program Office discovered evidence of chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the field s soil. The findings were puzzling since PCBs a toxin classified as a probable carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have been banned in the United States since 1979. Before the ban, PCBs were commonly used in transformer oils that leached into the ground when the oils were <b>changed</b> out and <b>dumped</b> near transformer sites, but there were no electrical transformers near the dismantled stand. It soon became apparent that the source of the PCBs was the launch stand itself. Prior to the ban, PCBs were used extensively in paints to add elasticity and other desirable characteristics. The PCB-laden paint on the Saturn 1 B launch stand was flaking off into the field s soil. Nobody knew there were PCBs in the paint, says Quinn, noting that the ingredient was not monitored carefully when it was in use in 1960 s. In fact, she says, the U. S. EPA was not even established until 1970, a year after Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon. Nobody knew any better at the time, Quinn says, but today, we have the responsibility to return any natural environmental media to as close to pristine a condition as possible. Quinn, fellow engineer Kathleen Loftin, and other Kennedy colleagues already had experience developing unprecedented solutions for environmental contamination; the team invented the emulsified zero-valent iron (EZVI) technology to safely treat groundwater tainted by chlorinated solvents once used to clean rocket engine components. The award-winning innovation (Spinoff 2010) is now NASA s most licensed technology to date. PCBs in paint presented a new challenge. Removing the launch stand for recycling proved a difficult operation; the toxic paint had to be fully stripped from the steel structure, a lengthy and costly process that required the stripped paint to be treated before disposal. Noting the lack of efficient, environmentally friendly options for dealing with PCBs, Quinn and her colleagues developed the Activated Metal Treatment System (AMTS). AMTS is a paste consisting of a solvent solution containing microscale particles of activated zero-valent metal. When applied to a painted surface, the paste extracts and degrades the PCBs into benign byproducts while leaving the paint on the structure. This provides a superior alternative to other methods for PCB remediation, such as stripping the paint or incinerating the structure, which prevents reuse and can release volatized PCBs into the air. Since its development, AMTS {{has proven to be a}} valuable solution for removing PCBs from paint, caulking, and various insulation and filler materials in older buildings, naval ships, and former munitions facilities where the presence of PCBs interferes with methods for removing trace explosive materials. Miles of potentially toxic caulking join sections of runways at airports. Any of these materials installed before 1979 potentially contain PCBs, Quinn says. "This is not just a NASA problem," she says. "It s a global problem. ...|$|R
