2500|$|Paulini's {{third album}} <b>Come</b> <b>Alive</b> was {{released}} on 29 May 2015, almost nine years {{after the release of}} her second album Superwoman (2006). <b>Come</b> <b>Alive</b> marked a departure from Paulini's previous R releases, with a more commercial adult contemporary pop sound. She worked on the album for five years in Berlin, London, Los Angeles, New York City and Paris with several writers and producers, including Chris Rosa, Erik [...] "Blue2th" [...] Griggs and Philippe-Marc Anquetil. Paulini stated that she wanted to take her time with the album to concentrate on improving her songwriting, having co-written all but two tracks on <b>Come</b> <b>Alive.</b> <b>Come</b> <b>Alive</b> debuted at number 25 on the ARIA Albums Chart and surpassed Superwomans peak position of number 72.|$|R
25|$|In 1992, {{after a year}} of 8–7 or 7–8 records {{near the}} top of the makuuchi division, Akebono {{suddenly}} <b>came</b> <b>alive</b> with a 13–2 record in January of that year, narrowly losing the top division championship to Takanohana. A second 13–2 record two tournaments later, in May, saw him win the top division championship for the first time, and with it promotion to ōzeki.

25|$|Meanwhile, Lee {{held the}} Monarchs hitless {{through the first}} four innings, and to one hit through seven.

Allen then singled to right, driving in Johnston to take a 1–0 lead. Hilldale responded in the top of the ninth, when Cockrell, pinch hitting for Lee, reached base with a one-out walk. Briggs {{followed}} with a single to left, and Warfield grounded to shortstop, forcing Briggs at second. With two outs, Carr singled to right, scoring Cockrell and tying the game.|$|E
25|$|Australia thus gave India {{a target}} of 199 in 23 overs. The Indian openers however, started {{extremely}} badly, {{with both of them}} getting out in successive balls to Nathan Bracken, giving him a chance of bagging a hat-trick on his test debut. The match <b>came</b> <b>alive</b> after that and VVS Laxman the next batsman, avoided the hattrick by squirting the ball through gully. Thereafter, India had no problems absolutely, as Rahul Dravid and Laxman took the score to respectability with Dravid dominating the partnership, scoring 43 only off 47 balls, while Laxman charmed his way on to a breezy 24. Amazingly, for a match in which ten hours of play was lost, this match kept the spectators interested till the end.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 season remains notable in {{the minds}} of {{baseball}} fans for two inexplicable oddities. On August 19 at the Metrodome, the Minnesota Twins logged 19 strikeouts against the Rangers, one short of the Major League record. Three days later, the 22nd, in the first game of a doubleheader at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the Rangers' bats <b>came</b> <b>alive</b> with a modern record for runs by one team, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 30–3. Their 27-run margin of victory is also a modern-day MLB record. Wes Littleton gained probably the easiest save in Major League history– entering the game {{in the bottom of the}} seventh, with his team already ahead 14–3, he pitched three innings finishing the game, and gave up just two hits and a walk.|$|E

25|$|Beckett {{made his}} Dodgers {{debut in the}} opener of a series against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field.

25|$|The last {{match of}} the day came between two former US Open finalists Vera Zvonareva and Caroline Wozniacki, who has split their former 8 matches in half. Zvonareva, the No.6 seed, was the clear aggressor in the match, going for her big groundstrokes – {{including}} some particularly impressive backhands – {{to take the first}} set in just 35 minutes. Wozniacki broke in the last game of the second set to push the match to a third but Zvonareva <b>came</b> <b>alive</b> again, racing out to a double-break 4–1 lead and barely looking back. The Russian, who just turned 27 last month, won the last seven points of the match to end it 6–2, 4–6, 6–3. Although both Zvonareva and Wozniacki are known for their strong defensive skills, the Russian's offense really shone through at the Sinan Erdem Dome – she had by far the bigger numbers for the day, 49 winners to 49 unforced errors (Wozniacki finished the match with 13 winners to 18 unforced errors).|$|E
25|$|In the Daytona 500, Earnhardt started 9th. His car {{hung around}} mid-pack {{for most of}} {{the first quarter of the}} race.

He led 54 of the last 70 laps and he held off Denny Hamlin and Brad Keselowski to win his second Daytona 500, just 10 years after his first one. The {{following}} week at Phoenix, Earnhardt continued his momentum, finishing 2nd to Kevin Harvick. At Las Vegas, Earnhardt gambled on fuel in the remaining 40 laps, but he ran out of gas while leading on the last lap, finishing 2nd to eventual race winner Brad Keselowski. At Bristol, he was strong early, and had a chance to become the first driver since Richard Petty to start a season with four straight Top 2 finishes, until tire problems forced him to make an unscheduled stop, leaving him to finish 24th, four laps down.|$|E
25|$|Still {{trailing}} 3–0 {{and having}} only one hit {{to show for}} their outing so far, the New York bats <b>came</b> <b>alive</b> {{in the bottom of}} the sixth against Hurst. After recording the first out, pinch hitter Lee Mazzilli and Mookie Wilson recorded back to back hits and Tim Teufel drew a walk to load the bases. Keith Hernandez singled to drive in Mazzilli and Wilson, and Gary Carter followed with a liner to right that Evans dove to try to catch but could not come up with. Pinch runner Wally Backman, who came in to run for Teufel, scored the tying run but Hernandez, who had to wait and see if the ball was going to be caught by Evans, got a late jump and was thrown out as Evans was able to relay the throw to Spike Owen. Hernandez got into an argument with right field umpire Dale Ford, claiming that his delay in ruling on Evans' play caused him to wait too long before advancing. With two outs, Hurst faced Darryl Strawberry and retired him.|$|E

25|$|The first singles {{semifinal}} match saw white group no. 1 Petra Kvitová and red group no. 2 Samantha Stosur. Kvitová was {{the only}} player {{to make it through}} the round robin undefeated, but she showed some cracks in her last match on Friday, falling behind 5–1 in the first set before rallying to beat Agnieszka Radwańska in straights. And although she was up an early break she had somewhat of a slowish start again against a confident Stosur, who came back to take the first set and eventually build a 7–5, 1–0 lead, with a break point to go up 7–5, 2–0. Just like she did before, though, Kvitová <b>came</b> <b>alive</b> when she needed to, winning six of the next eight games to take the second set 6–3, then racing ahead 5–0 in the third. Stosur made things exciting at the end by winning three straight games to close to 5–3, but the Wimbledon champion held on, closing out the US Open champion with a love hold 5–7, 6–3, 6–3. Both Kvitová and Stosur finished with clean winners-to-errors differentials (Kvitová 38–39, Stosur 16–18) but the biggest difference came in creating break point opportunities – Kvitová brought up 11 break points (converting on five) while Stosur only got six break points (converting on three).|$|E
25|$|The second match saw French Open Champion Li Na {{making her}} debut against no. 2 seed Maria Sharapova. Having not won a match since August - she lost first round at her last two {{events at the}} US Open and Beijing, and in {{straight}} sets too - Li's game <b>came</b> <b>alive</b> at the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships, as her power game clicked {{against one of the}} most powerful players in the game. She rallied from 2-4 to take the first set to a tie-break, where she rallied from 0–4 to take the set; she then held off a late surge from Sharapova in the second set, watching a 5–2 lead close to 5–4 before finally serving out the victory in front of a packed crowd. Li had been struggling since becoming Asia's first Grand Slam champion at the French Open, going 5–7 in her seven tournaments since – but she had won her last three meetings against Sharapova in straight sets and brought that magic out again, getting just a few more winners in the winners column - 15 to 12. Li is the first Chinese ever to compete in singles at the year-end finale. Later in the day, Sharapova withdrew with a left ankle injury, ending her chance to finish the year at No.1.|$|E
25|$|The second match saw Agnieszka Radwańska {{trying to}} advance to the semifinals taking on Petra Kvitová. With Kvitová, Victoria Azarenka and Samantha Stosur already through, Radwańska had to take a set from Kvitová on Friday to become the fourth player into the final four. And that goal didn't seem far away at all as she stormed out to a 5–1 first set lead - but Kvitová {{suddenly}} <b>came</b> <b>alive,</b> her power game hitting its mark as she stormed back to take the opening set comfortably in a tie-break. Although there were a few close moments midway through the second set - she went to six deuces before holding in a marathon game for 4–3 - Kvitová never really looked in trouble again, eventually finishing the match off with a big crosscourt forehand that drew one last backhand error from Radwańska. Whether she was winning or losing, Kvitová seemed to be in complete control of the score against Radwańska - she finished the match with 42 winners to 47 unforced errors, while Radwańska had eight winners to 17 unforced errors. Kvitová finished first in the Red Group with a bullet, 3–0 in win-loss and 6–0 in sets. Although Zvonareva, Radwańska and Caroline Wozniacki all ended with a 1–2 win–loss record and 3–5 sets won-lost, Zvonareva had the best games won-lost percentage of the three and thus finished second in the Red Group. The semifinals will be Red Group No.1 Kvitová taking on White Group No.2 Stosur, and White Group No.1 Azarenka taking on Red Group No.2 Zvonareva.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{influences}} of the Pompeii and Herculaneum excavations, several other factors came together to popularize neoclassical dress. Starting in the early 1790s, Emma Hamilton began her performances of attitudes, something that was considered by contemporaries as entirely new. These attitudes were based loosely on the ancient practice of pantomime, though Emma’s performances lacked masks and musical accompaniment. Her performances created a fusion between art and nature; art <b>came</b> <b>alive</b> and her body became a type of art. As an aid to her performances of tragic mythological and historical figures, Emma wore the clothing á la grecque that would become popular in mainstream France in the coming years. A simple light colored chemise made from thin, flowing material was worn and gathered with a narrow ribbon under the breasts. Simple cashmere shawls were used as headdresses or to give more fullness to the drapery of the chemise. They also helped to prevent broken lines in the performance so that the outstretched arms were always connected with the body, escalating the effect of fluid movement, and oftentimes, a cape or a cloak was worn to emphasize {{the lines of the}} body in certain poses. This highlighted the continuity of surface of line and form {{in the body of the}} performer to emphasize the unity, simplicity, and continuously flowing movement from one part of the body to the next. The hair was worn in a natural, loose, and flowing fashion. All of these properties blended together to allow an extensive play of light and shadow to reveal and accent certain parts of the body during the performance, while covering others. Emma was highly capable in her attitudes, and the influence of her dress spread from Naples to Paris as wealthy Parisians took the Grand Tour.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to Philadelphia for a road {{series against the}} two-time defending National League champion Phillies. In the opener, the Dodgers offense finally <b>came</b> <b>alive,</b> scoring a season-high 15 runs in a 15–9 victory. The game featured the first home run since 2007 by outfielder Jay Gibbons, who was just called up from AAA a few days before. In the second game of the series, the bats were silenced by Phillies pitcher Roy Oswalt, who shut the Dodgers down 2–0. In the finale, the Dodgers jumped to a 9–2 lead thanks to 6 quality innings by Clayton Kershaw and a four RBI effort from Matt Kemp. However a poor outing from Ronald Belisario in the eighth cut the lead to 9–6 and then Jonathan Broxton was unable to retire a batter in the ninth as the Phillies stormed back for a 10–9 walk-off victory. Next the Dodgers {{traveled to}} Atlanta for a four-game series against the Braves. In the opener, the Dodgers were shut out for the 14th time in the season, this time by Tim Hudson. Hiroki Kuroda allowed just one run in seven innings (a solo home run by Brooks Conrad), {{but it was enough}} as the team lost 1–0. Ted Lilly picked up his third straight win for the Dodgers, as they won the next game 2–1. The Dodgers string of impressive performances from their starting pitchers was ended on August 15, when Vicente Padilla was pounded for eight runs in 4 inning and the Dodgers lost a blow-out 13–1. In the series finale, the Dodgers wasted another gem from Chad Billingsley as the bullpen blew another lead, allowing three runs in the ninth inning to fall 4–3 as Melky Cabrera hit a two-run bases-loaded walk-off single off Octavio Dotel.|$|E
