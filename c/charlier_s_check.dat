40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{of interaction between}} Lactococcus lactis and the food pathogen Staphylococcus aureus are of crucial importance, as one major role of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in fermented foods is to inhibit undesirable and pathogenic flora. It was never questioned if {{the presence of a}} pathogen can actively modify the gene expression patterns of LAB in a shared environment. In this study, transcriptome and biochemical analyses were combined to assess the dynamic response of L. lactis in a mixed culture with S. aureus. The presence of S. aureus hardly affected the growth of L. lactis but dramatically modified its gene expression profile. The main effect was related to earlier carbon limitation and a concomitantly lower growth rate in the mixed culture due to the consumption of glucose by both species. More specific responses involved diverse cellular functions. Genes associated with amino acid metabolism, ion transport, oxygen response, menaquinone metabolism, and cell surface and phage expression were differentially expressed in the mixed culture. This study led to new insights into possible {{mechanisms of}} interaction between L. lactis and S. aureus. Moreover, new and unexpected effects of L. lactis on the virulence of S. aureus were discovered, as described elsewhere (<b>S.</b> Even, C. <b>Charlier,</b> <b>S.</b> Nouaille, N. L. Ben Zakour, M.

Our pseudo-bisimulating models are often smaller than forward-reachability graphs, commonly used in reachability analysis.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{benefit of}} regular multidimensional {{assessment}} {{of older people}} remains controversial. The majority of trials have been too small to produce adequate evidence to inform policy. Despite {{the lack of a}} firm evidence base, UK primary care practitioners (general practitioners) are required to offer an annual health check to patients aged 75 years and over. Design Cluster-randomised factorial trial in primary care comparing a package of assessments (i) universal versus targeted assessment and (ii) management by the primary care team (PC) or a multidisciplinary geriatric assessment team (GM). The unit of randomization is the general practice. Methods Older people aged 75 and over eligible for the over 75 <b>s</b> health <b>check</b> and excluding those in nursing homes or terminally ill were invited to participate. All participants receive a brief assessment covering all areas of the over 75 <b>s</b> <b>check.</b> In the universal arm all participants also receive a detailed health and social assessment by a study nurse while in the targeted arm only participants with a pre-determined number and range of problems at the brief assessment go on to have the detailed assessment. The study nurse follows a standard protocol based on results and responses in the detailed assessment to make referrals to (i) the randomised management team (PC or GM) (ii) other medical services, health care workers or agencies (iii) emergency referrals to the GP.
