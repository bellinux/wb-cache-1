Chromium(IV) oxide is used to manufacture magnetic tape used in high-performance audio tape and standard audio cassettes. Chromates can prevent corrosion of steel under wet conditions, and therefore chromates are added to drilling muds.|$|E
5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets {{can have}} up to 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium to raise the <b>coercivity</b> for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines. This substitution would require up to 100grams of dysprosium per electric car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2million units per year, the use of dysprosium in applications such as this would quickly exhaust its available supply. The dysprosium substitution may also be useful in other applications because it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets.|$|E
25|$|Enhanced {{magnetic}} coercivities for hematite {{have been}} achieved by dry-heating a 2-line ferrihydrite precursor prepared from solution. Hematite exhibited temperature-dependent magnetic <b>coercivity</b> values ranging from 289 to 5,027 Oe. The origin of these high <b>coercivity</b> values has been interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the subparticle structure induced by the different particle and crystallite size growth rates at increasing annealing temperature. These differences in the growth rates are translated into a progressive development of a subparticle structure at the nanoscale. At lower temperatures (350–600°C), single particles crystallize however; at higher temperatures (600-1000°C), the growth of crystalline aggregates with a subparticle structure is favored.|$|E

Magnetic and microstructure measurements show {{the presence of}} two phases : the anisotropic Dy 2 Fe 14 C phase and a DyFeC phase with Tc around 40 K.

40|$|Electrodeposition at {{elevated}} temperatures from a dibasic ammonium citrate-stabilized iron-cobalt electroplating {{solution is}} shown to promote the deposition of a metastable phase. The metastable phase is isostructural to α-Mn. XRD analysis indicated that the α-Mn-type phase begins to be deposited at temperatures between 30 °C and 40 °C. Below this the equilibrium BCC phase is deposited. Plating at 60 °C produced deposits composed completely of the α-Mn-type phase. TEM analysis indicated that increasing the plating temperature refined the deposit’s grain structure and also led to regions with preferred orientation. Annealing of deposits composed of the α-Mn-type phase above its transformation temperature resulted {{in the formation of}} a textured BCC phase. The presence of the α-Mn-type phase led to high deposit <b>coercivities.</b> Annealing of deposits, which resulted in transformation of the α-Mn-type phase to the BCC phase, reduced their <b>coercivities.</b> The <b>coercivities</b> of these films, however, were not reduced to the level of those deposits which were plated as the BCC phase. In deposits completely composed of the BCC phase, either plated as such or transformed, annealing led to higher <b>coercivities.</b> This is attributed to coarsening of the deposit microstructure...|$|R

25|$|The {{continuous}} {{torque density}} of conventional electric machines {{is determined by}} the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation. Despite the high <b>coercivity</b> of neodymium or samarium-cobalt PMs, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or PM damage.|$|E

Magnetite particles are of interests in bioscience applications such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since iron oxide magnetite nanoparticles represent a non-toxic alternative to currently employed gadolinium-based contrast agents. However, due to lack of control over the specific transformations involved {{in the formation of the}} particles, truly superparamagnetic particles have not yet been prepared from magnetite, i.e. magnetite nanoparticles that completely lose their permanent magnetic characteristic in the absence of an external magnetic field (which by definition show a <b>coercivity</b> of 0 A/m).

40|$|The {{structural}} and magnetic properties of Co:C nanocomposite films {{at room temperature}} were investigated as functions of annealing temperature, Co concentration, and film thickness. The as-deposited films, which were cosputtered from Co and C onto water-cooled glass substrates, are nonmagnetic amorphous Co–C alloys. Hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) Co grains are formed in 100 nm films annealed at 300 °C and most Co takes this structure when annealed at higher temperatures. The sizes of the Co grains range from 10 to 25 nm, with larger grain size resulting from higher annealing temperature and higher Co concentration. With the increase of annealing temperature and Co concentration, the magnetic activation or switching volumes increase faster than the physical grain volumes, suggesting the increased exchange coupling between neighboring Co grains. The films with high <b>coercivities</b> have optimal combinations of large grain size and weak intergrain exchange coupling before a network-like structure is formed and the percolation threshold is reached. <b>Coercivities</b> of about 800 Oe were obtained in 100 nm films with annealing temperature of 400 °C and Co concentration of 60 at. %. Higher <b>coercivities,</b> up to 1030 Oe, were obtained in films with reduced thickness and elevated annealing temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} of <b>coercivities</b> and magnetic interactions {{in a set}} of polycrystalline Ni(0. 8) Fe(0. 2) /FeMn bilayers have been determined using the first-order reversal curve (FORC) formalism. The thickness of the permalloy (Py) film was fixed at 10 nm (nominal), while that of the FeMn film varied within the range 0 - 20 nm. The FORC diagrams of each bilayer displayed two clearly distinguishable regions. The main region was generated by Py particles whose <b>coercivities</b> were enhanced in comparison with those in which the FeMn film was absent (sample O). The minor region was produced by Py particles with <b>coercivities</b> similar to or slightly higher than those of particles in the Py film of sample O. Each sample presented two {{distributions of}} interaction fields, one for each region, and both were centred slightly below the exchange-bias field, thus indicating a prevalence of magnetizing interactions. These results are consistent with a grain size distribution in the Py layer and the presence of uncompensated antiferromagnetic moments.
