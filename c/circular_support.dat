50|$|The {{functions}} are a basis defined over the <b>circular</b> <b>support</b> area, typically the pupil planes in classical optical imaging at visible and infrared wavelengths through systems of lenses and mirrors of finite diameter. Their advantages are the simple analytical properties {{inherited from the}} simplicity of the radial functions and the factorization in radial and azimuthal functions; this leads, for example, to closed-form expressions of the two-dimensional Fourier transform in terms of Bessel functions. Their disadvantage, in particular if high n are involved, is the unequal distribution of nodal lines over the unit disk, which introduces ringing effects near the perimeter , which often leads attempts to define other orthogonal functions over the circular disk.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{pull-out}} {{bond test}} with short bond length for {{estimation of the}} splitting tendency of different rib shapes for reinforcing bars is proposed and investigated. In the test the bond force component along the bar is separated from the radial one. The radial component is determined by measuring circumferential strain in a steel ring surrounding the concrete of the pull-out specimen. The force component, which is longitudinal to the bar, is obtained by supporting the pull-out specimen with a teflon covered <b>circular</b> <b>support</b> close to the bar. Bars with specially turned ribs are studied concerning rib height and rib distance. Swedish standard high bond bars are also studied. The splitting tendency is stated {{as a function of}} the slip of the free bar end and also of the related rib area of the bars...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{lateral support}} and support frames were {{designed}} using a ball caster and circular rod, shown in Fig.  2. The <b>circular</b> <b>support</b> rod can move laterally {{to adjust the}} width of the beam and is fastened to act as a lateral support condition. The ball caster, which is in contact with the side surface of the top and bottom flanges of the beam, contains grease to minimize friction resistance at the contact surface of the ball caster and the circular rod. The top and bottom ball casters, which provide lateral support to the top and bottom flanges of the beam, respectively, is free to move up and down, as well as rotate when the rotations about the strong and weak axes occur in the beam. Therefore, the in-plane and out-of-plane rotations of a beam are unconstrained at the support locations.|$|E

X_M of M independent NxN Gaussian random matrices in the large-N limit is rotationally symmetric in the complex plane and is given by a simple expression rho(z,z̅) = 1 /(Mπσ^ 2 |z|^- 2 + 2 /M for |z| σ. The parameter σ corresponds to the radius of the <b>circular</b> <b>support</b> and {{is related to the}} amplitude of the Gaussian fluctuations. This form of the eigenvalue density is highly universal. It is identical for products of Gaussian Hermitian, non-Hermitian, real or complex random matrices.

40|$|Abstract: A new meshless Local Boundary Integral Equation (LBIE) {{method for}} solving {{two-dimensional}} elastostatic problems is proposed. Randomly distributed points without any connectivity requirement cover the analyzed domain and Lo-cal Radial Basis Functions (LRBFs) are employed for the meshless interpolation of displacements. For each point a <b>circular</b> <b>support</b> domain is centered {{and a local}} integral representation for displacements is considered. At the local circular bound-aries tractions are eliminated {{with the aid of}} companion solution, while at the in-tersections between the local domains and the global boundary displacements and tractions are treated as independent variables avoiding thus derivatives of LRBFs. Stresses are evaluated with high accuracy and without derivatives of LRBFs via a LBIE valid for stresses. All the integrations are performed quickly and economi-cally and in a way that renders the extension of the method to three-dimensional problems straightforward. Six representative numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed methodology are provided...|$|E

40|$|A {{soot blower}} {{is used to}} blow off soot on tubes in a tubular heat exchanger, or a gas heater. The soot blower has a long {{flexible}} tube, that is, a lance tube, 8 m long and 76. 2 mm in diameter, which is put slowly into/out of a gas heater. Steam flows through the lance tube and is discharged at the free end to blow off soot. The lance tube, rotating slowly about its axis at about 12 rpm, is supported at an intermediate position by a support bearing, that is, a lance bearing. Vibrations and noises occurred in operation while a lance tube is being put into a gas heater slowly. They are considered self-excited vibrations due to friction between the lance tube and the lance bearing. From frequency analysis dominant frequencies of the observed vibrations are the eighth to tenth natural frequencies. Experimental study is done to clarify the mechanism of the vibration. Accordingly, backward whirling motion of a shaft is observed. As the clearance between the flexible shaft and the <b>circular</b> <b>support</b> is reduced, higher modes appear...|$|E
40|$|Numerous scale-invariant feature {{matching}} algorithms using scale-space analysis {{have been}} proposed for use with perspective cameras, where scale-space is defined as convolution with a Gaussian. The contribution of this work is a method suitable for use with wide angle cameras. Given an input image, we map it to the unit sphere and obtain scale-space images by convolution with {{the solution of the}} spherical diffusion equation on the sphere which we implement in the spherical Fourier domain. Using such an approach, the scale-space response of a point in space is independent of its position on the image plane for a camera subject to pure rotation. Scale-invariant features are then found as local extrema in scale-space. Given this set of scale-invariant features, we then generate feature descriptors by considering a <b>circular</b> <b>support</b> region defined on the sphere whose size is selected relative to the feature scale. We compare our method to a naive implementation of SIFT where the image is treated as perspective, where our results show an improvement in matching performance...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} coordinated {{rehabilitation}} components, {{which are used}} at individuals with cerebral palsy (combined disability) in a concrete non state medical institution in České Budějovice. Cerebral palsy is the most frequent neurodevelopmental disease, wherein the health disability may occur {{in one or more}} fields. We can find crucial factor in care of individuals with handicap in coordinated rehabilitation, which is currently perceived as an interdisciplinary field seeking the fastest and widest participation of personal with disabilities in all usual activies of society with the use of medical, educational, social and labour resources. A prerequisite for success is a multidisciplinary team (<b>circular</b> <b>support),</b> which consists of experts and parents of individuals with disabilities. The thesis contains theoretical background, where health disbility, coordinated rehabilitation and cerebral palsy is mentioned, at which the occurrence, forms, associated disorders and treatment are described. A separate chapter is devoted to families of individuals with health disability, where I mentioned the reaction of parents on {{the birth of a child}} with a disability, the impact of disability on the family and family support. Furthermore I focus on social services for handicapped people and to ARPIDA centre, where my research took place. In the research section there is defined the aim of the thesis, which was to chart a coordinated rehabilitation components, which are used at individuals with cerebral palsy (combined disability) in ARPIDA centre in České Budějovice. The partial target of my thesis was also to compare the usage of coordinated rehabilitation components at individuals under 15 years of age and at individuals over 15 years. According to target of the work there were developed three hypotheses. Thesis research was conducted through quantitative research. To obtain the data, I used the method of questioning. The sample was comprised of individuals with cerebral palsy (combined disability), who attend the centre ARPIDA, while the questionnaires were filled out by their parents. The research undertaken within the thesis, which was supported by rehearsed literature, confirmed the third hypothesis of more often usuage of Vojta reflex locomotion method at individuals with cerebral palsy in the centre ARPIDA compared to individual therapeutic physical training. The remaining two hypotheses were disproved. Statistical survey also shows that care for people with cerebral palsy is a long-term care, where interconnection of services within the coordinated rehabilitation is needed. In the group of individuals under 15 years of age and over 15 years it has been used different coordinated rehabilitation components, this is associated with cerebral palsy, disorders, age and other factors. Problematic remains the job placement of individuals with disabilities, who remain at home without further stimulation possibility. Care and services in the centre ARPIDA were assessed positively. The results and conclusions of the thesis will be used as a feedback centre ARPIDA to map the coordinated rehabilitation components and further to the clearing of needs of single coordinated rehabilitation components in a group of individuals under 15 years of age and over 15 years...|$|E
