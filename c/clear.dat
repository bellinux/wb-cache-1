40|$|The {{overall effect}} of tree <b>clearing</b> on pasture, litter {{production}} and major soil parameters were analysed using multivariate analysis. "Tree <b>clearing</b> is practised for greater beef production and hence monetary gains from grazing systems of central Queensland. The {{high rates of}} <b>clearing</b> {{in the past and}} even recently (577, 000 ha/yr during 1999 - 2001) were mainly to develop land for pastures. The sustainability of <b>cleared</b> pasture systems over the long-term is questioned. Three major types of tree communities i. e. Eucalyptus populnea F. Muell., E. melanophloia F. Muell. and Acacia harpophylla F. Muell. ex. Benth. were selected on one property in central Queensland to quantify the impacts of <b>clearing</b> on pasture production and composition, and soil properties. The impacts were measured over time-since-clearing (recent (30 years)) in unreplicated <b>cleared</b> pastures in comparison to their replicated uncleared/intact woodland pastures of each tree community. Measures of pasture above-ground biomass production on a single property over time-sinceclearing in <b>cleared</b> systems showed that gains were not sustained over the long-term. The difference in response to <b>clearing</b> between tree communities was evident and important to support the future policy decisions. The impact of <b>clearing</b> on soil properties (physicochemical and biological) was confirmed, and explained the lesser availability of nutrients with time of <b>clearing</b> in <b>cleared</b> pastures.
