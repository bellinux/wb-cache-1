40|$|Chemical {{mechanical}} polishing (CMP) of metals {{has emerged as}} a <b>critical</b> <b>process</b> <b>step</b> for the fabrication of advanced integrated circuit devices in the semiconductor industry. In a typical metal CMP process, the metal film is blanket deposited to fill recessed features on a patterned dielectric on silicon. Following metal deposition and gap fill, the metal overabundance is polished away by CMP, leaving an inlayed metal pattern or damascene structure on the substrate. Removal of the metal overabundance also planarizes the wafer surface for subsequent processing steps. The material removal process occurring during CMP is thought to involve the combined action of chemical oxidation and dissolution, and mechanical removal of material by abrasives. However, the relative contribution of mechanical and chemical effects during metal CMP is not well understood. The objective of this research was to characterize the fundamental electrochemical behavior of tungsten and aluminum thin films in polishing chemistries of interest to CMP. It was also of interest {{to determine the extent to}} which electrochemical oxidation and dissolution, or mechanical removal by abrasive action assists in material removal during CMP. A simultaneous electrochemical tester and polishing tool was developed to characterize the electrochemical behavior of tungsten and aluminum during and after abrasion. Small-scale polishing experiments were also carried out to measure polishing (removal) rates of the metals during CMP. Electrochemical dissolution rates and polishing rates were compared. It was found that the electrochemical dissolution rate of tungsten or aluminum during or after abrasion was very small compared to actual polishing rates. However, the presence of an oxidant enhanced polishing rates dramatically. The findings indicate that the mechanism for removal during CMP is primarily corrosion assisted metal removal, and not electrochemical dissolution and/or removal of the oxidation product of the metal...|$|E
40|$|The powder {{metallurgy}} (PM) {{process is a}} cost efficient near net-shape technology suitable for sustainable manufacturing of structural steel components. A drawback with the PM technology is the difficulty to use oxidation sensitive alloying elements, such as Cr and Mn. These are effective alloying elements and their cost is {{significantly lower than the}} cost of the most commonly used alloying elements (Cu, Ni and Mo) in PM steel. Hence, increased usage of Cr and Mn as alloying elements in PM steel is crucial for retaining the competitiveness of the PM technology versus other metal forming processes. Sintering is the most <b>critical</b> <b>process</b> <b>step</b> when manufacturing PM steel parts from oxidation sensitive powder. The research work presented in this thesis was aimed at building a fundamental knowledge platform regarding key aspects of sintering PM steel prealloyed with Cr and Mn. These aspects are sintering atmosphere requirements, oxide reduction mechanisms, and effects of residual oxides on mechanical properties of the sintered material. The test materials used in the research studies were four different water-atomized steel powder grades prealloyed with 3 %Cr- 0. 5 %Mo, 1. 5 %Cr- 0. 2 %Mo, 1. 8 %Cr and 0. 8 %Cr- 0. 4 %Mn. Compacted specimens based on these powder grades were used for sintering experiments in N 2 /H 2 (90 / 10) atmosphere at temperatures in the range of 1120 - 1300 °C. Oxide reduction reactions during sintering were studied by the means of photoacoustic spectroscopy. Mechanical properties of the sintered specimens were evaluated through hardness measurements, tensile tests and impact tests. The analysis techniques used for evaluation of specimen microstructures and fracture surfaces were light-optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The research work shows that the critical oxygen partial pressure in the sintering atmosphere can be well-predicted by thermodynamic calculations of oxide stabilities in the steel. Stable Cr-Mn spinel oxides on the powder surfaces are reduced via carbothermal reactions at temperatures above 1000 °C. Sintering for 30 minutes at 1120 °C in a reducing atmosphere gives incomplete reduction of these oxides, which does not affect the sinter neck formation in the PM part. Increased sintering temperature to 1200 - 1250 °C enables nearly complete oxide reduction, although high PM part density may obstruct the reduction of the stable oxides due to less effective CO diffusion in the pore system of the part. Residual oxides after sintering are in the form of micrometer size particulate features and these have no detrimental effect on the evaluated mechanical properties of the PM steel...|$|E

The problem we address here is managing capacity production by respecting these complex time constraints in semiconductor fabrication plant. Our work is about a specific area of semiconductor fab. An area is represented by a sequence of <b>process</b> <b>steps</b> which are linked by complex time constraints. A time constraint covers a sequence of <b>process</b> <b>steps</b> and represents a maximum time that a product should complete processing on them. Products with a violation of the recommended time constraint have to be scrapped. The capacity of the area is maximum number of products that can be processed by respecting time constraints. To adapt the capacity problem in our fab, two specific points must be taken into account: firstly, the fact that time constraints covers multiple <b>process</b> <b>steps.</b> Secondly, the overlapping among time constraints. In the fab, overlapping among two time constraints occurs when they have some common <b>process</b> <b>steps.</b> To compute capacity of the area, we propose a static approach based on priority of time constraints and <b>critical</b> <b>process</b> <b>steps.</b> There are some papers that address time constraints between <b>process</b> <b>steps</b> for managing capacity [Giglio 1999, Hertzler 2006].

The research found that agents consider really hearing the vendor, getting along with the vendor and getting to know the vendor as key elements of a listing attempt, whilst vendors suggest the path to listing is through negotiation, that some level of negotiation must take place. Research should now examine the influence of time in this <b>critical</b> listing <b>process</b> <b>step</b> with reference to both agent and vendor perspectives using metrics other than perceptions of vendor satisfaction. relationship establishment; sales exchange; buyer-seller interactions;structural equation modelling...|$|R

40|$|This paper details a new {{manufacturing}} process R) r compact disc master stamper production. Stamper is an optical disc industry {{term for the}} mold used to replicate polymer compact discs (CDs) in an injection molding device. The stamper surface contains a negative image of the CDs more than 1 billion, submicrometer features embossed in a spiral pattern on a 138 -ram diameter substrate. In conventional mastering, nickel submaster stampers are generated by electroforming from a glass master. In the proposed process, submaster stampers are not required, and a ceramic master is used directly as a stamper for injection molding. In the new process, ceramic substrates are ion machined through a photoresist mask, resulting in improved productivity, reduced hazardous waste, and lower production costs. All <b>critical</b> <b>process</b> <b>steps</b> have proved feasible in the research reported here. The new stamper production technique replaces the conventional g ass master substrate with a tough ceramic and replaces several difficult electrochemical and manual operations with a single pre-cision ion machining <b>step.</b> <b>Processes</b> that precede and follow stamper fabrication remain largely unchanged. In the new process, precision stamper manufacturing (PSM), more than 200 minutes of chemical pro-cessing, electroforming, back-polishing, punching, and handling are re-placed by fewer than 20 minutes of automatically controlled ion machining. At the same time, PSM eliminates nearly all process teps that produce toxic and hazardous wastes. The process is suitable for production of CD-audio, CD-ROM, and high-density DVD formats. A process flow diagram {{and a series of}} proof-of-concept experiments are described. © Elsevier Science Inc., 199...|$|R
