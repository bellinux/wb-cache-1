5|$|A few {{different}} animals establish <b>commensal</b> {{interactions with}} L.gigas, {{which means that}} both organisms maintain a relationship that benefits (the <b>commensal)</b> species but not the other (in this case, the queen conch). Commensals of this species include certain mollusks, mainly slipper shells (Crepidula spp.) The porcelain crab Porcellana sayana is also {{known to be a}} <b>commensal</b> and a small cardinalfish, known as the conch fish (Astrapogon stellatus), sometimes shelters in the conch's mantle for protection.|$|E
5|$|The prey {{does not}} have to be {{attracted}} towards the predator for the predator to benefit: it is sufficient for the predator simply not to be identified as a threat. Wicklerian-Eisnerian mimics may resemble a mutualistic ally, or a species of little significance to the prey such as a <b>commensal.</b> For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider <b>commensal</b> of ants.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi have {{important}} symbiotic relationships with organisms from most {{if not all}} Kingdoms. These interactions can be mutualistic or antagonistic in nature, {{or in the case of}} <b>commensal</b> fungi are of no apparent benefit or detriment to the host.|$|E
50|$|Microbiota-derived signals recruit IgA-secreting {{plasma cells}} to mucosal sites. For example, {{bacteria}} on the apical surfaces of epithelial cells are phagocytosed by dendritic cells located beneath peyer's patches {{and in the}} lamina propria, ultimately leading to differentiation of B cells into plasma cells that secrete IgA specific for intestinal bacteria. The role of microbiota-derived signals in recruiting IgA-secreting plasma cells was confirmed in experiments with antibiotic-treated specific pathogen free and MyD88 KO mice, which have limited <b>commensals</b> and a decreased {{ability to respond to}} <b>commensals.</b> The number of intestinal CD11b+ IgA+ plasma cells was reduced in these mice, suggesting the role of <b>commensals</b> in recruiting IgA-secreting plasma cells. Therefore, <b>commensals</b> can protect the host from harmful pathogens by stimulating IgA production.|$|R
40|$|In {{sluggish}} and comparatively defenceless {{nature of}} the holothurians make them convenient hosts to many <b>commensals</b> and parasites. A variety of <b>commensals,</b> from protozoans to fish, have been reported from them of which the most interesting and classical example is the pearl fish, Carapus formerly known under Fierasfer...|$|R

5|$|Many {{millipede}} {{species have}} <b>commensal</b> relationships with mites of the orders Mesostigmata and Astigmata. Many of these mites {{are believed to}} be phoretic rather than parasitic, which means that they use the millipede host as a means of dispersal.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are <b>commensal</b> with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for {{protection}}, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being {{in close proximity to}} the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
5|$|Ants have colonised {{almost every}} landmass on Earth. The only places lacking {{indigenous}} ants are Antarctica {{and a few}} remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the terrestrial animal biomass. Their success in so many environments {{has been attributed to}} their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, <b>commensal,</b> parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, <b>commensal</b> bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Basidiomycota, {{commonly}} known as the club fungi or basidiomycetes, produce meiospores called basidiospores on club-like stalks called basidia. Most common mushrooms belong to this group, as well as rust and smut fungi, which are major pathogens of grains. Other important basidiomycetes include the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis, human <b>commensal</b> species of the genus Malassezia, and the opportunistic human pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell and}} soft parts of living L.gigas {{serve as a}} home to several {{different}} kinds of <b>commensal</b> animals, including slipper snails, porcelain crabs and cardinalfish. Its parasites include coccidians. The queen conch is hunted and eaten by several species of large predatory sea snails, and also by starfish, crustaceans and vertebrates (fish, sea turtles and humans). Its shell is sold as a souvenir and used as a decorative object. Historically, Native Americans and indigenous Caribbean peoples used parts of the shell to create various tools.|$|E
50|$|The {{balance between}} {{pathogens}} and <b>commensals</b> {{is extremely important}} in the maintenance of homeostasis in the respiratory tract.|$|R
50|$|Members of Acholeplasmatales are facultative anaerobic. They are parasites or <b>commensals</b> of vertebrates, insects, or plants; {{some are}} saprophytes.|$|R
50|$|The larvae live as <b>commensals</b> in nests of wasps of {{the genus}} Vespula. Like all Volucella, the adults are migratory.|$|R
5|$|A few {{species of}} beetles are ectoparasitic on mammals. One such species, Platypsyllus castoris, parasitises beavers (Castor spp.). This beetle lives as a {{parasite}} {{both as a}} larva and as an adult, feeding on epidermal tissue and possibly on skin secretions and wound exudates. They are strikingly flattened dorsoventrally, no doubt as an adaptation for slipping between the beavers' hairs. They are wingless and eyeless, as are many other ectoparasites. Others are kleptoparasites of other invertebrates, such as the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) that infests honey bee nests, while many species are parasitic inquilines or <b>commensal</b> in the nests of ants. A few groups of beetles are primary parasitoids of other insects, feeding off of, and eventually killing their hosts.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or <b>commensal</b> {{relationship}} with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|Cave and archeological remains {{indicate}} that {{the range of the}} marsh rice rat has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene, into central Texas, eastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, central Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, West Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000CE and are associated with corn cultivation, but in some older cave sites the rice rat is found with the extinct giant armadillo Dasypus bellus, suggesting warm climatic conditions. Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled the rice rat to disperse northward and when the climate cooled, relict populations were able to survive in the north as commensals in corn-cultivating Native American communities. Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats, possibly because environmental constraints were relaxed in <b>commensal</b> populations.|$|E

5|$|Since {{birds are}} highly visible and common animals, humans {{have had a}} {{relationship}} with them since the dawn of man. Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana. Other times, they may be <b>commensal,</b> as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard. Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).|$|E
5|$|Some teleosts are parasites. Remoras {{have their}} front dorsal fins {{modified}} into large suckers {{with which they}} cling onto a host animal such as a whale, sea turtle, shark or ray, but this is probably a <b>commensal</b> rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin. More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues. The snubnosed eel, though usually a scavenger, sometimes bores into the flesh of a fish, and has been found inside {{the heart of a}} shortfin mako shark.|$|E
5|$|Swimming {{behavior}} in mantas differs across habitats: when travelling over deep water, they swim {{at a constant}} rate in a straight line, while further inshore they usually bask or swim idly around. Mantas may travel alone or in groups of up to 50. They may associate with other fish species as well as sea birds and marine mammals. Mantas sometimes breach, leaping partially or entirely out of the water. Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps one after the other. These leaps come in three forms: forward leaps where the fish lands head first, similar jumps with a tail first re-entry or somersaults. The reason for breaching is not known; possible explanations include mating rituals, birthing, communication, or the removal of parasites and <b>commensal</b> remoras (suckerfish).|$|E
30|$|Conclusions: At our large University Hospital ICU with a {{heterogeneous}} patient population, {{the introduction of}} routine daily chlorhexidine-impregnated cloth bathing appears to significantly {{reduce the incidence of}} bacteraemias due to skin <b>commensals</b> and demonstrates a non-significant reduction in CLABSIs. Given the uncertainties surrounding diagnosis in the ICU, the effect seen may be of benefit in reducing the use of antibiotics to cover for these skin <b>commensals</b> - both in terms of antibiotic stewardship and health economics.|$|R
40|$|Diabetic foot {{infection}} is commonly encountered in clinical practice usually {{as a consequence}} of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) (Edmonds, 2005); all open wounds are colonised with bacteria normally found on the skin surface (skin <b>commensals).</b> Usually skin <b>commensals</b> colonise a wound without impacting negatively on wound healing as the level of bacteria present is low. However diabetes is known to impair the normal immune response rendering individuals with diabetic foot ulceration susceptible to infection (Falanga, 2005) ...|$|R

5|$|The main {{hormonal}} {{driver of}} oily sebum {{production in the}} skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. Higher amounts of DHEA-S are secreted during adrenarche (a stage of puberty), and this leads {{to an increase in}} sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely <b>commensal</b> skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is known to be essential to comedo formation.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} (Oryzomys palustris) is a semiaquatic North American rodent {{in the family}} Cricetidae. It usually occurs in wetland habitats, such as swamps and salt marshes. It is found mostly in the eastern and {{southern}} United States, from New Jersey and Kansas south to Florida and northeasternmost Tamaulipas, Mexico; its range previously extended further west and north, where {{it may have been}} a <b>commensal</b> in corn-cultivating communities. Weighing about , the marsh rice rat is a medium-sized rodent that resembles the common black and brown rat. The upperparts are generally gray-brown, but are reddish in many Florida populations. The feet show several specializations for life in the water. The skull is large and flattened, and is short at the front.|$|E
5|$|The {{massive and}} rapid {{expansion}} of the cattle egret's range is due to its relationship with humans and their domesticated animals. Originally adapted to a <b>commensal</b> relationship with large grazing and browsing animals, it was easily able to switch to domesticated cattle and horses. As the keeping of livestock spread throughout the world, the cattle egret was able to occupy otherwise empty niches. Many populations of cattle egrets are highly migratory and dispersive, and this has helped the species' range expansion. The species {{has been seen as}} a vagrant in various sub-Antarctic islands, including South Georgia, Marion Island, the South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkney Islands. A small flock of eight birds was also seen in Fiji in 2008.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} <b>commensals</b> {{at the peak of}} infection with the colonic mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Bioluminescent and kanamycin (Kan) -resistant C. rodentium persisted avirulently in the cecal lumen of mice continuously treated with Kan. A single Kan treatment was sufficient to displace C. rodentium from the colonic mucosa, a phenomenon not observed following treatment with vancomycin (Van) or metronidazole (Met). Kan, Van, and Met induce distinct dysbiosis, suggesting C. rodentium relies on specific <b>commensals</b> for colonic colonization. Expression of the master virulence regulator ler is induced in germ-free mice, yet C. rodentium is only seen in the cecal lumen. Moreover, in conventional mice, a single Kan treatment was sufficient to displace C. rodentium constitutively expressing Ler from the colonic mucosa. These results show that expression of virulence genes is not sufficient for colonization of the colonic mucosa and that <b>commensals</b> are essential for a physiological infection course...|$|R
