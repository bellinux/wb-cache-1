Since 9 / 11, the dominant view {{is that we have}} entered an era of ‘new conflict’ in which technology has empowered non-state actors who now pose unprecedented and unmanageable threats to U. S. national security. From homegrown and foreign terrorism to the possibility of <b>cyber</b> <b>sabotage</b> and fears of religious subversion, David Tucker challenges every aspect of this ‘new conflict’ argument, writes Maria Kuecken...|$|E

This paper proposes a simulation of attackers and defenders, who have limited resources that must be applied to either advancing the technology they have available to them or attempting to attack (defend) the system. The objective is to identify the appropriate deployment of specific defensive strategy, such as Defense-in-depth and Critical Component Defense. The problem is represented as a strategic competitive optimisation problem, which is solved using a coevolutionary Particle Swarm Optimisation problem. Through the development of optimal defense strategies, {{it is possible to}} identify when each specific defensive strategies is most appropriate; where the optimal defensive strategy depends on the kind of attacker the system is expecting and the structure of the network...|$|R

Human activity become faster, easier, and practical because of the human mobilities become faster, through this {{improvement of}} technology, now the society has more widely scope of movement. Human activity that originally national oriented by nature has changing to globally oriented. Altough this improvement makes much easier for human life, it also cause many problems which {{is not so easy}} to find the way out. One problem that occur because of the improvement of technology, especially the technology with the internet as a supporting tool, is well known as cybercrime. This crime not only ‘new’ but also create the widely effect not just inside the region of a nation but spread worldwide also. For that reason, in this thesis, the writer proposes the title : ‘The Analysis of Cybercrime from the Perspective of Criminology and Fiqh Jinayah. ’ In connection with the problem of the study, in this thesis, writer proposed to find out any kind of cybercrime which is committed by the black hat hackers or crackers and to described the fiqh jinayah (Islamic criminal law) and criminology point of view about the cybercrime. For better result, the writer uses descriptive research method with comparative approach, that is :comparing data related to the writer’s study for obtaining data which is closer to the truth and finally the writer can make a conclusion, this descriptive research method also known as normative survey. From the result of the writer’s analysis about this cybercrime, the writer conclude that basically, cybercrime is a criminal act which is related to computer and internet (cyberspace), both criminal act to public facility in cyberspace or criminal act to privat domain. There are some types of cybercrime, that is : first, unauthorized access to computer system and service (a crime which is committed by entering / penetrating the computer system illegally) ; second, illegal contents (a crime which is committed by put some untrue data or information into the internet) ; third, data forgery (a crime which is committed by forgering data) ; fourth, cyber espionage (a crime which is committed by using the internet network to spy on something or someone) ; fifth, <b>cyber</b> <b>sabotage</b> and extortion (a crime which is committed by disturbing or destroying data) ; sixth, offense againts intellectual property (this crime refer to the Intellectual Property Rights) ; seventh, infringements of privacy (this crime refer to someone’s information which is...|$|E
40|$|Workplace {{deviance}} {{is voluntary}} behaviour that violates significant organizational norms {{and in so}} ding, threatens the well being of the organization or its members or both. Workplace deviance can be captured with two general factors interpersonal deviance and organizational deviance. Interpersonal deviance includes those behaviours which are directly harmful to other individuals with in the organization such as sexual harassment, aggression and violence, bullying and incivility etc, while organization deviance includes those behaviours which are directly harmful to organization, Such as fraud, <b>Cyber</b> slacking, <b>Sabotage</b> and Theft etc. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the workplace deviance exhibited by the teaching staff working in public and private universities. For this purpose the researchers investigated workplace deviance by implementing a survey research. Two public and two private universities were selected and from these universities hundred and twenty lecturers (60 from public and 60 from private universities) were selected randomly. A standardized questionnaire was distributed among the teaching staff of the Universities. The questionnaire composed of total 19 items divided in two scales, 7 -items measured interpersonal deviance and 12 -items measured organizational deviance. Respondent were asked to indicate on a 7 -point likert scale the extent to which they are engaged in each of the behaviour. The responses ranged from 1 (never) to 7 (daily). The data collected in terms of participant’s ranking responses was analyzed by applying descriptive and inferential statistical techniques such as means and t-test. After careful data analysis the researchers concluded that there is significant difference in work place deviance between the teaching staff of public and private universities. The ratio of workplace deviance is greater in teaching staff working in public universities as compared to the teaching staff working in private universities. In this article by the term ‘organization’, the researchers meant University and by the term ‘employees’, the researchers meant teaching staff...|$|R
