25|$|In 2009, Zappos started {{exploring}} an acquisition by Amazon. Within Zappos’ {{board of}} directors, {{two of the}} five—Hsieh and Alfred Lin—were primarily concerned with maintaining Zappos <b>company</b> <b>culture,</b> whereas the other three wanted to maximize profits in a down economy. Initially, Hsieh and Lin planned to buy out their board of directors, which they estimated would cost $200 million. In the midst of this, Amazon executives approached Zappos with the proposition of buying Zappos outright. After an hour-long meeting with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Hsieh sensed that Amazon {{would be open to}} letting Zappos continue to operate as an independent entity, and started negotiations. On July 22, 2009, Amazon announced that it would buy Zappos for $940 million in a stock and cash deal. Owners of shares of Zappos were set to receive approximately 10 million Amazon.com shares, and employees would receive a separate $40 million in cash and restricted stock units. The deal was eventually closed in November 2009 for a reported $1.2 billion.|$|E

500|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2008 and on caused further difficulties for Comverse Technology, with new layoffs occurring in October 2008, March 2009, and August 2009. [...] The company reportedly lost considerable money in 2009, and the moves were typical of other hi-tech companies {{caught in the}} bad economic environment. [...] Some of Comverse's products were still viewed highly; a Yankee Group survey ranked them first {{in the world in}} their type of billing services, and they were the worldwide market-share leaders in providing multimedia message service centers to wireless carriers. [...] However, the rise in popularity of smartphones and of sending e-mail eroded the carrier market for some of Comverse's products and services. [...] By 2009, the company's upper management was now largely American rather than Israeli, Dahan was under internal criticism, and there were frequent clashes regarding <b>company</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E

500|$|SAS spokespeople say its {{employee}} benefits are provided for business, not altruistic, reasons. The company evaluates new benefits using three criteria: {{whether it would}} benefit the <b>company</b> <b>culture,</b> whether it would serve {{a significant number of}} employees and whether it would save more money than is spent on it. According to academics, the company's practices improve the loyalty, focus and creativity of its staff. Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer from the Stanford Graduate School of Business estimated that the company saves $60–$80 million annually in expenses related to employee turnover. SAS has an annual employee turnover of three to five percent, while the software industry's average is 20 to 25 percent. According to USA Today, the workplace culture has created [...] "intensely loyal" [...] staff who care about the company's well-being. [...] Even though there are unlimited sick days, the average employee takes only two. The 40,000 free medical visits provided to employees annually are estimated to cost the company $4.5 million USD, but save it $5 million USD due to the employee productivity lost when staff spend their work-hours in waiting rooms at other hospitals.|$|E

500|$|... 343 {{started with}} a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through {{development}}. Halo 4s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told {{they were going to be}} working on Halo 4. [...] "We had people who we hired who hated Halo because of 'X,'" [...] said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. [...] "But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team." [...] This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, Halo 4 executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make [...] "necessary mistakes", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties. Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. [...] With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and <b>company</b> <b>culture</b> was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an [...] "epiphany moment" [...] that proved the team was headed in the right direction was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was [...] "very traditional [...] ". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.|$|E

[...] Understanding the people in organizations, the current <b>company</b> <b>culture,</b> motivation, leadership, and past performance is essential to recognize, understand, and integrate into the vision and implementation of BPR. [...] If the human element is given equal or greater emphasis in BPR, the odds of successful business transformation increase substantially.|$|E

A core group of artists, designers, and programmers left MicroProse UK to join Psygnosis, which opened an office in Stroud specifically to attract ex-MicroProse employees. In 1994, Stealey departed MicroProse and Spectrum HoloByte agreed to buy out his shares. He later commented, [...] "Spectrum Holobyte {{had a lot of}} cash and very few products. Microprose had a lot of products and no cash. It was a great marriage, but the new company only needed one chairman, so I resigned." [...] Stealey went on to found an independent game company Interactive Magic (also specializing in vehicle simulators and strategy games), while Andy Hollis departed for Origin Systems, and Sandy Petersen joined id Software.|$|E
