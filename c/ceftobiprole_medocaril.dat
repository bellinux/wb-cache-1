50|$|Ceftobiprole is {{the active}} moiety of the prodrug <b>ceftobiprole</b> <b>medocaril</b> and is {{available}} for i.v. treatment only. The recommended dose is 500 mg as 2-hour infusion every 8 hours. It is mainly excreted renally. Dose adjustment is required for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and for patients with end-stage renal disease, but no dose adjustment is needed by gender, ethnicity or age, in severely obese patients or in patients with hepatic impairment.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{there are}} only two drugs in this category, Ceftobiprole and Ceftaroline. These new drugs are also the only β-lactam {{antibiotics}} that are effective against methicillin-resistant-Staphylococcus-aureus (MRSA). Ceftobiprole is a pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem. The C-3 side chain was specifically designed to have a strong binding affinity to PBP2a and PBP2x. PBP2a is known to give staphylococci resistance to other β-lactam drugs and PBPx does the same for pneumococci. Ceftobiprole also has an aminothiazoylhydroxyimino side chain at the C-7 position which is known to give good resistance to β-lactamase from S. aureus. Together these active groups make Ceftobiprole bactericidal to MRSA. Ceftobiprole has poor water solubility and is therefore administered intravenously as an ester prodrug called <b>Ceftobiprole</b> <b>medocaril.</b> It is rapidly broken down into active Ceftobiprole by plasma esterases.Ceftaroline was developed from the fourth generation cephalosporin Cefozopran. It retains the alkoxyimino group at position C-7 from earlier generations so it is fairly stable in the presence of many β-lactamases. Since MRSA and penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae have resistance dedicated to new types of PBP, PBP2a and PBP2x respectively, both Ceftaroline and Ceftobiprole have C-3 side chains specially engineered to bind these new PBP. In the case of Ceftaroline this side chain contains a 2-thioazolythio spacer linkage optimised for its anti-MRSA activity. Ceftaroline has low water solubility but this problem was overcome by attaching a N-phosphonoamino group to the molecule making the intravenous prodrug Ceftaroline fosamil. The prodrug is dephosphorylated in plasma to form active Ceftaroline.|$|E

Ceftobiprole exhibits broad bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methods: A subgroup analysis was performed from a large multinational, double-blind, randomised study (NCT 00210964) in patients with HAP (excluding VAP) who were in the ICU at randomization. Ceftobiprole (500 mg three times daily (tid)) was compared to ceftazidime (2000 mg tid) and linezolid (600 mg twice daily), intravenously for 7 - 14 days. Primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (7 - 14 days after end of treatment). Results: In the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set, a subgroup of 219 / 571 (38 %) were ICU patients. 29 / 219 (13 %) patients had baseline bacteraemia. 154 / 219 (70 %) patients had a valid baseline pathogen (respiratory specimen and/or blood culture), 28 / 154 (18 %) presented with MRSA and 23 / 154 (15 %) with P. aeruginosa.

Among 152 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including 5 vancomycin-intermediate and 2 vancomycin-resistant strains, MIC 50 and MIC 90 values for ceftobiprole were each 0. 5 μg/ml against methicillin-susceptible strains and 2 μg/ml against methicillin-resistant strains. Against 151 coagulase-negative staphylococci (including 4 vancomycin-intermediate strains), MIC 50 and MIC 90 values were, respectively, 0. 125 μg/ml and 1 μg/ml against methicillin-susceptible and 1 μg/ml and 2 μg/ml against methicillin-resistant strains. Teicoplanin was less active than vancomycin against coagulase-negative strains. Linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and daptomycin were active against all strains, whereas increased MICs for amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, minocycline, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, rifampin, mupirocin, fusidic acid, and fosfomycin were sometimes observed. At 2 × MIC, ceftobiprole was bactericidal against 11 of 12 test strains by 24 h. Prolonged serial passage {{in the presence of}} subinhibitory concentrations of ceftobiprole failed to select for clones with MICs > 4 times those of the parents; the maximum MIC achieved for ceftobiprole after 50 passages (in 1 of 10 strains) was 8 μg/ml.

We also included in the tests the highly oxacillin-resistant subpopulations that are present with low frequencies in the cultures of these clones.

We also tested the efficacy of BPR against MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and against MRSA strains carrying the enterococcal vancomycin resistance gene complex. BPR was shown to be uniformly effective against all these resistant MRSA strains, and the mechanism of superb antimicrobial activity correlated with the strikingly increased affinity of the cephalosporin against penicillin-binding protein 2 A, the protein product of the antibiotic resistance determinant mecA...|$|E

Methods: A post-hoc analysis from a double-blind randomised phase 3 study was performed to analyse clinical cure at TOC and 30 -day ACM with ceftobiprole (500 mg q 8 h) compared to a combination therapy of ceftazidime (2000 mg q 8 h) plus linezolid (600 mg q 12 h) in HAP 1.  Patients with VAP were excluded from the analysis of HAP patients. Early/Late-onset HAP was defined as time from hospitalisation to randomisation < 5 / ≥ 5 days.   Results: 571 patients with HAP (excluding VAP) were randomised in the study (ITT analysis), 171 (29. 9 %) with early-onset HAP and 400  (70. 1 %) with late-onset HAP. The spectrum of baseline pathogens was similar overall in early vs late-onset HAP with a somewhat higher prevalence of Gram-negative pathogens in the late-onset HAP group. The prevalence of baseline pathogens in the early vs late-onset HAP groups were as follows: Gram-positive pathogens in 57 % vs 54 %, Gram-negative pathogens in 57 % vs 68 %, S. aureus in 38 % vs 37 %, MRSA in 13 % vs 18 %, P. aeruginosa in 18 % vs 14 %, and Acinetobacter baumannii in 3 % vs 9 %. Clinical cure rates at TOC and 30 -day ACM for ceftobiprole vs ceftazidime/linezolid (ITT analysis set) were similar in both treatment groups and also in early vs. late-onset HAP (Figure 1). Conclusion: In this large, randomised study, timing of onset of HAP (early or late) had no major impact on pathogen spectrum or clinical outcomes. Ceftobiprole showed similar efficacy as combined ceftazidime/linezolid in patients with early and late-onset HAP (excluding VAP). References: 1. Awad et al. Clin Infect Dis. 201...|$|E
