5|$|The Charodis, {{the second-largest}} group, were <b>converts</b> from the Kshatriya (warrior class) and Vaishya (merchant class) castes. They were {{generally}} engaged in trade and commercial vocations. The artisan <b>converts</b> formed the third-biggest group and {{were known as}} Sudirs (the Konkani word for Shudras, which were the labour class). They were workers and agricultural labourers engaged in service professions. The <b>converts</b> from the fisher caste residing around Ullal, Kuloor, and other places around the seacoast were called Gaudis, and formed the fourth group. They cultivated the lands of the Bamonns and the high-caste Hindus. Other minor castes included the Padvals, whom historian Severine Silva assumes to be local Jain <b>converts.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ruthenium forms a {{wide range}} {{compounds}} with carbon-ruthenium bonds. Grubbs' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis. Ruthenocene is analogous to ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. The colorless liquid ruthenium pentacarbonyl <b>converts</b> {{in the absence of}} CO pressure to the dark red solid triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. Ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride (RuCl2(PPh3)3), which <b>converts</b> to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh3)3).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether ethnicity impacts graft outcomes in kidney transplant patients <b>converted</b> to sirolimus (SRL) and maintained on either calcineurin inhibitors (CI) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with steroids. METHODS: This study analyzed kidney transplants <b>converted</b> to SRL and transplanted between July 1991 and April 2007. Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI; group 2 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI; group 3 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF; group 4 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF. RESULTS: A total of 242 patients was included. Demographics, baseline immunosuppression, and reason for SRL conversion were similar among groups. Patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI regimens had significantly higher rates of acute rejection before SRL conversion, but equal rates after conversion. Development of proteinuria was similar across groups. African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF tended to have poorer outcomes compared with African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI. Non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF tended to have better graft outcomes compared with non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI. CONCLUSIONS: African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL may benefit from continued CI, whereas non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL seem to have better outcomes with MMF. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings...|$|R
