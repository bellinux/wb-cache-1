The residue definition for risk assessment is used by risk assessors to evaluate the potential risk of dietary intake of residues resulting from the application of a pesticide. This document guides the complex process of identifying the pertinent residue components that should be considered for dietary risk assessments of <b>chemical</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances.</b> Specifically, the document provides directions for determining the metabolites that require hazard identification and characterisation using scientific tools and methods ((quantitative) structure-activity relationship ((Q) SAR), read-across, threshold of toxicological concern (TTC)) and available data in combination, and for developing an appropriate testing strategy for these compounds. Further, for activities within the remit of the guidance document the terms 'potency' and 'toxicological burden' for consumers are defined and decision criteria established for the selection of the residue components that {{should be included in the}} residue definition for dietary risk assessment. In order to support the decision process it is recommended to make use of all information available, including mechanistic understanding, and to present detailed information on toxicity and exposure for every single metabolite and on the uncertainties connected to the proposed residue definition. The guidance document is complemented with three practical case studies demonstrating the applicability of the proposed decision scheme...|$|E
40|$|Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a {{medicinal}} plant of containing diverse <b>chemical</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> of several biological properties. So, {{the aim of}} the current investigation was to assess the effects of water leaf extract of neem plant on the survival and healthy status of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), African cat fish (Clarias gariepinus) and zooplankton community. The laboratory determinations of lethal concentrations (LC 100 and LC 50) through a static bioassay test were performed. The 24 h LC 100 of neem leaf extract was estimated as 4 and 11 g/l, for juvenile's O. niloticus and C. gariepinus, respectively, while, the 96 -h LC 50 was 1. 8 and 4 g/l, respectively. On the other hand, the 24 h LC 100 for cladocera and copepoda were 0. 25 and 0. 45 g/l, respectively, while, the 96 -h LC 50 was 0. 1 and 0. 2 g/l, respectively. At the highest test concentrations, adverse effects were obvious with significant reductions in several cladoceran and copepod species. Some alterations in glucose levels, total protein, albumin, globulin as well as AST and ALT in plasma of treated O. niloticus and C. gariepinus with 1 / 2 and 1 / 10 LC 50 of neem leaf water extract compared with non-treated one after 2 and 7 days of exposure were recorded and discussed. It could be concluded that the application of neem leaf extract can be used to control unwanted organisms in ponds as environment friendly material instead of deleterious pesticides.

40|$|Fouling is a {{major problem}} in the {{shipping}} industry because it increases the drag of the ship, the fuel consumption and consequently the CO 2 emission. Fouling can consist of slime, algae and/or macro fouling like mussels, barnacles or crabs. To avoid this accretion, antifouling paints cover the immersed parts of the hull. They prevent or limit fouling by using different techniques. Each constructor and developer uses his own formula. One of these methods adds nanoparticles to the top layer coating. Nanoparticles are inorganic materials with a size ranging from 1 to 100 nanometres. They are essentially microscopically small crystal structures intentionally produced to repel micro- and macro fouling without having to resort to active biocides which are <b>chemical</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> designed to destroy or eradicate or repulse harmful species. Some examples of nanoparticles being used are: copper, silver, silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide. These products inhibit the development of nascent growth on submerged surfaces by producing an acid in contact with water or thanks to antimicrobial properties. Next, slipstream washes the remaining fouling away. The main advantage of nanoparticles is that they seem to be eco-friendly compared with other antifouling paints on the market. However, initial studies indicate some bioaccumulation. These preliminary results are not certain yet due to the very active evolution of this technology. The findings of these studies also suggest that that human health may be affected by inhalation of nanoparticles. In general, therefore, it seems that the new type of antifouling paint using nanoparticles is a good alternative to common paints. Nevertheless, there is some reserve concerning the bioaccumulation and the effects on little organisms after a long-term utilisation...|$|R

The intensification of transfer processes into the textile materials is realized in conventional finishing textile industry (washing, cleaning, and coloring) by using high work temperature. The negative result of this intervention {{and the presence of}} chemical substances without degradation mean the environment pollution by the pour out residual water with a great quantity of toxic substances. The recently laboratory scientific research showed that the use of ultrasonic systems in finishing textile materials contributes both to the acceleration of thermo and mass transfer and to the decreasing of <b>active</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances.</b> In this way the paper presents a finishing system based on ultrasonic processes which is composed by modules and specific hardware components...|$|R
50|$|Bone cement {{has proven}} {{particularly}} useful because specific <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> e.g. antibiotics, {{can be added}} to the powder component. The <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are released locally after implant placement of the new joint, i.e. in the immediate vicinity of the new prosthesis and have been confirmed to reduce the danger of infection. The antibiotics act against bacteria precisely at the site where they are required in the open wound without subjecting the body in general to unnecessarily high antibiotic levels. This makes bone cement a modern drug delivery system that delivers the required drugs directly to the surgical site. The important factor is not how much <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is in the cement matrix but how much of the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is actually released locally. Too much <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in the bone cement would actually be detrimental, because the mechanical stability of the fixed prosthesis is weakened by a high proportion of <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in the cement.

Testosterone and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) were used as the reference compounds. The tested EASs had no significant effect on growth and survival at the tested concentration ranges (ng to mu g/L. Classical reproduction endpoints (i. e., oviposition and fecundity) were not responsive to the tested chemicals, except for chlordecone and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, which hampered reproduction from 19. 6 mu g/L and 17. 6 mu g/L, respectively. The frequency of polyembryonic eggs, used as an additional endpoint, demonstrated the effects of all compounds except EE 2. The molecular pathways, which are involved in such reproduction impairments, remain unknown.
