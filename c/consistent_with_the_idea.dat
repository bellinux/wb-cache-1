25|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have provided}} evidence {{which may be}} taken to support Kayne's scheme, such as Lin, who considered Standard Chinese sentences with the sentence-final particle le.

However, Takita (2009) observes that similar restrictions do not apply in Japanese, in spite of its surface head-final character, concluding that if Lin's assumptions are correct, then Japanese must be considered to be a true head-final language, contrary to the main tenet of Antisymmetry.

25|$|In 2006 a 2.2 Å {{resolution}} {{crystal structure}} of the full-length hammerhead ribozyme was obtained. This new structure (shown on the right) appears to resolve the most worrisome of the previous discrepancies. In particular, C17 is now positioned for in-line attack, and the invariant residues C3, G5, G8 and G12 all appear involved in vital interactions relevant to catalysis. Moreover, the A9 and scissile phosphates are observed to be 4.3 Å apart, <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that, when modified, these phosphates could bind a single thiophilic metal ion. The structure also reveals how two invariant residues, G-12 and G-8, are positioned within the active site consistent with their previously proposed role in acid/base catalysis. G12 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the 2’–O of C17, the nucleophile in the cleavage reaction, and the ribose of G8 hydrogen bonds to the leaving group 5’-O. (see below), while the nucleotide base of G8 forms a Watson-Crick pair with the invariant C3. This arrangement permits one to suggest that G12 is the general base in the cleavage reaction, and that G8 may function as the general acid, consistent with previous biochemical observations. G5 hydrogen bonds to the furanose oxygen of C17, helping to position it for in-line attack. U4 and U7, {{as a consequence of}} the base-pair formation between G8 and C3, are now positioned such that an NOE between their bases is easily explained.|$|E
500|$|The cyclol {{model was}} {{consistent}} with the general properties then attributed to folded proteins. [...] (1) Centrifugation studies had shown that folded proteins were significantly denser than water (~1.4 g/mL) and, thus, tightly packed; Wrinch assumed that dense packing should imply regular packing. [...] (2) Despite their large size, some proteins crystallize readily into symmetric crystals, <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of symmetric faces that match up upon association. [...] (3) Proteins bind metal ions; since metal-binding sites must have specific bond geometries (e.g., octahedral), it was plausible to assume that the entire protein also had similarly crystalline geometry. [...] (4) As described above, the cyclol model provided a simple chemical explanation of denaturation and the difficulty of cleaving folded proteins with proteases. (5) Proteins were assumed to be responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules, including other proteins. [...] Wrinch noted that a fixed, uniform structure would be useful for proteins in templating their own synthesis, analogous to the Watson-Francis Crick concept of DNA templating its own replication. [...] Given that many biological molecules such as sugars and sterols have a hexagonal structure, it was plausible to assume that their synthesizing proteins likewise had a hexagonal structure. [...] Wrinch summarized her model and the supporting molecular-weight experimental data in three review articles.|$|E

2500|$|All {{humans have}} a fundamental, evolutionarily-rooted {{need to feel}} {{socially}} connected to other people (i.e., to achieve [...] "belongingness" [...] or [...] "relatedness"). Simultaneously, people also hold a need for [...] "autonomy", or the desire to maintain a sense of independence and self-sufficiency. While these two psychological needs may initially appear to be contradictory (that is, it is not readily apparent how people may reconcile their need for social connection with their need for independence), psychological research shows that individuals who are more dependent on their intimate partners for support actually experience more autonomy, rather than less (a phenomenon that has been labelled the [...] "dependency paradox"). For example, Feeney (2007) showed that individuals whose romantic partners were more comfortable with having their partner depend on them {{were more likely to}} independently pursue and achieve their personal goals over a period of 6 months (without their partner's direct assistance). Such research is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the most effective type of support for promoting personal growth (e.g., accepting challenges, trying new things, exploring) is support that involves simply communicating availability, and that individuals who feel confident in the availability of a secure base to fall back on in case their goal pursuits go wrong are less likely to actually over-rely on their secure base.|$|E

Exiles like Rash Behari Bose had already voiced their demands to the Japanese authorities that support and pursuit of Indian Independence be an aim of the Japanese campaign, but neither the government nor the Imperial Japanese army were able to commit to these earlier. Militarily, India was important as the origin (from Assam) of the Ledo road which supplied Nationalist Chinese and American forces, {{as well as the}} supplies airlifted over the hump.

2500|$|Genetic {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the eastern wolf evolved in North America, unlike the gray wolf, which originated in Eurasia, and diverged from a common ancestor with the coyote and red wolf 150,000–300,000 years ago. However, in 2014, the research of Chambers et al. (2012) about the eastern wolf's status as a species became controversial, forcing the USF to commission a peer review of it, known as NCAES (2014). This peer review concluded unanimously that [...] "virtually all taxonomic conclusions from Chambers et al. are accepted uncritically." [...] Two subsequent reviews of updated research in 2013 and 2014, one commissioned to the Wildlife Management Institute by the USFWS, and one journal review, concluded that historically there were four unique canine species in North America, gray wolf, eastern wolf, coyote, and dog, and that [...] "the red wolf may be conspecific with the eastern wolf". This view <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the coyote and gray wolf did not historically range into the eastern United States. These reviews and a 2015 genetics study, the most comprehensive to date, led the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in May, 2015 to change the designation of the eastern wolf to a distinct species, Canis species cf lycaon (Canis species believed to be lycaon). However, the previous assertion that gray wolves did not occur in the eastern third of the United States is still ill-founded by the newer genetic study's lead author Dr. Linda Y. Rutledge who noted in the conclusions that [...] "the recognition of the eastern wolf as a separate species does not exclude the possibility that a grey wolf × eastern wolf hybrid animal (previously identified as Canis lupus lycaon, boreal/Ontario-type), similar to a Great Lakes boreal wolf currently located in the Great Lakes states and across Manitoba, northern Ontario, and northern Quebec, historically inhabited the northeastern United States alongside eastern wolves, and there is some evidence to support the historical presence of both Canis types." ...|$|E
