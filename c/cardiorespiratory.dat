5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and <b>cardiorespiratory</b> arrest.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and <b>cardiorespiratory</b> abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E

25|$|One {{publication}} {{has investigated}} 226 deaths attributed to GHB. Of 226 deaths included, 213 had a <b>cardiorespiratory</b> arrest and 13 had fatal accidents. Seventy-one deaths (34%) had no co-intoxicants. Postmortem blood GHB was 18–4400mg/L (median=347) in deaths negative for co-intoxicants.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{beneficial}} {{in reducing the}} symptom of shortness of breath due to both cancer and noncancer causes. In the setting of breathlessness at rest or on minimal exertion from conditions such as advanced cancer or end-stage <b>cardiorespiratory</b> diseases, regular, low-dose sustained-release morphine significantly reduces breathlessness safely, with its benefits maintained over time.|$|E
25|$|If {{a patient}} {{presents}} {{with a sudden}} onset of severe symptoms, other forms of abnormal heart rhythm with high heart rate must be ruled out, as some may be immediately life-threatening, such as ventricular tachycardia. While most patients will be placed on continuous <b>cardiorespiratory</b> monitoring, an ECG is essential for diagnosis. Provoking causes should be sought out.|$|E
25|$|Nickel {{carbonyl}} poisoning {{is characterized}} by a two-stage illness. The first consists of headaches and chest pain lasting a few hours, usually followed by a short remission. The second phase is a chemical pneumonitis which starts after typically 16 hours with symptoms of cough, breathlessness and extreme fatigue. These reach greatest severity after four days, possibly resulting in death from <b>cardiorespiratory</b> or renal failure. Convalescence is often extremely protracted, often complicated by exhaustion, depression and dyspnea on exertion. Permanent respiratory damage is unusual. The carcinogenicity of Ni(CO)4 is a matter of debate.|$|E
25|$|A stroke {{can also}} reduce people's general fitness. Reduced fitness can reduce {{capacity}} for rehabilitation {{as well as}} general health. Physical exercises {{as part of a}} rehabilitation program following a stroke appear safe. <b>Cardiorespiratory</b> fitness training that involves walking in rehabilitation can improve speed, tolerance and independence during walking, and may improve balance. There are inadequate long-term data about the effects of exercise and training on death, dependence and disability after a stroke. The future areas of research may concentrate on the optimal exercise prescription and long term health benefits of exercise. The effect of physical training on cognition also may be studied further.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia has classically been {{associated}} with disturbances to interoception with people hyper-focused on their bodies. People with anorexia concentrate on distorted perceptions of their body exterior in fear of weight gain, and they also report altered physical states within their bodies, such as indistinct feelings of fullness or {{are not able to}} distinguish emotional states from bodily sensations in general (also called alexithymia). Further, people with anorexia experience abnormally intense <b>cardiorespiratory</b> sensations, particularly of the breath, and this is most prevalent before they consume a meal. Abnormal senses of interoceptive awareness such as these have been observed so frequently in anorexia that they have become key characteristics of the illness.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, {{countries}} without mature EMSs {{began taking}} {{more interest in}} developing them. One reason for this interest was the overall improvement in healthcare in these countries. Another was the increasing urbanization taking place worldwide and the corresponding shift of focus from infectious diseases to trauma and <b>cardiorespiratory</b> diseases, which are better managed by emergency medicine than prevention. In addition to these developments, the aging population in many countries {{has led to an}} increased need for emergency medical services. Also, American popular culture, particularly television shows, and [...] "the demonstrated success of emergency medicine" [...] in countries with mature EMSs both led the public in many countries to expect better emergency medical care.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, {{after the}} Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was promulgated, the Nationalist Party {{began a series}} of revolutionary actions, {{including}} the Jayuya Uprising. As part of this initiative, Pedro Albizu Campos ordered her to organize attacks in the United States, focusing on locations that were [...] "the most strategic to the enemy". She [...] became the leader of a group of nationalists, who attacked the United States House of Representatives in 1954. She was incarcerated as a result. Lebrón remained imprisoned 25 years, when President Carter issued pardons to the group involved. After their release in 1979, the nationalists returned to Puerto Rico, where independence movements received them with a celebration. During the following years she continued her involvement in pro-independence activities, including the Navy-Vieques protests. Her life would be subsequently detailed in books and a documentary. On August 1, 2010, Lebrón died from complications of a <b>cardiorespiratory</b> infection.|$|E
2500|$|In mild cases, <b>cardiorespiratory</b> {{function}} is normal, although the heart can be displaced and/or rotated. [...] In severe cases, {{mitral valve prolapse}} may be present and physical capability may be limited due to base lung capacity being decreased.|$|E
2500|$|Exercise testing: [...] Coordinating {{exercise}} {{tests in}} order to measure body compositions, <b>cardiorespiratory</b> fitness, muscular strength/endurance, and flexibility. [...] Functional tests are also used {{in order to}} gain understanding on a more specific part of the body. [...] Once the information is gathered about a client, exercise physiologists must also be able to interpret the test data and decide what health-related outcomes have been discovered.|$|E
2500|$|Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} occurs {{exclusively in}} otherwise normal children and manifests mainly with infrequent autonomic epileptic seizures and autonomic status epilepticus. [...] Onset of seizures is from age 1 to 14 years with 76% starting between 3–6 years. Autonomic seizures consist of episodes of disturbed autonomic function with nausea, retching and vomiting as predominant symptoms. [...] Other autonomic manifestations include pallor (or, less often, flushing or cyanosis), mydriasis (or, less often, miosis), <b>cardiorespiratory</b> and thermoregulatory alterations, {{incontinence of urine}} and/or feces, hypersalivation, and modifications of intestinal motility. In approximately one fifth of the seizures the child becomes unresponsive and flaccid (syncope-like epileptic seizures or ictal syncope) before or often without convulsions. Syncope-like epileptic seizures (ictal syncope) with the child becoming [...] "completely unresponsive and flaccid like a rag doll" [...] occur in one fifth of the seizures. [...] More-conventional seizure symptoms often appear after the onset of autonomic manifestations. The child, who was initially fully conscious, becomes confused and unresponsive. Eyes turn to one side or gaze widely open. Only half of the seizures end with brief hemiconvulsions or generalized convulsions. Autonomic symptoms {{may be the only}} features of the seizures. None of the above symptoms alone is a prerequisite for diagnosis. [...] Recurrent seizures may not be stereotyped. The same child may have brief or prolonged seizures and autonomic manifestations may be severe or inconspicuous. [...] The full emetic triad (nausea, retching, vomiting) culminates in vomiting in 74% of the seizures; in others only nausea or retching occur, and in a few, none of the emetic symptoms are apparent.|$|E
