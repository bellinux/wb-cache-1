40|$|The city of Dubuque, Iowa, {{aimed for}} a twofer — lower energy costs for public {{facilities}} and reduced air emissions. To achieve that goal, the city partnered with the Iowa Economic Development Authority {{to establish a}} revolving loan fund to finance energy efficiency and other energy projects at city facilities. But the city needed to understand approaches for financing energy projects to achieve both of their goals {{in a manner that}} would not be considered debt — in this case, obligations booked as a liability on the city’s balance sheet. With funding from the U. S. Department of Energy’s <b>Climate</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Champions</b> Initiative, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) provided technical assistance to the city to identify strategies to achieve these goals. Revolving loans use a source of money to fund initial cost-saving projects, such as energy efficiency investments, then use the repayments and interest from these loans to support subsequent projects. Berkeley Lab and the city examined two approaches to explore whether revolving loans could potentially be treated as non-debt: 1) financing arrangements containing a non-appropriation clause and 2) shared savings agreements. This fact sheet discusses both, including considerations that may factor into their treatment as debt from an accounting perspective...|$|R

We hope this will help planners preparing <b>climate</b> <b>action</b> plans make informed, clear, and defensible choices, as well as optimize policy development and implementation in their communities. In addition, we hope that this research will contribute to refining future GHG emissions inventory protocols and <b>climate</b> <b>action</b> planning methods...|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} the first progress assessment of <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> launched at the 2014 UN Climate Summit in New York. It considers {{the distribution and}} performance of <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> along multiple dimensions {{that are relevant to}} both mitigation and adaptation. While it is too early for a conclusive assessment of the effectiveness of <b>climate</b> <b>actions,</b> this study makes a first and indispensable step toward such an assessment. Initial findings are encouraging. One year after their launch, most <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> have performed well in terms of producing outputs, putting them on track to implementing their commitments in the coming years. The research for this project is underpinned by the Global Aggregator for <b>Climate</b> <b>Actions</b> (GAFCA), a database developed between January and September 2015 by a research team at the German Development Institute/Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). GAFCA includes data on organizational characteristics, geography of implementation and output performance of <b>climate</b> <b>actions.</b> It creates the foundation for a long-term systematic examination of <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> that can inform more effective efforts to strengthen such actions. Our analysis is focused on three broad questions: Have organizers of the 2014 UN Climate Summit engaged a wide range of non-state and sub-national actions that set targets relevant to both mitigation and adaptation? Do <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> align with the interests of both developing and developed countries, and do they achieve an appropriate balance in implementation in the global North and South? Have <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> started to deliver on their commitments one year since they were launched at the 2014 UN Climate Summit? (Output performance...|$|R
