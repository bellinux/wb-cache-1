5|$|Ealdred was {{probably}} {{born in the}} west of England, and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Lyfing, his predecessor as bishop of Worcester. His family, from Devonshire, may have been well-to-do. Another relative was Wilstan or Wulfstan, who under Ealdred's influence became Abbot of Gloucester. Ealdred was a monk in the cathedral chapter at Winchester Cathedral before becoming abbot of Tavistock Abbey about 1027, an office he held until about 1043. Even after leaving the abbacy of Tavistock, he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death. No contemporary documents relating to Ealdred's time as abbot have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Other {{articles}} {{dealt with}} punishing specific persons, foremost among these, Piers Gaveston. Article 20 describes at length the offenses committed by Gaveston; {{he was once}} more condemned to exile and was to abjure the realm by 1 November. The bankers of the Italian Frescobaldi company were arrested, and their goods seized. It was held that the king’s great financial dependence on the Italians was politically unfortunate. The last individuals to be singled out for punishment were Henry de Beaumont and his sister, Isabella de Vescy, two foreigners associated with the king’s household. Though {{it is difficult to}} say why these two received particular mention, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the central position of their possessions in the Scottish war.|$|E
5|$|The white-cheeked nuthatch, with S. przewalskii subsumed within it, {{has been}} {{regarded}} as {{closely related to the}} North American white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), which has a similar contact call (though S. carolinensisss is moderately higher in pitch), and they have sometimes been treated as conspecific. In turn, it has been proposed that the triumvirate of S. przewalskii, S. leucopsis and S. carolinensis <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Sitta canadensis, monophyletic group, corresponding to the subgenus Micrositta, which includes six species of average-sized nuthatches. The relationships remain very unclear. A molecular study by Eric Pasquet conducted in 2014 may provide some clarity.|$|E

5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing {{of the human genome}} in 2003, as he started to realise how it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the Dawn was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E

25|$|Like other interpretations before it, Kircher's 'translations' were {{hampered}} by the fundamental assumption that hieroglyphs recorded ideas and not {{the sounds of the}} language. As no bilingual texts were available, any such symbolic 'translation' could be proposed without the possibility of verification. Kircher further developed the assumption that the last stage of Egyptian <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the earlier Egyptian stages.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in understanding sexual harassment, is that it involves a range of behaviors. In most cases (although not in all cases) {{it is difficult for}} the victim to describe what they experienced. This can be related to difficulty classifying the situation or <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> stress and humiliation experienced by the recipient. Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.|$|E
25|$|When an Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) {{encounters}} a large egg, {{it takes a}} stone into its beak and forcefully throws it at the egg until the shell is broken, usually taking a few minutes. This behaviour, first reported in 1966, seems to be largely innate and is displayed by naïve individuals. Its origin <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the throwing of eggs; rounded (egg-like) stones are preferred to jagged ones.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} of scholars {{have proposed that}} the Elamite language <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Munda Language of India, some to Mon–Khmer of Cambodia and some to the modern Dravidian languages of India and Sri Lanka such as Tamil and Malayalam, {{in contrast to the}} majority who denote it as a language isolate.

25|$|From the {{observed}} X-ray spectrum, combined with spectral emission results for other wavelength ranges, an astronomical model addressing the likely source of X-ray emission can be constructed. For example, with Scorpius X-1 the X-ray spectrum steeply drops off as X-ray energy increases up to 20 keV, {{which is likely}} for a thermal-plasma mechanism. In addition, there is no radio emission, and the visible continuum is roughly what would be expected from a hot plasma fitting {{the observed}} X-ray flux. The plasma could be a coronal cloud of a central object or a transient plasma, where the energy source is unknown, but <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> {{the idea of a}} close binary.|$|E
25|$|Whether BBB {{dysfunction}} is {{the cause}} or the consequence of MS is disputed, because activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. Apart from that, activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. (Adhesion molecules could {{also play a role}} in inflammation) In particular, one of these adhesion proteins involved is ALCAM (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule, also called CD166), and is under study as therapeutic target. Another protein involved is CXCL12, which is found also in brain biopsies of inflammatory elements, and which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the behavior of CXCL13 under methylprednisolone therapy. Some molecular biochemical models for relapses have been proposed.|$|E
25|$|Spriggina fossils {{represent}} {{the first known}} organisms with a bilaterally symmetric body plan. They had a head, tail and almost identical halves. They probably had sensory organs {{in the head and}} digestive organs in the tail which would have allowed them to find food more efficiently. They were capable of locomotion, which gave them an advantage over other organisms from that era that were either tethered {{to the bottom of the}} ocean floor or moved very slowly. Spriggina was soft bodied, which leave the fossils as faint imprints. It is most likely related to annelids, however there is some speculation that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> arthropods since it somewhat resembles trilobite fossils.|$|E
50|$|The Considii were an old family, first {{appearing}} {{early in}} the fifth century B.C. However, they quickly faded into obscurity, from which they did not emerge for nearly four centuries.

25|$|Mohini was {{checked for}} Chédiak-Higashi {{syndrome}} in 1960, {{but the results}} were inconclusive. This condition is similar to albino mutations and causes bluish lightening of the fur color, crossed eyes, and prolonged bleeding after surgery. Also, {{in the event of}} an injury, the blood is slow to coagulate. This condition has been observed in domestic cats, but there has never been a case of a white tiger having Chédiak-Higashi syndrome. There has been a single case of a white tiger having central retinal degeneration, reported from the Milwaukee County Zoo, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> reduced pigmentation in the eye. The white tiger in question was a male named Mota on loan from the Cincinnati Zoo.|$|E
25|$|This great {{emphasis}} on the performativity of tomb figurines <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the competitive Tang culture of publicly displaying one’s wealth and power. The social classes of Tang society were mobile. This means {{that people in the}} different social classes could improve its status through hard work and move to an upper class. This created a competitive society, where people often showed off their wealth and power. Members of prominent families or high-ranking officials often paraded through streets in the public, with troops of servants mounted on beautiful horses. This culture of public display takes place even during funerals. After the funerary ceremonies at home are complete, there would be a funeral procession to transport the deceased from home to gravesite.|$|E
25|$|An {{assortment}} of neurological {{effects can be}} observed in 75-90% of individuals of any age with clinically observable B12 deficiency. Cobalamin deficiency manifestations are apparent in the abnormalities of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, optic nerves, and cerebrum. These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of myelin, and may be expressed behaviourally through reports of sensory disturbances in the extremities, or motor disturbances, such as gait ataxia. Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases. Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss, disorientation, and dementia. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes. Mental symptoms are extremely variable, and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, and memory defect. Memory defect encompasses symptoms of confusion, severe agitation and depression, delusions and paranoid behaviour, visual and auditory hallucinations, urinary and fecal incontinence in the absence of overt spinal lesions, dysphasia, violent maniacal behaviour, and epilepsy. It has been suggested that mental symptoms <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> a decrease in cerebral metabolism, as caused by the state of deficiency. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes.|$|E
