40|$|The filled {{polyurethane}} polishers are recently {{used in the}} Chemical Mechanical Polishing process (CMP). Polyurethane polishing pads {{with specific}} physicochemical characteristics have shown a great ability to produce very high surface quality. The product quality is {{closely linked to the}} polisher quality during its use. Several causes can contribute to the filled polishing pads wear. This study aims to characterize the mechanical behavior of the filled polyurethane polishing pads and its influence on the quality and efficiency of the polishing process. Several mechanical tests were conducted on polyurethane polishers LP 66 and LP 57 that have been recovered during the polishing operations. The pads behavior during the compression and creep tests was characterized. The polished surfaces quality and the process efficiency were also evaluated. The obtained results have shown the existence of the <b>creep</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of polyurethane polishers. The polyurethane polishing pads creep is influenced by several parameters as polishing time, polishing load and loading time. However, a variation of the compression module was observed according to the polishers filling by the abrasive grains used in the polishing operation. Polisher type LP 66 has more resistance to deformation before polishing and they become more sensitive after their use in polishing.

40|$|Chondrosia reniformis is {{a common}} marine demosponge that shows {{striking}} tissue plasticity and unusual body deformability. This sponge can develop long and slender outgrowths extending from the parental body. According to some authors, this phenomenon, called “creeping”, {{can be related to}} asexual reproduction, atypical mechanisms of «localized» locomotion or passive response to environmental stress. Here we address this phenomenon by means of an interdisciplinary approach consisting of field survey, experimental field studies and experimental laboratory studies. During field survey and field experimental survey we observed that the instability of substratum is an important factor that trigs the beginning of creeping. The sponge size {{does not seem to be}} directly involved in the occurrence of the phenomenon. Specimens of Bergeggi (Ligurian Sea, northern Italy) show a high correlation between the <b>creeping</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and the sea temperature; this seems to support the hypothesis that the phenomenon is related to asexual reproduction, which is in its turn seasonally regulated by environmental temperature. In addition, experimental laboratory studies performed in different mechanical conditions on isolated samples of both ectosome and choanosome showed that temperature affects mesohyl mechanical properties: the lower is the temperature the stiffer is the mesohyl. The different physiological states recorded by the laboratory experiments are expressions of the mechanical adaptability of the collagenous mesohyl of C. reniformis and suggest that stiffness variability is under cellular control. On the basis of present results we can infer that C. reniformis can exert some control on the <b>creeping</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and that the primary factors implied in inducing <b>creeping</b> <b>phenomena</b> are the instability of substratum and the temperature. Interestingly the capability to modulate the mechanical properties of the collagenous matrix is an uncommon feature that C. reniformis shares with the mutable collagenous tissue (MCT) of Echinoderms. This close analogy, which is supported by morphological and physiological evidence, is an intriguing point that opens a wide range of evolutionary and functional questions...|$|R

Their axes are commonly parallel {{to each other}} and to the strike of the slope. The down-slope limbs usually dip more steeply and are frequently faulted. The amplitude is as great as 18 feet, although the average is about 6 feet. Many of the folds are separated from the underlying and uniformly dipping shale by a decollement. Although the folding mechanism is now essentially inactive, owing to increased aridity, this <b>creep</b> <b>phenomenon</b> should not be ignored in slope-stability analyses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To achieve {{reliable}} solutions, today’s numerical {{and experimental}} activities need developing more accurate methods and utilizing expensive facilities, respectfully in microchannels. The analytical study {{can be considered}} as an alternative approach to alleviate the preceding difficulties. Among the analytical solutions, those with high robustness and low complexities are certainly more attractive. The perturbation theory has been used by many researchers to analyze microflows. In present work, a compressible microflow with constant heat flux boundary condition is analyzed. The flow is assumed to be fully developed and steady. The Mach and Reynolds numbers are also assumed to be very small. For this case, the <b>creeping</b> <b>phenomenon</b> may have some effect on the velocity profile. To achieve robustness solution it is assumed that the flow is quasi-isothermal. In this study, the creeping term which appears in the slip boundary condition is formulated by different mathematical formulas. The difference between this work and the previous ones is that the creeping term is taken into account and presented in non-dimensionalized form. The results obtained from perturbation theory are presented based on four non-dimensionalized parameters including the Reynolds, Mach, Prandtl and Brinkman numbers. The axial velocity, normal velocity and pressure profiles are obtained. Solutions for velocities and pressure for two cases with different Br numbers are compared with each other and the results show that the effect of <b>creeping</b> <b>phenomenon</b> on the velocity profile becomes more important when Br number is less than O(ǫ) ...|$|R

40|$|Creep {{mechanisms}} in uniaxially compressed 3 D granular solids comprised of faceted frictionless grains are studied numerically using a constant pressure and constant stress simulation method. Rapid uniaxial compression followed by slow dilation is predicted {{on the basis}} of a logarithmic <b>creep</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Micromechanical analysis indicates the existence of a correlation between granular creep and grain-scale deformations. Localized regions of large strain appear during creep and grow in magnitude and size with time. Furthermore, the accumulation of non-affine granular displacements increases linearly with local strain, thereby providing insights into the origins of plastic dissipation during stress-driven creep evolution.
