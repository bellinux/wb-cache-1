25|$|There {{has been}} {{evidence}} that the sockeye salmon are affected by thermal conditions and their responses to temperature are relatively strong and tend to vary from region to region. Canada has also used the Species at Risk Act to {{recognize the importance of}} biological diversity when it come to the conservation of the salmon population. This means that multiple species of salmon would be looked at when it comes to conservation as well as multiple areas that each species live in. COSEWIC, a Canadian organization for the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>species,</b> has named the Interior Fraser River Coho, the Cultus Lake Sockeye, and the Sakinaw Lake Sockeye to all be endangered. In British Columbia sockeye salmon in four different watersheds were certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, or MSC, as sustainable fisheries in July 2010 and the certification is good for a period of five years. In 2011 MSC also certified the Pink Salmon Fishery and as of 2012 The Chum Salmon Fisheries started their review under the MSC to become certified as a sustainable fishery.|$|E
25|$|The Division of Ecological and Water Resources {{studies the}} {{ecosystems}} within Minnesota. They analyze {{the information in}} order to understand how the ecosystems function, how they benefit the citizens of Minnesota, how they are impacted by human use, and what long-term effects will take place on the health of the ecosystems. The division is involved in locating and protecting endangered and threatened species, as well as the habitats that are vital to the conservation of those species. Another part of the division's responsibilities is in managing threats against the ecosystem. These threats include: harmful invasive species, fish and wildlife diseases, and the negative impact human development can have on the environment. One of the largest programs that the Division of Ecological Resources is in charge of is Minnesota’s Nongame Wildlife Program, which focuses on the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> that are not hunted. This would include trumpeter swans, bald eagles and Minnesota’s state bird, the common loon. The division is also accountable for all lakes, rivers and streams, wetlands, and ground waters within the state. The division enforces permits implemented to protect and preserve Minnesota's water resources. The program works on observing the effects of climate on the water resources and analyzes the data {{in order to understand}} and address the impact the climate has on the Minnesota's wildlife and its citizens.|$|E

Section 9(a)(1) of the ESA sets out the general prohibition on taking listed species.

40|$|There is {{contentious}} debate {{surrounding the}} merits of de-extinction as a biodiversity conservation tool. Here, we use extant analogues to predict conservation actions for potential de-extinction candidate species from New Zealand and the Australian state of New South Wales, and use a prioritization protocol to predict the impacts of reintroducing and maintaining populations <b>of</b> these <b>species</b> on <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> extant threatened <b>species.</b> Ewen using the optimistic assumptions that resurrection <b>of</b> <b>species</b> is externally sponsored, and that actions for resurrected species can share costs with extant analogue species, public funding for <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> resurrected <b>species</b> would lead to fewer extant species that could be conserved, suggesting net biodiversity loss. If full costs of establishment and maintenance for resurrected species populations were publicly funded, there could be substantial sacrifices in extant <b>species</b> <b>conservation.</b> If <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> resurrected <b>species</b> populations could be fully externally sponsored, there could be benefits to extant threatened species. However, such benefits would be outweighed by opportunity costs, assuming such discretionary money could directly fund <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> extant <b>species.</b> Potential sacrifices in <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> extant <b>species</b> should be a crucial consideration in deciding whether to invest in de-extinction or focus our efforts on extant species...|$|R
