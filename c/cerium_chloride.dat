This method employed a more sophisticated approach, starting out with the pinitol 30 that its stereocenters {{are exactly the same}} as the ones in the C-ring of Pancratistatin. Protection of the diol functions of compound 30 gave compound 31. The free hydroxyl of this was subsequently substituted by an azide to give 32.

40|$|The use of <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> (CeCl 3) {{to remove}} {{fluoride}} and phosphate from waters is {{addressed in this}} study. High concentrations of fluoride exist in groundwater especially in developing countries. Consumption drinking water containing high levels of fluoride can lead to serious cases of dental and skeletal fluorosis. Current defluoridation technologies are limited, especially for high levels of fluoride, and are expensive. Industrial wastewaters contribute to the highest fluoride contamination in the world. With the increasing production of electronic materials, the global fluoride concentration and fluoride-contaminated waters have grown tremendously. Excessive discharge of phosphate into the environment promotes eutrophication of lakes and rivers. The major sources of phosphate pollution are agricultural and urban runoff and domestic wastewater discharges. <b>Cerium</b> <b>chloride,</b> a newly available coagulant is expected to remove both fluoride and phosphate from waters A commercially available <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> e (i. e.

We also conducted mass spectrometric experiments in which the concentration-dependence (1 - 20 mM; pH 5. 2 - 6. 9) of the cerium cluster distribution was probed. Results from these concentration-dependent experiments demonstrate that <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> clustering increases with CeCl 3 concentration, in other words, at higher CeCl 3 concentrations (lower pH) more <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> is present as polynuclear chlorocerate.

Last but not least, the observed correlation between ion mass spectra and solution content appears to demonstrate that dinuclear clusters are intermediates on the way from the [CeCl 2]+ complex to the formation of larger “bulk-like” chlorocerate clusters.

Parameters such as the nature of the homogeneous catalyst, support effects and operating conditionswere systematically varied to evaluate the potential of this dual {{catalytic system}}. Sharp analysis of reactionpathways led us to identify an optimal combination of <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> and a barium zirconate-based platinumcatalyst for the production of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol exhibiting substantial selectivities(> 40 %). The recyclability and the possible deactivation mechanisms of the catalytic system were ultimatelyinvestigated...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{chlorinated}} CeO 2 is {{an efficient}} material for HCl oxidation, {{which raises the}} question whether an oxychloride phase could be also active in the same reaction. CeOCl was synthesized by solid state reaction of cerium oxide with anhydrous <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> and tested in HCl oxidation using various feed compositions at 703 K. X-ray diffraction of post-reaction samples revealed that CeOCl is unstable, in both oxygen-rich and -lean conditions. Applying oxygen over-stoichiometric feeds led to complete transformation of CeOCl into CeO 2. Considerable HCl conversions were obtained only after this transformation, which confirms the essential role of bulk cerium oxide in this catalytic system...|$|E
40|$|Electroless ternary NiCeP {{deposits}} {{were prepared}} from alkaline citrate bath containing nickel sulphate, <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> and sodium hypophosphite. Concentration of rare earth cerium was varied from 1 to 2 g/L to obtain ternary deposits containing variable Ce and P contents. The influence of cerium on the deposit properties was analysed. The deposit exhibited a maximum cerium content of 6. 2 ± 0. 1 wt. % when the <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration was 2 g/L. The {{result of the}} Pd stability test showed that {{the stability of the}} bath was reduced due to Ce salt addition. The microhardness measurements made on both as-plated and heat treated samples exhibited a peak hardness of 1006 ± 11 VHN for cerium concentration of 1. 5 g/L. The concept of kinetic strength analysis was proved to be applicable only for binary and not for ternary alloys due to multistep deposition mechanism with different kinetic energies. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-plated and heat treated samples revealed peaks corresponding to Ni (1 1 1) and nickel phosphide (Ni 3 P). Higher amount of Ce incorporation in NiP matrix increased the crystallisation temperature of the deposit which could be due to the suppression of nickel crystallisation prior to Ni 3 P compound formation and thus increasing the activation energy for the formation of stable phases. Surface compositional analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) carried out on as-plated NiCeP- 2 deposit showed a prominent peak of P existing in + 1 oxidation state as higher alkalinity favoured hypophosphite deposition in the ternary alloy coating. It was observed that the co-deposition of Ce in NiP matrix improved the continuous salt spray exposure for 168 h...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{cultures}} of medicinal plants - X Aim {{of this study}} was to study the effect of abiotic elicitation on production of rutin in callus and suspension culture of Fagopyrum esculentum Moench. <b>Cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> (CeCl 3) was used as elicitor at three different levels of concentration. The content of rutin in cell cultures was determined by HPLC. Cell cultures were cultivated on Murashige - Skoog medium with the addition of 10 mg/ml of 2, 4 -D as a growth regulator. No rutin was produced in both types of culture without the presence of elicitor. The maximal content of rutin in callus culture was determined after 6 hours of treatment with elicitor solution with concentration c 1 (4, 057. 10 - 3 mol/l.). No production of rutin was observed in suspension culture...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{films of}} titania–ceria have been {{prepared}} via sol–gel processing by employing titanium and <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> compounds in highly acidic conditions for the precursor sol. This sol–gel route allows obtaining titania–ceria and cerium titanate films, CeTi 2 O 6, after thermal treatment in air. The films exhibit a high optical transparency which is modulated by controlling the composition and the thermal treatment. The materials have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV–visible spectroscopy, ellipsometric spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The titania–ceria films show, {{as a function of}} the composition, the formation of different phases after thermal treatment in air at 800 °C. In particular, with the composition Ce 25 –Ti 75 we have obtained a pure cerium titanate phase, CeTi 2 O 6, which can be formed only in a very strict range of compositions...|$|E

The polymerization process {{was carried out in}} both nonaqueous (Acetonitrile containing 0. 1 mole L- 1 LiClO 4 as supporting electrolyte) or aqueous (6. 0 mol L- 1 H 2 SO 4) media. The electropolymerization process is fast and economic. The prepared films are stable and have been used as sensors for the electroanalytical determination of p-aminophenol, ascorbic acid, dopamine, hydroquinone, catechol, pyrogallol, <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> and epinephrine. The determination is based on the cyclovoltammogramic method. The cyclic voltammetry was always carried out under the same conditions, where a scan rate of 100 mV s- 1 in the specified potential range for each electrolyte at room temperature were used.

Hence a stab {{has been made}} on the electrochemical synthesis of CeB 6 using molten salt technique. The electrolyte consisted of lithium fluoride (LiF), boron trioxide (B 2 O 3) and <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> (CeCl 3). Electrochemical experiments were carried out in an inconal reactor in an argon atmosphere. Electrolysis was executed in a high-density graphite crucible, which doles out as the electrolyte clutching vessel {{as well as the}} anode. The cathode was made up of a molybdenum rod. The electrolysis was carried out at 900 1 C at different current densities intended for the synthesis of CeB 6 crystals. After the electrolysis, the cathode product was removed and cleaned using dilute HCl solution. The crystals were scrutinized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to make out the phase and the purity. It has been observed that CeB 6 crystals are synthesized at all current densities and the product has traces of impurities...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrochemically}} integrated multi-electrode array {{namely the}} wire beam electrode (WBE) {{has been used}} to characterize the behavior of <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> (CeCl 3) and lanthanum chloride (LaCl 3) in inhibiting localized corrosion of AA 2024 -T 3 and AA 1100. CeCl 3 has been found to inhibit AA 2024 -T 3 corrosion in 0. 005 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution by suppressing galvanic corrosion activities and by creating a large number of insignificant anodes. It has also been shown to inhibit localized corrosion of AA 1100 in 0. 5 M NaCl solution by promoting the random distribution of minor anodes. LaCl 3 has been found to inhibit localized corrosion of AA 2024 -T 3 at 1000 ppm, although its efficiency dropped significantly when its concentration decreased to 500 ppm. The addition of CeCl 3 and LaCl 3 to corrosion testing cells at later stages was unable to effectively suppress existing corrosion anodes...|$|E
40|$|Different {{surfactants}} such as {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS), {{polyethylene glycol}} (PEG), and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB,) assisted cerium oxide (CeO 2) nanoparticles were synthesized by using <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride</b> and potassium hydroxide as the starting materials via facile hydrothermal route. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that cubic fluorite-type structure of pure CeO 2 and the average crystallite sizes were calculated to be ~ 12 – 16 [*]nm. Raman spectra of various surfactants assisted CeO 2 consist of a single triply degenerated F 2 g mode characteristic of the fluorite structure. The elongated spherical-like morphology of SDS assisted CeO 2 samples was observed from the SEM and TEM studies. Optical absorption spectra showed a blue shift by the capped CeO 2 due to the quantum confinement effect.

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the impact of iron doping on the structural, chemical, and magnetic properties of ceria (Ce 1 -xFexO 2). Samples were produced in triplicate through a coprecipitation approach in a forced hydrolysis synthesis that yielded consistently sized nanocrystals using three different cerium precursors: <b>cerium</b> <b>chloride,</b> cerium ammonium nitrate, and cerium nitrate. Particles were characterized by x ray diffraction (XRD), x ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). XPS and EPR data shows iron {{to be in the}} Fe 3 + state and confirms the nominal dopant concentration. The moment per Fe ion found was largest at the lowest dopant concentrations, and quickly decreased as the concentration was increased. We used XPS to estimate the Ce 3 +/Ce 4 + ratio and observed a linear relation between the saturation magnetization and the Ce 3 +/Ce 4 + ratio...|$|E
