50|$|In mid-1962, the Kennedy {{administration}} tasked Roosevelt {{with making}} preparations {{for a military}} coup against Iraqi Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim, whose expropriation of the concessionary holdings of the British- and American-owned Iraq Petroleum Company and threats to invade Kuwait were considered a threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf. While the CIA had <b>cultivated</b> <b>assets</b> within the Iraqi Ba'ath Party, a former CIA colleague of Roosevelt's has denied any CIA role in the February 1963 Ba'athist coup that saw Qasim assassinated, stating instead that the CIA's efforts against Qasim {{were still in the}} planning stages at the time.|$|E
40|$|PublisherTokyoThe {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to describe {{the problems with the}} current estimates for WiP inventories of <b>cultivated</b> <b>assets</b> in Japan's system of national accounts and to propose an alternative method of dealing with these assets. There is a huge di erence between inventory stock measurement that are compiled according to the 1968 SNA versus the 1993 SNA for Japan's national accounts. This leads to non-negligible di erences for productivity measures when inventories are treated as a capital input. We argue that the 1993 SNA recommendations have been inappropriately introduced in the current production and wealth accounts for Japan and that the current 1993 -SNA version estimates for WiP inventory stocks of <b>cultivated</b> <b>assets</b> (CAWiP) are implausible. As an alternative to the "perpetual inventory method" used for the current estimates for CAWiP, we propose a "realized inventory method" (RIM), where inventory stocks over the past periods are backwardly estimated based on the realized values of <b>cultivated</b> <b>assets</b> to be sold. RIM can provide alternative estimates that we argue are more realistic and can also help with distinguishing CAWiP and non-cultivated biological resources, with the latter being as a non-produced asset, of which the natural growth should not be described in production account...|$|E
50|$|The credit {{extended}} is small, varying between US$15 and US$25, and lent for {{a period}} of six months. The women exhibit excellent managerial abilities and are very punctual and regular in repaying their loans. One woman, for example, the wife of a poor labourer and mother of eight, received a loan for Tk300 (about US$l25) to buy a calf. She repaid her loan punctually and took out a second loan which enabled her to buy another. These calves are now milk cows, providing enough milk for her children and a surplus to sell in the market. The cows are also used by her husband to plow a small plot of land which he could not otherwise have <b>cultivated.</b> Her <b>assets</b> have increased tenfold.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} how to provide affordances for youth development in the context of environmental stewardship in cities. Urban environmental education encompasses place-based and action-oriented stewardship practices, including community gardening and vegetable production, often with the dual goals of developing youth and community assets. Yet in-depth understanding of how these goals are achieved is lacking. Using narrative inquiry, we explored participant experiences in a multi-year agriculture internship program conducted by the food justice organization East New York Farms! (ENYF) in Brooklyn, NY. Emerging from our conversations with youth were five themes defining their intern experience: ENYF as somewhere to belong, to be pushed, to grapple with complexity, to practice leadership, and to become yourself. We propose a theory of change that emphasizes politicized notions of caring as a foundation for <b>cultivating</b> developmental <b>assets,</b> including competence, contribution, and critical consciousness, among youth who participate in ENYF programs multiple years. This paper extends the literature on socio-environmental affordances to encompass urban environmental education programs, which incorporate physical and social features that act as affordances. Further, this paper describes a feedback loop in which youth afforded opportunities to develop assets through contributing to their community in turn create affordances for additional youth and adults...|$|R
40|$|The {{tertiary}} education sector in Qatar has grown very rapidly, viewed as key to national {{development on the}} path to the “knowledge society,” also to reduce its reliance on limited natural resources. The states of the Islamic world, with a significant but long-obscured past of scientific achievement, are witnessing a contemporary renaissance. The establishment of international offshore, satellite or branch campuses in the Persian or Arabian Gulf region emphasizes the dynamism of higher education development. With a history of several decades, Qatar’s higher education and science policies join contrasting strategies prevalent in capacity building attempts worldwide – to emulate the strongest global exemplars through importation as well as to <b>cultivate</b> local, indigenous <b>assets.</b> Thus, university-related and science policymaking on the peninsula has been designed to directly connect with global developments while building local capacity in higher education and scientific productivit...|$|R
40|$|Adolescent {{girls are}} on the move. Throughout the {{developing}} world, natural disasters, political emergencies, child marriage, and violence force a migration journey many girls do not choose. But for most girls, migration is a choice made in a quest for social and economic advancement. Migration offers adolescent girls the possibility and promise of opportunity. Absent from their parents {{and the limits of}} their natal homes, migrant girls can seize new opportunities and fully enjoy their human rights as they enter adulthood. The ability to navigate a number of critical milestones throughout her journey shapes a migrant girl's success or failure. An unsuccessful transition can have significant consequences. It is those consequences that are portrayed in popular culture: the trafficked Eastern European girl who is sexually exploited; the young Chinese woman hunched over a sewing machine in filthy surroundings; the frightened domestic worker in Central America. These disadvantages are real and deserve attention, but they do not tell the whole story. This report brings a fresh image of girls' migration: the uniformed secondary school student in a boarding school in Zimbabwe; the apprentice acquiring tailoring skills in Ghana; and the factory worker in Bangladesh abandoning her traditional role to negotiate higher wages with an employer. Should a migrant girl successfully navigate her journey, the ability to unlock her potential expands enormously. When she thrives in her new home, a successful migrant girl can be a powerful agent of social and economic change, transforming the prospects of her family and community. She has a unique potential, known as the girl effect, to end poverty for herself and for others. With a primary focus on internal migration, "Girls on the Move" presents evidence not only about how and why a girl moves, but ultimately about what factors enable girls to take advantage of new opportunities in employment, education, and health. Building from the evidence, the report recommends policies and programs for migrant adolescent girls that take account of their diversity, ensure protection, and <b>cultivate</b> connections, <b>assets,</b> and capital [...] the main ingredients for migrant girls' success...|$|R
40|$|Since the women’s liberation {{movement}} in the 1970 s, {{the number of women}} in the American workforce has increased dramatically; however, the percentage of women in the C-Suite—those who reach the status of chief officer—remains below 10 percent nationally (Soares et al., 2013). This disparity, sometimes called the “glass ceiling,” remains, even though many companies have adopted important initiatives to promote women’s advancement. Although research has identified a complex set of factors involved in women’s achievement of the highest levels of success in contemporary corporate settings, including measurable achievements, such as education, experience, and technical proficiency and intangibles, such as emotional intelligence, leadership styles, and communication skill, a significance difference in women’s ability to break through the glass ceiling has still not been made. ^ Aimed at bridging that gap, this qualitative study gathers, through personal interviews, the experiences and perspectives of seventeen individuals, both men and women, of different races, cultures, and backgrounds, all of whom have reached the level of chief officer. Respondents were queried about their perception of the factors necessary to reach the C-Suite, as well as any factors required especially for women to arrive at that destination. The data gathered in the interviews included the subjects’ experiences from the process of their own advancement to the C-Suite and their observations of others’ experiences. The data were coded and analyzed according to recurring themes and patterns in the interviewees’ answers. The results point to a complex, nuanced, dynamic set of factors in the life of an otherwise qualified individual. Namely, four (4) such factors play a primary role in propelling aspiring women into the C-Suite: 1) executive traits; 2) preparation; 3) networking; and 4) engaging organizational culture. The findings offer an empowering promise that women can not only identify and gain the tools they need to accomplish their C-Suite goals, but also actively pursue and <b>cultivate</b> these <b>assets</b> in a way that offers success in both life and career. ...|$|R
40|$|This study uses {{household}} level panel {{data from}} Malawi {{to measure the}} contemporaneous and dynamic impacts of fertilizer subsidies on different indicators of household well‐being. Well‐being is measured in this paper using indicators contained in available survey data, such as area <b>cultivated,</b> maize production, <b>asset</b> wealth, respondent‐stated adequacy of food consumption and respondent-stated life satisfaction. The study uses fixed effects and instrumental variable methods to control for endogeneity caused by the non‐random distribution of targeted fertilizer subsidies. Results indicate that the quantity of subsidized fertilizer acquired by a household has a positive contemporaneous effect on area planted, area planted to maize and maize production at the household level. The subsidy also has a significant dynamic effect on the quantity of maize that households produce. Subsidized fertilizer has no significant contemporaneous or dynamic effect on household asset accumulation. Receiving more subsidized fertilizer does not make households feel that their food consumption has been adequate over the past year, but receiving more subsidized fertilizer makes household heads {{say that they are}} more satisfied with their lives. Subsidized fertilizer appears to be going to people with more land. In addition, people in villages where members of parliament reside also receive greater quantities of subsidized fertilizer. These findings raise questions about how subsidy recipients are targeted. Improving targeting could increase the positive impacts of fertilizer subsidies on household well‐being.

40|$|A hi-tech company often {{focuses on}} being {{innovative}} by providing product offerings as product leader, fast follower or with operational excellence. In the international calling sector the technological solutions are numerous. The providers are, for instance, normal telecom providers, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Mobile virtual network operators (MVNO). This {{means that a}} company faces not only the competitors that offer the same solution but also from outside the company’s business sector. The company thus needs to tackle many challenges, such as fast-paced product development, market expansion, competitor volatility, {{at the same time}} as the company <b>cultivates</b> its brand <b>assets.</b> This study focuses on the branding strategy within the VoIP telecom sector. It aims to set a guideline for how companies, in particular in the VoIP telecom sectors, cultivate and enhance their brand identity in order to differentiate themselves from competitors as well as achieve a successful and sustainable level of brand equity. The thesis also studies the brand strategies that have already manifested themselves within the providers of international calling services, in particular VoIP providers and a couple of MVNO providers. By conducting the brand identity and brand equity analysis, customer analysis and competitors’ analysis, a company can make a decision on brand strategy that will further associate, differentiate, energize and support its brands. The research framework consists of both the corporate and consumer perspectives. It consists of brand theory, market research, competitor analysis and the company’s brand identity, as well as brand awareness analysis. The thesis presents the Swedish VoIP consumers’ behavior and trends, the guideline and case study on how a company bridges the gap between brand identity and brand equity as well as the guideline and case study of brand portfolio strategies that have been explored within the VoIP telecom sectors, i. e.

40|$|This {{has always}} been the dream of {{development}} thinkers, academicians, researchers and policy makers to contribute in materializing the goal of sustainable development with maximum possible equity. A series of development programs have been launched in different regions of the country to materialize this dream. Now it has become a challenging question whether such initiatives are really contributing in the welfare of masses and if so, what sort of policy messages can be taken from such success stories? In this connection, the fundamental objective {{of this study was to}} empirically investigate the impact of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Community Development Program (AJKCDP) in multidimensional perspectives. This program was established to directly address the key issues for rural poverty reduction through empowering the community organization to assume the responsibility and ownership for decentralized planning and implementation of development activities. Both secondary and primary data was collected for analysis, for the objectives and thus for extracting meaningful results. The entire AJK was the universe of the study and a sample of 560 respondents was snapped by employing multistage stratified purposive random sampling technique. Four districts were selected from where both male and female respondents who were registered (70 percent) and non-registered (30 percent) were surveyed from selected villages in each of the districts. Data was gathered from the field through personal interviews by using a properly constructed interview schedule. Empirical analysis was operated by using different analytical techniques. There has been substantial difference in the trend of education profile of registered and nonregistered members from the base year (2003 - 04) to current year (2013 - 14). FGT measure of poverty was applied for estimating incidence, depth and severity of poverty in absolute and relative framework. There has been decrease in incidence poverty by 6 percent among the registered members but there was slight increase in depth of poverty. Similarly, the increase in relative incidence of poverty among members was 3 percent less than non-members. Relative depth of poverty has been decreased substantially showing the positive impact of developmental interventions as during the base year around 13 percent boost in income was required to come out of poverty. Now only 7 percent coverage is required. Inequality among the poor has also been reduced more among registered members than non-registered. There are varying reflections of incidence, depth and severity of poverty in different districts of AJK. Beside unidimensional poverty, multidimensional deprivation was also quantified for all registered and non registered members of AJKCDP under different arbitrary weight arrangements. Most of such empirics clearly demonstrate the fact that multidimensional poverty was reduced in a higher proportion among the members as compared to non members except in Muzaffarabad. Health dimension has been emerged as the leading contributor in multidimensional poverty as health poverty increased almost in all districts of AJK. Had there been health related initiatives, the fall in multidimensional poverty would have been higher. Probability expressions were modeled with the aid of Logit to check correlates of poverty in the area. Education, <b>cultivated</b> area, <b>assets,</b> employment status, jobs of females, household size and the livestock are going to increase the probability of decrease in poverty. It is recommended that the success stories of this program should be replicated with great care as area specific interventions are more workable than initiatives in one stroke across the whole valley. One key policy message states that no intervention can be sustainably workable and highly successful in improving the welfare of the masses until health related issues are addressed in conjunction with other initiatives. It has been proved empirically that women?s participation in economic activities plays a pivotal role in reducing poverty. Gender friendly policies are highly beneficial particularly in the remote regions. Health and education related infrastructure should be improved by involving the local community and by inviting private sector through the foundation of corporate social responsibility...|$|R
