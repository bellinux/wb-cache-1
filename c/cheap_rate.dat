Barani names these parts as Chautara-i Subhani, Mori, Hudhudi and the royal tank (Hauz-i Sultani). The modern identity of these areas is not certain; Hauz-i Sultani probably refers to Hauz-i-Shamsi. The Mongols also ransacked the royal stores, and sold corn and other commodities from it to the public at a <b>cheap</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
500|$|On the Northwest Coast {{itself the}} fur trade was {{supplemented}} with slave trading. The pre-existing indigenous slave trade was enlarged and expanded upon by fur traders, especially the American traders. While working the coast for furs, traders would purchase slaves around {{the mouth of the}} Columbia River and in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, then sell or trade them on the northern coast. Few traders admitted to slaving, although some wrote about it in detail. Further information comes from sources such as reports by HBC officers. Aemelius Simpson of the Hudson's Bay Company wrote in 1828 that American traders on coast trafficked in slaves, [...] "purchasing them at a <b>cheap</b> <b>rate</b> from one tribe and disposing of them to others at a very high profit." [...] He concluded that the American traders made more money from selling slaves, rum, and gunpowder than they did from fur trading.|$|E
500|$|With {{inflation}} {{falling to}} 0.5% in May 2014, the ECB again took measures {{to stimulate the}} eurozone economy, which grew at just 0.2% {{during the first quarter}} of 2014. [...] (Deflation or very low inflation encourages holding cash, causing a decrease in purchases.) [...] On 5 June, the central bank cut the prime interest rate to 0.15%, and set the deposit rate at −0.10%. [...] The latter move in particular was seen as [...] "a bold and unusual move", as a negative interest rate had never been tried on a wide-scale before. [...] Additionally, the ECB announced it would offer long-term four-year loans at the <b>cheap</b> <b>rate</b> (normally the rate is primarily for overnight lending), but only if the borrowing banks met strict conditions designed to ensure the funds ended {{up in the hands of}} businesses instead of, for example, being used to buy low risk government bonds. [...] Collectively, the moves are aimed at avoiding deflation, devaluing the euro to make exportation more viable, and at increasing [...] "real world" [...] lending.|$|E

Delhi was planned as the headquarters and location of the ground for the club, but it was eventually set up in Bombay (now Mumbai). Guha [...] considers this as an attempt {{on the part of}} De Mello and Grant Govan to shift the headquarters of cricket in India from Bombay, but the book brought out by the CCI for the Golden Jubilee of the Brabourne Stadium [...] attributes this to the non-availability of land in Bombay. But it does seem that De Mello played a prominent role in selecting the site and convincing Lord Brabourne, the Governor of Bombay, to allot the land for the stadium at a <b>cheap</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

60|$|He did {{not travel}} far that afternoon, for {{by this time}} it was nearly dark, and there had been a heavy fall of snow, which not only {{rendered}} the way toilsome, but the track uncertain and difficult to find, after daylight, save by experienced wayfarers. He lay, that night, at a cottage, where beds were let at a <b>cheap</b> <b>rate</b> to the more humble class of travellers; and, rising betimes next morning, made his way before night to Boroughbridge. Passing through that town in search of some cheap resting-place, he stumbled upon an empty barn within a couple of hundred yards of the roadside; in a warm corner of which, he stretched his weary limbs, and soon fell asleep.|$|E

The merchants were checked and discountenanced; they had often been told, by some in authority, of the <b>cheap</b> <b>rate</b> at which these Canada bills had been procured; yet the author can talk of the composition {{of them as a}} necessity induced by the change in administration. They found themselves indeed, before that change, under a necessity of hinting somewhat of bringing the matter into Parliament; but they were soon silenced, and put in mind of the fate which the Newfoundland business had there met with. Nothing struck them more than the strong contrast between the spirit, and method of proceeding, of the two administrations.|$|E

Clean sheets are provided every week, as are baths for the inmates. In the kitchen were great cooking boilers, ovens, etc., all of which are worked by steam produced by the burning of the refuse of the sorted paper. Then I saw the household salvage store, which contained enormous quantities of old clothes and boots; also a great collection of furniture, including a Turkish bath cabinet, all of which articles had been given to the Army by charitable folk. These are either given away or sold to the employes of the factory or to the poor of the neighbourhood at a very <b>cheap</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

60|$|Britannia, sitting meditating {{one fine}} day (perhaps in the {{attitude}} {{in which she}} is presented on the copper coinage), discovers {{all of a sudden}} that she wants Veneering in Parliament. It occurs to her that Veneering is 'a representative man'--which cannot in these times be doubted--and that Her Majesty's faithful Commons are incomplete without him. So, Britannia mentions to a legal gentleman of her acquaintance that if Veneering will 'put down' five thousand pounds, he may write a couple of initial letters after his name at the extremely <b>cheap</b> <b>rate</b> of two thousand five hundred per letter. It is clearly understood between Britannia and the legal gentleman that nobody is to take up the five thousand pounds, but that being put down they will disappear by magical conjuration and enchantment.|$|E

He added that as no shipwrights could be found in London to repair it till after Christmas, the chapman, a Cypriote, who was in charge of the wine, was selling as much as he could in Southminster and to the houses about at a <b>cheap</b> <b>rate,</b> and delivering it by means of a wain that he had hired.|$|E
