5000|$|Because {{colistin}} {{was introduced}} into clinical practice over 50 years ago, {{it was never}} subject to the regulations that modern drugs are subject to, and therefore there is no standardised dosing of colistin and no detailed trials on pharmacology or pharmacokinetics: The optimal dosing of colistin for most infections is therefore unknown. Colomycin has a recommended intravenous dose of 1 to 2 million units three times daily for patients weighing 60 kg or more with normal renal function. Coly-Mycin has a recommended dose of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg colistin base a day, which is equivalent to 6 to 12 mg/kg <b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium</b> per day.

40|$|Background : A {{long-term}} plating of Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{in patients}} with cystic fibrosis {{is a sign of}} damage of the lung tissues with rapid progression of the disease and decrease in a respiratory function. The early pathogen detection is necessary for the timely prescription of an antibiotic for the purpose of a complete eradication of P. aeruginosa.   Objective : Our aim was to determine the efficiency and safety of an inhalation form of the <b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium</b> antibiotic in children with cystic fibrosis during the initial detection of P. aeruginosa.   Methods : In a retrospective continuous study it was analyzed the results of inhalation use of the <b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium</b> in a dose of 2 million IU/day in children with moderate cystic fibrosis with newly diagnosed P. aeruginosa.   Results : The analysis included data of 25 children at the age of 2 – 10 years, 17 of them were treated with <b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium</b> for 6 months, 8 — for 12 months. P. aeruginosa eradication was detected in 22 (88 %) children. Children, who received antibiotic therapy for 6 months, {{at the end of the}} treatment showed an increase in forced expiratory volume for the 1 st second (FEV- 1) from 67. 1 ± 2. 2 to 80. 4 ± 1. 9 % (р = 0. 012), but in 3 months without inhalations there was a decrease in indicator values (to 75. 9 ± 5. 7 %; p = 0. 069). With the duration of inhalations of 12 months, the value FEV- 1 indicator also increased: from 65. 9 ± 3. 8 to 81. 5 ± 3. 1 % (р = 0. 011). However, in the following 3 months without therapy these children did not have any significant decrease in FEV- 1 (80. 6 ± 3. 4 %; р = 0. 073). There were no allergic reactions during the treatment; bronchospasm was observed in one child.

He had been receiving multiple nephrotoxic antibiotics for a long time (including tigecycline and <b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium)</b> and had a persistent urinary infection related to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (with susceptibility to colistimethate).

40|$|Background: Currently applied {{nebulisation}} {{techniques for}} the administration of antibiotics to patients with infectious lung diseases are ineffective, time consuming and therefore, burdensome to the patient. Dry powder inhalers may be an interesting alternative {{as they can be}} effective, simple, cheap and thus, disposable. Methods: Our preferred strategy for high dose drug administration is to avoid the use of excipients, apply simple production techniques and adapt the design of the dry powder inhaler to the specific properties of the drug. For this study we produced excipient free tobramycin particles (sulphate and base) by micronization and spray drying. We also used two different dry powder inhalers, the Twincer™and the Novolizer ®, both making use of air classifier technology for dispersion. The Twincer™is a disposable inhaler specifically designed {{for the administration}} of high doses of <b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium.</b> The Novolizer ® was used only to investigate whether a different classifier design can overcome problems with retention and dispersion of tobramycin, which has completely different physico-chemical properties compared to <b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium.</b> Results: Spray dried tobramycin performs better in the Twincer™than micronised particles. Although the Twincer™classifiers effectively disperse spray dried tobramycin, a high inhaler retention is obtained because of adhesion onto the classifier walls. In contrast, the Novolizer ® classifier combines a high dispersion efficiency with minimal retention, but this device is not suitable for delivery of high drug doses. Conclusion: The results indicate that the Twincer™dry powder inhaler can be optimised for spray-dried tobramycin free base by re-designing the classifiers...|$|E

MethodsPatients hospitalized at Siriraj Hospital between January 2005 and April 2006, who had infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii, were enrolled in the study. Colistin (<b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium)</b> at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day was given intravenously in two divided doses. Primary outcomes were the clinical response and 30 -day mortality; secondary outcomes were microbiological response and adverse events. ResultsNinety-three patients infected with MDR P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were enrolled. Seventy-eight patients (71 with A. baumannii and seven with P. aeruginosa) received colistin, whereas 15 patients (12 with A. baumannii and three with P. aeruginosa) received other antibiotics. The mean age, gender, underlying conditions and severity of illness of the patients in both groups were not significantly different. In the colistin group, 63 patients (80. 8 %) had a favorable clinical response and 94. 9 % had a microbiological response. The overall mortality of the patients in the colistin group was 46. 2 % and that in the non-colistin group was 80 %. Nephrotoxicity was found in 24 patients (30. 8 %) in the colistin group and 17 of them had predisposing factors contributing to their renal dysfunction.

We compared lung microbiota samples retrieved by protected specimen brushings (PSB) and exhaled breath condensate collection. We {{also sought to}} assess whether aerosolized antibiotic treatment would influence the lung microbiota and whether this change could be detected in EBC. EBC was collected from 6 conscious sheep and then from the same anesthetized sheep during mechanical ventilation. Following the latter EBC collection, PSB samples were collected from separate sites within each sheep lung. On the subsequent day, each sheep was then treated with nebulized <b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium.</b> Two days after nebulization, EBC and PSB samples were again collected. Bacterial DNA was quantified using 16 S rRNA gene quantitative PCR. The V 2 -V 3 region of the 16 S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq.

40|$|Recent {{clinical}} studies {{performed in a}} large number of patients showed that colistin "forgotten" for several decades revived for the management of infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and had acceptable effectiveness and considerably less toxicity than that reported in older publications. Colistin is a rapidly bactericidal antimicrobial agent that possesses a significant postantibiotic effect against MDR Gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The optimal colistin dosing regimen against MDR GNB is still unknown {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) setting. A better understanding of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of colistin is urgently needed to determine the optimal dosing regimen. Although pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in ICU patients are scarce, recent evidence shows that the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of <b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium</b> and colistin in critically ill patients differ from those previously found in other groups, such as cystic fibrosis patients. The AUC:MIC ratio has been found to be the parameter best associated with colistin efficacy. To maximize the AUC:MIC ratio, higher doses of <b>colistimethate</b> <b>sodium</b> and alterations in the dosing intervals may be warranted in the ICU setting. In addition, the development of colistin resistance has been linked to inadequate colistin dosing. This enforces the importance of colistin dose optimization in critically ill patients. Although higher colistin doses seem to be beneficial, the lack of colistin pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data results in difficulty for the optimization of daily colistin dose.
