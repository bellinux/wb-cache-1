Although most of these compounds are present at low concentrations, many of them raise considerable toxicological concerns, particularly when present as components of complex mixtures. Here we review three scientific challenges in addressing water-quality problems caused by such micropollutants. First, tools to assess the impact of these pollutants on aquatic life and human health must be further developed and refined. Second, cost-effective and appropriate remediation and water-treatment technologies must be explored and implemented.

The main {{purpose of this study}} is to perform a first long-term air quality assessment for Portugal, regarding aerosols and PM pollution. The CHIMERE chemistry-transport model, forced by the MM 5 meteorological fields, was applied over Portugal for 2001 year, with 10  km horizontal resolution, using an emission inventory obtained from a spatial top-down disaggregation of the 2001 national inventory database. The evaluation model exercise shows a model trend to overestimate particulate pollution episodes (peaks) at urban sites, especially in winter season. This could be due to an underprediction of the winter model vertical mixing and also to an overestimation of PM emissions. Simulated inorganic components (ammonium and sulfate) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) were compared to measurements taken at Aveiro (northwest coast of Portugal). An underestimation of the three components was verified. However, the model is able to predict their seasonal variation. Nevertheless, as a first approach, and despite the complex topography and coastal location of Portugal affected by sea salt natural aerosols emissions, the results obtained show that the model reproduces the PM levels, temporal evolution, and spatial patterns.

In this study, a quantitative risk model that uses hazard quotients for each water quality parameter was combined with a qualitative risk model that uses the relative risk level of potential pollution events in order to characterize the current condition and potential risk of watersheds providing drinking water. In a case study of Taipei Source Water Area in northern Taiwan, total coliforms and total phosphorus were the top two pollutants of concern. Intensive tea-growing and recreational activities around the riparian zone may contribute the greatest pollution to the watershed.

The use of carbonation of as a method to decrease the leaching of inorganic pollutants from MSWI bottom ash has been studied. Field investigations and laboratory leaching experiments enabled the identification of inorganic pollutants whose leaching might be critical during such an utilisation. Treatment methods by carbonation and water extraction were evaluated regarding the mobility of seven <b>critical</b> <b>pollutants</b> (Al, Cl, Cr, Cu, Mo, Sb and SO 4). The stabilising effect of carbonation to a moderate alkaline level (~pH 8. 3) was evaluated and compared to the mobilising effect of carbonation in excess (~pH 6. 4). Carbonation to a moderate alkaline level demobilised four (Al, Cr, Cu and Sb) of seven critical components. Washing to remove easily soluble salts was recommended in addition to moderate carbonation. Carbonation in excess had the highest mobilising effect on Cr, Cu and Sb when interacted with other factors, mostly pH. Carbonation in excess was therefore proven to be a key factor enhancing the effectiveness of MSWI bottom ash treatment by wet extraction. Godkänd; 2006; 20061205 (haneit...|$|E

The fragile nature of high latitudes is extremely vulnerable to human impacts. The negative effects are caused not only by plants and factories located in the northern latitudes but also by far away plants in Central Europe, America, and Asia. As a result, pollutants migrating to the Arctic significantly affect the environmental situation in the northern regions of the planet. In order to improve the environmental situation in the Arctic, environment quality has to be managed properly in all regions of the world. This article {{is focused on the}} analysis of the situation in the Arctic region of Russia, namely in the North of the Russian Plain. Starting from the 1980 's, Russia has conducted environmental monitoring of the snow cover to determine <b>critical</b> <b>pollutant</b> loads on natural ecosystems across the country.

Iron and steel sector is considered {{as one of the}} most polluting sectors in the world. It is also one of the most energy intensive industries. During pig iron manufacturing, there is a number of steps that affect the environment emitting different pollutants. While some step(s) may be considered critical to damage the environment among all the steps, some pollutant(s) may be considered critical to affect the environment among all the pollutants. This paper proposes environmental bottleneck to consider critical step and <b>critical</b> <b>pollutant</b> simultaneously. Unless environmental bottleneck is improved, environmental performance of the entire manufacturing process may not improve significantly even if other processes (i. e. other than environmental bottleneck) are taken care of. Thus, environmental bottleneck must be taken care of properly by the manufacturing organization to enable environmentally conscious manufacturing. Hence, a method should be developed to identify environmental bottleneck. Current research work uses Bayesian Networks (BN) to identify environmental bottleneck. The contribution of the paper is to identify the environmental bottleneck for an Indian pig iron manufacturing organization.

The Le Sueur River Watershed (LRW) of South-Central Minnesota drains 2, 850 km² in the Minnesota River Basin. The watershed has an annual discharge of 230 mm and generates significant sediment and chemical pollution. The {{objective of this}} study was to quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of sediment, nutrient (nitrate-nitrogen, phosphorus) and pesticide (atrazine, acetochlor and metolachlor) losses from the LRW using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated from 2000 - 2006 in the Beauford sub-watershed. The calibrated model was applied to the entire LRW mainly to identify <b>critical</b> <b>pollutant</b> contributing areas and to evaluate effectiveness of alternative best management practices to reduce the loadings. The study has five major parts. The first part deals with hydrologic simulation. The second part identifies the relative contribution of upland and channel sediment sources. The third part deals with water quality impacts of land use and management alternatives on phosphorus and nitrogen losses to the LRW. The fourth part deals with pesticide losses. The fifth part deals with impacts of various biofuel production options on water quality. The LRW has estimated annual loadings of 1. 0 kg TP/ha, 18 kg NO 3 -N/ha and 302, 000 t/yr of sediment that contribute to water quality impairments in Lake Pepin and the Mississippi River. Alternative management practices are predicted to reduce upland sediment yield by up to 54 %, nitrate-N losses by 22 %, and phosphorus loadings by 64 %.

Diffusive Gradient in Thin-films (DGT) is a passive sampling technique, which has been successfully applied in a variety of environmental monitoring projects related to hazardous radionuclides, trace metals, organic contaminants and pharmaceuticals to precisely measure chemical releases. A DGT sampler is a very simple kit with a 25 mm diameter plastic backing cylinder and a front cap with a window of 20 mm in diameter.

This requires the identification of future loading of contributing pollutants, {{and the development of}} a plan to allocate the necessary reductions among the point and nonpoint sources in the watershed to achieve this loading. To support water quality model-based TMDL development, US EPA has released the modeling framework BASINS-Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Source, which incorporates several watershed water quality models within a GIS-based data management system. Current capabilities of BASINS enable simulation of watershed water quality associated with a TMDL, thus supporting TMDL development via a trial-and-error approach. The limitations of the trial-and-error approach are addressed via systematic search procedures implemented within the Water Quality Management Decision Support System (WQMDSS) that is designed to aid stakeholders and decision-makers efficiently identify TMDLs. The focus of the research presented in this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of WQMDSS in developing TMDLs for a realistic illustrative case study. Using the data for the Suwanee Creek Watershed in Georgia, which underwent a recent TMDL study, a series of illustrative scenarios are examined to consider varying target total suspended solids (TSS) loading rates, as well as different instream water quality parameters. The instream water quality is estimated using a calibrated HSPF model. Future land use development plans, with and without consideration of riparian buffer strips for nonpoint source control, to meet instream water quality goals are identified.

Asides, the ventilation system fault and availability analysis is seldom included in the project. The paper deals with the results of a research work started some years ago at an underground quarry exploited through drift sublevel based on drill and blast technique, to identify criteria suitable to grant effective safety and health -S&H- conditions for the workers operating in the underground in the Prevention through Design approach. Taken into account that the phases for an effective approach to the S&H problems in underground must follow a hierarchic method in which the risk management should be faced from an effective hazard reduction to a minimum at the sources, and the ventilation should be considered only as a 4 th level solution, the possibilities of control at the main pollution sources, i. e. the emission of pollutants due to the rock winning and mucking operations, have been examined. The residual risk was then faced with both the original underground and airways layout definition for a new exploitation development, based on technical and efficiency considerations, and on fire emergency computer simulations. Finally, the paper summarizes the results of an availability analysis of the ventilation system for the normal operating conditions and the emergencies management, {{on the basis of the}} results of Hazard Evaluation techniques, in particular Hazard and Operability Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis...|$|E
40|$|The Veneto region (NE Italy) lies in {{the eastern}} part of the Po Valley, a European hotspot for air pollution. Data for key air {{pollutants}} (CO, NO, NO 2, O 3, SO 2, PM 10 and PM 2. 5) measured over 7 years (2008 / 2014) across 43 sites in Veneto were processed to characterise their spatial and temporal patterns and assess the air quality. Nitrogen oxides, PM and ozone are <b>critical</b> <b>pollutants</b> frequently breaching the EC limit and target values. Intersite analysis demonstrates a widespread pollution across the region and shows that primary pollutants (nitrogen oxides, CO, PM) are significantly higher in cities and over the flat lands due to higher anthropogenic pressures. The spatial variation of air pollutants at rural sites was then mapped to depict the gradient of background pollution: nitrogen oxides are higher in the plain area due to the presence of strong diffuse anthropogenic sources, while ozone increases toward the mountains probably due to the higher levels of biogenic ozone-precursors and low NO emissions which are not sufficient to titrate out the photochemical O 3. Data-depth classification analysis revealed a poor categorization among urban, traffic and industrial sites: weather and urban planning factors may cause a general homogeneity of air pollution within cities driving this poor classification. Seasonal and diurnal cycles were investigated: the effect of primary sources in populated areas is evident throughout the region and drives similar patterns for most pollutants: road traffic appears the predominant potential source shaping the daily cycles. Trend analysis of experimental data reveals a general decrease of air pollution across the region, which agrees well with changes assessed by emission inventories. This study provides key information on air quality across NE Italy and highlights future research needs and possible developments of the regional monitoring network...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen (N), {{particularly}} nitrate (NO 3 -), is a <b>critical</b> <b>pollutant</b> in many northeastern US watersheds that {{is especially}} detrimental to coastal marine ecosystems. Agricultural land, which receives fertilizers and/or animal manures, {{is a principal}} source of N loading to the environment. The most effective NO 3 - attenuation mechanism is probably microbial denitrification, i. e., the transformation of NO 3 - into N gases (e. g., NO, N 2 O, N 2). Currently, our estimates of the magnitudes of denitrification rates at landscape scales are "tentative" at best, usually based on large-scale watershed budgets in which denitrification was estimated by difference. One reason that denitrification is hard to quantify is that {{a large amount of}} denitrification occurs in disproportionately small parts of the landscape (i. e., hotspots) and over relatively short periods (i. e., hot moments). Denitrification occurs primarily under anaerobic conditions by heterotrophic microbes and is expected to be vigorous in wet soils high in organic carbon. There is good evidence that these conditions correlate strongly with the likelihood of soil saturating, i. e., hydrological sensitivity, thus, by juxtaposing hydrology and biogeochemistry we can elucidate the distribution of denitrification hotspots across the landscape. We used nitrogen isotopes to quantify and characterize spatial patterns of denitrification in riparian zones and other saturated soils (i. e., the shallow saturated zone) of an agricultural landscape. In situ denitrification rates in shallow groundwater were determined monthly using the 15 N-NO 3 - push-pull method. Annual rates of denitrification showed a strong positive relationship with topographic index, a well- known wetness index and indicator of hydrologic similarity. The resulting relationship was used to distribute denitrification rates across the landscape and estimate denitrification N fluxes from the shallow saturated zone. Denitrification in the shallow saturated zone resulted in a N flux that was nearly half of the total denitrification from the landscape-in {{about a third of the}} area-as determined from an unusually well-constrained whole-farm N balance constructed from farm records and field measures. Denitrification N flux rates from saturated riparian soils were among the highest in the landscape, however the contribution of riparian areas to total landscape denitrification was less than 10 percent. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Stormwater, in {{this study}} defined as surface runoff in urban areas, is known to {{transport}} large quantities of toxic substances to receiving waters. Therefore different practices to treat stormwater have been proposed. In Sweden retention ponds have become a common treatment method during the past decade. The main objective {{of the study is}} to investigate the performance of stormwater ponds and street sweeping. Performance of retention ponds was investigated by field measurements of water and sediments, and through simulation of hydrodynamics and removal processes. This showed that ponds are an efficient way of reducing pollutant loads from stormwater and that both water and sediment were highly polluted. A clear correlation between pollutant concentrations in the water and in sediments was found, which indicates that pond sediments can be used for characterising pollutant loads from urban catchments. In order to distinguish between different parameters affecting removal efficiency in ponds, simulations using a numerical model were done. This demonstrated that surface load is the most important parameter governing removal efficiency, however hydraulic efficiency, i. e. how efficient the volume of the pond is utilised, has for engineering purposes a crucial significance, since the space available for construction normally is limited. Further it was shown that the most important factor explaining changes in removal efficiencies between winter and summer seasons is the change of hydrology during the winter. Wind was found to be an important parameter governing oxygenation of ponds. In order to investigate the efficiency of street sweeping a street was swept and the amount of removed sediment and heavy metals were measured. This showed that street sweeping could be an efficient control measure of pollutants. The amount of sediments on the street decreased during the sweeping period and approached a steady state condition. The largest amounts of metals were found in the sandy fractions of the sediment, however the highest concentrations were found in the finest grain sizes and the concentrations were proportional to the inverse of the particle diameter. Copper was found to be the <b>critical</b> <b>pollutant</b> for stormwater and sediments from ponds and streets...|$|R
40|$|According to the Air Quality Framework Directive, air {{pollutant}} concentration levels {{have to be}} assessed and reported annually by each European Union member state, taking into consideration European air quality standards. Plans and programmes should be implemented in zones and agglomerations where pollutant concentrations exceed the limit and target values. The main objective {{of this study is}} to perform a long-term air quality simulation for Portugal, using the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model, applied over Portugal, for the year 2001. The model performance was evaluated by comparing its results to air quality data from the regional monitoring networks and to data from a diffusive sampling experimental campaign. The results obtained show a modelling system able to reproduce the pollutant concentrations' temporal evolution and spatial distribution observed at the regional networks of air quality monitoring. As far as the fulfilment of the air quality targets is concerned, there are excessive values for nitrogen and sulfur dioxides, ozone also being a <b>critical</b> gaseous <b>pollutant</b> in what concerns hourly concentrations and AOT 40 (Accumulated Over Threshold 40 ppb) values...|$|R
