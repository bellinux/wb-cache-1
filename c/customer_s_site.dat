Although the five N 1 s orbitals in the core shell of all adenine amino tautomers are always given as 1 a' 2 a' 3 a' 4 a' 5 a'. The profound tautomer dependent inner-shell electronic reconfiguration has been largely masked by small net differences in their total electronic energies and subtle differences in their valence shell electronic structures.

Based on the observation of natural hydrothermal pyrites, As-I is usually assigned to the occupation of tetrahedral <b>S</b> <b>sites,</b> with the same oxidation state as in arsenopyrite (FeAsS), even if rare occurrences of AsIII or AsII are reported. However, the modes of As incorporation into pyrite during its crystallization in low-temperature diagenetic conditionsare not elucidated yet since arsenic acts as an inhibitor for pyrite nucleation at ambient temperature. Here, we bring evidence from X-ray absorption spectroscopy for AsII,III incorporation into pyrite at octahedral FeII sites and to As-I at tetrahedral <b>S</b> <b>sites</b> during crystallization at ambient temperature. Extended X-Ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of these As-bearing pyrites are explained by local structure models obtained using density functional theory (DFT), assuming incorporation of As at the Fe and <b>S</b> <b>sites</b> as well as local clustering of arsenic. Such observation of As-I incorporation at ambient temperature may help understanding the early formation of authigenic arsenian pyrite in subsurface sediments.

To identify {{some of these}} factors, the light-independent spinach RPL 21 gene encoding the plastid ribosomal protein L 21 was chosen as a model. The RPL 21 promoter organization was defined by transient and stable transfections of RPL 21 promoter deletion mutants fused to a reporter gene. The following results were obtained. (1) We identified a strong core promoter, spanning the transcription start site region, sufficient to drive high levels of gene expression. (2) We identified two non-overlapping positive and negative domains, located upstream from the core promoter region, that modulate core promoter activity independently of light. (3) We found that the positive domain contains a new cis-acting element, the <b>S</b> 2 <b>site,</b> related to but different from the light-responsive GT- 1 binding site. We show that the <b>S</b> 2 <b>site</b> binds a leaf-specific nuclear factor (named S 2 F).

Peat samples from both sites were subjected to similar experimental conditions to distinguish between the chemical effects (NO 3 -, O 2 ) and the physical effects (hydrologic regimes). [Cl-], [SO 4 2 -] and [NO 3 -] were monitored for 240 h. Nitrate was significantly reduced in most experiments: (1) Removal of 70 % of the initial nitrate content after 51 h under anoxic conditions; (2) Complete nitrate reduction after 240 h in soil from the <b>S</b> <b>site.</b> This reduction was interpreted as heterotrophic denitrification. Sulphate monitoring revealed that 400 mg/L were produced in peat from <b>site</b> <b>S</b> under aerobic conditions.

Based on literature studies, where detailed characterization of Cu/SSZ- 13 have been conducted using several experimental techniques', we suggest the following physical interpretation of the S 1 and <b>S</b> 2 <b>sites</b> in the model. The <b>S</b> 1 <b>sites</b> are associated with copper located in a six-membered ring, possibly slightly distorted due to interactions with-water and ammonia while, the <b>S</b> 2 <b>sites</b> represent copper in the large cages or CuxOy species. In addition, ammonia is also stored on Bronsted acid sites, but in order not to complicate the model further, it was lumped together in the S 1 and <b>S</b> 2 <b>sites.</b> Finally, <b>S</b> 3 <b>sites</b> have been added in order to describe the large amount of physisorbed ammonia at low temperature. This three-site model was capable of adequately describing the ammonia TPD experiments with the initial temperature of 50 and 150 degrees C. The heats of adsorption of ammonia on the Si and <b>S</b> 2 <b>sites</b> were determined using micro-calorimeter experiments. Further, the main SCR reaction in the model occurs on <b>S</b> 1 <b>sites</b> and the main ammonia oxidation reaction on <b>S</b> 2 <b>sites.</b> However, due to the complex behavior associated with ammonia oxidation, where the conversion slightly decreased when the temperature was increased from 350 to 400 degrees C, an ammonia oxidation reaction occurring at low temperature with low rate needed to be introduced on S 1. In a similar way, an added step was needed for ammonia-SCR on S 2, which occurred at high temperature where the ammonia coverage on Si was low resulting in low conversion. To summarize, the-three-site model developed was capable of well describing the ammonia storage and release, ammonia oxidation as well as SCR and N 2 O formation across a broad temperature interval (100 - 600 degrees C) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess whether local {{electrogram}} (EG) analysis is predictive of the endocardial (ENDO) ventricular (V) insertion of accessory pathways (APs) located in the left postero-septal (L PS) space. In 22 (3. 6 %) out of 619 manifest APs, the successful (S) out of 14 (2 – 30) pulses was delivered at the ENDO ventricular aspect of the PS mitral annulus (28 sessions; 4. 0 ± 1. 3 h duration; 69 ± 38 min fluoroscopy time). Of local EGs retrospectively analyzed, 22 were recorded at Sand 49 at unsuccessful (U) ENDO sites in the L PS V, 75 at U risght (R) PS sites, 72 at U epicardial (EPI) sites, of which 52 from within the coronary sinus (CS) and 10 from the middle cardiac vein (MCV). An AP potential could be distinguished in 18 / 24 (81 %) <b>S</b> <b>sites,</b> but also in 41 / 49 (84 %) U sites. Local A-V (42 ± 12 ms vs 43 ± 11 ms) and Δ-V intervals (- 5 ± 7 ms vs - 2 ± 9 ms) as well as A/V ratio (0. 15 vs 0. 17) did not differ between Sand U sites. Intermittent conduction block was induced during 50 % of pulses delivered from the R PS region and 30 % of those delivered from both the CS and 3 the MCV. Compared to <b>S</b> <b>sites.</b> A-V was longer at R PS (53 ± 10 ms, p< 0. 01), and CS (52 ±ms, p< 0. 01), but not at the MCV (43 ± 12 ms). At all these sites, Δ-V was similar to that at <b>S</b> <b>sites</b> (R PS, - 2 ± 8 ms, CS - 4 ± 8 ms. MCV, - 8 ± 12 ms). Conclusions Geometrical complexity of PS APs is reflected in the set of L PS APs ablated at the ENDO aspect. In such set, AP potentials are frequently recorded at the R PS and L EPI site; also, Δ-V intervals at these sites similar to those at <b>S</b> <b>sites,</b> thus rendering mapping techniques for AP localization and ablation in this region difficult...|$|R
30|$|An S 3 {{space is}} {{organised}} {{as a collection}} of buckets which are similar to folders. A bucket can contain zero or more objects of up to 5 terabytes of data each. Both buckets and objects are identified by names (keys in Amazon terminology) chosen by the <b>customer.</b> <b>S</b> 3 provides SOAP and RESTful interfaces. As per the abstract model, an <b>S</b> 3 <b>customer</b> is charged for: a) resource: storage space consumed by the objects that they store in S 3; b) traffic: network traffic generated by the operations that the customer executes against the S 3 interface; and c) operations: number of operations that the customer executes against the S 3 interface.|$|R

This minimizes the total distance traveled while sinks move to the assigned sites afterwards.

40|$|The genus Cephalanthera is an {{excellent}} plant group for karyotype evolution studies because it exhibits a dysploid series and bimodal karyotypes. With the aim of understanding their chromosomal and phylogenetic relationships, rRNA genes and the Arabidopsis-type telomeric sequence were mapped by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and the rDNA intergenic spacer (ITS) was sequenced {{for the first time}} in three European species: C. longifolia (2 n = 4 x = 32), C. damasonium (2 n = 4 x = 36) and C. rubra (2 n = 4 x = 44). One 45 S and three 5 <b>S</b> rDNA <b>sites</b> are observed in C. longifolia, one 45 S and two 5 <b>S</b> <b>sites</b> in C. damasonium, and two 45 S and one 5 <b>S</b> <b>site</b> in C. rubra. Telomeric signals were observed at every chromosome end in all three species and C. damasonium also displays interstitial signals on three chromosome pairs. In agreement with chromosome data, molecular analyses support C. longifolia and C. damasonium as closely related taxa, while C. rubra stands apart. Possible pathways of karyotype evolution are discussed in reference to a previous hypothesis. The results indicate that complex chromosomal rearrangements, possibly involving Robertsonian fusions and fissions, loss of telomeric repeats, gain or loss of rDNA sites and other heterochromatic sequences and inversions, may have contributed to generating the present-day karyotypes. 1330...|$|R
