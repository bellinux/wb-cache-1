40|$|Gliomas {{are common}} {{malignant}} {{tumors of the}} human neural system, and Wnt signaling activation {{is closely related to}} glioma malignancy. Human Pygopus 2 (Pygo 2) was recently discovered to be a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is required for beta-catenin/Tcf-dependent transcription. However, the role of Pygo 2 in glioblastoma cell growth and survival remains uncertain. In the present study, Pygo 2 expression was evaluated in 80 glioma tissue samples. Results demonstrated that tumor grade exhibited a positive correlation with overexpression of Pygo 2. In addition, small hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to specifically knockdown Pygo 2 expression in human glioblastoma U 251 cell lines. Results showed that inhibition of Pygo 2 expression resulted in inhibited cell proliferation and invasiveness, as well as increased cell cycle arrest at the G(1) stage and decreased expression of the Wnt target gene cyclin D 1. These results demonstrated that Pygo 2 was highly expressed in glioma tissue and required for growth of glioblastoma cells.
