5|$|Ancient authors {{agreed that}} the worship of Terminus was of Sabine origin, ascribing its {{introduction}} to Rome either to Titus Tatius, the Sabine colleague of Rome's founding king Romulus (traditional reign 753717 BC), or to Romulus' successor Numa Pompilius (717673 BC). Those authors who gave the <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> Numa explained his motivation as the prevention of violent disputes over property. Plutarch further states that, in keeping with Terminus's character as a guarantor of peace, his earliest worship did not involve blood sacrifices.|$|E

The Guild justified <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> Lewis Colick, who wrote {{the first draft of}} The Bobby Darin Story in 1987, and Kevin Spacey.

5|$|Brown {{initially}} conceded discovery <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> Ortiz, {{but came}} to suspect the Spanish team of fraud upon learning that his observation logs were accessed from the Spanish observatory {{the day before}} the discovery announcement. These logs included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images, and they were accessed again just before Ortiz scheduled telescope time to obtain confirmation images for a second announcement to the MPC on July 29. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating he was merely verifying whether they had discovered a new object.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s, {{the idea}} that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore; it was printed in the game's {{instructions}} for many years, in a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly, and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007. Even a guide to family games published for Reader's Digest in 2003 only gave <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> Darrow and Elizabeth Magie, erroneously stating that Magie's original game was created in the 19th century, and not acknowledging any of the game's development between Magie's creation of the game, and the eventual publication by Parker Brothers.|$|E

5|$|Haas and Creamer {{were cleared}} of the {{plagiarism}} charge by their institutions.

The record of the Airmen became a driving force for President Harry S Truman's decision to desegregate the U.S. military in 1948.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 President Andrew Jackson had vetoed a rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States, an {{institution}} which he felt extended <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> northeastern commercial tycoons {{at the expense}} of the ordinary frontiersmen of the Old Southwest, a region with which Jackson, a Tennessean, strongly identified. In 1836 Jackson had issued an executive order called the Specie Circular which demanded that all land transactions in the United States be conducted in cash. Both of these actions, combined with the economic depression following the Panic of 1837 (caused partly by Jackson's fiscal policies) increased the domestic need for minted money.|$|E
