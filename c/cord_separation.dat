40|$|Objectives: The best {{umbilical}} cord care after birth is a controversial issue. Aim {{of this research}} was to compare the effect of topical application of human milk and chlorhexidin on <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> time in newborns. Methods: One hundred seventy four neonates attending from hospitals affiliated to Kashan University of Medical Sciences were included. Newborns from birth were randomized to two groups. In group motherâ��s milk, mother will rub her own milk to cord stump two times a day. chlorhexidin (group 2) were applied to the umbilical stump every 12 hours. The time to umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> and any discomfort such as infection, hemorrhage, and discharge and odor were documented. Data was analyzed by SPSS software. Independent Samples t-Test, x 2, Fisher were used in this study. Results: Results showed a significant statistical difference between <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> time in two groups and the mean <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> time in the human milk group (7. 15 Â± 2. 15 days) was shorter than the chlorhexidin group (13. 28 Â± 6. 79 days). In addition, a significant correlation was found between Signs of infection (discharge, redness, swelling and odor) in both groups. Conclusions: Topical application of breast milk on {{umbilical cord}} care leads to quick <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> time and can be used as easy, cheep, non injury methods for umbilical cord care.

40|$|Summary: Over a 4 -month period, all infants {{admitted}} to the well-baby nursery were enrolled in a prospective study designed to compare <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> times between infants treated with triple dye once, followed by daily alcohol application, to infants treated with daily alcohol application alone. Follow-up phone calls were done 7 days after discharge, with weekly calls until <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> occurred. The objective {{was to determine whether}} the umbilical cord care regimen of triple dye followed by alcohol has an advantage over the alternative regimen of alcohol alone, with regard to <b>cord</b> <b>separation,</b> parenting, or healthcare caretaker preferences. In total, 634 infants were enrolled, with 599 infants (94 %) completing the study. Infants in the alcohol alone group had a shorter <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> time by 3 days (10 versus 13 days) (p < 0. 0001). There was no reported increase in infection, and monetary savings were noted. We conclude that alcohol applied once a day appears to be a safe and effective means of promoting cord detachment.

40|$|The {{morphogen}} Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) plays {{a critical}} {{role in the development of}} different tissues. In the central nervous system, SHH is well known to contribute to the patterning of the spinal <b>cord</b> and <b>separation</b> of the brain hemispheres. In addition, it has recently been shown that SHH signaling also contributes to the patterning of the telencephalon and establishment of adult neurogenic niches. In this work, we investigated whether SHH signaling inﬂuences the behavior of neural progenitors isolated from the dorsal telencephalon, which generate excitatory neurons and macroglial cells in vitro. We observed that SHH increases proliferation of cortical progenitors and generation of astrocytes, whereas blocking SHH signaling with cyclopamine has opposite effects. In both cases, generation of neurons did not seem to be affected. However, cell survival was broadly affected by blockade of SHH signaling. SHH effects were related to three different cell phenomena: mode of cell division, cell cycle length and cell growth. Together, our data in vitro demonstrate that SHH signaling controls cell behaviors that are important for proliferation of cerebral cortex progenitors, as well as differentiation and survival of neurons and astroglial cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Retrograde {{perfusion}} {{has emerged}} as a useful technique for the preservation of the heart and brain when arterial circulation is interrupted. Herein, {{this study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that retrograde perfusion of the azygos vein is sufficient to maintain viability of the spinal cord during aortic occlusion in the swine model. Methods: Female swine, 17 to 22 kg, underwent left thoracotomy, creation of a shunt between the aortic arch and the azygos vein, and aortic crossclamping for 60 minutes: the shunt was open in the retrograde perfusion group (n = 5) and closed in the control group (n = 4). The animals were evaluated for neurologic function for 8 days and killed. Spinal cords were processed for histologic examination. Additional animals underwent left thoracotomy and injection of a casting solution in the azygos vein (n = 2), left thoracotomy and angiography of the azygos vein (n = 2), and a compartmentalization procedure to separate the azygos vein from the caval system followed by angiography (n = 2). Results: Differences in the neurologic (2 -sample t test, P =. 11) and histologic (2 -sample t test, P =. 65) scores of retrograde perfusion and control groups were likely due to chance. Casting and angiography groups showed extensive collaterals between azygos and caval systems, only partially interrupted by compartmentalization. Conclusions: Retrograde perfusion does not protect the spinal cord from ischemic injury. The collateral network between the azygos and caval systems prevents the oxygenated blood from reaching the <b>cord.</b> Surgical <b>separation</b> between the 2 systems was only partially successful in this study.

40|$|Though the {{presence}} of stem cells in the adult human brain has been presented earlier, much {{has yet to be}} discovered about these cells. However, the mere potential of these cells has had a significant impact of how we today evaluate the regenerative capacity of the central nervous system and, importantly, on the possible means for science to provide insights in neural repair. In this thesis a series of in vitro studies, based on the formation of neurospheres, was used to identify the subependymal zone and hippocampus as sources of adult human neural stem cells. Cells of hippocampal origin were acquired from patients treated for epilepsy. To access the subventricular zone cell-population, a minimally invasive method was developed: using an endoscope in conjunction to placement of a ventricular drainage catheter in hydrocephalic patients, small biopsies were successfully acquired. Single, candidate stem cells were under strict clonal conditions induced to give rise to neurospheres in {{the presence}} of mitogens-epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor- 2 (bFGF- 2). The neurospheres were enzymatically passaged. As long as a mitogen was present in the culture medium, the cells continued to form neurospheres without differentiating. After induced differentiation, all 3 phenotypes represented in the CNS were present. Using patchclamp analysis, passive membrane properties of glia and neurons were identified. The development of active membrane properties in neuronal off-spring was documented, finally resulting in INa+-dependent repetetive firing of mature action potentials of individually investigated cells. In a subpopulaton of glutamaterigic neuronal off-spring, evidence of synaptic communication between cells lying in a network was also recorded. Knowing that the neuronal off-spring of adult human neural stem cells was functional in vitro, noncommitted adult human neural stem cells were transplanted into the spinal cord of adult rats in two separate studies. In a future perspective of auto-tranplantation, it is imperative to analyse the behaviour and integrational capacity of these cells, as well as analysing any possible negative side-effect of transplantation therapy using these cells as grafts. We could establish that even after prolonged frozen storage, stem cells survive, migrate and differentiate at least 8 weeks after a xenografting procedure. Migration was more prominent in the rostro-caudal axis and rnicroenvironmental cues seemed to strongly favour astroglial differentiation, although a few neurons of grafted origin also were encountered. A possible devastating side-effect of the procedure of injecting stem cells is the development of a chronic, many times therapy-refractory pain condition called allodynia. In the last study the induction of allodynia by grafted stem cells was evaluated. Using 4 different groups of animals (stem cell injected, vehicle injected, sham laminectomized and intact control), presence of allodynia was evaluated over an 8 week postoperative period. On the ipsilateral side of injection, there is a recovery of stem cell injected animals present after 5 weeks, while the vehicle treated animals showed a delayed response. On the contralateral side of injection however, there is a distinct separation between the 2 injected and the 2 non-injected groups. Importantly, the data here presented does not imply an aggravation of allodynia by injecting stem cells into the spinal <b>cord.</b> The <b>separation</b> in time of recovery between stem cell injected and vehicle treated animals on the ipsilateral side, might suggest a direct effect of the stem cell on host...|$|R

Different methods {{are used for}} umbilical cord care with multifarious efficien-cies. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare three methods of local use of maternal milk, local use of 96 % ethyl alcohol, and dry cord care. Materials & Methods: In this prospective, randomized, clinical trial, 207 healthy full-term neo-nates were randomly assigned to three groups. In the first and second groups, mothers rubbed her milk and 96 % ethyl alcohol on umbilical cord until two days after its separation, respec-tively. In the third group, they only kept the cord clean and dry. The length of umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> was compared among the groups with ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests. Results: The difference among lengths of umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> in three groups was statis-tically significant.

40|$|As {{a baby is}} born, the {{umbilical}} cord is cut and clamped, then it dries up and detaches. During the course of cord detachment and before the wound completely heals up, umbilical cord care is essential for preventing any local infection, which may lead to septicemia or infection of other organs. However, the yellowish and blood-stained discharge {{from the base of}} the cord and the appearance of the cord stump often causes anxiety among parents and make them hesitant to provide cord care. Hence, healthcare professionals are responsible for explaining the importance of proper cord care and provide consistent information on the course of cord detachment. This will decrease parental anxiety or the cord-related issues and improve compliance. Currently, different solutions are being used at different healthcare facilities. This leads to confusion among healthcare professionals and parents. Moreover, as evidenced in many studies, different solutions can affect {{the umbilical}} cord detachment time and prolongation of umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> time, which can cause immense anxiety among the parents. Hence, a solution that is effective in reducing the umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> time can help to alleviate parental anxiety. Dry care, such as using cold boiled water to clean the cord, is suggested to be suitable for umbilical cord care as it shortens the umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> time compares to alcohol, which is still being used in many healthcare facilities. Therefore, this proposed innovation attempts to promote dry care as the standard umbilical cord care practice, to shorten the umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> time, which in turn, decreases parental anxiety and the workload related to cord care for the healthcare professionals. The implementation of dry care was explored and it was found that this innovation is cost-effective and has a high transferability and feasibility in the current setting of Hong Kong Maternal and Child Health Clinics. An evidence-based practice guideline was developed and would be launched initially on a trial basis at one of the Maternal and Child Health Clinics after a well-developed communication and implementation plan is established. It is expected to take about 12 months from gaining approval, implementation of the innovation, data collection and to the last stage, program evaluation. published_or_final_versionNursing StudiesMasterMaster of Nursin...|$|E

Methods This open label clinical trial was conducted in Pirngadi Hospital, Medan from July to September 2003. Newborn infants who fulfilled inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to umbili- cal cord care using 10 % povidone iodine or 70 % alcohol. The main outcome measures were omphalitis prevalence, microor- ganism colonization, and time to umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>separation.</b> Culture of the umbilical cord swab was taken in the first 48 - 72 hours after birth. The umbilical cord was observed daily during hospital- ization and every other day after discharge until <b>cord</b> <b>separation.</b> Statistical analysis was done using chi-square test and indepen- dent t-test. Results There were 54 infants in the povidone iodine group and 52 infants in the alcohol group. Omphalitis was absent in both groups. Fourteen percent of subjects in the povidone iodine group showed no microorganism growth, compared to 7 % in the alco- hol group.

In respect to no clinical trial study about human milk effects on bacterial colonization in umbilicalcord, we decided to compare the effect of topical application of breast milk and dry cord care onbacterial colonization and <b>cord</b> <b>separation</b> time in neonates. Materials and Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial which was done at Omolbanin hospitalin Mashhad (Iran) in 2006. 118 neonates with 38 - 42 weeks gestational age, singleton and with oughtcongenital anomaly were chosen in base of interview and registration information from mother and herneonate, and they divided in two groups, Mother's milk for group 1, and dry cord care for group 2. Allmothers in two groups received an instructed one-to-one cord care education within 3 hours of birth.

From December 2014 to March 2015, 239 infants were born at the AH. The number of eligible infants was 200 and they were equally assigned to either case group (dry cord care) or control group (70 % alcohol, standard procedure). Standard cord care consisted in 1 application of 70 % alcohol at birth followed by other 2 times a day, while experimental dry cord care procedure was executed by the only application of a sterile gauze around the base of the UC at the 1 st day of life and after the cord has been exposed to air off the diaper edge. The time to UC separation and any AEs such as local and systemic infections, hemorrhage, and granuloma formation were reported by mothers.

Immunoprecipitation of 125 I-labeled patient cells with subunit specific MAbs confirmed that the alpha-subunits of Mo 1 (155 kD) and LFA 1 (177 kD) and their common beta-subunit (94 kD) were totally deficient. Functional analyses of patient PMNs demonstrated severe impairment of adherence- and adhesion-dependent cell functions including spreading, aggregation, orientation in chemotactic gradients, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and phagocytosis of particles (Oil-Red- 0 -paraffin, zymosan) selectively opsonized with C 3 -derived ligands. Patient PMNs demonstrated a normal capacity to rosette with IgG or C 3 b-coated sheep erythrocytes, but rosette formation with C 3 bi-coated erythrocytes was profoundly diminished. Adhesion-independent functions including shape change, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl- 3 H-phenylalanine binding, and O- 2 generation or secretion elicited by soluble stimuli were normal. Membrane fluidity, surface charge, and microtubule assembly were also normal. These findings provide new evidence that critical PMN surface glycoproteins are required to facilitate multiple adhesion-dependent cellular functions of the inflammatory response...|$|E
