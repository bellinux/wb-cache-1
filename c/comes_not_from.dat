25|$|Critics of the Kuznets curve theory {{argue that}} its U-shape <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> {{progression}} {{in the development}} of individual countries, but rather from historical differences between countries. For instance, many of the middle income countries used in Kuznets' data set were in Latin America, a region with historically high levels of inequality. When controlling for this variable, the U-shape of the curve tends to disappear (e.g. Deininger and Squire, 1998). Regarding the empirical evidence, based on large panels of countries or time series approaches, Fields (2001) considers the Kuznets hypothesis refuted.|$|E

500|$|The {{only known}} {{credit for the}} film is that it starred William Garwood. Film historian, Q. David Bowers notes that the plot dealing with circumstantial {{evidence}} focused on one of Lloyd Lonergan's social issues. Lonergan would produce several scenarios featuring the problems with circumstantial evidence being used to obtain convictions. Bowers notes that such convictions were a known social issue, but not a pressing one in 1911. The first such Thanhouser film to tackle the subject was Love and Law released in December 1910. Love and Law was a film which garnered some criticism for an improbable plot. Checkmate wove a more tangled web of circumstantial evidence and intrigue and the resolution <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> an astute female detective, but by the heiress's novel substitution of a doppelgänger to the prison so that the original can get the needed confession. The serious nature of the film was highlighted with the advertising of the film by Thanhouser which states, [...] "Checkmate carries a message and a lesson to those who value the 'circumstantial evidence' process by which so many convictions are obtained in our criminal courts. The reel demonstrates how easily evidence of this sort may be made to entangle and ensnare a totally innocent man..." ...|$|E

Japanese manga critic Kaoru Nagayama has noted that the manga is [...] "fun to read" [...] and commended Arakawa for keeping Jesus and Buddha faithful to their real character—of kindness—even when confronted by evil. Carlo Santos from Anime News Network criticized it for its art and questioned its capacity to evolve into something other than [...] "Jesus and Buddha hanging out, while normal people do embarrassing things to them". Santos complained that Jesus' and Buddha's philosophical differences and personalities are not explored. However, Santos praised the series' comedy, noting its simplicity and saying, [...] "its brilliance <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> purposely trivializing two of the world's great religions, but by highlighting the quirks of the secular world when these famous religious figures are placed in it". According to him, the series does not lose its capacity of making readers laugh as it progresses, unlike other manga. Jolyon Baraka Thomas of The Guardian praised the constancy of [...] "visual gags and puns", and wrote: [...] "Her story is not an introduction to abstruse religious doctrines, nor does it feature much overt commentary on the role of religions in contemporary society." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his role}} as manager, Zimmer took over a team that had {{finished}} in seventh place in 1902. [...] By the first of June 1903, the Phillies were struggling with an 11-26 record. Zimmer at that time acknowledged that the [...] "task of managing a team that does not stand so well up in the race {{is not the most}} pleasant one in the world", but he insisted that he was not discouraged and noted that the greater satisfaction <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> taking charge of a first-class team and keeping it going, but [...] "to take hold of a team that is down in the race and bring it up to a high standard." [...] The Phillies did improve late in the season, compiling a 16-13 record in their last 29 games. However, with a seventh-place finish, the 1903 season was Zimmer's only one as a Major League manager. [...] In fairness to Zimmer, the Phillies simply lacked the talent to compete with the best teams in the National League, had finished in seventh place in 1902 under Bill Shettsline, and dropped to eighth place in 1904 under Hugh Duffy.|$|E

During the 2011 presidential election, Ho Kwon Ping suggested that while the President's [...] "hard powers" [...] are his constitutional duties, he also exercises soft power which manifests in three domains. At the private level, the President may consult the Prime Minister on certain issues; at the bureaucratic level, the President may take an [...] "activist, inquisitive" [...] role towards civil servants; and most contentiously, in the public domain, {{it is up to}} the people (whose mandate confers such soft powers upon the elected President) to decide how much of a voice the President should have. Ho later clarified his stance, explaining his point was that [...] "by virtue of being directly elected, the Elected President (EP) will possess the popular mandate to speak out on issues, so long as they are not politically partisan views".

[...] Slant Magazine reviewer Jonathan Keefe also gave it a three-and-a-half star out of five and said: [...] "Instead, by revealing some carefully chosen, deeply personal details and by building elaborate façades {{for the sake of}} drama, Jones has crafted her headiest, most complex album to date." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian criticized the album and gave it a three-star-out-of-five, saying: [...] "Mostly, though, Little Broken Hearts finds an effective way to grab the listener by the lapels: with kid gloves." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent was very positive about the album, remarking: [...] "There's always an ingenious, often unexpected, connection linking the music to the mood of a specific song," [...] and gave it a four-out-of-five-star. However, Nick Coleman of The Independent on Sunday was more critical about the record, saying Jones' [...] "strength as a singer <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> the power of her voice but the detail of her phrasing" [...] and gave it a three-star-out-of-five rating, labelling the album [...] "dull". The Daily Telegraph writer Helen Brown was positive on the album, giving it four-out-of-five stars and wrote: [...] "In the past decade, it seems Jones has made a sneaky transition from dinner party backdrop to David Lynch soundtrack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} (ESI) is {{a technique}} that involves using high voltages to create an electrospray, or a fine aerosol created by the high voltages. ESI sample preparation can be very important {{and the quality of}} results can be heavily determined by the characteristics of the sample. ESI experiments can be run on-line or off-line. In on-line measurements the mass spectrometer is connected to a liquid chromatograph and as the samples are separated they are ionized into the mass spectrometer by the ESI system; sample preparation is actually performed before the LC separation. In off-line measurements, the analyte solution is applied directly to the mass spectrometer by a spray capillary [...] Off-line sample preparation has many considerations, such as the fact that the capillary used allows for the application of volumes in the nanoliter range, which can contain a concentration too small for analysis of many compounds, such as proteins. An additional problem can be loss of ESI signal due to interference between the analyte sample and background components. Unfortunately, {{it has been shown that}} sample preparation itself can only slightly alleviate this problem which is due more to the nature of the analyte itself than the preparation. In ESI the principle problem <b>comes</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> reactions in the gas phase but rather from problems involving the solution phase of the droplets themselves. Issues can be due to non-volatile substances remaining in the drops, which can change the efficiency of droplet formation or droplet evaporation, which in turn affects the amount of charged ions in the gas phase that ultimately reach the mass spectrometer. These problems can be fixed in multiple ways, including increasing the amount of concentration of analyte compared to matrix in the sample solution or by running the sample through a more extensive chromatographic technique before analysis. An example of a chromatographic technique that can aid in signal in ESI involves using 2-D liquid chromatography, or running the sample through two separate chromatography columns, giving better separation of the analyte from the matrix.|$|E
