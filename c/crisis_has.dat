40|$|The {{costs of}} wars {{have been the}} main driver of public debt in the Western World during the modern era. The late twentieth century stands out as a period that saw a {{pronounced}} increase of government debt to GDP ratios in peacetime. This paper assesses the role that financial <b>crises</b> <b>have</b> played in shaping the public debt trajectory in the twentieth century. Focusing on the experiences of 14 industrial economies, I show that financial <b>crises</b> <b>have</b> long and lasting effects on public finances. I provide evidence {{that the costs of}} financial <b>crises</b> <b>have</b> increased strongly {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century and that the costs of financial crises grow with the size of the financial sector. In many countries, the rising costs incurred from stabilizing the economy after financial crises were an important cause of the peacetime surge of public debt ratios in the late twentieth century. In today's highly financialized economies, financial <b>crises</b> <b>have</b> become a key risk for public finances...|$|R

After Bainimarama declared martial law and resolved the crisis by force, an interim government was sworn in, headed by current prime minister Laisenia Qarase.

40|$|Research on {{organizational}} <b>crises</b> <b>has</b> typically {{focused on}} case studies or measures for crisis prevention, while the social dimension of <b>crises</b> <b>has</b> remained largely unexplored.

However, the mechanisms behind these differences remain unclear. This paper aims to fill this gap by arguing that organizational crises and effective reactions are linked by different dimensions of legitimacy perceived by stakeholders. To this end, after elaborating on the role of legitimacy in organizational crises, typologies of crises as well as reactive strategies are presented, accompanied by propositions about possible links. 1 SCHUMPETER DISCUSSION PAPERS 2009 - 00...|$|R

25|$|Most {{people with}} sickle-cell disease have {{intensely}} painful episodes called vaso-occlusive crises. However, the frequency, severity, {{and duration of}} these crises vary tremendously. Painful crises are treated symptomatically with pain medications; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the <b>crisis</b> <b>has</b> settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on NSAIDs (such as diclofenac or naproxen). For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices are commonly used in this setting. Diphenhydramine is also an effective agent that doctors frequently prescribe to help control itching {{associated with the use}} of opioids.|$|E

25|$|The Syrian <b>crisis</b> <b>has</b> {{significantly}} affected Lebanese {{economic and financial}} situation. The demographic pressure imposed by the Syrian refugees now living in Lebanon has led to competition in the labour market. As a direct consequence unemployment has doubled in three years, reaching 20% in 2014. A loss of 14% of wages regarding the salary of less-skilled workers has also been registered. The financial constraints were also felt: the poverty rate increased with 170.000 Lebanese falling under the poverty threshold. In the period between 2012 and 2014, the public spending increased by $1 billion and losses amounted to $7.5 billion. Expenditures related only to the Syrian refugees were estimated by the Central Bank of Lebanon as $4.5 billion every year.|$|E
25|$|The vaso-occlusive {{crisis is}} caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells that obstruct {{capillaries}} and restrict blood flow to an organ resulting in ischaemia, pain, necrosis, and often organ damage. The frequency, severity, and duration of these crises vary considerably. Painful crises are treated with hydration, analgesics, and blood transfusion; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the <b>crisis</b> <b>has</b> settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac or naproxen. For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; patient-controlled analgesia devices are commonly used in this setting. Vaso-occlusive crisis involving organs such as the penis or lungs are considered an emergency and treated with red-blood cell transfusions. Incentive spirometry, a technique to encourage deep breathing to minimise the development of atelectasis, is recommended.|$|E
25|$|Poverty and {{inequality}} are significant social problems that Portugal {{has attempted to}} address VIA various social policy measures. The European economic <b>crisis</b> <b>has</b> {{increased the number of}} households that remain below the poverty line in Portugal with the greatest affected being the youth due to high unemployment rates. The current economic crisis experienced across the globe {{is the leading cause of}} income inequalities which lead to poor market demand in an economy and lower economic growth in Portugal. The minimum wage policy is aimed at reducing abject poverty and income inequalities in Portugal which will increase demand and lead to economic stability in the long-term. In 2014 after a four-year freeze Portugal increased their minimum wage by 4%. The minimum wage policy which came after negotiations with labor organizations and employers was only possible after substantial recovery of the economy and will increase the sustainability of the economy with aims at reducing poverty.|$|E

In 1995, Corporación Deportiva América was placed under watch by Executive Order 12978, commonly known in Colombia as the Clinton List. Because of its past connections with drug cartels, the United States froze the team's assets in the U.S. (valued around $1million), and ordered other companies not to conduct direct business with América. Also, according to club president Carlos Puente, the club never received the prize money of $200,000 from the Copa Merconorte championship. Since then, América's economic <b>crisis</b> <b>has</b> been severe. At one point in time, it was immersed in nearly $10million worth of debt. América had survived {{the past few years}} without a major sponsor, depending mostly on ticket sales for attendance at the Pascual Guerrero and the sales of soccer jerseys. The monthly salaries of its players has been below league average and América has seen itself forced to make money by selling its most recognized players.|$|E

Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite, 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used {{in the production of}} tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves. Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.

Plans have been in place since 2004 to construct a second town centre shopping centre, originally called 'The Oval'. By the time a sufficient number of tenants had signed up to begin construction, the effects of the financial crisis cast doubts over the project. In early 2011 fresh plans were released for a considerably smaller scheme involving a cluster of retail units. The site is now earmarked for a cinema and restaurants and is due to open in 2016 As well as Woolworths, the financial <b>crisis</b> <b>has</b> also led to the closure of several other shops in the last few years, including T J Hughes, Miss Selfridge, and HMV but has gained new high street names in large retail units including Next and River Island.
