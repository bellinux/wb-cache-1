5|$|They {{team up with}} a {{group called}} the Sweeper Alliance to storm the Apostles of the Stars' island, {{organized}} by Chronos assassin Lin Shaolee in disguise to act as decoys for Chronos' own attack. Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of the Apostles, while Chronos, who landed after them, get to Creed first. Sephiria Arks faces off against Creed, but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with Creed. Creed has obtained immortality, although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaired</b> like the rest of his body. Train defeats Creed using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines to take those that give Creed immortality out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow Creed to walk away, and the survivors of the Apostles of the Stars are shown on the run or hiding.|$|E

5|$|In naval battles, players {{control a}} fleet of up to twenty varied ships, and use 18th-century tactics to {{overcome}} enemy fleets. As with army units, each ship's crew has a set amount of morale that changes as a battle progresses; a crew may attempt to withdraw their vessel from the battle if their morale is broken, or in extreme cases may surrender. A battle is won when all hostile ships have been sunk, captured, or have left the map. Individual ships can be maneuvered, or remain in formation with other ships from the fleet. Players can designate which parts of a hostile ship they want a crew to target, making ships prone to sustaining authentic damage during a battle: masts can be toppled, sails and gun ports can be destroyed and damage can entirely disable a ship's ability to manoeuvre or eventually sink it. The types of ammunition can be used during a battle are grapeshot, chain-shot and round shot, which have different uses, from killing enemy crew to disabling enemy movement. As battles progress, crews can try to board enemy vessels and fight hand-to-hand {{in an attempt to}} capture the ship. The weather in a naval battle is also important; bad weather can create poor visibility. Ships <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaired</b> in mid-battle unlike its successor, , but fires on board ships can be put out automatically.|$|E

25|$|Although fully mineralized and {{containing}} no water—and {{therefore not}} subject to dehydration and subsequent crazing as seen in opal—ammolite is often damaged due to environmental exposure.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Many {{different}} prosthetic {{materials have}} <b>been</b> used for <b>repair</b> of large posterolateral {{congenital diaphragmatic hernia}}s, which <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> primarily <b>repaired.</b> Almost 50 % of patch repaired diaphragmatic hernias will recur. The ideal prosthetic material for congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair {{has yet to be}} established. We report on two cases with unusual (calcification) and late complications related to the prosthetic material used for diaphragmatic hernia repair. Case presentation We report two cases of antenatally diagnosed left-sided diaphragmatic hernia that <b>were</b> <b>repaired</b> with a patch due to total absence of a diaphragm. Both Caucasian patients developed recurrent late graft complications. Case one <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> on day 17 post-stabilisation and developed recurrence at 14 ½ months of age and again at 26 months of age. Case 2 underwent surgery on day 13 of life and developed recurrence at 4 months and again at 3 years of age. In the recurrent repairs, both synthetic and biomaterial patches were used. Both patients are well at long-term follow-up of 10 and 7 years, respectively. Conclusion The ideal choice of patch material for diaphragmatic hernia repair remains a therapeutic challenge. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} not {{intended}} to replace safety critical warnings such as an aircraft's flight management system but instead to complement them and perhaps also leverage existing sensors for assistance with system health monitoring. Ideal systems to monitor are those systems, subsystems & structural elements which are likely to show graceful degradation so that they can <b>be</b> <b>repaired</b> or replaced at a convenient time prior to failure. This gives a saving over condition based maintenance as once a part has failed often a vehicle <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> used until <b>repaired.</b> This often results in scheduling difficulties if the vehicle fails when it was needed for revenue generation and <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> used. In contrast IVHM can be used to replace the part during vehicle downtime prior to failure. This ensures that it can continue to generate revenue as scheduled.|$|R
2500|$|Since 5 November, {{there has}} been a {{shortage}} of chlorine for water treatment due to Israeli blockades, increasing the risk of outbreak of water diseases. On 27 December, Israeli airstrikes extensively damaged two water wells, rendering a population of 30,000 Palestinians without water. On 2 January, airstrikes in the al-Mughraqa area damaged a main drinking water pipe, cutting off water supplies to 30,000 people in the Nuseirat Camp. The UN sums the situation that as of 2 January, 250,000 people in Gaza City and northern Gaza are without water supply; seven water wells were seriously damaged and <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaired</b> due to bombardments. As of 4 January, and as reported by the Palestinian Coastal Municipality Water Utility (CMWU) throughout the UN reports, 70% of the Gaza strip 1.5 million population have no access to water, in particular in Gaza City and northern Gaza. As of 6 January, 800,000 Palestinians have no access to water, and those who still enjoy water access face problems in purifying such water as well as risking additional danger of contamination due to waste water leakage. This situation lasts in the third week of the attacks where 500,000 Palestinians still have no access to running water, another 500,000 receive water for four to six hours only every five to seven days, and the rest receive water for four to six hours every two or three days. Five days after the unilateral lull, one fifth of the Gaza strip 1.5 million population has no direct access to drinking water and currently depends on water purchased from private suppliers. As of [...] 26, 8 January days after the unilateral ceasefire, at least 70% of the water system is functioning, although {{this does not mean that}} everyone is receiving water due to localized damage. By 5 February, a month and 8 days since the beginning of the Israeli attacks, the CMWU reports that 50 percent of Gaza's 1.5 million population receives running water for 6–8 hours every second day; 30 percent of the population receives running water every third day; and ten percent of the population receives water every five days. Ten percent of the population does not receive running water and depends on tankered water. As of 9 February, the CMWU reports that 50,000 people do not have access to water and an additional 150,000-200,000 receive water every 5 or 6 days. According to the World Health Organization guidelines, 80% of drinking water in Gaza is not currently safe for human consumption. In light of the poor quality of water, the Ministry of Health and the UNICEF has stated concerns about the increased risk of diarrhea and other water-borne diseases in infants.|$|E

40|$|Key {{properties}} of organic coatings, such as mechanical strength and solvent resistance, are {{greatly influenced by}} {{the structure of the}} polymeric binder. In general, a 3 -dimensional polymeric network gives the best properties and therefore most performance coatings have a 3 -dimensional network structure. However, 3 -dimensional networks <b>cannot</b> easily <b>be</b> <b>repaired.</b> Through molecular design in combination with different synthetic routes, a series of new building blocks has been prepared that render conventional coating types thermally remendable. Damage can <b>be</b> <b>repaired</b> through thermally reversible cross-linking of the coating through reversible bond scission within these specially designed building blocks. At room temperature, a fully cross-linked network is present, whereas at elevated temperatures the cross-link density becomes much lower and the system becomes mouldable or low viscous. This self-healing concept was proven by various techniques. Both the thermal reversibility window and the final coating properties can be tuned by careful design of the system. © 2008 Elsevier B. V.
