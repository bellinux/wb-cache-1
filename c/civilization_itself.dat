5|$|The second Persian {{invasion}} of Greece was {{an event of}} major significance in European history. A large number of historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture {{that lies at the}} basis of Western civilization would have never developed (and by extension Western <b>civilization</b> <b>itself).</b> While this may be an exaggeration, it is clear that even at the time the Greeks understood that something very significant had happened.|$|E
25|$|Warner {{asserts that}} social class {{is as old}} as <b>civilization</b> <b>itself</b> and has been present in nearly every society from before the Roman Empire, through medieval times, and to the modern-day United States. He {{believes}} that complex societies such as the United States need an equally complex social hierarchy.|$|E

50|$|In 2086, <b>civilization</b> destroys <b>itself</b> in {{a nuclear}} Armageddon, as two factions who both develop an {{anti-radiation}} battlesuit completely immune to conventional weapons go to war against each other when diplomatic peace talks break down. In the following millennia, the survivors develop into a hardy but peaceful race, living a quiet agricultural existence.|$|R
25|$|The Renaissance was {{inspired}} by the growth in study of Latin and Greek texts and the admiration of the Greco-Roman era as a golden age. This prompted many artists and writers to begin drawing from Roman and Greek examples for their works, but there was also much innovation in this period, especially by multi-faceted artists such as Leonardo da Vinci. The Humanists saw their repossession of a great past as a Renaissance—a rebirth of <b>civilization</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{fear of the}} world's end {{is about}} as old as <b>civilization</b> <b>itself.</b> In a 1967 study Frank Kermode {{suggests}} that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Scientific and critical thought supplanting religious and mythical thought {{as well as a}} public emancipation may be the cause of eschatology becoming replaced by more realistic scenarios. Such might constructively provoke discussion and steps to be taken to prevent depicted catastrophes.|$|E
25|$|With the {{adoption}} of such tenets came a succession of Symbolist poems, where {{the focus is on}} minutely-observed objects, usually items of luxury, partly reflecting themes he had explored in the Naturalist stage. Commenting on them, Tudor Vianu argues that no such works had ever been produced in Romanian literature up until that moment. In his Ospățul lui Pentaur ("The Feast of Pentaur"), the poet reflected on <b>civilization</b> <b>itself,</b> as reflected in inanimate opulence. The motif was also developed in descriptive prose fragments later grouped in Cartea de aur, collectively titled nuvele fără oameni ("novellas without people") and compared by Călinescu with the paintings of Theodor Aman.|$|E
50|$|This {{strategy}} had not succeeded, and {{the clouds}} had attacked the alien populations and the Monuments. The clouds had even hit the Monument-Makers themselves, throwing their society into a technological dark age - the space station and ruined buildings at Beta Pacifica were the remnants of their second, lesser <b>civilization,</b> which <b>itself</b> was nearly annihilated when the cycle repeated on its 8,000-year timescale.|$|R

60|$|<b>Civilization</b> imparts <b>itself</b> by {{some such}} means, {{and the lower}} classes are clothed in the cast conduct of the upper, which {{if it had been}} stored would have left the inferiors rude and barbarous.

25|$|Cereal crops {{were first}} domesticated around 9000 BCE in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. The first domesticated crops were {{generally}} annuals with large seeds or fruits. These included pulses such as peas and grains such as wheat. The Middle East was especially suited to these species; the dry-summer climate was {{conducive to the}} evolution of large-seeded annual plants, and the variety of elevations led to a great variety of species. As domestication took place humans began to move from a hunter-gatherer society to a settled agricultural society. This change would eventually lead, some 4000 to 5000 years later, to the first city states and eventually the rise of <b>civilization</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|Petroleum {{is vital}} to many industries, and is of {{importance}} {{to the maintenance of}} industrialized <b>civilization</b> <b>itself,</b> and thus is a critical concern to many nations. Oil accounts for {{a large percentage of the}} world's energy consumption, ranging from a low of 32 percent for Europe and Asia, up to a high of 53 percent for the Middle East, South and Central America (44%), Africa (41%), and North America (40%). The world at large consumes 30 billion barrels (4.8km³) of oil per year, and the top oil consumers largely consist of developed nations. In fact, 24 percent of the oil consumed in 2004 went to the United States alone, though by 2007 this had dropped to 21 percent of world oil consumed.|$|E
25|$|In Australian parlance, 'the bush' {{includes}} not only all remote and rural areas, but ways of living there, especially the limitations and hardships endured. Even though remote areas in contemporary Australia are easily reachable by air and modern communications, there remains a mythology of the tyranny of distance: tyranny over comfort, sophistication, over <b>civilization</b> <b>itself.</b> The expression bush carpentry includes two criteria of 'remoteness'. The first, that the builder is separated (by lack of formal training) from regular methods of construction. The second, separation (by physical distance) from regular resources such as milled timber, fasteners, specialized tools, and similar manufactured products. Those in both 'remote' circumstances are forced to invent and improvise. They produce a necessary structure or object via unorthodox procedures, {{and it will be}} serviceable, if inelegant in appearance.|$|E

3000|$|The idea of {{coevolution}} means, however, {{that social}} systems and biophysical systems have different {{and at least}} partially independent operating methods. Here, even more radical perspectives exist, {{such as the one}} represented by Jason Moore (2015) concept of oikeios, which refers to the innate unity of human and natural factors, so that no <b>civilization</b> restricts <b>itself</b> to [...] "interacting" [...] with nature, but develops [...] "through nature-as-matrix" [...] (Moore 2015, p. 127).|$|R

25|$|At {{the centre}} of all Nambassa festivals lay the village marketplaces. These {{consisted}} of dozens of hand craft outlets and health food eateries. Here the hustle and bustle, the exuberant colour and relaxed atmosphere, prevalent at the various Nambassa village marketplaces, was a feature. These centers of community are where one found the main information centre or where folks simply culminated just to absorb the diverse quirky celebratory ambiance. Over the various festivals the marketplaces evolved and became major attractions in themselves. Not only a space for the enjoyment of bartering for the various eclective products and oddities, but they were a place of fun and entertainment, spontaneous or otherwise. The idea of a marketplace servicing the local population, {{as a method of}} doing business, buying, selling and exchanging products, is as old as <b>civilization</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E

[...] In Hochman's interpretation, [...] "The plays {{are not so}} much about the centrality of violence in American life as about the discords at the heart of <b>civilization</b> <b>itself.</b> As a trilogy, the plays examine the bond between the powers that oppress and the powers that seek to overthrow them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the game}} was [...] "carefully {{constructed}} to be fun and factual", {{in some cases the}} historical accuracy was sidestepped in favor of ease of gameplay, creating fun puzzles, and increasing visual clarity. Uniquely, the siege in Case 5 is entirely fictional and {{is a direct result of}} Carmen's crook stealing the Domesday Book, resulting in a perceived weakness in William's leadership and a rebellion to overthrow him. In addition, while efforts were made to convey historically accurate scenarios, they could only do so based on the available evidence which they sometimes extrapolated from. In situations where the truth is unknown, certain viewpoints were chosen. For example, while there is no evidence that Hatshepsut wore a false beard. She is often depicted wearing one in statues and hieroglyphs and the game's designers decided to include this [...] "intriguing, if debatable, element". Often, the designers created simplified versions of long and complex concepts in order to reduce confusion and make cases shorter. Examples include the mummy-making process in Case 1, the feudal political system presented in Case 5, the sign language of the Plains and Rocky mountain regions in Case 15, and the Vostok rocket parts involved in Gagarin's spaceflight in Case 18. Also, modern titles were used in favour of contemporary ones in the case of pharaoh for Hatshepsut, [...] "Inca" [...] for the Incan <b>civilization</b> <b>itself,</b> and Edison for Thomas Alva Edison. Similarly, a choice was made for every character to speak English instead of using subtitles for the sake of simplicity, even in time periods or locations where English was unknown or was not the local language.|$|E
