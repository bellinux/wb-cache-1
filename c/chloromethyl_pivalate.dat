The intermediacy of such an ylide is demonstrated by representative alkene-forming reactions with <b>chloromethyl</b> <b>pivalate,</b> benzaldehyde and CD 3 OD, giving a Z -allylic pivalate, a conjugated E -allylic alcohol and a partially deuterated terminal alkene, respectively, in modest yields...|$|E

The reaction most likely proceeds via a 1, 6 -electrocyclic path and provides a convenient access to an important class of nitrogen heterocycles. Subsequent treatment of the mesityl derivative with <b>chloromethyl</b> <b>pivalate</b> and silver triflate led to the corresponding benzimidazolium salt. Peer reviewe...|$|E
