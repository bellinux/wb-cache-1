2500|$|The cuisine of Aix-les-Bains {{is typical}} of Savoy, based on {{products}} of the local soil and mountain meadows, essentially the Bauges. In addition to its famous fondue, there is the pleasing main course of potato doughnuts, and also , péla, tartiflette, diots, polenta and [...] For dessert, there are bugnes, <b>confiture</b> de lait and blueberry pie. Aix tables feature Savoy cheeses such as Abondance, Beaufort, the , , , , Reblochon, Abbaye de Tamié, Tomme de Savoie and still many others. However, {{the presence of the}} Lac du Bourget, and the rivers such as the Tillet and the Sierroz, offer a variety of freshwater fish, to Aix cooks, which make up good number of local dishes. The local trout, Arctic char and the vendace are pleasing to eat. Also fishing and frying pike delights the taste buds of the inhabitants of Aix-les-Bains. The surrounding forests and mountains of average altitude, such as Mont Revard, offer very popular produce. There are fungi, for instance, and the reputation of , boletes of Revard, continues unabated. Several vineyards around the Aix-les-Bains commune produce wines used in many specialities, such as Savoy fondue, by the use of white wine. Thus, the vineyards of Saint-Innocent and of Saint-Baldoph are found near Aix-les-Bains, and the area generally enjoys most of the wines of Savoy.|$|E

2500|$|Coffee {{had been}} {{introduced}} to Paris in 1644, and the first café opened in 1672, but the institution did not become successful until the opening of Café Procope in about 1689 in rue des Fossés-Saint-Germain, close to the Comédie-Française, which had just moved to that location. The café served coffee, tea, chocolate, liqueurs, ice cream and <b>confiture</b> in a luxurious setting. The Café Procope was frequented by Voltaire (when {{he was not in}} exile), Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Diderot and D’Alembert. Cafés became important centers for exchanging news, rumors and ideas, often more reliable than the newspapers of the day. In 1723 there were about 323 cafés in Paris; by 1790 there were more than 1,800. They were places for meeting friends, and for literary and political discussion. As Hurtaut and Magny wrote in their ‘’Dictionnaire de Paris’’ in 1779: [...] "One gets the news there, either by conversation, or by reading the newspapers. You don’t have to encounter anyone with bad morals, no loud persons, no soldiers, no domestics, no one who could trouble the tranquility of society." [...] Women rarely entered cafés, but women of the nobility sometimes stopped their carriages outside and were served inside the carriage with cups on silver platters. During the Revolution the cafés turned into centers of furious political discussion and activity, often led by members of the Revolutionary clubs.|$|E

6000|$|William had {{meanwhile}} come to Bonn with us, but was domiciled {{with another}} tutor, younger and fairer {{and more of}} the world, above all more ventilated and ventilating, Herr Stromberg, whose defect might in fact have seemed that, with his constant exhibition of the stamp received by him from the writings of Lord Macaulay, passages of which he could recite by heart, and the circumstance that his other pupil, William's comrade for a time, was of unmitigatedly English, that is of quasi-Byronic association, he didn't quite rise to the full gothic standard. Otherwise indeed our brother moved on the higher plane of light and air and ease, and above all of enjoyed society, that we felt he naturally must. Present to me yet is the thrill of learning from him that his English fellow-pupil was the grandson, if I remember rightly the degree of descent, of Mary Chaworth, Byron's [...] "first love," [...] and my sense afterwards, in gaping at young Mr. Musters himself, that this independently romantic contact would have been more to my own private purpose at least than the most emphasised gothicism. None the less do I regain it as a part of my current vision that Frau Stromberg, who was young and fair, wrote tragedies as well as made pancakes--which were served to each consumer double, a thick <b>confiture</b> within being the reason of this luxuriance, and being also a note beyond our experience in the Bonn-Gasse; and that with the printed five acts of a certain [...] "Cleopatra" [...] before me, read aloud in the first instance to her young inmates and by my brother passed on to me, I lost myself in the view of I scarce knew what old-world Germanic grace, positively, or little court-city practice of the theatre: these things so lived in the small thick pamphlet, [...] "grey paper with blunt type" [...] and bristling, to my discomfiture, with descriptive stage directions, vast dense bracketed tracts, gothic enough in all conscience, as to which I could already begin to wonder whether such reinforcements of presentation proved more for or against the true expressional essence of the matter; for or against, that is, there being nothing at all so dramatic, so chargeable with meaning and picture, as speech, of whatever sort, made perfect. Such speculations, I may parenthesise, might well have been fostered, and doubtless were, by an impression that I find commemorated in a few lines of a letter of my father's to a friend in America--he having brought us on to Bonn, introduced us to our respective caretakers and remained long enough to have had an evening at the theatre, to which we accompanied him. [...] "We had Ristori to play Mary Stuart for us last night--which was the vulture counterfeiting Jenny Wren. Every little while the hoarse exulting voice, the sanguinary beak, the lurid leer of menace, and the relentless talons looked forth from the feathery mass and sickened you with disgust. She would do Elizabeth better." [...] I recall the performance in every feature, as well as my absence of such reserves, though quite also the point to which I was impressed by the utterance of them; not that it didn't leave me at the same time free to feel that the heroine of history represented could scarce have been at all a dove-like, much less a wren-like person. She had indeed on Madame Ristori's showing prodigious resources of militant mobility--of what in fact would be called to-day mobilisation. Several years later on I was to see the actress play the same part in America; and then, if I am not mistaken, was to note scarce more than one point; the awful effect on any histrionic case, even on one so guardedly artful as hers, of having been dragged round the globe and forced home, so far as might be, to imperfect comprehensions. The big brush had come fairly to daub the canvas. Let the above, however, serve in particular to lead in as many examples of my father's singularly striking and personal habit of expression and weight of thought as these pages may find room for.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{concentrated}} products are obtained by removing a large quantity {{of water from}} the specific raw material, having as effect the reduction or even the interruption of the activity of biodegrading agents, because of the diminution in water activity. Concentration is a less energy-intensive process than dehydration, but in many cases, it cannot be applied to conserve a product, but it is associated to other procedures (pasteurization, thermal sterilization, packing in sterile spaces, ionization, etc). <b>Confitures</b> presented by the offer of the municipality of Iasi have specific features, depending on the producing unit, and we may identify some unprofitable aspects in terms of quality or the manner of conditioning and packing.

It recounted {{the life of a}} poet elected president of France, who went on to start a war. This work of fiction was the first indication of Charles Dantzig’s passion for literature and his ironic handling of posturing and comedy. His second novel, Nos vies hâtives (Grasset, 2001), was awarded the Prix Jean-Freustié and the Roger Nimier Prize. The third, Un film d'amour, was published in 2003. It was a choral novel with a scholarly structure that supposedly drew on a TV documentary on the death of a young film-maker by the name of Birbillaz. “At first, the reader takes this book - intelligent from the first line to the last - for a formalist whimsy, before grasping that it aims for a kind of totality, like all great books. It leaves behind its ostensible subject, the portrait of the absent figure, Birbillaz, to focus on his brother - his double, his mirror image - like something out of Robert Louis Stevenson: a failure in life, bitter, rotten to the core, who says no to everything, to the point of obstinacy and pain. No to love, to talent, to creativity, to goodness, to beauty. A “no!” that he shouts in people’s faces, to the very gates of Hell - and no doubt beyond.” (Jacques Drillon, Le Nouvel Observateur, October 16, 2003). Grasset published Charles Dantzig’s fourth novel, Je m'appelle François, in 2007.

Relationships between sensory and rheological data were studied. It was shown that the logarithm of apparent viscosity for a shear rate of 50 s- 1 is significantly correlated with the oral consistency. This result shows that an easy and quick rheological measurement can give a precise information of the oral consistency of the product.

Etienne et Sara, started out being the last in a series of films whose project should have been resolved in a collation of multiple graphic and moving expressions, i. e. within the scope of what we commonly call the techniques of the animated film. However, following Pierre Hébert's meeting with the Belgian poet Serge Meurant, it became evident that it was more than just a film.

In it the author exhibits and lays claim to the origin of the film for the body, alive and feeling, of its maker, thereby questioning the ideological workings of the whole film making machinery and protocols.
