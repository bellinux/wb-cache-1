5|$|In particular, SR-11 was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{only the}} roadway south from Kanab, {{which had become}} US-89A in 1959.|$|E
5|$|However, by 1973, NY27 {{had been}} <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its {{interchange}} with the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn while unsigned I-478 {{was assigned to}} both the Battery Tunnel {{and all of the}} West Side Elevated Highway south of the Lincoln Tunnel. NY9A was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Lincoln Tunnel as a result. The extension of I-478 into Manhattan was eliminated following the collapse of part of the Elevated Highway in 1973, an event which led to the demolition of the highway south of 59th Street. Demolition was completed in 1989. NY9A was shifted onto 12th Avenue, one of the surface streets that the Elevated Highway had run atop of, but was otherwise unaffected as the route's south end was initially kept at the Lincoln Tunnel.|$|E
5|$|MBTA Commuter Rail {{service was}} {{extended}} west from Fitchburg to Gardner in January 1980, but trains {{did not make}} stops at Wachusett or other intermediate stations. Service was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Fitchburg {{at the end of}} 1986.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of {{the various}} names used for types of pruning, {{there are only two}} basic cuts: One <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> an {{intermediate}} point, called heading <b>back</b> <b>cut,</b> and the other <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> some point of origin, called thinning out cut.|$|R

5|$|A £40 million {{contract}} to build 27 Urbos 3 trams, sufficient for phase 1a and (unbuilt) 1b lines, {{was awarded to}} CAF. When the line was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> York Place, only 17 trams would be needed. An unsuccessful attempt was made in 2011 to lease ten trams to Transport for London for use on Tramlink.|$|E
5|$|After being {{banned in}} , in-season testing {{returned}} in 2012, with a test held at Mugello on 1 May {{ahead of the}} European leg of the 2012 championship. As teams were only be permitted to do fifteen days of testing {{over the course of}} the season, the pre-season winter testing schedule was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the Mugello test.|$|E
5|$|In December 1973, state {{subsidies}} for towns outside the MBTA funding district were halved, {{resulting in the}} MBTA needing to renegotiate subsidies from 14 municipalities. Ultimately Ayer, with just 14 daily commuters, refused to pay its $8200 bill in 1974; Littleton also did not reach an agreement. On March 1, 1975, the line was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> South Acton, dropping stops at Ayer, Littleton, and West Acton.|$|E

50|$|In the video, a girl {{is taking}} a bath while a boy knocks on her door with flowers. She opens the door, {{immediately}} rejects him, and walks into another room down the hall. The boy throws the flowers across the room angrily, and they land in the bathtub. The band is shown playing {{in the basement of}} the apartment complex, with water dripping on their instruments. The video <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the girl getting out of the bath. She proceeds to get dressed and go to sit in her room, where she looks at a picture of her and her boyfriend. It <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the band playing in the basement; rose petals are now falling on the instruments along with the water. When it <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the girl, the boy has just opened the door and is standing in the doorway. They make up, and the boy takes out a ring. The two kiss, and the water dripping into the basement recedes back into the bathtub.|$|R
5|$|In the 1920s, a non-electrified branch {{along the}} West Shore of Staten Island {{was built to}} haul {{materials}} to construct the Outerbridge Crossing, branching off of the main line south of Richmond Valley. The branch was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a point south of the bridge after the bridge was built. Afterwards, the branch served a scrapyard owned by the Roselli brothers. The branch still exists to Page Avenue, and the switch is kept working.|$|E
5|$|The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway from Fenchurch Street was {{extended}} from Barking to Upminster in 1885. The underground Whitechapel and Bow Railway opened in 1902 and allowed through {{services of the}} District Railway to operate to Upminster. The District converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> East Ham. Delayed by World War I, electrified tracks were extended by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to Upminster and through services resumed in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Due in {{no small}} part to the {{presence}} of the station, South Framingham eclipsed Framingham Center in size; on January 8, 1915, the station was renamed Framingham. Traffic on the B and its various branch lines, though, decreased after World War I. In 1919, Agricultural Branch trains were cut to Framingham, requiring a transfer to continue Boston or Mansfield. The line was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Marlborough in 1931, and passenger service ended in 1937. Passenger service on the Mansfield & Framingham ended in 1933. The Milford Branch lasted the longest of the Boston & Albany branch lines; it was cut to one daily trip in 1953 and terminated in April 1959.|$|E

50|$|The video {{opens with}} the band in a futuristic, but cheaply constructed, control room as they sing, dance and operate various controls. The band then watch {{themselves}} on a monitor screen as they walk down a rainy British high street dressed in incongruous, brightly coloured summer clothes. The video then <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the control room, this time {{with the band}} playing their instruments superimposed over it, before returning to more scenes of a British city in torrential rain as the band walk around in scuba diving gear. The video finally <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the band playing in a silver foil covered room, before superimposing them over a pile of random photographs.|$|R
50|$|Just as {{the couple}} {{are about to}} fall into each other's arms, Farquhar stiffens and his head snaps <b>back.</b> The scene <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his body hanging from the bridgehis escape {{revealed}} to be fantasy experienced {{in the moment of}} the drop.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, {{in order}} to add four {{additional}} Amtrak trips along the corridor, four of the then six round trips to New London were <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Old Saybrook. An agreement with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection limits service over the Old Saybrook-Old Lyme bridge {{in order to}} avoid inconveniencing recreational boaters. ConnDOT's agreement with Amtrak allowed commuters with monthly passes to ride certain Amtrak trains instead. After criticism over the service cuts, in April 2008 ConnDOT began allowing commuters with multi-ride passes to board the selected Amtrak trains as well.|$|E
5|$|MD 404 was {{designated}} by 1933 {{to run from}} Matapeake (where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis), east along present-day MD 8, US 50, and MD 662 to Wye Mills, where it followed its current routing to the Delaware border. By 1946, the route’s western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis, where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry. The western terminus was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Wye Mills in 1949, having been replaced by US 50 west of there. The route was realigned to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro in 1960 and Denton in 1987.|$|E
5|$|NY441 was {{originally}} routed on Penfield Road between Brighton and Penfield {{when it was}} assigned in 1949. It remained on Penfield Road through Penfield and into Wayne County to Marion, where the highway ended at NY21. The entirety of this routing had previously been part of NY33, which was truncated westward to downtown Rochester as part of NY441's assignment. NY441 was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> NY350 in Walworth by 1970. The divided highway that now carries NY441 through Brighton and western Penfield was constructed during the late 1960s and opened as a realignment of NY441 by 1971.|$|E

5000|$|Everyone {{then returns}} to Charlie Brown's house, and he {{declares}} {{that it was}} a reunion even if it wasn't the best. He then wonders how Snoopy's siblings are going to get home. Snoopy responds by getting into his World War I flying ace costume, and ushers them up on top of his doghouse (i.e. Sopwith Camel). The camera <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Charlie Brown, with several off-screen sound effects insinuating that Snoopy is flying his 'plane'. When the camera <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it, all his siblings have gone back home, and Snoopy is standing on the ground next to it, picking his teeth. Charlie Brown is shocked and wonders aloud how he could do that, to which Linus replies, [...] "Well, he's your dog, Charlie Brown".|$|R

5|$|Route 42 was {{originally}} designated in 1927 to {{run along the}} Black Horse Pike between Ferry Avenue in Camden and the present U.S. Route 40/U.S. Route 322 split in the McKee City section of Hamilton Township, Atlantic County. In 1953, the southern terminus was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its current terminus in the Williamstown section of Monroe Township to avoid the concurrency it shared with U.S. Route 322. After {{the completion of the}} NorthSouth Freeway between Bellmawr and Turnersville in 1959, Route 42 was moved to this freeway, and the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168.|$|E
5|$|The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway from Fenchurch Street and Barking was {{constructed}} through the Upminster Bridge area in 1885, with stations at Hornchurch and Upminster. The Whitechapel and Bow Railway opened in 1902 and allowed through {{services of the}} District Railway to operate to Upminster. The Metropolitan District converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> East Ham. Delayed by World War I, electrified tracks were extended by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to Upminster and through services resumed in 1932. The District Railway was incorporated into London Transport in 1933, and {{became known as the}} District line.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{northern}} terminus of NY420 was in {{the center}} of Massena at the junction of Orvis and Main Streets, where it ended at NY37. In the mid-1950s, construction began on a new alignment for NY37 around the southern edge of the village. The highway opened to traffic by 1958; however, NY420 continued to extend past the bypass into Massena until the early 1960s, when it was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its junction with NY37's new routing. The former routing of NY420 in Massena is still state-maintained as part of NY970B, an unsigned reference route designation for all of Main Street between NY37 and NY37B.|$|E

50|$|WCHL's 5,000-watt {{non-directional}} daytime signal <b>cuts</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> 1,000 watts directional {{toward the}} southeast at sunset. Even {{with all the}} changes in recent years, the station has continuously broadcast from its two-tower array on Franklin Street, noticeable for being emblazoned with metal call letters on one and frequency on the other.|$|R
5|$|The last OE {{service to}} this station {{operated}} on June 19, 1931, {{after the company}} requested, and received, permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon that section of route because of declining ridership and worsening traffic congestion. The service was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Front and Jefferson streets the following day, and OE moved its ticket office to that location. The tracks along 10th and Salmon streets were abandoned and soon removed. Just two years later, in May 1933, the Oregon Electric discontinued all its remaining passenger service, becoming exclusively a freight railroad.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} I-590 between Winton Road and the Can of Worms was {{originally}} {{constructed in the}} 1960s and designated as part of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue northward. In the late 1970s, I-590 was proposed as a designation for the entire southern half of the Outer Loop. Ultimately, it was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its current western terminus at the then-proposed I-390. I-590 was officially assigned in 1980 following the elimination of NY47, and the last segment of the freeway between Winton Road and I-390 was completed by the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} the current route between Whitesbog and Lakehurst {{became a part of}} pre-1927 Route 18 in 1923. In 1927, Route 40 was legislated to run from Camden to Lakewood; the termini were {{eventually}} moved to the Airport Circle in Pennsauken and the Laurelton Circle in Brick Township. Route 40 became Route 70 in 1953 in order to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 40; in addition, the western terminus was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its current location to avoid a concurrency with Route 38 and the eastern terminus was moved to the Brielle Circle, replacing a portion of Route 34 between the Laurelton Circle and the Brielle Circle.|$|E
