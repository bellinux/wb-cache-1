40|$|Abstract Background Traumatization in {{childhood}} {{can result in}} lifelong health impairment and may {{have a negative impact}} on other areas of life such as education, social contacts and employment as well. Despite the frequent occurrence of traumatization, which is reflected in a 14. 5 percent prevalence rate of severe child abuse and neglect, the economic burden of the consequences is hardly known. The objective of this prevalence-based cost-of-illness study is to show how impairment of the individual is reflected in economic trauma <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> borne by society as a whole in Germany and to compare the results with other countries’ costs. Methods From a societal perspective trauma <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> were estimated using a bottom-up approach. The literature-based prevalence rate includes emotional, physical and sexual abuse as well as physical and emotional neglect in Germany. Costs are derived from individual case scenarios of child endangerment presented in a German cost-benefit-analysis. A comparison with trauma <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> in Australia, Canada and the USA is based on purchasing power parity. Results The annual trauma <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> total to a margin of EUR 11. 1 billion for the lower bound and to EUR 29. 8 billion for the upper bound. This equals EUR 134. 84 and EUR 363. 58, respectively, per capita for the German population. These results conform to the ones obtained from cost studies conducted in Australia (lower bound) and Canada (upper bound), whereas the result for the United States is much lower. Conclusion Child abuse and neglect result in trauma <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> of economically relevant magnitude for the German society. Although the result is well in line with other countries’ costs, the general lack of data should be fought in order to enable more detailed future studies. Creating a reliable cost data basis in the first place can pave the way for long-term cost savings. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{determine}} and compare initial treatment costs of microsurgery, linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery, and gamma knife radiosurgery in meningioma patients. Additionally, the <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> in the first year after initial treatment were assessed. Cost analyses were performed at two neurosurgical departments in The Netherlands from the healthcare providers' perspective. A total of 59 patients were included, of whom 18 underwent microsurgery, 15 underwent LINAC radiosurgery, and 26 underwent gamma knife radiosurgery. A standardized microcosting methodology was employed to ensure that the identified cost differences would reflect only actual cost differences. Initial treatment costs, using equipment costs per fraction, were € 12, 288 for microsurgery, € 1, 547 for LINAC radiosurgery, and € 2, 412 for gamma knife radiosurgery. Higher initial treatment costs for microsurgery were predominantly due to inpatient stay (€ 5, 321) and indirect costs (€ 4, 350). LINAC and gamma knife radiosurgery were equally expensive when equipment was valued per treatment (€ 2, 198 and € 2, 412, respectively). <b>Follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> were slightly, but not significantly, higher for microsurgery compared with LINAC and gamma knife radiosurgery. Even though initial treatment costs were over five times higher for microsurgery compared with both radiosurgical treatments, our study gives indications that the relative cost difference may decrease when <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> occurring during the first year after initial treatment are incorporated.

MethodsThe records of 195 patients (EVAR, n = 55; OR, n = 140) who underwent elective aortic aneurysm repair between 1995 and 2004 were reviewed. Primary costing data were analyzed for 54 EVAR and 135 OR patients. Hospital costs were divided into preoperative, operative, and postoperative <b>costs.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> for EVAR patients were recorded, with a median follow-up time of 12 months. ResultsMean preoperative costs were slightly higher in the EVAR group (AU $ 961 /US $ 733 vs AU $ 869 /US $ 663; not significant). Operative costs were significantly higher in the EVAR group (AU $ 16, 124 /US $ 12, 297 vs AU $ 6077 /US $ 4635; P <. 001); this was entirely due to the increased cost of the endograft (AU $ 10, 181 /US $ 7, 765 for EVAR vs AU $ 476 /US $ 363 for OR). Postoperative costs were significantly reduced in the EVAR group (AU $ 4719 /US $ 3599 vs AU $ 11, 491 /US $ 8, 764; P <. 001). Total hospital costs were significantly greater in the EVAR group (AU $ 21, 804 /US $ 16, 631 vs AU $ 18, 437 /US $ 14, 063; P <. 001). The increase in total hospital costs was due to {{a significant difference in}} graft costs, which was not offset by reduced postoperative <b>costs.</b> The average <b>follow-up</b> <b>cost</b> per year after EVAR was AU $ 1316 /US $ 999. At 1 year of follow-up, EVAR remained significantly more expensive than OR (AU $ 23, 120 /US $ 17, 640 vs AU $ 18, 510 /US $ 14, 122; P <. 001); this cost discrepancy increased with a longer follow-up. ConclusionsEVAR results in significantly greater hospital costs compared with OR, despite reduced hospital and intensive care unit stays. The inclusion of <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> further increases the cost disparity between EVAR and OR. Because EVAR requires lifelong surveillance and has a high rate of reintervention, <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> must be included in any cost comparison of EVAR and OR.

40|$|Abstract Background Cardiovascular (CV) {{events are}} {{prevalent}} and expensive worldwide {{both in terms}} of direct medical costs {{at the time of the}} event and follow-up healthcare after the event. This study aims to determine initial and <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> for cardiovascular (CV) events in US managed care enrollees and to compare to healthcare costs for matched patients without CV events. Methods A 5. 5 -year retrospective matched cohort analysis of claims records for adult enrollees in ~ 90 US health plans. Patients hospitalized for first CV event were identified from a database containing a representative sample of the commercially-insured US population. The CV-event group (n = 29, 688) was matched to a control group with similar demographics but no claims for CV-related events. Endpoints were total direct medical costs for inpatient and outpatient services and pharmacy (paid insurance amount). Results Overall, mean initial inpatient costs were US dollars ($) 16, 981 per case (standard deviation [SD] = $ 20, 474), ranging from $ 6, 699 for a transient ischemic attack (mean length of stay [LOS] = 3. 7 days) to $ 56, 024 for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (mean LOS = 9. 2 days). Overall mean health-care cost during 1 -year follow-up was $ 16, 582 (SD = $ 34, 425), an excess of $ 13, 792 over the mean cost of matched controls. This difference in average costs between CV-event and matched-control subjects was $ 20, 862 and $ 26, 014 after two and three years of follow-up. Mean overall inpatient costs for second events were similar to those for first events ($ 17, 705 /case; SD = $ 22, 703).

40|$|Study objectives: The {{influence}} of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) on costs after lung transplantation was investigated {{by comparing the}} costs of patients with and without this condition. Design: <b>Follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> were prospectively investigated in a medical technology assessment of the Dutch Lung Transplant Program, {{in relation to the}} development of the BOS. First, average <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> per week per patient were compared between patients who did or did not develop BOS. Second, in the BOS group, these costs were compared before and after the onset of BOS. Setting: Dutch Lung Transplant Program, University Hospital of Groningen. Results: Data on 53 patients (37 patients without BOS and 16 with BOS) who underwent transplantation between November 1990 and April 1995 were available. The average follow-up time of these 53 patients was 1. 5 years. The <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> amounted to an average (in Dutch guilders [Dfl]) of 1, 774 /wk for non-BOS patients, compared to 3, 072 /wk for BOS patients (+ 73 %; p = 0. 002; one Dfl = 50 cents US currency). This difference in costs was largely accounted for by an increase in used health-care resources, in particular hospitalization and medication. For the BOS patients, the average costs per week before and after the onset of BOS were 1, 941 Dfl and 2, 422 Dfl, respectively. Conclusion: BOS is associated with substantial extra costs.

METHODS A simplified decision-analytic model based on TLR rates reported in the literature was applied to baseline and <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> associated with in-hospital patient treatment during 1 year of <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Costs</b> were expressed in Swiss Francs (sFr) and calculated per 100 patients treated. Budgets were analyzed in the context of current SwissDRG reimbursement figures and calculated from two different perspectives: a general budget on total treatment costs (third-party healthcare payer) as well as a budget focusing on the physician/facility provider perspective. RESULTS After 1 year, use of DEB was associated with substantially lower total inpatient treatment costs when compared with BA (sFr 861, 916 vs. sFr 951, 877) despite the need for a greater investment at baseline related to higher prices for DEBs. In the absence of dedicated reimbursement incentives, however, use of DEB was shown to be the financially less favorable treatment approach from the physician/facility provider perspective (12 -month total earnings: sFr 179, 238 vs. sFr 333, 678). CONCLUSION Use of DEBs may be cost-effective through prevention of TLR at 1 year of follow-up.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stroke occurs {{concurrently}} with {{myocardial infarction}} (MI) in approximately 30 000 US patients each year. This number {{is expected to}} rise with the increasing use of thrombolytic therapy for MI. However, no data exist for the economic effect of stroke in the setting of acute MI (AMI). The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the effect of stroke on medical resource use and costs in AMI patients in the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: Medical resource use and cost data were prospectively collected for 2566 randomly selected US GUSTO I patients (from 23 105 patients) and for the 321 US GUSTO I patients who developed non-bypass surgery-related stroke during the baseline hospitalization. Follow-up was for 1 year. All costs are expressed in 1993 US dollars. During the baseline hospitalization, stroke was associated with a reduction in cardiac procedure rates and an increase in length of stay, despite a hospital mortality rate of 37 %. Together with stroke-related procedural costs of $ 2220 per patient, the baseline medical costs increased by 44 % ($ 29 242 versus $ 20 301, P< 0. 0001). <b>Follow-up</b> medical <b>costs</b> were substantially higher for stroke survivors ($ 22 400 versus $ 5282, P< 0. 0001), dominated by the cost of institutional care. The main determinant for institutional care was discharge disability status. The cumulative 1 -year medical costs for stroke patients were $ 15 092 higher than for no-stroke patients. Hemorrhagic stroke patients had a much higher hospital mortality rate than non-hemorrhagic stroke patients (53 % versus 15 %, P< 0. 001), which was associated with approximately $ 7200 lower mean baseline hospitalization cost. At discharge, hemorrhagic stroke patients {{were more likely to be}} disabled (68 % versus 46 %, P= 0. 002).

The costs of a 12 -month follow-up from index bleeding admission were calculated [...] the actual <b>cost</b> of <b>follow-up</b> and rebleeding in this cohort was compared with the theoretical 12 -month <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> of instead inserting an early TIPS at index admission. Our findings were subjected to a sensitivity analysis to assess the cost effectiveness of early TIPS insertion compared with standard care. Results: In 2009, 78 patients were admitted to our units with variceal haemorrhage; 27 patients (35...|$|R
50|$|There are {{indirect}} {{and direct}} {{costs associated with}} needlestick injuries. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that requiring hospitals to use safety-engineered needles would result in substantial savings due to the reduction in needlestick injuries requiring treatment. Costs of needlestick injuries include prophylaxis, wages and time lost by workers, quality of life, emotional distress, costs associated with drug toxicity, organizational liability, mortality, quality of patient care, and workforce reduction. Testing and follow-up treatment for healthcare workers who experienced a needlestick injury was estimated at $5,000 in the year 2000, depending upon the medical treatment provided. The American Hospital Association found that a case of infection by blood-borne pathogens could cost $1 million for testing, follow-up, and disability payments. An estimated $1 billion annually is saved by preventing needlestick injuries among healthcare workers in the US, including fees associated with testing, laboratory work, counseling, and <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Part 10 : PLM Virtual and Simulation EnvironmentsInternational audienceWhen {{products}} are developed in 3 D for the engineering applications, {{the data is}} initially stored in the native format of the used CAD software. If this 3 D CAD data is to {{be made available to}} people who do not have this software, neutral 3 D formats are needed. For visualization of product data in the engineering field - regardless of native CAD formats – various 3 D formats are available. Among these are disclosed or standardized formats like PDF from Adobe, JT and also X 3 D, Collada and STEP. The choice of a format has many implications, including the options available for using the data and the resulting <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs.</b> This paper illustrates an overview of the state of development, the committees’ activities, of current practical examples and gives an outlook for future developments too. The record is completed by examples from the industrial practice in the automotive industry...|$|R
40|$|Despite an {{expanding}} number of centres which provide lung transplantation, {{information about the}} incremental costs of lung transplantation is scarce. From 1991 until 1995, in The Netherlands a technology assessment was performed which provided information about the incremental costs of lung transplantation. Costs in the situation with and without a transplantation programme were compared from a Lifetime perspective. Because randomization was ethically inadmissible, only costs in the situation with the programme were observed. Both conventional treatment costs and costs of the transplantation programme were registered. Costs in the situation without the programme {{were based on the}} conventional treatment costs in the situation with the programme. Due to the study period of four years, long term <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> were estimated. The total incremental costs per transplanted patient were estimated at Dfl 466 767 (5 % discounted costs). The main part of these costs was caused by the high costs during the Lifetime follow-up of the patients. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The future {{consequences}} {{of climate change}} are highly uncertain. Today, the exact size of possible future damages are widely unknown. Governments try to cope with these risks by investing in mitigation and adaptation measures. Mitigation aims at a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions whereas adaptation reduces the <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> of climate change. In contrast to the existing literature, we explicitly model the decision of risk-averse governments on mitigation and adaptation policies. Furthermore we also consider {{the interaction of the}} two strategies. Mitigation efforts of a single country trigger crowding out as other countries will reduce their mitigation efforts. We show that, under fairly mild conditions, a unilateral increase in mitigation efforts of a single country can even increase global emissions. In contrast, a unilateral commitment to large adaptation efforts benefits the single country and may reduce the global risk from climate change {{at the expense of other}} countries. climate change, adaptation, mitigation, risk-taking...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{describe}} the economic outcomes from a prospective multicenter registry of primary coronary angioplasty. BackgroundInterest in coronary angioplasty without preceding thrombolytic therapy as a primary reperfusion strategy has increased {{as a result of}} three recent randomized trials showing outcomes equivalent to or better than standard thrombolytic therapy. MethodsThe Primary Angioplasty Registry enrolled 270 patients with acute myocardial infarction at six private tertiary care medical centers. Baseline and <b>follow-up</b> medical <b>costs</b> and counts of resources consumed were collected from enrollment to the 6 -month follow-up visit. Correlates and predictors of cost were identified with multivariable linear regression modeling. ResultsNinety-five percent of patients had a revascularization procedure during the baseline hospital period: 85 % had coronary angioplasty only; 4 % had coronary bypass surgery only; 6 % had both procedures. The total mean baseline hospital cost (not charge) was $ 13, 113, with mean physician fees of $ 5, 694. During the follow-up period, repeat coronary angiography was performed in 21 % of patients, whereas 13 % had repeat angioplasty and 3 % bypass surgery. Mean hospital <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> were $ 3, 174, with mean physician fees of $ 1, 443. Independent correlates of higher baseline hospital costs included older age (p = 0. 049), anterior infarction (p = 0. 03), initial Killip class (p < 0. 0001), more severe coronary disease (p = 0. 0015), need for bypass surgery alone or in addition to angioplasty (p < 0. 0001) and recurrent ischemia (p < 0. 0001). ConclusionsCosts of primary angioplasty for patients with acute myocardial infarction eligible for thrombolysis were strongly influenced by infarction- and procedure-related complications but only modestly influenced by patient selection factors...|$|R
40|$|According {{to recent}} guidelines, oral dabigatran etexilate is {{indicated}} for stroke and systemic embolism prevention {{in patients with}} atrial fibrillation (AF). Aim. Based on the RE-LY study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate versus warfarin prescribed in “real-world” settings from a Russian payer perspective. Material and methods. Markov model simulated AF patients at moderate to high risk of stroke while tracking clinical events and resulting functional disability. Acute event costs and resulting long-term <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> incurred by disabled stroke survivors were calculated using general tariff agreement of Russian obligatory health insurance system and official national statistics. Clinical events, summarized as events per 100 patient-years, expected life years, total costs, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated. Results. Over a lifetime, dabigatran etexilate treated patients experienced fewer intracranial haemorrhages and fewer ischaemic strokes. ICER of dabigatran etexilate was 461, 602 roubles per one additional life year versus “real-world” warfarin. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that dabigatran etexilate is a cost-effective alternative to current care {{for the prevention of}} stroke and systemic embolism among Russian patients with AF. </p...|$|R
