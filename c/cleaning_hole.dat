40|$|Cuttings {{transport}} and efficient <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> remains a vital challenge when planning and drilling vertical, deviated, high angle and extended reach wells. Optimization of cuttings transport depends {{on so many}} factors- hole angle, cutting size, drill string rotation, drill pipe eccentricity, optimization of bit hydraulics, etc. As to date, most existing <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> models and charts have been derived for wells with angles greater than 25 degrees, these models use charts developed from the original physicalbased model. <b>Hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> in vertical <b>holes</b> have been evaluated by calculating the carrying capacity and most <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> charts {{do not apply to}} near vertical and vertical wells.

However, poor <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> often occurred in the highly-deviated sections and horizontal sections of the complex structural wells, which affects rate of penetration, cementing quality and downhole safety. It is advisable to study the behavior of cuttings transport under different conditions. In general, experimental observations and CFD simulations are main methods to analyze the effects of cutting parameters, fluid parameters and operational parameters on <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning.</b> The correlations and models are applied to predict the number of cuttings and the critical velocity in the annulus. In this paper, an analysis of key parameters is conducted on cuttings transport, the existing problems and characteristics of these correlations and models are summarized,, and different removal methods of annular cuttings and future research needs are discussed. Although major improvements have been achieved in the past several decades, how to accurately predict the cuttings bed height, critical velocity and other key parameters, and to effectively solve the poor <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> still is a difficulty challenge.

40|$|Optimization of {{drilling}} fluid properties {{is an essential}} part of cost effective drilling operations and process safety. Currently fluid properties are measured and optimized manually by human engineers with different skills and experience which might lead to nonoptimum drilling fluid properties that deteriorate its functionalities. Automated drilling fluid management is still at an early development stage. Several vendors are actively developing automated skids to measure drilling fluid properties in real time [1] [2], and several authors also have published scientific work on the use of the real-time measurement as a component of automated control systems that dose mud additives automatically to meet the mud specifications or setpoints defined by human engineers [3] [4]. During the well planning stage, the design process of mud specifications is carried out by engineers checking several scenarios using well planning software and their experience to come up with drilling fluid specifications. When <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> and/or borehole stability conditions change during the actual drilling process that warrant updates or changes {{of drilling}} fluid properties, the specifications are updated in an ad-hoc manner, relying on the skills of human engineers. This thesis focusses on the development of a model-based optimization module for drilling fluid properties to help engineers in the planning and drilling phase to automatically derive drilling fluid specifications that meet the <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> criteria, and satisfy the downhole pressure requirement and constraints set on the operating ranges of drilling parameters. The optimization framework will use proxy models derived from well hydraulics software that predicts cuttings concentration and downhole pressure as a function of the drilling fluid properties. Three objective functions for the optimization module are given as examples in this thesis. The first two objective functions deal with the <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> criteria while the last one is a cost function that combines the cost of <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> and downhole pressure management. The optimization module has been tested on a case study based on real field data. Given an objective function, multiple constraints, and proxy models, the module takes only a few seconds to find the optimum mud property values and drilling parameters such as flow rates, rotary speed and rate of penetration. A benchmark with the field data shows that the optimum drilling fluid properties and parameters result in significant improvement of the <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> state while the downhole pressure requirement and constraints on the drilling parameters can still be satisfied. When a cost function is defined as a combination of <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> and downhole pressure management, the module also gives a quantified benefit of the trade-off between maximizing <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> and minimizing losses. Since this module can perform optimization very efficiently compared to the ad-hoc processes done by human engineers, this module may be of significant value for operating units to use in the planning and drilling phase and also in the future as an outer optimization loop for automatic drilling fluid control systems.

40|$|Drilling with casing and liner are {{unconventional}} drilling methods {{developed to}} reduce both the non-productive {{time spent on}} drilling operations and drilling time in general. A casing or liner string is used as the drillstring, {{and the number of}} operations is therefore reduced from two to one as drilling and casing of the wellbore are performed in one operation. Even though there are many benefits with this drilling method, there are also some drawbacks and operational considerations. Statoil and Baker Hughes have developed a rotary steerable liner drilling system, called the Steerable Drilling Liner (SDL). Two offshore test wells have been drilled with this system, and Statoil is now planning to utilize it on more wells in the North Sea. The Oseberg field is a candidate field for liner drilling due to stability problems in the Draupne and Ness formations. Two wells on the Oseberg field have therefore been chosen as the candidate wells for this thesis. The case histories of the test wells show that the limitation may be the low flow rate circulated through the liner, which may cause cuttings accumulation on top of the liner where the flow area suddenly expands. A flow diverter is therefore developed to have more flexibility in the choice of flow rate above the liner. The flow diverter and other solutions to improve the <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> have been evaluated in this thesis. The high annular circulating pressure is another issue with the liner drilling technique. Many of the factors which improve <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> also increase the annular pressure. The ECD must also be taken into consideration when optimizing the <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> of the candidate wells. The simulations of <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> and annular circulating pressure for the SDL system have been performed in WellPlan. The recommended flow rate for <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> in the sections above the liner is at least 500 lpm higher than the maximum possible flow rate through the liner. By circulating this recommended rate through the liner, the equivalent circulating density increases. The circulating pressure exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation for the 7 ” SDL system. It is therefore not an alternative to come up with solutions to be able to circulate with a higher flow rate through the SDL system. A flow diverter above the liner is the best solution to increase the flow rate in the critical part of the well. With the flow diverter above the liner, the flow rate can be increased to the minimum required rate for <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> {{and at the same time}} keep the equivalent circulating density at an acceptable level. The increased flow rate above the flow diverter will have minimal effect on the annular circulating pressure below the previous casing shoe. The simulations also showed that this minimum rate can be significantly reduced by changing the drilling fluid parameters. If the flow rate is kept constant, the bed height of cuttings can be reduced by optimizing the fluid parameters. Optimization of the drilling fluid is also important to make sure the cleaning in the annulus outside the liner is good. The required rate could be reduced further by increasing the rotation of the string and increasing the size of the drillpipe above the liner, and these solutions have been evaluated. Future work should include the development of a simulation program that can include all the downhole tools and components required for the Steerable Drilling Liner system, including two flow split components. The simulation program should also be able to handle the combination of a pilot bottom hole assembly and an underreamer to ream the hole to full size, and then calculate the correct amount of cuttings in the annulus. The drilling fluids should also be optimized to improve the <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> in liner drilling operations further. </p...|$|R

40|$|Drilling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cost drivers in the finding and development of oil and gas fields. More efficient drilling reduces the overall costs and enables drilling of longer wells to reach new reservoir targets. Mechanical friction and poor <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> are the main limiting factors for drilling and well completion of longer wells. Poor <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> can lead to costly drilling problems such as stuck pipe, reduced ROP and higher annular pressure drop leading to lost circulation. Excessive torque and drag caused by mechanical friction, often leads to the inability of reaching the target in high-angle extended reach drilling wells (ERD). Over the years, the oil industry has attempted to stretch the hydraulics and mechanical limitations for drilling longer wells. However, currently available solutions used by the oil industry are not sufficient to overcome these challenges for drilling longer wells that will be required in the future. In addition, stretching these mechanical and hydraulic limitations is essential for improving the drilling efficiency and reducing the overall well construction costs. Drilling boreholes with non-circular geometry is a new concept with step-change potential to stretch operational limits allowing drilling longer wells and more efficient well construction. This concept is based on creating helical grooves in the borehole sidewalls to improve <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> and reduce the mechanical friction. Rifle shaped spiral grooves can be made in the borehole wall with the use of a specialized tool installed as a part of the bottom hole assembly (BHA). The spiral grooves can increase the wellbore cross sectional area and reduce the drill string and formation contact area. The spiral grooves can introduce swirling flow regime in the annulus which may improve the cutting transport. Reduced contact area and improved <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> may reduce the overall mechanical friction. Initial flow simulations indicated differences in the flow regime of circular and non-circular wellbore geometry with integrated helical grooves inside the annulus. More uniform fluid velocity distribution and swirling flow in the non-circular geometry indicated the potential for improving <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> and cutting transport in the new geometry. The objective of this PhD study was to investigate key features and further understanding of the non-circular wellbore concept. Cutting transport and wellbore cleaning as well as mechanical friction has been investigated through flow loop experiments and in the tribology laboratory. A large scale flow loop rig with concrete borehole with rotational drill string was designed and built as the tool for the main part of the PhD work. The modern flow loop includes a 12 meter long test section with a 2 " OD freely rotating drill string inside a 4 " ID wellbore made of concrete. Solid particles were injected while circulating the drilling fluid through the test section at two inclinations; horizontal and 30 o inclined from horizontal. Test results of the big scale flow loop demonstrated the difference in the hydraulics and mechanical performance of circular and non-circular wellbores geometries. For fluid and flow conditions which are relevant for oilfield applications, the results indicated lower pressure gradients and better cuttings transport in the non-circular wellbore than in a circular wellbore. In addition, the torque measurements showed lower mechanical friction in the non-circular wellbore geometry. To support the finding of reduced friction in the non-circular geometry in the flow loop setup, the mechanical friction was also studied in a tribology lab. Test results in the pin-on-disc were consistent with the results obtained from the flow loop experiments. The experiments in the tribology lab confirmed the hypothesis that reducing contact area in the non-circular wellbore geometry can decrease the mechanical friction. Such a comparative, experimental study of <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> in different wellbore geometries has to our knowledge previously never been performed. The results of the present PhD work and the experimental approach could therefore be of value for any one working in the drilling industry.

40|$|More {{extended}} reach wells, highly deviated and ultra deep {{are being}} drilled {{to meet the}} world&# 146;s continuously increasing energy demand. <b>Hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> {{remains one of the}} greatest challenges throughout drilling operations, as material from the formation is generated during the entire drilling process. Depending on several parameters like rate of penetration, flow rate and mud rheology, the cuttings concentration will fluctuate throughout the wellbore. Insufficient <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> may result in a number of drilling problems. Satisfactory cuttings transport is therefore essential to avoid problems associated with poor <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning,</b> and it is important to reduce non-productive time associated with downhole failures and wellbore integrity. The objective {{of the present study was}} to observe and estimate an effect from cuttings on equivalent circulating density, and to find the amount of cuttings in the vertical part of the wellbore at a certain time. This was attempted by calculating the length of displacement of generated cuttings from the horizontal part within each section, and the amount of time required for these cuttings to be transported upwards the annulus, to the vertical part of the wellbore. This has been done for both observed and theoretical values. The effects of cuttings on equivalent circulating density have been observed and estimated, based on data from the drilling operation of well NO- 34 / 10 -C- 47 in the North Sea. Twenty different cases were chosen, and standpipe pressure information was gathered from real time drilling data. The cuttings concentrations were then calculated. The same procedure was then performed theoretically, where data from the Final Well Report were used. The results of observations and estimations were compared to evaluate the quality of the results. Also, extensive research of published knowledge has been made, along with interpretation of already existing cuttings transport models. The parameters affecting <b>hole</b> <b>cleaning</b> are presented to give an overview of the complexity of the subject. The main conclusions obtained in the present study are:&# 149; Effects of cuttings on equivalent circulating density were successfully observed and estimated. &# 149; Good consistency of model results when comparing the observed and estimated values for lengths of displacement. &# 149; The field data provided relevant information. However, field data from several wells would have been preferable for increased reliability. &# 149; The model calculations were not able to account for transient effects, which limits the results significantly. &# 149; Simple theoretical models were made for clarity, but more complex and detailed descriptions are required, accounting for transient effects. </p...|$|R
