5|$|In 1981 the French {{clinched}} {{their third}} Grand Slam; at Twickenham against England. They again completed a Grand Slam in 1987 {{on the eve}} of the first Rugby World Cup hosted by Australia and New Zealand. In that tournament they <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> numerous times to defeat the Wallabies in their semi-final, and faced the All Blacks in final at Eden Park, Auckland; France lost 29–9. They shared the Five Nations with Wales the next year, and also won it in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In {{a crucial}} Premier League match away to Everton on 3 May, Nasri {{provided}} the assist for Edin Džeko's game-winning goal as City <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to win 3–2 and go {{top of the}} table with two matches remaining. On 11 May, Nasri scored Manchester City's opening goal in a 2–0 defeat of West Ham United as the club won the 2013–14 Premier League title.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November was the North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur. After 20 minutes, Tottenham were 2–0 {{up after}} goals from Steffen Iversen and Tim Sherwood. Vieira scored for Arsenal from a header, {{but there were}} no further goals in the game. In the second half Ljungberg was sent off, as was Keown in {{stoppage}} time, to reduce Arsenal to nine men. The team responded with a 5–1 win against Middlesbrough, in which Overmars scored three goals. Arsenal then <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to beat Derby County on 28 November 1999; they ended the month in third, three points behind Leeds United in first.|$|E

5|$|Del Piero {{then came}} on as a {{substitute}} in the 61st minute during Juventus's next Coppa Italia match on 27 August, against Napoli. Once again Juventus <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> as Del Piero scored twice to give his team the lead. The match eventually went to penalties; although Del Piero scored his spot-kick, Napoli won 5–4 in the penalty shoot-out. Despite starting {{the season with a}} nine-point penalty from the match-fixing scandal, Juventus gained promotion to Serie A as Serie B champions; Del Piero finished the league campaign as the top scorer of the 2006–07 Serie B season, with 20 goals. During the season, Del Piero also managed his 200th goal with Juventus on 21 October 2006, in a 1–0 league victory over Frosinone.|$|E
5|$|Despite Oklahoma State's 0–4start to conference play, {{they led}} Texas the entire first half, {{including}} a lead {{of as much}} as nineteenpoints. It was the thirdstraight year that Texas trailed Oklahoma State at halftime and <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to win by a sizable margin (47–28). Vince Young set a school record for total yards in one game with 506yards (239passing, 267rushing). Young also became one of only sevenplayers in NCAA history to have accumulated over 200yards rushing and 200yards passing in a singlegame. Over the past threemeetings between the twoschools (2003–2005), the Longhorns outscored the Cowboys by a combined second-half score of 118–0.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disappointment}} {{of the previous}} season, Arsenal won their seventh League title in 1952–53; {{in one of the}} closest title races, they beat Preston North End to the title on goal average after finishing level on points. The title looked to be Preston's after Arsenal lost to them 2–0 at Deepdale in the penultimate game of the season, but Arsenal <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to beat Burnley 3–2, to take the title on 0.099 of a goal. That proved to be Arsenal's last trophy for seventeen years, as Arsenal's fortunes began to wane, particularly after the unexpected death of Tom Whittaker in October 1956.|$|E

5|$|Each team {{played two}} matches, with three points awarded for a win, one {{point for a}} draw and none for a loss. An {{additional}} point is awarded for every goal scored. Arsenal did not face RB Leipzig, and Benfica did not play against Sevilla. On {{the first day of}} the Emirates Cup, Sevilla defeated RB Leipzig by a single goal, while Arsenal <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to beat Benfica 5–2. Although Sevilla were victorious against Arsenal and took maximum points, the hosts won the competition due to scoring more goals over the two days. RB Leipzig beat Benfica by two goals to finish in third place.|$|E
5|$|Given {{both teams}} {{were in the}} highest tier of English football, the Premier League, they entered the {{competition}} in the third round. Each needed to progress through five rounds to reach the final. Arsenal's progress was relatively comfortable; after scoring six past Queens Park Rangers, they knocked out holders Chelsea in the fifth round and later <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to beat local rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-final. Liverpool by contrast made hard work of overcoming lower-league opponents Tranmere Rovers and Wycombe Wanderers in the latter rounds of the competition. The final {{marked the first time}} that two managers born outside the British Isles had met in an FA Cup final – French compatriots Arsène Wenger and Gérard Houllier.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut for Sporting B on 10 August 2014, {{replacing}} Palhinha at half {{time in a}} 1–0 defeat away to Farense.

On 7 December, he scored a second goal, opening a 4–3 win at Lisbon neighbours Clube Oriental de Lisboa with a 20-yard volley. On 21 December, he was sent off for two bookings in a 3–1 triumph at Vitória de Guimarães B. He finished the season with three goals from 26 games for the B-team, the third coming on 7 February 2015, when he equalised as the team <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to win 2–1 against SC Olhanense.|$|E

On 27 March, his 32nd birthday, Hasselbaink came on as a 60th-minute substitute for Geremi Njitap and scored a hat-trick as Chelsea <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 5–2 at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea finished the season in second place and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League; Hasselbaink played in both legs of the semi-final defeat to AS Monaco, as Chelsea lost 5–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September, Jones {{made his}} only {{international}} appearance, replacing Giles Barnes in a goalless friendly draw for England under-19 against the Netherlands at the Bescot Stadium in Walsall. Eighteen days later, he scored his first league goal, opening a 2–0 home win over Hull City, the first match of John Gregory's tenure. Jones followed this the following weekend as QPR <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to win 2–1 at Southampton, scoring the decisive goal after rounding goalkeeper Kelvin Davis. On 17 November, {{as a substitute}} for Blackstock, Jones scored the only goal in a 1–0 away win over high-flying Cardiff City, connecting with Ward's cross with less than three minutes left of the match.|$|E
5|$|The Royals won Game 1 {{in extra}} innings, tying {{for the longest}} game in World Series history. The Royals also won Game 2 with a {{complete}} game by Johnny Cueto, who allowed only one unearned run and two hits. With the series shifting to New York, the Mets won Game 3 with home runs by David Wright and Curtis Granderson. The Royals <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to win Game 4 after an error by Daniel Murphy led to a blown save by Jeurys Familia. Game 5 also went into extra innings, where bench player Christian Colón drove in the go-ahead run for the Royals, who clinched the series.

5|$|Two fumbles deep in New England Patriots {{territory}} overcame {{a stubborn}} Buccaneer effort. The Patriots’ 260 rushing yards stood {{for years as}} the most allowed in a game by the Buccaneers, while their total of four pass completions remains the least by a Tampa Bay opponent. New England <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> twice on Andy Johnson touchdown runs, and took the lead for good on Sam Hunt’s 58-yard return of a Steve Spurrier interception. Johnson’s first touchdown run was a 69-yarder that set a club record. Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan set an NFL record with four seconds left, rushing for his 12th touchdown of the year. The Buccaneers also set an NFL record, by becoming the only team to go winless in a 14-game season.|$|E
5|$|While Newell's {{place was}} taken first by Kevin Blackwell and later former player Mick Harford, {{the team was}} then relegated twice in a row, {{starting}} in 2006–07, and spent {{the latter part of}} the 2007–08 season in administration, thus incurring a ten-point deduction from that season's total. The club then had a total of 30 points docked from its 2008–09 record by the Football Association and the Football League for financial irregularities dating back several years. These deductions proved to be too large an obstacle to overcome, but Luton <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> in the final of the Football League Trophy to win the competition for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses near King at {{the moment}} of his death said that the shot came from another location. They said that it <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> thick {{shrubbery}} near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) that were left in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints also determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1984–85 York {{were beaten}} by Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in the League Cup, but Byrne {{impressed}} QPR manager Alan Mullery enough {{to earn a}} £100,000 move to Loftus Road. Smith spent half of this sum (a club record) on Aldershot forward Dale Banton, {{who went on to}} score 49 goals in 138 appearances for the club. He also released winger Brian Pollard, but found that the man he signed in his place, Gary Nicholson, was not able to replicate Pollard's form. York started the season well and another of his signings, Keith Houchen (£15,000), scored a hat-trick in a 7–1 win over Gillingham in November 1984. On 26 January 1975, he guided York to victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup fourth round. In the next round York <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to draw 1–1 at home with Liverpool, before losing 7–0 away at Anfield.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut as a second-half {{substitute}} in Valencia's Champions League group-stage defeat {{at home to}} Chelsea, and started the next league match, another home defeat against Espanyol, but was selected only infrequently either by Quique Flores, who had signed him, or by successor Ronald Koeman. With the transfer window approaching, Koeman had given Žigić two weeks to convince him he was worth keeping. Prior to the Copa del Rey on 19 December, Valencia had not scored for six matches, and they were soon 1–0 down to third-tier opponents Real Union. Žigić came on and scored twice to turn the match around, and followed up with another goal three days later as Valencia <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to secure a 2–2 draw at Real Zaragoza. A mooted loan to English club Portsmouth fell through when Koeman {{changed his mind about}} the player leaving, but he made only nine league appearances (two starts) in what remained of the season, and was sent off in the first of those.|$|E

Although much was expected of Pogba at the upcoming European Championships, in France's opening match of the tournament, a 2–1 win over Romania on 10 June, he endured criticism for his perceived negative performance after being played out of position, and was subsequently left on the bench by Deschamps for his nation's second group match, later coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 win over Albania. In the round of the 16, he was once again the target of media scrutiny for conceding an early penalty against Ireland, prompting former England international Gary Lineker to tweet: “Is Pogba the world’s most overrated player?”; France eventually <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> to win the match 2–1.|$|E
