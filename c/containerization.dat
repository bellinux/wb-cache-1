5|$|Although railroads {{have lost}} much of the general-freight-carrying {{business}} to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of <b>containerization</b> has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds. In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{was also}} honoured by various other countries, and {{was made a}} member of the National Order of the Cedar by Lebanon in 1955. The United States honoured Smallpeice by giving him the Key to the City of San Francisco in 1959. He was also honoured with a Pioneers Award for his {{contributions}} to the development of container shipping by the <b>Containerization</b> Institute in New York during 1981.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{of cargo}} <b>containerization</b> in the 1960s helped offset declining traffic to the Port of Seattle, {{leading to a}} $80 million {{modernization}} and expansion program begun in 1968. The Port of Tacoma debuted its own cargo container-ready facilities in 1970, and gradually lured away several large shipping lines from Seattle through the 1990s, including Alaska-based Totem Ocean Trailer Express (1976), SeaLand (1983), Maersk (1985), K Line (1988), and Evergreen Marine (1991). The Port of Seattle's largest line, Hyundai Merchant Marine, moved to a new, $65 million terminal in Tacoma in 1996.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of <b>containerization</b> in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E
25|$|However, few {{initially}} foresaw {{the extent}} of the influence of <b>containerization</b> on the shipping industry. In the 1950s, Harvard University economist Benjamin Chinitz predicted that <b>containerization</b> would benefit New York by allowing it to ship its industrial goods more cheaply to the Southern United States than other areas, but he did not anticipate that <b>containerization</b> might make it cheaper to import such goods from abroad. Most economic studies of <b>containerization</b> merely assumed that shipping companies would begin to replace older forms of transportation with <b>containerization,</b> but did not predict that the process of <b>containerization</b> itself would have a more direct influence on the choice of producers and increase the total volume of trade.|$|E
25|$|Henry Robinson Palmer {{described}} an early principle of <b>containerization.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Containerization</b> {{greatly reduced}} {{the expense of}} {{international}} trade and increased its speed, especially of consumer goods and commodities. It also dramatically changed the character of port cities worldwide. Prior to highly mechanized container transfers, crews of 20–22 longshoremen would pack individual cargoes into the hold of a ship. After <b>containerization,</b> large crews of longshoremen were no longer necessary at port facilities, and the profession changed drastically.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} founded just as <b>containerization</b> was {{beginning}} and continuously {{grew up with}} the growth of this market.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th {{century the}} area went into decline as {{congestion}} and <b>containerization</b> forced shipping to unload goods further east, {{and the last}} warehouses closed in 1972.|$|E
25|$|International {{standards}} have made {{trade in goods}} and services more efficient. An example of such standard is the intermodal container. <b>Containerization</b> dramatically reduced transport of its costs, supported the post-war boom in international trade, and was a major element in globalization. International Organization for Standardization is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Gleason {{negotiated}} {{what was}} at the time, the longest lasting ILA contract in history. It {{was also the first}} truly forward-looking contract the union signed. As automation and <b>containerization</b> increased, the contract focused on preserving jobs. Gleason-era initiatives such as the Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI) program, the Job Security Program (JSP). Under Gleason, the ILA once again became a strong and powerful force in the world of labor.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the port}} {{facilities}} {{needed to support}} <b>containerization</b> changed. One effect was the decline of some ports {{and the rise of}} others. At the Port of San Francisco, the former piers used for loading and unloading were no longer required, but there was little room to build the vast holding lots needed for container transport. As a result, the Port of San Francisco virtually ceased to function as a major commercial port, but the neighboring port of Oakland emerged as the second largest on the US West Coast. A similar fate met the relation between the ports of Manhattan and New Jersey. In the United Kingdom, the Port of London and Port of Liverpool declined in importance. Meanwhile, Britain's Port of Felixstowe and Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands emerged as major ports. In general, inland ports on waterways incapable of deep-draft ship traffic also declined from <b>containerization</b> in favor of seaports. With intermodal containers, the job of sorting and packing containers could be performed far from the point of embarking.|$|E
25|$|Malcom Purcell McLean (November 14, 1913– May 25, 2001) was an American businessman. He was a {{transport}} {{entrepreneur who}} developed the modern intermodal shipping container, which revolutionized transport and international trade {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century. <b>Containerization</b> led to a significant reduction in the cost of freight transportation by eliminating the need for repeated handling of individual pieces of cargo, and also improved reliability, reduced cargo theft, and cut inventory costs by shortening transit time.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} <b>containerization</b> rapidly spread beyond the {{shipping}} industry. Containers were quickly adopted by trucking and rail transport industries for cargo transport not involving sea transport. Manufacturing also evolved {{to adapt to}} take advantage of containers. Companies that once sent small consignments began grouping them into containers. Many cargoes are now designed to fit precisely into containers. The reliability of containers also made just in time manufacturing possible as component suppliers could deliver specific components on regular fixed schedules.|$|E
25|$|Improved cargo {{security}} {{is also an}} important benefit of <b>containerization.</b> The cargo is not visible to the casual viewer and thus is less likely to be stolen; the doors of the containers are usually sealed so that tampering is more evident. Some containers are fitted with electronic monitoring devices and can be remotely monitored for changes in air pressure, which happens when the doors are opened. This reduced the thefts that had long plagued the shipping industry. Recent developments have focused on the use of intelligent logistics optimization to further enhance security.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>containerization</b> {{and other}} {{advances}} in shipping were impeded by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), {{which was created}} in 1887 to keep railroads from using monopolist pricing and rate discrimination but fell victim to regulatory capture. By the 1960s, ICC approval was required before any shipper could carry different items in the same vehicle or change rates. The fully integrated systems in the United States today became possible only after the ICC's regulatory oversight was cut back (and abolished in 1995); trucking and rail were deregulated in the 1970s and maritime rates were deregulated in 1984.|$|E
25|$|The first {{international}} standard for containers {{was established by}} the Bureau International des Containers et du Transport Intermodal (B.I.C.) in 1933, and a second one in 1935, primarily for transport between European countries. American containers at this time were not standardized, and these early containers were not yet stackable – neither in the U.S. nor Europe. In November 1932, the first container terminal {{in the world was}} opened by the Pennsylvania Rail Road Company in Enola, PA. The development of <b>containerization</b> was created in Europe and the US as a way to revitalize rail companies after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, in New York, which resulted in economic collapse and a drop in all modes of transport.|$|E
25|$|Container trains {{have become}} the beta type in the US for bulk haulage. Containers can easily be transshipped to other modes, such as ships and trucks, using cranes. This has succeeded the boxcar (wagon-load), where the cargo had to be loaded and {{unloaded}} into the train manually. The intermodal <b>containerization</b> of cargo has revolutionized the supply chain logistics industry, reducing ship costs significantly. In Europe, the sliding wall wagon has largely superseded the ordinary covered wagons. Other types of cars include refrigerator cars, stock cars for livestock and autoracks for road vehicles. When rail is combined with road transport, a roadrailer will allow trailers to be driven onto the train, allowing for easy transition between road and rail.|$|E
25|$|Greenland Dock {{suffered}} greatly during World War II, {{when many}} of the warehouses were razed by German bombing and the great lock was rendered unusable due to bomb damage. It soon recovered {{after the war and}} enjoyed a brief resurgence of prosperity. However, technological changes in the shipping industry soon pushed the dock into a spiral of decline. The deal porters' jobs were abolished from 1958 when timber started to be packaged. Not long afterwards, the shipping industry moved en masse to the system of <b>containerization,</b> which required bulk carriers far too large to be accommodated in the London docks. In 1970, the Surrey Commercial Docks were closed. Greenland Dock was sold to Southwark council.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, {{the company}} began {{investigating}} the possibility of <b>containerization,</b> and sent research teams into 28 major ports. Following their reports, Davies began integrating containers into the company's business. By 1961, the company had begun launching ships capable of container transport, the first two of these being the combination break-bulk - container vessels SS President Tyler and SS President Lincoln. Ports also began adapting to the new container-based system, although many potential customers were still wary. By {{the end of the}} decade, the company was still launching combination ships rather than fully cellular container ships as already employed by several U.S., British, European and Japanese lines, yet by 1969, 23% of the company's business moved via container.|$|E
25|$|The sizable {{decline in}} U.S. {{manufacturing}} jobs since 2000 has been blamed on various causes, such as trade with a rising Asia, offshoring of jobs with few restrictions to lower wage countries, innovation in global supply chains (e.g., <b>containerization),</b> and other technology improvements. The millions of construction jobs created during the housing bubble that peaked in 2006 helped mask {{some of this}} adverse employment impact initially. Further, households dramatically increased their debt burden from 2001-2007, extracting home equity for use in consumption. However, the housing bubble collapse in 2006-2008 contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis and resulting Great Recession, which resulted in households switching from adding debt to paying it down, a headwind to the economy for several years thereafter.|$|E
25|$|As one of {{the three}} major ports on the West Coast of the United States, the Port of Oakland is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the fifth busiest {{container}} port in the United States. It was {{one of the}} earliest seaports to switch to <b>containerization</b> and to intermodal container transfer, thereby displacing the Port of San Francisco, which never modernized its waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s, the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of development of an intermodal container transfer capability, i.e., facilities that now allow trans-loading of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes.|$|E
25|$|Before <b>containerization,</b> {{goods were}} usually handled {{manually}} as break bulk cargo. Typically, goods would be loaded onto a vehicle {{from the factory}} and taken to a port warehouse {{where they would be}} offloaded and stored awaiting the next vessel. When the vessel arrived, they would be moved {{to the side of the}} ship along with other cargo to be lowered or carried into the hold and packed by dock workers. The ship might call at several other ports before off-loading a given consignment of cargo. Each port visit would delay the delivery of other cargo. Delivered cargo might then have been offloaded into another warehouse before being picked up and delivered to its destination. Multiple handling and delays made transport costly, time consuming and unreliable.|$|E
25|$|German bombing during World War II caused massive {{damage to}} the docks with 380,000 tons of timber {{destroyed}} in the Surrey Docks in a single night. Nonetheless, following post-war rebuilding they experienced a resurgence of prosperity in the 1950s. The end came suddenly, between approximately 1960 and 1970, when the shipping industry adopted the newly invented container system of cargo transportation. London's docks were unable to accommodate the much larger vessels needed by <b>containerization</b> and the shipping industry moved to deep-water ports such as Tilbury and Felixstowe. Between 1960 and 1980, all of London's docks were closed, leaving around eight square miles (21km²) of derelict land in East London. Unemployment was high, and poverty and other social problems were rife.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Containerization</b> is {{a system}} of {{intermodal}} freight transport using intermodal containers (also called shipping containers and ISO containers). The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is completely mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes [...] and special forklift trucks. [...] All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Containerization</b> has {{its origins}} in early coal mining regions in England {{beginning}} in the late 18th century.

In 1795, Benjamin Outram opened the Little Eaton Gangway, upon which coal was carried in wagons built at his Butterley Ironwork. The horse-drawn wheeled wagons on the gangway took the form of containers, which, loaded with coal, could be transshipped from canal barges on the Derby Canal, which Outram had also promoted.|$|E
