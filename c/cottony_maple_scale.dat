5000|$|Pulvinaria innumerabilis (<b>cottony</b> <b>maple</b> <b>scale)</b> is a small, flattened, brown {{scale insect}} about 1/8" [...] long. In early summer mature females begin to secrete white, waxy, cottony-appearing egg sacs {{in which they}} lay as many as 1,500 eggs. Severely infested trees look like they are covered with strings of popcorn.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, nursery crop {{producers}} and landscape managers in Maryland and the eastern U. S. have become increasingly concerned about the pest insect, exotic Japanese <b>maple</b> <b>scale</b> (JMS), Lopholeucaspis japonica (Cockerell) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae). JMS is difficult to control and monitor because of its wide host plant range (over 45 genera of plants in 27 families), extended crawler emergence period, small size and coloration that blends in well on trees with light bark (figure 1). Unless JMS is monitored carefully and controlled early, populations of this armored scale can spread throughout a nursery or landscape to many species of woody plants and build up to levels that cause dieback and even death of infested plants. In the United States, JMS was first detected in Connecticut in 1914 (Miller et al. 2005), and it has since been reported in Washington DC, and 1...|$|R
5000|$|A less {{expensive}} Squier {{version of the}} Katana - much more commonly available in the used market - was also made, with a single humbucking pickup, a bolt-on short scale neck, vintage-style 6-screw tremolo bridge and a single volume control. It was also available as a bass model with a split-coil P-Bass humbucker, 4-saddle bridge and a medium 32"-inch <b>scale</b> <b>maple</b> neck with a 20-fret rosewood fretboard.|$|R
5000|$|The DRP crest {{is used on}} vehicles, {{headgear}} and uniforms, and {{consists of}} St. Edward's Crown over a round blue shield with the legend [...] "Durham Regional Police" [...] in white, encircling a red maple leaf overlaid with gold scales of justice. The crest is based on that of the former City of Oshawa police department, with the <b>maple</b> leaf and <b>scales</b> replacing the city's coat of arms.|$|R
5000|$|The ESP LTD M-300FM Electric Guitar has a {{mahogany}} {{body with}} a flamed maple top, and a 25.5" [...] <b>scale</b> <b>maple</b> neck with rosewood fretboard and 24 extra-jumbo frets. Other features include black nickel hardware, ESP tuners, double-locking Floyd Rose Special bridge, a pair of EMG 81 pickups with 3-way switch selector, and volume and tone controls. The lower bout has an extreme beveled edge to give your arm unobstructed access to the frets.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s when dance bands downsized, guitar players {{who lost their}} {{positions}} playing guitar were told they could play double bass. However, “they {{did not want to}} take the time to learn upright technique. They needed a bass they could play like a guitar-a fretted bass.” Leo Fender heard these criticisms and took his telecaster model and adopted it to a bass guitar. The result was the Fender Precision Bass. It consisted of an ash bolt-on <b>maple</b> neck. The <b>scale</b> for the bass was 34.” “It also had “cutaways for better balance.” Now guitarists could double on bass, and the bass player of the band would not have to carry around a huge upright bass. It entered the market in 1951.|$|R
5000|$|The Bongo is a {{model of}} bass guitar {{manufactured}} by Music Man, a division of Ernie Ball. It was first introduced at the NAMM Show on March 21, 2003. Ernie Ball president Sterling Ball designed the instrument in conjunction with the Music Man Research and Development department and BMW's Designworks team. It boasts an 18-volt 4-band preamp (except on the single-pickup model, which has a 3-band preamp; single-pickup models with piezo bridges have a 4-band preamp) designed by Dudley Gimpel with help from Cliff Hugo and other Music Man artists. It also sports a sleek, carved basswood body with high-gloss polyester finish and a satin-finish painted 34" [...] <b>scale</b> <b>maple</b> neck with rosewood fingerboard (pau ferro on lined or unlined fretless, ebony on both fretted and fretless [...] "stealth" [...] basses) featuring 24 high-profile wide frets and crescent moon-shaped position inlays. These basses are generally known for their dual humbucking pickup configuration, as they are the first twin humbucker-equipped models released by Music Man since the introduction of their Sabre and Cutlass bass guitars in the late 1970s.|$|R
