25|$|The first stamps did {{not need}} to show the issuing country, so no <b>country</b> <b>name</b> was {{included}} on them. The UK remains the only country to omit its name on postage stamps, using the reigning monarch’s head as country identification. Following the introduction of the postage stamp in the UK, prepaid postage considerably increased the number of letters mailed. Before 1839, the number of letters sent in the UK was typically 76 million. By 1850 this increased five-fold to 350 million, continuing to grow rapidly {{until the end of the}} 20th century when newer methods of indicating the payment of postage reduced the use of stamps.|$|E
25|$|The wars with Champa and the Mongols left Vietnam {{exhausted}} and bankrupt. The Trần dynasty was in turn overthrown {{by one of}} its own court officials, Hồ Quý Ly. Hồ Quý Ly forced the last Trần emperor to abdicate and assumed the throne in 1400. He changed the <b>country</b> <b>name</b> to Đại Ngu and moved the capital to Tây Đô, Western Capital, now Thanh Hóa. Thăng Long was renamed Đông Đô, Eastern Capital. Although widely blamed for causing national disunity and losing the country later to the Ming Empire, Hồ Quý Ly's reign actually introduced a lot of progressive, ambitious reforms, including the addition of mathematics to the national examinations, the open critique of Confucian philosophy, the use of paper currency in place of coins, investment in building large warships and cannons, and land reform. He ceded the throne to his son, Hồ Hán Thương, in 1401 and assumed the title Thái Thượng Hoàng, in similar manner to the Trần kings.|$|E

500|$|Currently 249 countries, territories, or {{areas of}} {{geographical}} interest are assigned official codes in ISO 3166-1.

500|$|The {{codes are}} chosen, {{according}} to the ISO 3166/MA, [...] "to reflect the significant, unique component of the <b>country</b> <b>name</b> {{in order to allow}} a visual association between <b>country</b> <b>name</b> and country code". For this reason, common components of country names like [...] "Republic", [...] "Kingdom", [...] "United", [...] "Federal" [...] or [...] "Democratic" [...] are normally not used for deriving the code elements. As a consequence, for example, the United Kingdom is officially assigned the alpha-2 code [...] rather than , based on its official name [...] "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" [...] (although [...] is reserved on the request of the United Kingdom). Some codes are chosen based on the native names of the countries. For example, Germany is assigned the alpha-2 code , based on its native name [...] "Deutschland".|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we analyze whether US {{antidumping}} (AD) duties in the agricultural sector are effective in restricting trade. More specifically, does imposing an antidumping duty restrict imports of the named commodity or are imports deflected from <b>countries</b> <b>named</b> in the AD petition to <b>countries</b> not <b>named</b> in the petition? We find that AD duties have significantly restricted imports of agricultural commodities from <b>countries</b> <b>named</b> in the petition. However, our results also indicate that, unlike the manufacturing sector in the US, there was little trade diversion towards <b>countries</b> not <b>named</b> in the petition. Our results indicate that AD is a plausible protectionist policy in the agriculture sector. ...|$|R

Some postcards focused on the host city of Baku with text changing to 'Baku' and underneath 'City of ...' (e.g. City of Jazz; City of Leisure etc.). The postcards finished with a shot of the Crystal Hall displayed in the colours of the performing country's flag.
