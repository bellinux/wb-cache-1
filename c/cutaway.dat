5|$|In {{addition}} to both its main cast and guest stars, Family Guy utilizes a deep bench of regularly appearing supporting voice actors.

5|$|Family Guy is an American {{animated}} sitcom {{created by}} Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series {{centers on the}} Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show {{is set in the}} fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional <b>cutaway</b> gags that often lampoon American culture.|$|E

5|$|There is a <b>cutaway</b> {{model of}} Viribus Unitis in the Museum of Military History in Vienna. The model is at {{a scale of}} 1:25 and has a total length of 6 metres. It was built between 1913 and 1917 by eight {{craftsmen}} of the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino. The model is true to the original in structure, layout, and engine system. It is accurate to the point that, for instance, the painting in the wardroom of the model exactly replicates the original not only in subject {{but also in the}} painting technique (oil on canvas).|$|E

5|$|A year later, he {{made his}} feature film debut in the action film Double Team {{alongside}} Jean-Claude Van Damme and Mickey Rourke. The film was critically panned and his performance earned him three Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst New Star, Worst Supporting Actor and Worst Screen Couple (shared with Van Damme). Rodman starred in Simon Sez, a 1999 action/comedy and co-starred with Tom Berenger in a 2000 action film about skydiving titled <b>Cutaway.</b> In 1998, he joined the cast of the syndicated TV show Special Ops Force, playing 'Deke' Reynolds, a flamboyant but skilled ex-Army helo pilot and demolitions expert.|$|E
5|$|Scherzinger {{performed}} the {{song for the}} first time in Stratford, London at Westfield Stratford City on September 13, 2011. The performance was included in a set of multiple songs off of Killer Love, and was sung in order to celebrate the shopping centre's opening. Scherzinger began her performance with a fringed leather coat in red and black, the colours of the Westfield logo, a <b>cutaway</b> black bodycon dress and purple platform heels which she whipped off to reveal an even racier outfit underneath. She than wore a black leather number covered in tassels and chains. Scherzinger's performance was accompanied onstage by several dancers, whom were wearing shiny metallic trousers, as she performed in front of thousands of fans. The song was also performed in 2012 on her first solo tour, the Killer Love Tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{first team}} of writers {{assembled}} {{for the show}} consisted of Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, Gary Janetti, Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman, Garrett Donovan, Matt Weitzman, and Mike Barker. The writing process of Family Guy generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a script is finished it {{is given to the}} rest of the writers to read. These scripts generally include <b>cutaway</b> gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason. The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.|$|E

5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first <b>cutaway</b> to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to Get Smart, Auto takes the plant and goes into {{the bowels of the}} ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom.|$|E
5|$|As the Griffin family {{prepare to}} sit down for their dinner, baby Stewie is shown {{watching}} television, with the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade taking place on the screen. Stewie notices a hot air balloon in the parade resembling himself. After the family decides {{to go to the}} Griffin family's backyard to play football, Joe approaches his son to encourage him to beat the other team. Joe then references the 2009 war film The Hurt Locker, with Kevin responding with disdain for the film, despite supposedly being in a coma during its release. Joe also goes on to point out that Kevin is wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt, which also became popularized during his supposed coma, and despite Kevin telling his father that he flew straight home after he awoke. Later during dinner, when Kevin reveals that he went A.W.O.L., Peter makes an off the wall reference, causing the episode to cut to a room showing several of the show's editors, who become confused about what <b>cutaway</b> to play on the screen. They then decide to play a clip involving several characters from The Wizard of Oz, including the Cowardly Lion, who is shown to be actress Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to criticizing the show's perceived controversial or offensive content, critics have also targeted the show's reliance on <b>Cutaway</b> Gags. The show's <b>Cutaway</b> Gags are mostly {{criticized for being}} either offensive or too long. The show has also received criticism of having one-dimensional characters and unoriginal storytelling. The backlash Family Guy has received has led many contemporary animated sitcoms such as South Park and The Simpsons to satirize Family Guys writing.|$|E
