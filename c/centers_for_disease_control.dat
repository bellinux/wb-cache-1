5|$|Due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} in the public, in 2001 the <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> and the National Institutes of Health asked the U.S. National Academy of Science's (NAS) Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety concerns. This initial report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at the time, there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically plausible.|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} of the scientific consensus includes the rejection of a causal link between thiomersal and autism by multiple national and international scientific and medical bodies including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the Canadian Paediatric Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Food and Drug Administration, <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the European Medicines Agency.|$|E

In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E

The United States <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> and Prevention (CDC) maintains an up-to-date summary of available laboratory tests.

5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing gender inequity in research, {{a number of}} countries have made women's health the subject of national initiatives. For instance in 1991 in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services established an Office on Women's Health (OWH) with the goal of improving the health of women in America, through coordinating the women's health agenda throughout the Department, and other agencies. In the twenty first century the Office has focussed on underserviced women. Also, in 1994 the <b>Centers</b> <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> and Prevention (CDC) established its own Office of Women's Health (OWH), which was formally authorised by the 2010 Affordable Health Care Act (ACA).|$|E

Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E
