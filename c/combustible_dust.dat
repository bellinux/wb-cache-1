The laboratory-scale tests were conducted in the 20 -L chamber using ignitors of various energies. One purpose of the laboratory and mine comparison is to determine the conditions under which the laboratory tests best simulate the full-scale tests. The results of this research showed relatively good agreement between the laboratory and the large-scale tests in determining explosion limits.

40|$|The present work of thesis {{investigate}} the explosibility sensitivity {{and behavior of}} combustible solid materials, {{in the form of}} dusts. The first phase of the work has focused on the ignition sensitivity of <b>combustible</b> <b>dusts,</b> both in form of clouds than deposed as layers. Standard test methods has been used to assess ignition parameter of the samples, i. e. UNI EN 50821 : 1999. MITC and MITL were measured for pure <b>combustible</b> <b>dusts</b> and for mixtures of different dusts. In particular mixtures of <b>combustible</b> and inert <b>dusts</b> were analyzed. The experimental results underlined the increase of the ignition temperature (both in clouds than in layers) as the weight content of inert material increase. Extinguishing powders with chemical heat depletion effect had demonstrated to be more effective in increasing the ignition temperature with respect to inert acting with physical inertia mechanism. MITC of two <b>combustible</b> <b>dusts</b> mixture have been analyzed and results have shown the poor accuracy of the standard procedure in defining the ignition temperature, particularly when there is little difference between ignition temperatures of the pure materials. The author has attempted to reduce this lack of accuracy, inadequate when a high level of details is required (like for scientific purposes) in ignition measurements through different statistical analysis of experimental data. This study has generated a statistical approach to the investigation of dust ignition temperature with the definition of the SIT (Statistical Ignition Temperature) and the definition of a Probability Escalation Interval (PEI); within PEI ignition probability of dusts vary between 0 and 1 with respect to temperature. The results obtained show that standard methods adopted worldwide could fail in determine the MITC of dusts and bring a new, more accurate methodology as a contribution on the definition of ignition concept of dusts. The statistical study could also apply to ignition criteria of the explosibility test proposed here, in order to give to SET procedures and results a more reliable statistical value. The Speditive Explosibility Test has the form of a screening procedures for defining explosibility of dust samples, with the aim of avoiding time and cost-consuming standard procedures. The test consist in different procedures derived from standards (mainly UNI EN 50821 and UNI EN 13821) which ignition conditions are modified to be "as worst as possible", in order to avoid marginally explosive dusts to be classified as non explosible. Tests were performed on different dusts samples (by chemical composition, nature, PSD) and results were validated through explosion test in the 20 L Siwek-sphere. The test classification shows, {{for the majority of the}} samples collected, good agreement with literature standard explosibility tests. The SET could be assumed as standard test for the explosibility determination of a dust. A second experimental campaign was performed on non-traditional dusts coming from textile industries.

40|$|AbstractThe {{parameters}} of explosive {{characteristics of the}} coal-dust are assessed systematically with the test device of minimum ignition temperature of dust clouds and 20 L sphere explosion test units. The minimum ignition temperature of dust is a main safety index when handling <b>combustible</b> <b>dusts</b> in industrial production, and while hazard evaluation, the maximum explosion pressure and the explosion index are key parameters. Five kinds of coal-dust with different particle diameters were tested {{in order to determine}} the temperature sensitivity and the ferocity under the given conditions, which can be used as the criteria to classify dust explosion hazards. The experiment results indicate that the minimum ignition temperature of coal-dust cloud reduces with the decrease of particle diameter under temperature of (293 ± 5) K and powder spraying pressure of 0. 08 MPa, and when the particle size reduces to (25 - 48) μm, the minimum ignition temperature is between (793 - 803) K; Besides that, the results can also show that minimum explosive concentration of coal-dust cloud is between 20 gám- 3 and 30 gám- 3 under temperature of (293 ± 5) K, powder spraying pressure of 2 MPa and ignition energy of 10 kJ, the maximum explosion pressure is 0. 45 MPa and the maximum explosion index is 11. 14 MPaámás- 1, which classifies coal-dust explosion hazards to Level I.
