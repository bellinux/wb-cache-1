He adopted the organizational schemes of the Colombian cartels: some employees cooked and packaged the drug, others transported and stored it, and others sold {{it on the}} streets. Others were organized into a hit squad to overpower and take drug spots from smaller but stronger gangs throughout the Bronx and Brooklyn. The DEA claimed that Polanco-Rodriguez's hit squad was responsible {{for at least five}} slayings, although there was never enough evidence to indict. His enterprise also included several family members. His half-brother, Chiqui, ran the operation when Polanco-Rodriguez was in the Dominican Republic. A second brother, Elvis, delivered stashes to street locations, and a third, Santiaguito, was a <b>cash</b> <b>courier.</b> His sister, Dulce Elizabeth, and mother, Luisa Ordalina, counted the cash and maintained apartments where the crack was kept and produced. All are now fugitives in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
