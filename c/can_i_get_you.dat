6000|$|... "That's annoying," [...] said Kells, with {{exasperation}} at himself. [...] "Where {{on earth}} <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> a dress? We're {{two hundred miles}} from everywhere. The wildest kind of country.... Say, did you ever wear a man's outfit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure, and I am {{glad the}} lady has come, Mr. Conway; though I {{would have done}} the best I could for you. Still, a man is but a poor crater in a sick-room. <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} ma'am?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh,' she shrieked with rage, 'you {{have killed}} my daughters and my husband, {{and all the}} men {{belonging}} to me; how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> at <b>you</b> to avenge myself?' ...|$|R

6000|$|Two days later, at the {{invitation}} of General Palmer, we joined his party in a trip over the short-line railway to Cripple Creek, traveling in his private car, and the luxury of this novel experience made my wife's eyes shine with girlish delight.--I professed alarm, [...] "I don't know where all this glory is going to land us," [...] I warned, [...] "after this Aladdin's-lamp luxury and leisure, how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> back into washing dishes and canning fruit in West Salem?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He stopped, and, {{suddenly}} stepping forward, {{caught the}} widow by the arm. At {{his last words}} she had started to her feet. Her face suddenly turned from pale to red--and then changed again to a ghastly whiteness. She would have fallen if Mr. Keller had not held her up. He placed her at once in his own easy chair. [...] "You must really have medical advice," [...] he said gravely; [...] "your nerves are seriously out of order. <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> anything?" ...|$|E

6000|$|WAITER. We get on {{together}} {{very well}}, very well indeed, sir, considering {{the difference in}} our stations. (With another of his irresistible transitions.) A small lump of sugar, sir, will take the flatness out of the seltzer without noticeably sweetening the drink, sir. Allow me, sir. (He drops a lump of sugar into the tumbler.) But as I say to him, where's the difference after all? If I must put on a dress coat to show what I am, sir, he must put on a wig and gown to show what he is. If my income is mostly tips, and there's a pretence that I don't get them, why, his income is mostly fees, sir; and I understand there's a pretence that he don't get them! If he likes society, and his profession brings him into contact with all ranks, so does mine, too, sir. If it's a little against a barrister to have a waiter for his father, sir, it's a little against a waiter to have a barrister for a son: many people consider it a great liberty, sir, I assure you, sir. <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> anything else, sir? ...|$|E

Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers recorded an incredible number of songs that are personal favorites of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The very thing!" [...] he said, with hopeful emphasis. [...] "I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> {{plenty of}} it to do. And I'll {{come back in the}} morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{it without}} thinking," [...] said Ingleby, who {{turned to him}} a trifle flushed in face. [...] "You're looking faint. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> some water--fortunately it's cheap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Up in the mountains, {{ten miles}} and {{more from the}} ranch. There's a trail just below here. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> home by midnight. They'll be some worried down there." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Not at all, not at all, my dear fellow. Don't mention it. We'll tide it over somehow, and I'll {{see whether}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} else to do that you're better fitted for.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jekyll," [...] said Utterson, [...] "you know me: I {{am a man}} to be trusted. Make a clean {{breast of}} this in confidence; and I make no doubt <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can have}} it out as you want it," [...] the man said; [...] "and {{anything}} <b>you</b> want outside <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> for <b>you</b> out of it. The only thing prohibited is vodka." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is very {{beautiful}} and right, Joe, and I honor you for it; {{but you were}} not meant to tend babies, so sing your last lullabies, {{and be ready to}} go to the Home as soon as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> there." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'No, no, at a restaurant. Where has Jemima put my boots? I {{wonder if}} she has cleaned them. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never tell by looking. Here they are. And my coat? Anything <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> in town? Well, good-bye, dear, good-bye!' Maude {{had never seen him}} make so hurried an exit.|$|R
6000|$|... "So now you {{understand}} why, {{as soon as}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> clear of this damned bench, I am going to tear you limb from limb.
