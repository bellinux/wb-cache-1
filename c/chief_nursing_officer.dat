Many units or wards have both a nursing and a medical director that serve as administrators for their respective disciplines within that specialty. For example, in an intensive care nursery, the director of neonatology is responsible for the medical staff and medical care while the nursing manager/director for the intensive care nursery is responsible for all of the nurses and nursing care in that unit/ward.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{realization}} of an organizational context that succeeds to retain nurses within {{their job is}} one of the most effective strategies of dealing with nursing shortages. OBJECTIVES: First, to examine the impact of nursing practice environments, nurse staffing and nurse education on nurse reported intention to leave the hospital. Second, to provide understanding of which best practices in the organization of nursing care are being implemented to provide sound practice environments and to retain nurses. METHODS: 3186 bedside nurses of 272 randomly selected nursing units in 56 Belgian acute hospitals were surveyed. A GEE logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of organization of nursing care on nurse reported intention to leave controlling for differences in region (Walloon, Flanders, and Brussels), hospital characteristics (technology level, teaching status, and size) and nurse characteristics (experience, gender, and age). For the second objective, in-depth semi-structured interviews with the <b>chief</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>officers</b> of the three high and three low performing hospitals on reported intention to leave were held. RESULTS: 29. 5 % of Belgian nurses have an intention-to-leave the hospital. Patient-to-nurse staffing ratios and nurse work environments are significantly (p< 0. 05) associated with intention-to-leave. Interviews with <b>Chief</b> <b>Nurse</b> <b>Officers</b> revealed that high performing hospitals showing low nurse retention were - in contrast to the low performing hospitals - characterized by a flat organization structure with a participative management style, structured education programs and career opportunities for nurses. CONCLUSION: This study, together with the international body of evidence, suggests that investing in improved nursing work environments is a key strategy to retain nurses. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Technology {{has changed}} how {{registered}} nurses (RNs) provide {{care at the}} bedside. As more technologies are utilized to improve quality of care, safety of care, maximize efficiencies, and decrease costs of care, one must question how well the information technologies (IT) are fully integrated and utilized by the front-line bedside nurse {{in his or her}} practice. Despite the pervasiveness of IT in healthcare, there is a paucity of literature on how <b>Chief</b> <b>Nursing</b> <b>Officers</b> (CNOs) assure the ongoing education and training for nurses to maintain IT competencies in the practice environment. From this author’s lived experience as a CNO, it is imperative {{to gain a better understanding}} of how to maintain nurses full use of IT capabilities in the electronic health record (EHR) to provide safe, quality care. This Doctor of Nursing project developed an ongoing EHR training program, for staff nurses, that was hard-wired into the organization’s educational plan. Additionally, this project was designed to increase nurses’ confidence to more effectively and efficiently navigate through the EHR and locate desired information in a timely manner for providing optimal clinical care. This DNP project identified, organized, and streamlined current resources into a sustained, multifaceted ongoing training program. Materials, guides, and lesson plans were presented in a module format with multiple educational classes offered. The “Post-Training Only Evaluation Survey Template” instrument, developed by the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice from the University of Washington, was used to assess nurses’ ability to navigate pertinent clinical information post training. The survey tool provided feedback to the project sponsor to help identify areas where the course content did not improve the trainees’ efficiency and effectiveness in using the EHR. This project provided information that will be helpful in developing future trainings and will be adopted by the facility for use by other disciplines and units. Literature provided little guidance on how to maintain nurses’ competencies in IT in the practice environment. This project served as a foundation for altering future trainings in IT, including the EHR, to better meet the needs of registered <b>nurses.</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Nursing</b> <b>Officers</b> can foster ongoing IT learning through providing supportive processes that empower nurses to acquire the knowledge and skills to be effective in their roles...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Chief</b> <b>Nursing</b> <b>Officer’s</b> {{recent review}} {{of mental health}} nursing called for the {{widespread}} involvement of mental health service users {{in the education of}} mental health nurses. This paper describes an innovative project that involved mental health service users in the education of pre-registration mental health nursing students through an online discussion forum that blended e-learning with enquiry-based learning (EBL). The findings of an evaluation are presented, drawing on quantitative and qualitative methods. Overall, the project was a success with students and service users engaging in online discussions on a range of issues. EBL presentations demonstrated understanding of the service user experience and students reflected on implications for clinical practice. All participants would take part again and recommend the online forum to others. Analysis of activity data revealed different levels and styles of student involvement. Limitations in communication skills appeared to limit student participation, alongside logistical difficulties, whereas the service users eagerly utilised the forum. Potential implications for healthcare education are discussed and recommendations made for developments in user-led e-learning and further research...|$|R
40|$|The {{supervision}} of students by qualified nurses {{is a common}} event in clinical practice. However, the continued {{supervision of}} nurses once qualified, is not so usual unless participating in a formalised course of study. It is an interesting situation that for three years prior to qualifying as a nurse, you are entitled {{to be given the}} necessary education and support to become an accountable practitioner in practice. Yet once qualified and accountable, inside the complex world of clinical practice, formalised supervision disappears after some rudimentary preparation period. In other health related disciplines such as counselling and psychotherapy, midwifery, and social work, regular feedback on clinical practice for qualified practitioners is not an unusual feature of practice. Not surprisingly, the nursing literature on the development of clinical supervision, has become interested in disciplines who regularly talk to each other about practice, in practice. The need to formalise talking to one another during worktime in order to learn, as well as support each other in practice, is legitimised by the <b>Chief</b> <b>Nursing</b> <b>Officers</b> of the UK.

40|$|Objectives: {{to explore}} nurses' {{knowledge}} of universal health coverage (UHC) for inclusive {{and sustainable development}} of elderly care services. Method: this was a cross-sectional survey. A convenience sample of 326 currently practicing enrolled nurses (EN) or registered nurses (RN) was recruited. Respondents completed a questionnaire {{which was based on}} the implementation strategies advocated by the WHO Global Forum for Governmental <b>Chief</b> <b>Nursing</b> <b>Officers</b> and Midwives (GCNOMs). Questions covered the government initiative, healthcare financing policy, human resources policy, and the respondents' perception of importance and contribution of nurses in achieving UHC in elderly care services. Results: the knowledge of nurses about UHC in elderly care services was fairly satisfactory. Nurses in both clinical practice and management perceived themselves as having more contribution and importance than those in education. They were relatively indifferent to healthcare policy and politics. Conclusion: the survey uncovered a considerable knowledge gap in nurses' knowledge of UHC in elderly care services, and shed light on the need for nurses to be more attuned to healthcare policy. The educational curriculum for nurses should be strengthened to include studies in public policy and advocacy. Nurses can make a difference through their participation in {{the development and implementation of}} UHC in healthcare services...|$|R
