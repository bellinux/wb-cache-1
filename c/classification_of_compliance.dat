40|$|History and Objectives: Long term {{treatment}} of Thalassemic major is by regular blood transfusion and infusion of an Iron chelator. The treatment is cumbersome and expensive and compliance may be low. Diabetic mellitus {{is well known}} side of chronic or acute Iron toxicity. Relationship between compliance and emergence diabetes mellitus is investigated among patients referred to the Bou-Ali Sina hospital in 1997. Materials and Methods: A case control study was carried out. Control group consisted of Thalassemic patients with normal glucose tolerance test and case group was Thalassemic patients with diabetes mellitus. 2 groups were matched for age, sex, severity of Thalassemia (Age of diagnosis, age of transfusion and degree of dependence to the transfusion), social-economic class and infection to chronic hepatitis C. Results were obtained from patient’s record. Body mass index was calculated from height and weight. All patients were from Mazandaran province and have no record of diabetes mellitus in their first-degree relatives. Compliance was assessed by a suggested system and classified. On {{the basis of this}} system, compliance was classified as good, fair and poor and compared in the control and case group. Results were analyzed by Chi-square method and odds ratio for estimation relative risk was determined. Results: Two control and case groups were similar {{on the basis of the}} above-mentioned criteria. <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> for the last year was similar but results for the last five years indicated that 79...|$|E

40|$|We propose some {{practical}} solutions for causal effects estimation when compliance to assignments is only partial {{and some of}} the standard assumptions do not hold. We follow the potential outcome approach but in contrast to Imbens and Rubin (1997), we require no prior <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>compliance</b> behaviour. When noncompliance is not ignorable, it is known that adjusting for arbitrary covariates can actually increase the estimation bias. We propose an approach where a covariate is adjusted for only when the estimate of the selection bias of the experiment as provided by that covariate is consistent with the data and prior information on the study. Next, we investigate cases when the overlap assumption does not hold and, {{on the basis of their}} covariates, some units are excluded from the experiment or equivalently, never comply with their assignments. In that context, we show that a consistent estimation of the causal effect of the treatment is possible based on a regression model estimation of the conditional expectation of the outcome given the covariates. We illustrate the methodology with several examples such as the access to influenza vaccine experiment (McDonald et al (1992) and the PROGRESA experiment (Shultz (2004)) ...|$|R

Also the present paper seeks to establish {{whether there was a}} difference in the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> between Russian and Kazakhstan firms. This study also intends to identify firm-specific factors that are associated with the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by firms in these countries. IFRS-compliant financial reports of 37 Russian and 17 Kazakhstan companies which disclosed the existence of goodwill were investigated. The level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> was measured by comparing actual disclosures made by firms with those required by IAS 36. The results indicate a generally improving trend in the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Russian and Kazakhstan firms. However, findings suggest the existence of an unwillingness to comply with IAS 36 requirements by managers in those countries. Also the results show a higher level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Russian firms compared to that of Kazakhstan companies which may be attributed to contrasting approaches to IFRS adoption in Russia and Kazakhstan. Research findings provide evidence of a positive association of the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Russian firms with firm goodwill intensity. The level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Kazakhstan firms appears to be positively associated with firm size. The research suggests a lack <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> enforcement in Russia and Kazakhstan.

40|$|Background and Discussion: The {{adoption}} of the IFRS by Swedish companies was an arduous task which required {{a lot of resources}} and time. The regulations that the IFRS contain are more complex and require more extensive disclosures than Swedish companies are used to. It can be a difficult task for companies to comply with IAS 36 disclosure requirements {{and at the same time}} not to disclose too much of a company’s specific information. The importance of disclosure should not be underestimated, as more disclosures lead to lower cost of capital. Recent studies show that disclosures about goodwill impairment testing provided by companies are too general and not sufficient to enable users of financial statements to assess the reliability of goodwill impairment testing. Research Question: The research question of this thesis is to what extent company characteristics may explain the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36. In order to measure the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance,</b> the examination <b>of</b> goodwill impairment accounting practices has been conducted. Methodology: The research question has been addressed using an empirical approach with an emphasis on note-form disclosures in the 2011 and 2011 / 2012 consolidated financial statements of Swedish firms listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. This study has examined relationships between company-specific, institutional and goodwill-related company characteristics and degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36 with the help of multiple regression analysis. The degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> in this study is measured by a self-constructed index. Results and conclusions: The study has shown that a combination of examined company characteristics explain only about 9 % of the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36. Regarding company-specific characteristics, this study has indicated that company size has a significant impact of the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements as larger companies seem to have a higher degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance.</b> No significant relationships between company performance and degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> as well as between financial needs and degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> have been found in this study. The study has further indicated that degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements regarding goodwill impairment tests varies across industries and auditor firms. Finally, the results of this study show that goodwill-related characteristics do not seem to have a significant impact on the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements, as no significant relationships between the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> and the amount of goodwill on the balance sheet of the company and the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> and the goodwill impairment rate were found...|$|R
