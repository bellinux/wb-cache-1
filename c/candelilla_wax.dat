50|$|<b>Candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> {{can be used}} as a {{substitute}} for carnauba wax and beeswax. It is also used for making varnish.|$|E
50|$|The white sap of E. antisyphilitica was {{historically}} used in Mexico {{to treat}} sexually-transmitted diseases. Commercial harvesting of <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> {{began at the}} start of the twentieth century, with demand greatly increasing during World War I and II. This industry largely disappeared following the end of World War II due to diminished candelilla populations and the availability of cheaper petroleum-based waxes.Later on however, new uses were found for the wax mainly in the cosmetic and food Industries, and it is still being produced in northern Mexico and exported to other countries. See the <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> article.|$|E
50|$|Euphorbia antisyphilitica is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the spurge family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Trans-Pecos of Texas and southern New Mexico in the United States as well as Chihuahua, Coahuila, Hidalgo, and Querétaro in Mexico. Common names include <b>candelilla</b> and <b>wax</b> plant, but the latter is more often applied {{to members of the}} unrelated genus Hoya. It is shrubby and has densely clustered, erect, essentially leafless stems that are covered in wax to prevent transpiration.|$|R
40|$|From Introduction: Wax and wax-like {{substances}} {{have been}} defined in many ways. One reasonably extensive definition, by Hatt and Lamberton (1956) is given below: "The term "wax" seems best used to denote {{a group of}} substances which qualitatively have certain physical properties in common. These properties are familiar ones, for in almost all countries some natural wax - beeswax, Japan wax, Chinese insect wax, the carnauba and <b>candelilla</b> <b>waxes</b> of the Americas - {{has been an important}} material in art and industry from prehistoric times. Waxes are understood to be opaque or translucent solids, which melt without decomposition to form mobile liquids at temperatures in the region of 100 ⁰C. They differ in hardness, but are all essentially soft substances with poor mechanical strength. Most waxes can be easily shaped or kneaded at a little above ambient temperatures. In fact, the term could easily have been made to cover the whole class now named thermoplastics. " Pure n-paraffins would be too crystalline and brittle for use as waxes, whereas mixtures of n-paraffins have some valuable properties. The molecules bear such close resemblance to one another that they form mixed crystals of lowered crystallinity and the melting point {{is a function of the}} mean molecular weight. This is a desirable feature for it permits crystallinity and brittleness to be reduced without a marked loss in the melting point or hardness. It also allows a mixture to simulate a pure compound very closely. Waxes, in general, have been put to a large number of uses. They are used, for example, in candles, polishes, paper-coating, plastics, printing, matches, rust protectants and insulation. Each application requires its own appropriate range of wax properties...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} laminar smoke points of candle flames is presented. A smoke {{point is the}} flame length just {{before the onset of}} visible smoke release. Adjustable wicks with diameters of 2 - 7. 6 mm were used to measure smoke points in quiescent air for 14 different waxes. The measured smoke points varied from 36 - 89 mm and increased with wick diameter. Smoke points fitted to a wick diameter of 4 mm increased from consumer-grade <b>waxes</b> (<b>candelilla,</b> carnauba, beeswax, paraffin) to alkanes (hexatriacontane, octacosane, tetracosane) to alcohols (octadecanol, docosanol, hexadecanol) to acids (stearic, palmitic, lauric, myristic). Within each wax family, a decrease in carbon number yielded an increased smoke point. Soot emission was not possible for any fuel when the wick diameter was below 1. 8 mm or when wick length was below 6 mm. The results suggest new ways of producing cleaner burning candles...|$|R
50|$|<b>Candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> is a wax {{derived from}} {{the leaves of the}} small Candelilla shrub native to {{northern}} Mexico and the southwestern United States, Euphorbia cerifera and Euphorbia antisyphilitica, from the family Euphorbiaceae. It is yellowish-brown, hard, brittle, aromatic, and opaque to translucent.|$|E
50|$|In 1914, W.K. Ellis and C.D. Wood {{established}} a wax factory on the embankment of Glenn Springs employing a {{population in the}} mountainous Chihuahuan Desert region. By 1916, the candelillero factory was composed of a boiler room with tall smoke stacks, six large extraction vats, and a water storage system {{for the production of}} <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{is mostly}} used mixed with other waxes to harden them without raising their melting point. As a food additive, <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> has the E number E 902 {{and is used}} as a glazing agent. It also finds use in {{cosmetic}} industry, as a component of lip balms and lotion bars. One of its major uses is as a binder for chewing gums.|$|E
40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1981 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Assn. and the Hydrology Section - Arizona - Nevada Academy of Science - May 1 - 2, 1981, Tucson, ArizonaA {{vegetable}} <b>wax</b> (<b>candelilla),</b> {{alone or}} in combination with petroleum waxes, was evaluated for treating soils for water harvesting. Samples were alternately weathered in a freeze -thaw cycle chamber, tested for water repellency and structural stability against water erosion, then subjected to more weathering, etc., until sample failure occurred. Soils treated with candelilla/paraffin wax mixtures were much more resistant to laboratory freeze -thaw cycle weathering than those soils treated with either of the waxes alone. Weatherability was further improved, and wax requirement reduced by (1) prior stabilization of the soil with cellulose xanthate made from chemically pulped waste paper; (2) incorporating 28 of a commercial antistripping agent into the wax; and (3) substituting a residual type petroleum wax for the paraffin in the wax mixtures...|$|R
5000|$|With {{a melting}} point of 68.5-72.5 °C, <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> {{consists}} of mainly hydrocarbons (about 50%, chains with 29-33 carbons), esters of higher molecular weight (20-29%), free acids (7-9%), and resins (12-14%, mainly triterpenoid esters). The high hydrocarbon content distinguishes this wax from carnauba wax. [...] It is insoluble in water, but soluble in many organic solvents such as acetone, chloroform, benzene, and Turpentine.|$|E
50|$|Lipstick {{contains}} wax, oils, antioxidants and emollients. Wax {{provides the}} structure to the solid lipstick. Lipsticks {{may be made}} from several waxes such as beeswax, ozokerite and <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax.</b> Because of its high melting point, Carnauba wax is a key ingredient in terms of strengthening the lipstick. Various oils and fats are used in lipsticks, such as olive oil, mineral oil, cocoa butter, lanolin, and petrolatum.|$|E
50|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century through World War II, the Terlingua Mining District was a boom town due to the {{extraction}} of cinnabar, a mercury ore, in the Chisos Mountains.Silver and lead from mines on the Mexican side of the river in the Boquillas area were shipped north, as were <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> produced at factories at Glenn Spring and Mariscal and the guayule rubber from a factory in Marathon.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{emulsions}} based on different waxes and blends thereof are available, depending on the final application. Waxes that are found in wax emulsions can be of natural or synthetic origin. Common non-fossil natural waxes are carnaubawax, beeswax, <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> or ricebran wax. Paraffin, microcrystalline and montanwax are the most used fossil natural waxes that are found in emulsions. Synthetic waxes that are used include (oxidised) LDPE and HDPE, maelic grafted PP and Fischer-Tropsch waxes.|$|E
50|$|Plants secrete waxes {{into and}} {{on the surface of}} their cuticles as a way to control evaporation, {{wettability}} and hydration. The epicuticular waxes of plants are mixtures of substituted long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, containing alkanes, alkyl esters, fatty acids, primary and secondary alcohols, diols, ketones, aldehydes. From the commercial perspective, the most important plant wax is carnauba wax, a hard wax obtained from the Brazilian palm Copernicia prunifera. Containing the ester myricyl cerotate, it has many applications, such as confectionery and other food coatings, car and furniture polish, floss coating, and surfboard wax. Other more specialized vegetable waxes include <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> and ouricury wax.|$|E
5000|$|Boquillas and Glenn Springs {{were just}} small {{settlements}} at the time, about 12 miles apart, and only nine {{soldiers from the}} 14th Cavalry guarded at the former and none at the latter. Glenn Springs was located just south of Chilicotal Mountain and centered around a small spring named after the first settler in the area who was killed at the site by Comanches. The town was home to some 80 people, who were employed mainly by a <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> factory, owned by [...] "Captain" [...] C.D. Wood and W.K. Ellis. The Ellis family also owned the general store, which was managed by C.G. Compton and his family. The inhabitants, who were mostly Mexican-Americans, lived in a [...] "scattered" [...] neighborhood of about 50 jacales concentrated {{at one end of}} town. Boquillas was even smaller than Glenn Springs. Located along the Rio Grande, across from the mining town of Del Carmen, Boquillas had a general store, owned by Jesse Deemer, and several jacales.|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources {{added to}} Food (ANS) {{delivers}} a scientific opinion re-evaluating {{the safety of}} <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> (E 902). <b>Candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> (E 902) is authorised in the EU as a food additive as a glazing agent. It has been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The JECFA and the SCF did not establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) but considered the use of <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> as a glazing agent acceptable. <b>Candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> is obtained from leaves of candelilla plants Euphorbia antisyphilitica found in semi-desert regions. It is a complex mixture composed of wax hydrocarbons, wax, resin esters, lactones, free wax resin alcohols, and free wax resin acids. The Panel considered that absorption of <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> {{is expected to be}} low, and that upon absorption the components would be incorporated into normal metabolic pathways. The Panel noted that there were limited data comparing the composition of the <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> tested with the specification of the food additive. However the Panel considered that the materials tested were likely to be broadly similar in composition to the food additive. Overall, the Panel considered that the available data suggest that <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> is not genotoxic. The Panel considered that long-term toxicity data on <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> were lacking and therefore did not establish an ADI. However, the Panel noted that available toxicity studies consistently reported no findings associated with intake of the main components constituting <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax.</b> Furthermore, consideration of the exposure estimates to <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax,</b> using the Maximum Permitted Level (MPL) of carnauba wax, indicated sufficient margins of safety. This allowed the Panel to conclude that the use of <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern...|$|E
40|$|The oleogels of {{canola oil}} with <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> were {{prepared}} and utilized as a shortening replacer to produce cookies {{with a high}} level of unsaturated fatty acids. The incorporation of <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> (3 % and 6 % by weight) to canola oil produced the oleogels with solid-like properties. The firmness of the oleogels was lower than that of the shortening at room temperature. A more rapid change in the viscosity with temperature was observed with increasing levels of <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> in the steady shear measurements. The replacement of shortening with oleogels in the cookie formulation reduced both viscoelastic parameters (G′ and G″) of the cookie doughs. The level of unsaturated fatty acids in the oleogel cookies was distinctly increased up to around 92 %, compared to the shortening cookies (47. 2 %). The cookies with the oleogels showed desirable spreadable property and the replacement of shortening with the oleogels produced cookies with soft eating characteristics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An edible coating {{functionalized}} with pomegranate polyphenols was designed. Different blends of <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax,</b> gum arabic, jojoba oil, and pomegranate polyphenols were {{formulated in}} order to improve the shelf life quality of pears (variety Bartlett), and all formulations were applied by immersion onto the fruit surface. Coated pears with and without polyphenols and uncoated pears (control) were stored under the same conditions. Fruits were analyzed to evaluate changes in their physicochemical, microbiological, and sensorial properties during 30 days of storage at room temperature. Coated pears coded as T 13 (<b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> 3 %, gum arabic 4 %, jojoba oil 0. 15 %, and pomegranate polyphenols 0. 015 %) extended and improved their shelf life quality due to the minimization of the physic-chemical changes and sensorial properties. Therefore, the results indicated that the formulated edible coating has potential to extend the shelf life and maintain quality of pears.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} {{addition}} of ellagic acid (at three different concentrations) into <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> matrix on shelf life and quality of whole avocados was studied. Control treatments were avocados coated with <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> without ellagic acid and avocados without coating. The fruits were chosen for their maturity, size, free from infection and physical defects. All those samples were inoculated with a concentrated suspension of spores of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, the main phytopathogenic fungus for avocados. Experiments were carried out completely divided into randomized groups. Changes in appearance, solids content, pH, aw, lightness (L* value) and weight loss were monitored during 6 weeks every 8 days. A sensory evaluation of avocados coated with the best edible film was also performed. Edibel films were able to reduce significantly {{the damage caused by}} C. gloeosporioides, reducing also significantly the change in appearance and weight loss in the fruits. Use of ellagic acid as part of the edible film has an important effect to improve the quality and shelf life of avocado.

40|$|Wax-based edible {{coatings}} for strawberry fruit were formulated and optimized. The {{weight loss}} was the preliminary quality parameter {{for determining the}} appropriate composition of the waxbased coating. Different combinations of wax to coconut oil ratio and amount of ethanol were performed to create a coating solution {{that would result in}} reduction of the weight loss while giving a desirable appearance. After conducting the preliminary study, it was concluded that the combination of 4 wax: 1 coconut oil in 70 mL ethanol was the best combination in order to significantly reduce the weight loss. Beewax and <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> were used as the wax-basis, with coconut oil in the ratio 4 : 1. Both types of coating were applied onto strawberry fruits and these were evaluated for weight loss, surface color, ascorbic acid content, decay incidence, yeasts and mold count. A sensory evaluation was also performed. Strawberries were stored for 10 days at 10 ºC. Both wax-based coatings produced significant reduction in weight loss in comparison to the uncoated fruits. Furthermore, a significant decrease of 20 % and 15 % in the reduction of ascorbic acid was noted on the 7 th day of storage, for beewax - coconut oil coating and <b>candelilla</b> <b>wax</b> - coconut oil coating, respectively. The presence of mycelial growth often dictates the shelf-life of the strawberry fruit. In this study, a significant reduction in the decay incidence was observed both in beewax-coconut oil and candelilla wax-coconut oil coating. This was further supported by the lower yeast and mold count obtained for the coatings used. The changes in color between coated and uncoated fruits were not significantly different except for the L*value with higher values for coated fruits. In the sensory evaluation of the uncoated and coated fruits, judges also distinguished the color between the control and the treated fruits, after two days of storage at 4 ºC. Significant differences were also noticed between fruits coated with candelilla wax- coconut oil and the control, regarding other sensory parameters. However, there were not significant differences between beewax-coconut oil based coating and the uncoated fruits. Edible wax-based coating of beewax-coconut oil and candelilla wax-coconut oil could help to extend the shelf life of strawberry since after 10 days of storage the yeasts and molds count was 4. 0 × 105 cfu/g and 5. 3 × 105 cfu/g for beewax-based and candelilla wax-based coated samples, respectively, lower than 9. 4 × 107 cfu/g for the uncoated ones. However, those counts are still high, indicating a shelf life of beewax-based and candelilla wax-based coated strawberries shorter than 10 days...|$|E
