5|$|Ranavalona's 33-year reign was {{characterized}} by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the Kingdom of Imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and <b>cultural</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of Madagascar. These policies were enacted {{in a context of}} increasing European influence within her kingdom and competing French and English bids for domination over the island. Early in her reign, the queen took incremental steps to distance Madagascar from the purview of European powers, first putting an end to a friendship treaty with Britain, then placing increasing restrictions on the activities of the missionaries of the London Missionary Society, who operated schools where basic education and trade skills were taught in addition to the Christian religion. In 1835 she forbade the practice of Christianity among the Malagasy population, and within a year nearly all foreigners had left her territory.|$|E
5|$|The queen's foreign contemporaries {{strongly}} condemned her {{policies and}} viewed {{them as the}} actions of a tyrant or even a madwoman, a characterization that persisted in Western historical literature until the 1970s. Although Ranavalona has traditionally been depicted as a cruel and xenophobic tyrant, in more recent historical analyses she is commonly viewed as an astute politician who effectively protected the political and <b>cultural</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of her nation from European encroachment. In Madagascar today, the Malagasy of the central highlands hold complex and diverse views ranging across this spectrum. Most condemn her reign, in line with negative depictions of Ranavalona in current Malagasy history textbooks; this view is most common among Malagasy Christians. Others admire her effort to preserve Malagasy traditions and independence. The majority, regardless of their feelings toward her domestic policies, consider her a remarkable figure in Malagasy history and commend her strength as a ruler in a period of tension with European powers.|$|E

In addition, the Chumash were roughly divided into 8 separate linguistic groups.

The Chumash weren’t a <b>cultural</b> or linguistic <b>sovereignty</b> in the traditional sense; they were a conglomeration of autonomous settlements. Most recording of Chumash narratives occurred through anthropological study, specifically Harrington’s papers.|$|R

However, the Irish Catholic movements of the 16th century were invariably led by a small landed and clerical elite. Professor Kevin Whelan has traced the emergence of the modern Catholic-nationalist identity that formed in 1760-1830.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 07 For centuries, the Coast Salish peoples {{have been}} one of the most visible {{political}} actors in the Environmental Justice Movement of the state of Washington. However, despite their strong advocacy for environmental justice, environmental justice policies continue to dismiss <b>cultural</b> values, tribal <b>sovereignty,</b> and community mapping. This thesis aims to document several environmental justice cases that have occurred in the Pacific Northwest U. S. (PNW) against or in favor of the Coast Salish peoples since the 1960 ’s Fish Wars. The environmental justice cases will consist of both environmental victories and injustices that impact and affect the Washington state tribes. For the purposes of this thesis, environmental justice is defined as a theory and framework utilized to describe grassroots movements led by communities of color to protect and advocate for their well-being, livelihoods, resilience and Mother Earth. The environmental justice cases documented in this study will be utilized to develop an environmental justice atlas and website. The environmental justice cases will be coded to determine the indigenous pillars of environmental justice for the Pacific Northwest U. S. The indigenous pillars of environmental justice will identify the important tribal and cultural values for the Coast Salish tribes and nations. These indigenous pillars of environmental justice will allow policy-makers to shift from distributive, process,procedural and recognition justice by incorporating <b>cultural</b> values, tribal <b>sovereignty,</b> and community mapping. It is important to acknowledge that environmental justice is a complex issue in Indian Country, therefore, there are no simple solutions to address environmental justice provided in this thesis, but rather initial tools to start building, adapting, and applying the environmental justice concept to the specific context of the indigenous experiences in the United States...|$|R

A Board of Governors composed of distinguished individuals from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors guides the evaluation process, in which up to ten programs are selected for “High Honors” or “Honors.” All honorees receive national recognition.

To facilitate the dissemination of best practices, honorees receive financial awards to share their success story with other governments.

30|$|Then, {{it is also}} key {{to point}} out that {{resistance}} and resurgence through culture are also tied to the complex notion of sovereignty, and to the specific interpretation indigenous people have of the concept, which competes with the American understanding of it as shaped by spatial and temporal boundaries produced by a definite paradigm of binary narratives and images. The American interpretation hence emphasizes ‘the efforts of the citizens, institutions and government of the United States to restrain indigenous people seeking to maintain and secure their cultural, economic and political practices over time’. Using the loopholes of the Western application of the idea, Native Americans claim sovereignty as being ‘the ability of a group of people {{to make their own decisions}} and control their own lives in relation to the space where they reside or that they envision as their own’, to shape a modern status on their own term. Therefore, as a category of scholarship, activism, governance, and <b>cultural</b> work, <b>sovereignty</b> matters in consequential ways to understanding the political agendas, strategies, and cultural perspectives of indigenous peoples in the Americas. Following World War II, sovereignty emerged as a particularly valued term within indigenous scholarship and social movements as well as through cultural production. It was a term through which indigenous intellectuals and artists represented their histories, cultures, and identities, often in opposition to the erasures of their sovereignty by dominant ideologies of race, culture, and nationalism coined in the discourses of American patriotism and settler colonialism (Bruyneel 2004, 12).|$|R
