40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} outsourcing in which {{the circumstances under which}} factors of production can grab rents play the leading role. One factor has monopoly power (call this labor) while a second factor does not (call this capital). There are two kinds of production tasks: labor-intensive and capital-intensive. We show that if frictions limiting outsourcing are not too large, in equilibrium labor-intensive tasks are separated from capital-intensive tasks into distinct firms. When a <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>country</b> is opened to free trade, outsourcing increases and labor rents decline. A decrease in outsourcing frictions lowers labor rents.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the effects of trade liberalisation on the firm-level profit-enhancing effects of mergers and its dependence on whether the technology is labour intensive or capital-intensive, under an oligopolistic competition framework. Mergers, as considered in this paper, cause an increase in the firm-level profits. The extent to which they enhance the profits is inversely proportional to the number of firms in the country. With a freer trade, the profit effect of mergers depends on the extent to which the fall in profit due to fall in price outweighs the gain in profit due to increased output. A firm in the <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>country</b> can gain more from a merger than one in the labour-intensive country, if the aggregate output is at sufficiently large scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the effects of trade liberalization on profits of a capital-intensive exporting country and a labour-intensive one with different cost functions and the welfare of the importing country under an oligopolistic competition framework. The results show that output is increasing in the degree of trade liberalization and price falls with it. However, the effects of freer trade on profits of the exporting countries are ambiguous and depend on the net gains in profit from free trade. Given the same level of output for both countries, a suffciently high output would bring more profits to the <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>country</b> than to the labour-intensive country. Welfare of the importing country, at least within this framework, is increasing in the degree of trade liberalization, provided that the initial level of restrictions in trade are not too high. ...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{financial}} crisis of 1997, Southeast Asia’s fast recovery and continued development has surprised the world. This paper investigates national productivity of the ten Southeast Asian countries. The high national productivity explains why the economy of this region developed steadily after {{the financial}} crisis. From the viewpoint of labor productivity and capital productivity, the ten countries are classified as high-productivity, low-productivity, labor-intensive, and <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>countries.</b> Together with another indicator used by many economists to represent living standards, GDP per capita, the Southeast Asian countries are categorized into four types: fast growing-moderate living standards, fast growing-low living standards, stable growing-high living standards, and slow growing-low living standards. Categorization into corresponding groups facilitates subsequent inference regarding their characteristics and stage of economic development. More importantly, weak areas are identified for future improvement...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} mixed {{economic}} results and huge distributional changes experienced by post-Soviet economies, I {{set up a}} series of theoretical and numerical simulation models using an approach based upon heterogeneous firms, where 'reform' means closure of inefficient capacity. In the presence of significant costs to new firm entry and international capital mobility, restructuring and privatisation can lead to falls in GDP and real wages, while capital is transferred abroad. This situation can occur even under perfect competition, but is worse when industrial production is concentrated and trade costs are high. By contrast, workers can gain when costs of establishing new firms are low, and/or when the inefficient industries are <b>capital-intensive.</b> For <b>countries</b> with high costs of firm set-up and of trade, capital controls may be justified to protect wages. Transition, wages, general equilibrium,...|$|R
40|$|Various {{recent works}} {{have sought to}} {{understand}} how endogenous trade dynamics impact international capital flows. In integrating structures of trade into macroeconomic frameworks, one can show that capital can flow from labor-intensive, poor <b>countries</b> to <b>capital-intensive,</b> rich <b>countries</b> upon financial and trade liberalization (Jin, K., in press. Industrial structure and capital flows. American Economic Review). Trade and capital flows can become complements rather than substitutes – contrary to the Heckscher–Ohlin–Mundell prediction – when economies differ in financial development, as shown by Antras and Caballero (Antras, P., Caballero, R. J., 2009. Trade and capital flows: a financial frictions perspective. Journal of Political Economy, 117 (4), 701 – 744), and that an economy's current account adjustment to shocks can depend on its degree of labor market rigidity, as in Ju and Wei. These papers contribute to the burgeoning literature that marries theories of trade and international macroeconomics...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, large labor {{intensive}} countries, like China, {{have played a}} growing role in world trade. Using the factor proportions theory, this paper investigates the dynamic effects of economic growth consequent to international trade between countries with different factor proportions. I present a complete characterization of the equilibrium dynamics with initial factor endowments outside the cone of diversification where factor prices are not equalized and either {{one or both of}} the countries specialize. I Â…find that while a small country can grow without the retarding force of a terms-of-trade deterioration, a large, <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>country</b> can experience terms-of-trade deteriorations, as a consequence of trading with a large, labor-intensive partner. These terms-of-trade effects have consequences over growth and the pattern of specialization in production. For instance, the capital stock of the poor country can overshoot its long-run steady state. However, at the steady state, the labor intensive country will always remain poorer compared to the capital intensive country. The model can also help to explain why countries experience non-monotonic changes in their pattern of specialization as they grow, why countries do not converge to the same steady state level of income, and why non-factor price equalizations might be the most likely outcome after all. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{wisdom is}} that the nature and {{the causes of the}} {{informal}} sector in transition economies are the same as in developing countries. This paper challenges this wisdom. First, it argues that their natures differ: while informal activities in transition economies are <b>capital-intensive,</b> in developing <b>countries</b> they are labor-intensive. Second, it argues that the main cause of the transition shadow is not excessive government intervention (as in developing countries), but the lack of a rule of law tradition. The paper articulates this alternative view and provides econometric evidence that endorses it as a more promising research avenue...|$|R
40|$|Economics Research Paper, no. 04 - 16 Post-Soviet {{restructuring}} {{has produced}} mixed economic results. In general, {{the more advanced}} countries, which have now joined the European Union, have fared better, while those further East in the CIS have seen a combination of rapid falls in measured gross domestic product and wages, followed by prolonged recession, while the large gains to a wealthy minority who gained from privatisations have largely been reinvested abroad, following capital flight. I set {{up a series of}} theoretical and numerical simulation models, based upon a batting order approach where reform means closure of inefficient capacity. In the presence of significant costs to new firm entry and international capital mobility, restructuring and privatisation can lead to falls in GDP and real wages, while capital is transferred abroad. This situation can occur even under perfect competition, but is worse when industrial production is concentrated and trade costs are high. By contrast, workers can gain when costs of establishing new firms are low, and/or when the inefficient industries are <b>capital-intensive.</b> For <b>countries</b> with high costs of firm setup and of trade, capital controls may be justified to protect wages...|$|R
40|$|Many {{previous}} studies {{based on a}} simple model of heterogeneous firms have identified characteristics of multinational firms engaging in export or foreign direct investment (FDI). While they focused mainly on firms that serve developed countries, this study analyzes both firms serving developing countries {{as well as those}} serving developed countries. The purpose was to identify the determining factors of firms' decision to either export or provide FDI. The results of our analyses indicated that the determining factors differ according to characteristics of the destination country; they differ between the two cases. In accordance with {{previous studies}}, firms that served developed countries were found to base their decision on the productivity level. On the other hand, firms that served developing countries were found to base their decision primarily on the capital-labor ratio, and secondarily on the productivity level. Thus, among the firms serving developing <b>countries,</b> <b>capital-intensive</b> firms chose to export while labor-intensive firms chose to provide FDI, regardless of the productivity level, and only firms with a mid-value capital-labor ratio based their decision on the productivity level. These findings, which were supported by empirical evidence derived from Japanese manufacturing firm-level data, indicated that productivity level is not as significant a factor for firms serving developing countries as it is for firms serving developed countries. ...|$|R

This study deals with import demand and export supply functions for Korea and Japan with emphasis on the investigation of the relationships among imports, exports, and other inputs or outputs. The analysis is based on a three-input (imports, labor services, and capital services), three-output (exports, consumption goods, and investment goods) model. A translog restricted profit function is used as a basis for deriving the estimating equations via Hotelling's Lemma. This procedure yields estimating equations which are largely free of a priori restrictions implicit in most of the empirical literature in the area. This treatment of imports and exports within a consistent theoretical framework yields price elasticities of imports and exports as well as the determination of substitution possibilities among imports, exports, and domestic inputs or outputs. A term for technical change is included in the function; and the model also permits the measuring of technical-change bias. To characterize the effects of technical change, the growth of equilibrium input demand is attributed to changes in output prices, changes in fixed inputs, and technical change. The results of the study based on the Korean data (1965 - 1980) and the Japanese data (1958 - 1978) show that exports and investment goods as well as investment goods and consumption goods are substitutes in production for both countries. The price elasticities of import demand are higher than those in other studies, and the price elasticities of export supply seem to be lower than those of other studies. In addition, exports are relatively import-intensive and <b>capital-intensive</b> in both <b>countries.</b> Labor and capital are definitely substitutes in both economies. Technical changes in both countries are labor saving and biased against imports. Important policy implications are derivable from these results: an increase in capital stock produced domestically while others hold constant yields an increase in exports and a decrease in imports with a favorable effect on the trade balance for both countries. Our results also imply that the devaluations of the Korean won and the Japanese yen will yield a relative increase in the rate of return to capital and an improvement in trade balance...|$|R
