5|$|A sale of 1,000 coins {{was made}} to an {{executive}} of the Hudson's Bay Company, and they {{were placed in the}} Archives of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. They were stolen in 1982 by a caretaker, who spent them and redeemed some for Canadian currency at a bank. Many wound {{up in the hands of}} a <b>coin</b> <b>dealer,</b> who sold them widely. At the time, the coins were worth about US$800 each. Once the theft was realized, the Province of Manitoba filed suit to recover the remaining coins, but a settlement allowed the dealer to retain them.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint struck 20,000 gold {{dollars in}} August and October 1916, plus 26 extra {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1917 meeting of the United States Assay Commission. In February 1917, 10,000 more (plus 14 assay coins) were minted, again at Philadelphia. The Association sold these {{to the public at}} $3 each, the same price at which the Louisiana Purchase pieces, which sold poorly, had been vended. The McKinley Memorial pieces were ill-publicized, and few were sold at full price. Texas <b>coin</b> <b>dealer</b> B. Max Mehl purchased 10,000 pieces at an unknown price, selling them for years afterwards at $2.50 each.|$|E
5|$|Class III {{dollars are}} {{identical}} to the Class II dollar, except lettering similar to that on the Class I dollars {{was applied to the}} edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the Class III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately the same time as the Class II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia <b>coin</b> <b>dealer</b> John W. Haseltine. Six specimens of the Class III dollar are known today.|$|E

5|$|The coins {{were also}} {{sold by the}} Springfield Chamber of Commerce at $1 each, though some were {{eventually}} vended for less: Texas <b>coin</b> <b>dealer</b> B. Max Mehl purchased several thousand at just over face value. A local bank held 30,000 of them for 15 years, and sold them during the 1933 Bank Holiday for a slight advance on par. This temporarily flooded the market, but they were absorbed during the first commemorative coin boom in 1936, though the price did not then rise from the $1.25 they had sold for since about 1925. At {{the height of the}} second commemorative coin boom in 1980, uncirculated specimens sold for about $300. The edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins published in 2017 lists the coin for between $130 and $685, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $7,040.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Head nickel was {{replaced}} after 1912, and initially {{there was no}} indication that 1913-dated pieces with that design existed. In December 1919, a <b>coin</b> <b>dealer,</b> Samuel W. Brown, placed advertisements in coin publications, offering to buy 1913 Liberty Head nickels. The following August, Brown appeared at the annual American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention bearing such a piece. Brown claimed that a master die had been prepared for 1913 and that these pieces had been run off to test it. As it turned out, Brown possessed five coins, which he eventually sold. After spending fifteen years {{in the hands of the}} eccentric Col. E.H.R. Green, the famous Fort Worth, Texas, area collector, the coins were finally dispersed in 1943. Since then, they have had several owners each. Today, two are on public display—at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the ANA's Money Museum in Colorado Springs, while three are owned privately. The most recent sale of a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was in January 2010, when one sold for $3,737,500 in an auction.|$|E
5|$|The {{precious}} metal composition of US coins was calculated such that gold would be fifteen times as valuable per ounce as silver. By {{the turn of}} the 19th century, the price of gold in terms of silver had risen to approximately 15.75 to one. This made it profitable for merchants to buy gold coins at face value using silver coins, and export the gold to Europe. Gold vanished from circulation in the United States by 1800. By 1801, almost no bullion was being deposited at the Mint, causing the Jefferson administration to consider its closure. The eagle was especially desired by exporters, as the larger size and value made it more convenient to handle. Although the Mint remained open, on December 31, 1804, President Thomas Jefferson ordered that eagles and silver dollars no longer be struck, ending the Turban Head eagle series. <b>Coin</b> <b>dealer</b> and author Q. David Bowers suggests that while a majority of eagles remained in the United States, enough were exported to make continuing their mintage an exercise in futility.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} numismatists {{became aware of}} 1804 dollars, they have {{commanded}} high prices, both {{in relation to their}} face value and the numismatic value of other silver dollars. Some early examples were maintained in the Mint's coin cabinet for use in trades, and in 1859, dealers began offering Class II dollars priced at $75, while Theodore Eckfeldt reportedly offered a Philadelphia <b>coin</b> <b>dealer</b> three coins for $70 each. In 1883, a Class III dollar was reportedly purchased in Vienna for $740, and a Class I specimen was auctioned for $1,000 in 1885 by Henry and Samuel H. Chapman. In 1903, an example sold for $1,800, and the same coin reportedly sold for $4,250 in 1941. In 1960, a Class III dollar fetched $28,000 at an auction conducted by Stack's, a coin firm, and the same coin reached $36,000 at another Stack's sale in 1963. A Class I specimen brought $77,500 at a 1970 Stack's, and during a 1980 rise in coin prices, a Class III example sold for $400,000 by Bowers and Ruddy Galleries. A Class I example reached $990,000 at a Superior Galleries auction in 1990, and an example once owned by coin collector Louis Eliasberg became the first 1804 dollar to surpass $1 million at auction, selling for $1,815,000 at a sale conducted by Bowers and Merena, Inc., in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Sparked by low-mintage {{issues which}} {{appreciated}} in value, {{the market for}} United States commemorative coins spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits {{to be made by}} purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Among the pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was the 1935 Old Spanish Trail half dollar. This piece had been issued at the behest of L. W. Hoffecker, a Texas entrepreneur and <b>coin</b> <b>dealer,</b> who put aside a fifth of the 10,000 mintage for himself and sold them well into the 1940s, by which time he had {{served as president of the}} American Numismatic Association (ANA). Congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fair}} closed, the {{question}} remained {{what to do}} with the some 4,600,000 half dollars which had not been sold. Organizers did not wish them to be issued, to preserve the premium price paid by purchasers. Those remaining in the Company's hands were redeemed by the Mint, which melted them; the fee for this service was forgiven by act of Congress. The coins which had been impounded by the Treasury were offered for sale at face value beginning in October 1894; when there were few takers, they were released into circulation. A million coins held by the Chicago banks were also placed in circulation. Although 2,501,700 half dollars were melted (all dated 1893), this still left a like number of Columbians in public hands. <b>Coin</b> <b>dealer</b> and numismatic historian Q. David Bowers recalls that when he began collecting coins as a boy in the 1950s, the Columbians were among the most common 19th-century pieces remaining in circulation. It was not until the 1930s that the pieces, in uncirculated condition, commanded the original price of $1. Prices began to rise as silver coins were replaced by base metal ones in the 1960s. In the 2012 version of Yeoman's catalog, both pieces are listed at under $20 in almost uncirculated (AU-50) condition, with specimens in near-pristine MS-66 selling for over a thousand dollars.|$|E

5|$|The first {{shooting}} thalers were cantonal pieces, minted by {{the sovereign}} cantons of Switzerland. All of these pieces, {{as well as}} the 1855 Solothurn issue, were strictly legal tender. Nineteenth-century Confederation shooting thaler issues were minted to legal fineness, and were thus allowed to bear the denomination of five francs. Beginning in 1865, Switzerland {{became a member of the}} Latin Monetary Union. Shooting thalers were not included in the mintages authorized by the Union. Therefore, these issues are commonly considered semi-medallic, though they could circulate due to their size and weight being the same as that of the regular five franc issues. This series of shooting thalers, following the standards of the Latin Monetary Union, began in 1855 with the Solothurn issue and ended in 1885 with the Bern issue. In 1927, the Monetary Union ceased to exist. Mintage began on a new series of shooting thalers in 1934 in honor of the shooting festival in Fribourg, and another design was issued in 1939 for the Lucerne festival. The 1934 issue was the last official shooting thaler that matched the circulating counterpart in both diameter and weight. The 1939 issues were not the same size and weight as their circulating counterparts, but both issues were redeemable only at the shooting festival or participating businesses. Production of shooting thalers was cut short with the outbreak of World War II. In 1984, a new series of shooting thalers began mintage, due largely to the efforts of California-based <b>coin</b> <b>dealer</b> Richard Nelson. These issues, like those minted in 1934 and 1939, are not minted to legal fineness and are not considered legal tender.|$|E

25|$|Popular stories claim {{one of the}} Confederate half dollars {{was given}} to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. This story has no basis in fact. In an 1879 letter to Ebenezer Mason, Davis {{confirmed}} that a Union soldier (actually a Federal Officer) stole a coin {{from one of his}} wife’s trunks, but could not confirm that it was like the then known Confederate half dollar. It is very possible that the coin was a gold so-called Jefferson Davis dime struck at the Paris (France) Mint, which Davis described to <b>coin</b> <b>dealer</b> Ed Frossard in an 1880 letter. All known Jefferson Davis dimes were struck in silver at the Paris Mint.

Mason bought the die and coin from Taylor and sold them to J.W. Scott Co. of New York City, a coin and stamp dealer. Scott bought 500 1861 United States half dollars from a New York bank that were supposedly struck at the New Orleans Mint. Scott had the reverse of the half dollars planed down and performed a one-sided strike using the Confederate half dollar die. The Seated Liberty obverse of the coins were flattened some because of the one-sided strike. In addition, Scott struck 500 half dollar sized tokens in white metal using the Confederate die and a newly made die to commemorate the restrikes of the Confederate half dollars. The Confederate half dollar die went missing during the 1920s and has not been seen since.|$|E
