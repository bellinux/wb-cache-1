5|$|In 1852 Staunton {{published}} his book The Chess Tournament, which recounted {{in detail the}} efforts required to make the London International Tournament happen and presented all the games with his comments on the play. Unfortunately some of Staunton's <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book and in The Illustrated London News were intemperate, because he was disappointed with the placing he achieved.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} governments linked the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to UN Peacekeepers in 1988 to the UNTAG operation, but the award {{was shared by}} peacekeepers and {{peacekeeping}} operations worldwide. Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar mentioned a number of UN peacekeeping operations (including Namibia) in his Nobel lecture in Oslo on 9 January 1989. Senator Graham Richardson also made similar <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian Senate.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{reflected}} {{on drug use}} in athletics {{in an interview with}} Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent for the BBC's Inside Sport programme. Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using performance-enhancing drugs because drug testers did not keep pace with advances in science and that athletes who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean. Chambers was roundly condemned for his <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E

5|$|Gottlieb, {{aided by}} Newman and Reinhardt, drafted a rebuttal, which {{was signed by}} 12 {{painters}} and three sculptors, and addressed {{to the editor of}} the Tribune. It was never published. Weldon Kees discussed the issue of the open letter further in the June 5 edition of The Nation, calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Francis Henry Taylor a philistine. Two days later Time magazine noted the protest in an article entitled The Revolt of the Pelicans, an oblique reference to Taylor's 1948 <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Monthly.|$|E
5|$|Tallon missed {{selection}} {{during the}} 195152 season due his increasingly error-prone glovework and {{a combination of}} health reasons including stomach ulcers and deafness. He did not play a first-class match {{because of lack of}} his fitness. In any case, Tallon had secretly been barred from selection by the Australian Board of Control for making unauthorised <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media; this fact was not revealed for half a century.|$|E
5|$|The {{respondents}} {{also noted}} that Gaudron made similar <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Stolen Generations case, which also considered non-judicial detention {{in the context of}} Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their parents' care. For this reason and others, they argued that the power to detain people for the purposes of criminal trial and punishment (as opposed to detention generally) was clearly a judicial function, but there is no general rule and other powers to detain may not offend Chapter III.|$|E

5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of the}} novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E
5|$|To help {{drive his}} points, Curtis uses {{interviews}} with various political and intellectual figures. In {{the first two}} parts, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former American Spectator writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton. Jason Burke, author of , <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Shadows in the Cave on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives William and Irving Kristol, Richard Pipes, Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film's subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's Azzam Tamimi, political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist Abdullah Anas.|$|E

Davidson advocated views which were little different from those of Gough, except for Gough wanting to make additional arrangements, to allow undefended ground to be captured by local initiative.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005, Mullenweg {{launched}} the Akismet plug-in for WordPress. Akismet (which stands for Automattic kismet) {{is a way}} of dealing with spam in aggregate, a crowd-sourced spam-fighting tool. Each time someone posts a comment to a participating website, Akismet checks it against all the <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> database. If it's spam, it's deleted. If spam gets through and a user marks it as spam, the comment is added to the database so the pool of spam comments widens, making Akismet increasingly effective over time.|$|E

25|$|The gradual {{abandonment}} of naturalism and {{the depiction of}} realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils, to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. Leon Golub's Interrogation III (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) is {{a photograph of a}} crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate about public funding of the arts.|$|E
25|$|For 18 years Hersey {{also taught}} two writing courses, in fiction and non-fiction, to undergraduates. Hersey taught his last class in fiction writing at Yale during 1984. In his {{individual}} sessions with undergraduates {{to discuss their}} work, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author was sometimes known to write his <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> margin, and having discussed his suggestion with the student, to then take out his pencil and erase his comment. As Master of Pierson College, he subsequently hosted his old boss Henry Luce– with whom Hersey had become reconciled after their dispute years prior– when Luce spoke to the college's undergraduates. Time founder Luce was a notoriously dull public speaker, and his address to the Pierson undergraduates was no exception. After Luce's somnolent speech, the former publisher privately revealed to Hersey {{for the first time}} that he and his wife Clare Boothe Luce had taken LSD while supervised by a physician. Hersey later confessed he was relieved that Luce had saved that particular revelation for a more private audience.|$|E
25|$|Hastings's {{appearances}} in Poirot's later novels {{are restricted to}} a few cases in which he participates on his periodic returns to England from Argentina. Poirot <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> ABC Murders that he enjoys Hastings's visits because he always has his most interesting cases when Hastings is with him. In the course of The Big Four, Dulcie's life is threatened by members of an international conspiracy. Hastings is forced to risk Poirot's life in return for her promised safety. In other respects {{there is very little}} personal detail regarding Hastings in these novels, until , which takes place after World War II: With his wife now dead, Hastings rejoins Poirot at Styles to help tackle one last case. The novel culminates with Poirot dying of a heart attack, leaving Hastings a confession explaining his role in events as he tracked a criminal who manipulated others to commit murder for him. Poirot's friendship with Hastings is further referenced when the murderer's attempt to manipulate Hastings in such a manner leaves Poirot resolved to kill his adversary, despite his disapproval of murder, as he knew that his friend would normally never do such a thing.|$|E
