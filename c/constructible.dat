25|$|In {{terms of}} algebra, a length is <b>constructible</b> if {{and only if}} it {{represents}} a <b>constructible</b> number, and an angle is <b>constructible</b> {{if and only if}} its cosine is a <b>constructible</b> number. A number is <b>constructible</b> if and only if it can be written using the four basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of square roots but of no higher-order roots.|$|E
25|$|<b>Constructible</b> polygon: which regular polygons are <b>constructible</b> {{partially}} {{depends on}} Fermat primes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are known}} to be an infinitude of <b>constructible</b> regular polygons with an even number of sides (because if a regular n-gon is <b>constructible,</b> then so is a regular 2n-gon and hence a regular 4n-gon, 8n-gon, etc.). However, there are only 31 known <b>constructible</b> regular n-gons with an odd number of sides.|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} <b>constructible</b> angles is closed under the {{operation}} that halves angles (which corresponds to taking square {{roots in the}} complex numbers). The only angles of finite order that may be constructed starting with two points are those whose order is either a power of two, or {{a product of a}} power of two and a set of distinct Fermat primes. In addition there is a dense set of <b>constructible</b> angles of infinite order.|$|E
25|$|It {{turns out}} to be the case that every point <b>constructible</b> using {{straightedge}} and compass may also be constructed using compass alone.|$|E
25|$|An inner {{model of}} Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is a {{transitive}} class that includes all the ordinals and satisfies all the axioms of ZF. The canonical {{example is the}} <b>constructible</b> universe L developed by Gödel.|$|E
25|$|If α is an {{infinite}} ordinal {{then there is}} a bijection between Lα and α, and the bijection is <b>constructible.</b> So these sets are equinumerous in any model of set theory that includes them.|$|E
25|$|It is {{essential}} {{to remember that the}} sets in L(A) or L are usually not actually <b>constructible</b> and that the properties of these models may be quite different from the properties of L itself.|$|E
25|$|If X is {{a complex}} variety, then étale cohomology with finite {{coefficients}} is isomorphic to singular cohomology with finite coefficients. (This does not hold for integer coefficients.) More generally the cohomology with coefficients in any <b>constructible</b> sheaf is the same.|$|E
25|$|Actually, {{even this}} complex formula has been {{simplified}} {{from what the}} instructions given in the first paragraph would yield. But the point remains, there is a formula of set theory that is true only for the desired <b>constructible</b> set s and that contains parameters only for ordinals.|$|E
25|$|Φ(...) to X. Notice {{that each}} zk∈Lβ+1 for some βformulas for the z's with {{the formula for}} s and apply existential quantifiers over the z's outside and one gets a formula that defines the <b>constructible</b> set s using only the ordinals α that appear in {{expressions}} like X=Lα as parameters.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes it is {{desirable}} to find a model of set theory that is narrow like L, but that includes or is influenced by a set that is not <b>constructible.</b> This {{gives rise to the}} concept of relative constructibility, of which there are two flavors, denoted L(A) and L.|$|E
25|$|Twelve key {{lengths of}} a {{triangle}} {{are the three}} side lengths, the three altitudes, the three medians, and the three angle bisectors. Together with the three angles, these give 95 distinct combinations, 63 of which {{give rise to a}} <b>constructible</b> triangle, 30 of which do not, and two of which are underdefined.|$|E
25|$|The {{image of}} a variety under the Veronese map is again a variety, rather than simply a <b>constructible</b> set; furthermore, these are {{isomorphic}} {{in the sense that}} the inverse map exists and is regular – the Veronese map is biregular. More precisely, the images of open sets in the Zariski topology are again open.|$|E
25|$|A quasi-{{projective}} {{variety is}} a Zariski open subset of a projective variety. Notice that every affine variety is quasi-projective. Notice {{also that the}} complement of an algebraic set in an affine variety is a quasi-projective variety; {{in the context of}} affine varieties, such a quasi-projective variety is usually not called a variety but a <b>constructible</b> set.|$|E
25|$|If W is any {{standard}} model of ZF {{sharing the same}} ordinals as V, then the L defined in W {{is the same as}} the L defined in V. In particular, Lα is the same in W and V, for any ordinal α. And the same formulas and parameters in Def (Lα) produce the same <b>constructible</b> sets in Lα+1.|$|E
25|$|Suppose that {{polynomial}} sized circuits for SAT {{not only}} exist, {{but also that}} they could be constructed by a polynomial time algorithm. Then this supposition implies that SAT itself could be solved by a polynomial time algorithm that constructs the circuit and then applies it. That is, efficiently <b>constructible</b> circuits for SAT would lead to a stronger collapse, P = NP.|$|E
25|$|Gödel {{very quickly}} resumed his {{mathematical}} work. In 1940, he published his work Consistency of the {{axiom of choice}} and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory, which is a classic of modern mathematics. In that work he introduced the <b>constructible</b> universe, a model of set theory in which the only sets that exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets. Gödel showed that both the axiom of choice (AC) and the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) are true in the <b>constructible</b> universe, and therefore must {{be consistent with the}} Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory (ZF). This result has had considerable consequences for working mathematicians, as it means that they can assume the axiom of choice when proving the Hahn–Banach theorem. Paul Cohen later constructed a model of ZF in which AC and GCH are false; together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory.|$|E
25|$|A Gremlins Team Pack was {{released}} for Lego Dimensions on November 18, 2016. The pack includes minifigures of Gizmo and Stripe, a <b>constructible</b> polaroid camera and RC car, and grants {{access to an}} Adventure World and Battle Arena based on the film. Howie Mandel and Frank Welker reprise their respective roles as Gizmo and Stripe, while Phoebe Cates, Hoyt Axton and Frances Lee McCain reprise as non-playable characters Kate Beringer, Randall Peltzer and Lynn Peltzer respectively.|$|E
25|$|Equivalently (and with {{no need to}} {{arbitrarily}} choose two points) we can say that, {{given an}} arbitrary choice of orientation, a set of points determines a set of complex ratios given by the ratios {{of the differences between}} any two pairs of points. The set of ratios <b>constructible</b> using compass and straightedge from such a set of ratios is precisely the smallest field containing the original ratios and closed under taking complex conjugates and square roots.|$|E
25|$|If V is a {{standard}} model of ZFC and κ is an inaccessible in V, then: Vκ {{is one of the}} intended models of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory; and Def(Vκ) is one of the intended models of Mendelson's version of Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory which excludes global choice, replacing limitation of size by replacement and ordinary choice; and Vκ+1 is one of the intended models of Morse–Kelley set theory. Here Def (X) is the Δ0 definable subsets of X (see <b>constructible</b> universe). However, κ {{does not need to be}} inaccessible, or even a cardinal number, in order for Vκ to be {{a standard}} model of ZF (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{continuum}} hypothesis, {{first proposed}} as a conjecture by Cantor, was listed by David Hilbert {{as one of}} his 23 problems in 1900. Gödel showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be disproven from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice), by developing the <b>constructible</b> universe of set theory in which the continuum hypothesis must hold. In 1963, Paul Cohen showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be proven from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (Cohen 1966). This independence result did not completely settle Hilbert's question, however, as it is possible that new axioms for set theory could resolve the hypothesis. Recent work along these lines has been conducted by W. Hugh Woodin, although its importance is not yet clear (Woodin 2001).|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{expansions}} {{have added}} {{features such as}} conquerable and <b>constructible</b> space stations, massive capital ships, advanced versions of existing ships, or Epic Arcs for players to master. Apocrypha included an overhauled probing system, wormholes, a smarter and tougher AI and customizable Tech 3 ships as its major features. Dominion, which became available for download on December 1, 2009, included {{an overhaul of the}} sovereignty system, more realistic astronomy, the Titan Doomsday weapon functionality being changed and the in-game web browser with Chromium's WebKit. It also included a redesign of the UI and in-game mailing system. Tyrannis added new features, such as the ability to exploit planetary resources, a social networking program called EVE Gate, new technology for ships, and graphical updates.|$|E
25|$|Assuming ZF is consistent, Kurt Gödel {{showed that}} the {{negation}} of the axiom of choice is not a theorem of ZF by constructing an inner model (the <b>constructible</b> universe) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC is consistent. Assuming ZF is consistent, Paul Cohen employed the technique of forcing, developed for this purpose, {{to show that the}} axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C is consistent. Together these results establish that the axiom of choice is logically independent of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.|$|E
25|$|Given {{any such}} {{interpretation}} {{of a set of}} points as complex numbers, the points <b>constructible</b> using valid compass and straightedge constructions alone are precisely the elements of the smallest field containing the original set of points and closed under the complex conjugate and square root operations (to avoid ambiguity, we can specify the square root with complex argument less than π). The elements of this field are precisely those that may be expressed as a formula in the original points using only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, complex conjugate, and square root, which is easily seen to be a countable dense subset of the plane. Each of these six operations corresponding to a simple compass and straightedge construction. From such a formula it is straightforward to produce a construction of the corresponding point by combining the constructions for each of the arithmetic operations. More efficient constructions of a particular set of points correspond to shortcuts in such calculations.|$|E
500|$|In antiquity, several {{geometric}} problems {{concerned the}} (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with compass and straightedge. For example, it was {{unknown to the}} Greeks {{that it is in}} general impossible to trisect a given angle. These problems can be settled using the field of <b>constructible</b> numbers. Real <b>constructible</b> numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only compass and straightedge. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the <b>constructible</b> numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field [...] of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of square roots of <b>constructible</b> numbers, not necessarily contained within [...]|$|E
500|$|Not all real {{numbers are}} <b>constructible,</b> {{it can be}} shown that [...] is not a <b>constructible</b> number, which implies that it is {{impossible}} to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a cube with volume 2, another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.|$|E
500|$|In computability theory, Putnam {{investigated}} {{the structure of}} the ramified analytical hierarchy, its connection with the <b>constructible</b> hierarchy and its Turing degrees. [...] He showed that there exist many levels of the <b>constructible</b> hierarchy which do not add any subsets of the integers and later, with his student George Boolos, that the first such [...] "non-index" [...] is the ordinal [...] of ramified analysis (this is the smallest [...] such that [...] is a model of full second-order comprehension), and also, together with a separate paper with Richard Boyd (another of Putnam's students) and Gustav Hensel, how the Davis–Mostowski–Kleene hyperarithmetical hierarchy of arithmetical degrees can be naturally extended up to [...]|$|E
500|$|A [...] "story pack" [...] {{based on}} Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was {{released}} for {{the video game}} Lego Dimensions by WB Games and TT Games. The pack includes a <b>constructible</b> model of MACUSA, figures of Newt Scamander and a Niffler, and a six-level game campaign that adapts the film's events. The pack was released {{on the same day}} as the film, alongside a [...] "fun pack" [...] containing figures of Tina Goldstein and a Swooping Evil. The cast of the film reprises their roles in the game.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its primary functions, the building is slated to include {{a significant amount of}} retail as well as a wide variety of other unique amenities with the intention that it functions as a nearly self-sustaining entity, approaching the concept of a [...] "vertical city". The building's design has been applauded as simplistic and buildable, yet bold, brilliantly sculpted, and high-tech, with AS + GG describing it as [...] "an elegant, cost-efficient and highly <b>constructible</b> design." [...] The estimated construction cost of US$1.23 billion, which is less than that of the Burj Khalifa (US$1.5 billion), can be attributed to cheap labor in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia, and that three shifts will work around the clock to expedite the process. Construction costs have also declined since the global financial crisis.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{bijection}} {{between the}} angles that are <b>constructible</b> and {{the points that}} are <b>constructible</b> on any <b>constructible</b> circle. The angles that are <b>constructible</b> form an abelian group under addition modulo 2π (which corresponds to multiplication of the points on the unit circle viewed as complex numbers). The angles that are <b>constructible</b> are exactly those whose tangent (or equivalently, sine or cosine) is <b>constructible</b> as a number. For example, the regular heptadecagon (the seventeen-sided regular polygon) is <b>constructible</b> because ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the field}} of <b>constructible</b> points is closed under square roots, it {{contains}} all points that {{can be obtained by}} a finite sequence of quadratic extensions of {{the field of}} complex numbers with rational coefficients. By the above paragraph, one can show that any <b>constructible</b> point can be obtained by such a sequence of extensions. As a corollary of this, one finds that the degree of the minimal polynomial for a <b>constructible</b> point (and therefore of any <b>constructible</b> length) is a power of2. In particular, any <b>constructible</b> point (or length) is an algebraic number, though not every algebraic number is constructible; for example, [...] is algebraic but not <b>constructible.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Suppose that X is a Noetherian scheme. [...] An abelian étale sheaf F over X {{is called}} finite locally {{constant}} {{if it is}} represented by an étale cover of X. It is called <b>constructible</b> if X can be covered by a finite family of subschemes on each of which the restriction of F is finite locally constant. It is called torsion if F(U) is a torsion group for all étale covers U of X. Finite locally constant sheaves are <b>constructible,</b> and <b>constructible</b> sheaves are torsion. Every torsion sheaf is a filtered inductive limit of <b>constructible</b> sheaves.|$|E
2500|$|In mathematics, in set theory, the <b>constructible</b> {{universe}} (or Gödel's <b>constructible</b> universe), denoted L, is {{a particular}} class of sets that can be described entirely in terms of simpler sets. L is the union of the <b>constructible</b> hierarchy Lα. It was introduced by Kurt Gödel in his 1938 paper [...] "The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalized Continuum-Hypothesis". In this, he proved that the <b>constructible</b> universe is an inner model of ZF set theory, and also that the axiom of choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis are true in the <b>constructible</b> universe. This shows that both propositions {{are consistent with the}} basic axioms of set theory, if ZF itself is consistent. Since many other theorems only hold in systems in which {{one or both of the}} propositions is true, their consistency is an important result.|$|E
