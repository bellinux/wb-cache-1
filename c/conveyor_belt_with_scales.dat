40|$|Abstract − Large {{quantities}} of commodities in different sizes transported on <b>belt</b> <b>conveyors</b> should often be mea-sured automatically {{by two or}} three <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales. Continuous measurement can be dynamically performed by multi-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales, so that the masses of discrete objects on <b>belt</b> <b>conveyors</b> can be determined in sequence according to the different lengths. <b>Belt</b> <b>conveyor</b> scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 130 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minutes and more. The output signals from the multi-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales are always contaminated with noises due to vibrations of the conveyor and the object to be measured in motion. This measuring system consists of the three-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>scales</b> <b>with</b> load-cells, and the photo-electro switches which detect the measuring lengths of the objects and distance between each object in sequence. The experimental results on the multi-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales suggest that the algorithms proposed in this paper are effective enough to practical applications...|$|R
