These come in two distinct configurations, both highly effective in improving load handling safety during a loss of hydraulic pressure: essentially locking the lift/dump cylinder in-place, preventing potential free fall of the load in the event of hydraulic failure.|$|E
40|$|The paper shows {{standard}} circuits {{with load}} reactive and non load reactive <b>counterbalance</b> <b>valves.</b> A Matlab simulation {{based on a}} linear model for the circuit with load reactive <b>counterbalance</b> <b>valves</b> shows what parameters have a significant influence on {{the stability of the}} system. The most important parameters of the counterbalance valve that influence the stability are pilot gain and relief gain. The factors describe how pilot pressure and load pressure affect the flow across the counterbalance valve. A new counterbalance valve (patent pending) has the pilot gain and relief gain required for stability only in operating ranges that require the parameters for stability. When the load is not moving or the counterbalance valve is not required for positive (non overrunning) loads, the new valve has a higher pilot ratio, which means that the valve opens further at lower inlet pressures. The new <b>counterbalance</b> <b>valves</b> saves about 30 % power compared with a standard counterbalance valve that has the same parameters for stability when it is lowering an overrunning load. The standard counterbalance can be replaced with the new load adaptive valve in the same cavity. The paper shows test results and the design of the valve...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} low-cost, high {{precision}} and efficient throttle-less hydraulic circuit that utilizes off-the-shelf industrial elements to control single rod hydraulic cylinders. The circuit uses an on/off solenoid valve to redirect the differential flow {{of a single}} rod hydraulic cylinder, and two <b>counterbalance</b> <b>valves</b> to manage switching (resistive–assistive) loads. Conducted experiments on a prototype system indicated a maximum steady state positional error of 0. 2 mm.

40|$|<b>Counterbalance</b> <b>valves</b> {{are widely}} used in {{hydraulic}} deck machinery to balance the overrunning loads. However, as is well known, counterbalance circuit designed with poor choice of counterbalance valve tends to introduce instability to the system. This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a pilot operated counterbalance valve which can operate at a flow rate about 2000 L/min. A linearized stability analysis of such a hydraulic circuit which consists of a slip in cartridge, a pilot counterbalance valve and a hydraulic winch is presented. Pole-zero plots are employed to reveal {{the effect of the}} volume of control cavity, the hydraulic resistance on pilot line and counterbalance valve pilot area ratio on the stability of the system. The analysis results indicate that such a system will be unstable within the normal range of each parameter. An alternative approach that guarantees system stability by adding an accumulator on the pilot line is put forward. The approach stabilizes the pilot pressure by reducing the hydro-stiffness of pilot control cavity, thus the system can reach its stability condition. Finally, a numerical optimization method is putted forward, with the optimized parameters, the dynamic performance of considered system become better...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{industrial}} tote dumpers and lifters {{are equipped}} with long-stroke single-rod hydraulic cylinders. For years, valve-controlled cylinders {{have been used in}} tote dumpers. Valve-controlled actuators are highly inefficient due to huge power losses in throttling valves. They also need a cooling system to remove the wasted heat energy from the hydraulic oil. This article introduces a low-cost throttle-less hydraulic circuit to control the single-rod cylinder of a tote dumper. The system consists of a motor-driven gear pump, an On/Off solenoid valve, to redirect the differential flow of the single-rod hydraulic cylinder and a <b>counterbalance</b> <b>valve,</b> which makes the circuit controllable for assisting loads and keeps the load in position with no effort from the hydraulic pump. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the circuit. A test rig has been designed to simulate a lifting load. The energy efficiency of the circuit is determined by comparing a valve-controlled circuit with the proposed circuit. The proposed circuit composition is not only efficient and simple but is also accurate in terms of position response using a proportional controller. The circuit is easy to control since the only needed measurement is the displacement of the actuator. The circuit, however, does not recycle energy...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the complex fluid flow phenomena that result in the generation of a high frequency noise in <b>counterbalance</b> <b>valves</b> through an experimental and numerical investigation of the flow. Once the influence of the different components involved in noise generation is established, a secondary objective is the introduction of design modifications that eliminate the undesired effect without altering the operation envelope or the performance of the valve. A hydraulic test bench was used to carry out an experimental investigation of the noise generation process. A computer based data acquisition system was used to record pressure fluctuations, flowrates and hydraulic oil temperatures in a production valve under a variety of operational conditions. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical modeling lead to the hypothesis that noise generation is the result of an acoustic resonance triggered by shear layer instability at the valve inlet. The pressure gradients developed when the shear layer entrains the stagnant fluid in the valve main cavity cause the layer to become unstable and oscillate. The oscillation frequency will depend on a great number of factors such as valve geometry, pressure and velocity gradients and the density and viscosity of the fluid. It is postulated that the observed noise is generated when this frequency matches one of the resonant frequencies of the valve cavity. The proposed mechanism is theoretically poorly understood and well beyond simplified analysis, its accurate numerical simulation is computational very intensive requiring sophisticated CFD codes. The numerical investigation was carried out using STAR–CCM+, a commercially available CFD code featuring 3 -D capabilities and sophisticated turbulence modeling. Streamline, pressure, velocity-vector and velocity-scalar plots were obtained for several valve configurations using steady and unsteady state flow simulations. An experimental and numerical analysis of an alternative valve geometry was carried out. Experimental results demonstrated a greatly reduced instability range. The numerical analysis of the unsteady behavior of the shear-layer streamlines for both valves yielded results that were compatible with the experimental work. The results of this investigation promise a great positive impact on the design of this type of hydraulic valves...|$|E
40|$|A knuckle boom crane is {{characterized}} by being a versatile machine that during operation experiences large load variations caused by the changes in position and payload. Common uses are as a mobile loader crane mounted on trucks and in offshore applications. Since their introduction the use of <b>counterbalance</b> <b>valves</b> (CBV) have been the de facto standard on load-carrying hydraulically actuated applications like the knuckle boom crane. It offers a simple and practical solution {{to one of the}} issues of mobile cranes: Controlling the load safely when lowering. By law (e. g. European Standard) the hydraulic circuit of load-carrying applications is required to contain a load holding protection device. The classical way of actuating such a crane is to use a circuit containing a pressure compensator valve and a directional control valve (DCV) in series with a CBV. This circuit {{is referred to as the}} base circuit. It is well known that this combination of valve components tends to introduce instability in the base circuit. This is mainly a problem when the controlled actuator is subjected to a negative load, because this will require the CBV to throttle the return ﬂow. The instability presents itself as pressure oscillations in the hydraulic circuit which cause the mechanical structure to oscillate. The consequence of the oscillations is a decreased accuracy of the boom motion which create a safety risk, reduces productivity and introduces an undesirable extra fatigue load. The objective of this project was to investigate the oscillations created in the hydraulic circuit of knuckle boom cranes and reduce their severity. The effort has mainly been split in two: First, was looked into existing solutions with the focus on the ones not requiring control systems to function. This was done with reliability and robustness in mind. The investigation identiﬁed the pressure control valve (PCV) as the best commercially available solution. The use of a PCV to control the inlet ﬂow in crane applications was rather uncharted territory. The valve, a DCV with a pressure control spool manufactured by Danfoss, has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. A linear stability analysis has been performed with the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. This analysis of the valve used together with a hydraulically actuated experimental setup indicates that the combination is stable in all situations. The use of the pressure control spool in the DCV is a simple and robust solution to the stability problem of the base circuit. Not related to the PCV’s ability to reduce the oscillations the use of it in knuckle boom cranes, however, comes with certain drawbacks. The drawbacks include a load dependent dead band and a load dependent inlet ﬂow. In order to achieve similar behavior as the normal pressure compensated DCV a closed loop control system is required. These issues are addressed in this project, where control schemes are proposed to handle them. In the second part the perspective of the search was broadened to include solutions using control systems. This has lead to the development of a novel, patent pending, concept that signiﬁcantly reduces the oscillations of the base circuit. It introduces a secondary circuit where a low-pass ﬁltered value of the load pressure is generated and fed back to the compensator of the ﬂow supply valve. The work has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement of stability obtained for a system with the novel concept implemented both theoretically and experimentally. The stability has been investigated both using a linear and a nonlinear model of a hydraulically actuated experimental setup. The presented novel concept circuit has the same steady state characteristics as the base circuit but without the corresponding oscillatory nature. Because the main spool of the DCV is not used for stabilising the system, the novel concept can be combined with any feedback control strategy. In this project, the novel concept is presented with linear actuators only. However,its use covers circuits with rotational actuators and CBV’s as well. The base circuit is used as a reference for comparison. Therefore, the stability of the base circuit is also investigated with a linear model...|$|E
