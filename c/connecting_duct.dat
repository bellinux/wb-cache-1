The blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.|$|E

The predictions from all the approaches are compared with experimental data. It is observed that, for a particular cup-shaped geometry of the piston, both the zero-dimensional and hybrid approach overpredict the pressure recovery rate in comparison with the three-dimensional CFD calculation, which is in good agreement with the experimental pressure-time variation. On the other hand, the agreement between the lumped parameter approach and the detailed CFD calculation is better for a flat piston, indicating the importance of the piston geometry...|$|E

Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to determine if estrogen receptors (ER) are present in the avian epididymis using immunocytochemistry, northern blot analysis, and in situ hybridization.

The relation between the developed pressure and the input current was analyzed for an incompressible liquid metal flow in the channels of all three types of DC electromagnetic pumps.

40|$|Establishing {{an optimal}} {{intercooled}} aeroengine constitutes a coupled problem where the conceptual {{design of the}} intercooler and the engine has to be considered simultaneously. The heat transfer and pressure loss characteristics {{will depend on the}} choice of the intercooler architecture. Hence, to be able to optimize the performance of an intercooled aeroengine, the performance characteristics of a given intercooler architecture has to be known in the parameter range anticipated for the aeroengine optimization. Here, the conceptual design of a tubular two-pass cross-flow intercooler architecture intended for a turbofan aeroengine application is presented. The internal flow is simulated applying a porous media model for the intercooler tubes, whereas the <b>connecting</b> <b>ducts</b> are analyzed with three-dimensional simulations allowing the assessment of a number of design solutions. The external flow is treated with two-dimensional simulations investigating the external pressure loss and heat transfer characteristics of the two elliptical tube stacks. The intercooler performance is then generalized by developing a reduced order correlation covering a parameter range anticipated for a turbofan conceptual design optimization.

40|$|Stereological {{studies of}} the spermatic ducts of the quail were carried out for {{comparison}} between {{different parts of the}} system and those of other species, and to provide a basis for future physiological studies. Duct length, surface areas and volumes of various components of the ducts were determined. Values were subsequently used to calculate net fluxes of fluid across the duct epithelium, spermatozoal velocity and the distribution of spermatozoa throughout the system. It was concluded that the extratesticular spermatic ducts are divided into 2 main parts: (1) the ductuli efferentes where spermatozoa spend a brief period (8 minutes) and which are adapted for considerable net fluid reabsorption (100 microliters/cm 2 /h), and (2) the <b>connecting</b> <b>ducts,</b> ductus epididymidis and ductus deferens where spermatozoa spend a longer period (24 hours) and which are involved in little net fluid transport (0. 14 - 2. 1 microliter/cm 2 /h). Most spermatozoa (92. 3 %) are located in the ductus deferens. The velocity of spermatozoal transport is much the same through the quail spermatic ducts (0. 37 mm/min) as through the mammalian epididymis, the difference between classes in the duration of spermatozoal transport being due to differences in the distance that they travel. In a comparison between estimates of spermatozoal concentration using stereological methods and direct counts of spermatozoa in samples collected using micropuncture procedures it was concluded that both methods gave similar results...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{diffusers}} {{applied in}} the field of ventilation of rooms are often complex in terms of geometry, including perforated plates, dampers, guide rails, curved surfaces and other components inside the diffuser, with the intention to create satisfying thermal comfort for the occupants. Also <b>connecting</b> <b>ducts</b> can be different for the same diffuser in different situations, affecting the supply velocity profile. It is obvious that simulation of airflow and air temperature particularly in rooms with displacement ventilation is very troublesome, particularly if the near-zone of the diffuser is of interest. Experiments commonly indicate very high turbulence intensities in the near-zone of displacement ventilation supply devices, especially close to the floor where high mean flow gradient occurs. This indicates that the air flow from inlet devices designed for displacement ventilation might be very unstable; the position of the stream leaving the diffuser and entering the room is changing with time, hence diffusion of momentum and temperature are increased. This effect is not captured in RANS simulations, since it is performed with the assumption of time-independent conditions. In this paper URANS simulations were performed for prediction of velocity and temperature distribution close to a complex air supply device in a room with displacement ventilation. The presented study show that unsteady simulations with the realizable turbulence k-ε model generates too high eddy viscosity and therefore damps out the unsteadiness of the flow especially inside the diffuser...|$|R
