40|$|Background: Fine needle {{aspiration}} cytology (FNAC) provides {{diagnostic information}} as {{to the nature of}} a solitary <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule.</b> Objective: This study was carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} FNAC as a diagnostic method of malignancy in solitary <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule.</b> Methodology: This cross sectional study was carried out among 40 cases of solitary <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule</b> who were admitted in the Department Surgery and ENT of DMCH during period of January 2006 to December 2007. This study was conducted using convient type of non-probability sampling technique Data were collected by face to face interview, clinical examination and finding of both cytological and histological examination. Result: The study revealed that the mean age of the patients was 35. 8 ± 2. 36 year with female to male ratio 2. 6 : 1. For all the patients, FNAC were done preoperatively and after definitive surgery histopathology were done for confirmed diagnosis and results of FNAC were compared with histopathology reports. 30 cases were diagnosed as benign and 10 case diagnosed as malignant cold thyroid solitary nodules among 40 cases. In this study, the sensitivity of FNAC was 80 % for the presence of malignancy and specificity 96. 7 % for the absence of malignancy in solitary cold thyroid nodules. The positive predictive value was 88. 9 % and negative predictive value was 92. 5 % and diagnostic accuracy was 92. 5 %. Conclusion: FNAC can be used a...|$|E

40|$|Background: Scanning with technetium- 99 m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99 mTc-MIBI) is {{recommended}} for evaluating <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule</b> metabolism. In addition, it may help differentiate between benign and malignant nodules; however, the efficacy of this technique has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, it is not currently performed for routine clinical application. This prospective {{study was conducted to}} investigate the clinical significance of 99 mTc-MIBI scintigraphy in the assessment of patients with <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules.</b> Patients and methods: This prospective study was conducted on 104 patients with <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules</b> greater than 1 cm in diameter as detected on 99 mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy. Uptake of MIBI in <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules</b> was compared with that in the surrounding normal thyroid tissue for both early and delayed images, and a score of 0 - 3 was assigned to each nodule as follows: 0, cold; 1, decreased; 2, equal; 3, increased. The thyroid scan was performed 20 and 40 min after intravenous injection of 555 MBq of 99 mTc-MIBI. The patients underwent fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Detailed statistical parameters were determined on a per-nodule basis for each qualitative and quantitative scan analysis, as defined by histology. Results: A total of 104 patients (93 women and 11 men; mean age 40. 76 ± 11. 40 years, range 20 - 73) with a total number of 167 cold nodules were included in this study. When 99 mTc-MIBI uptake was regarded as the criterion of malignancy in 99 mTc-MIBI scintigraphy, the accuracy was between 69. 46 and 92. 21 on using seven different methods. In addition, FNAC findings indicated a sensitivity of 66. 66, a specificity of 100, a negative predictive value of 95. 72, a positive predictive value of 100, and an accuracy of 96. 06. Six malignant cold nodules were detected on a positive 99 mTc-MIBI scan, which were determined as benign nodules on FNAC examinations. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that 99 mTc-MIBI scanning can be complementary to other diagnostic techniques in patients with <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules.</b> In addition, because of its availability, rather low cost, simple protocol, and objective semiquantitative information, 99 mTc-MIBI scanning seems to hold promise in routine imaging of <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules.</b> © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} ultrasound (US) -guided interstitial laser photocoagulation (ILP) on thyroid function, nodule size and patient satisfaction in benign solitary solid cold thyroid nodules by comparing one ILP session with no treatment in a prospective randomised study. Materials and methods: Thirty euthyroid outpatients with a benign solitary solid and a scintigraphi-cally <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule</b> causing local discomfort were assigned to one session of ILP (n 15) or observation (n 15) and followed for 6 months. Thyroid nodule volume and total thyroid volume were assessed by US and thyroid function was determined by routine assays before and during follow-up. Pressure and cosmetic complaints before and at 6 months were evaluated on a visual ana-logue scale. ILP was performed under US guidance and with an output power of 2. 5 – 3. 5 W. Results: In the ILP group, the nodule volume decreased from 8. 2 ml (6. 1; 11. 9) (median; quartiles) to 4. 8 ml (3. 0; 6. 6) after 6 months (P 0. 001). The overall median reduction was 44 % (37; 52), which correlated with {{a significant decrease in}} pressure symptoms as well as cosmetic complaints. In the control group, a non-significant increase in median nodule volume of 7 % (0; 34) after 6 months was seen. No major side-effects were seen in the ILP group. There was no correlation between thermal energy deposition and nodule volume reduction. Thyroid function was unaltered throughout. Conclusion: US-guided ILP, given as a single treatment, resulted in a satisfactory clinical response in the majority of patients with a benign solitary solid <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule,</b> and may become a clinically relevant alternative to surgery in selected patients.

Materials and methods: In a patient who underwent hemithyroidectomy for <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule,</b> hyperthyroid symptoms persisted, despite stopping levothyroxine treatment. Further investigation was carried out through the following laboratory tests: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test; free thyroxine (fT 4) test; and the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) test. A pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and genetic analysis was also carried out. The test results confirmed the diagnosis of a thyrotropinoma.

One tumor presented as a large <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule</b> {{and the other was}} an autopsy finding. The tumors were predominantly composed of fibroblast-like spindled cells. One case showed prominent meningioma-like concentric perivascular arrangement and contained cytoplasmic melanin-like pigment. Stromal hyalinization was a prominent feature of both.

They did not stain with calcitonin, CEA and other lineage-specific mesenchymal, neuroendocrine and melanocytic markers. There was no evidence of metastasis at autopsy (case 2) or at last follow-up 2 years after surgery (case 1). These cases demonstrate the diversity of follicular thyroid neoplasms and the unusual occurrence of extensive spindle cell metaplasia.

However, the consequence of this practice is to dispossess the human organism of the C cells of the thyroid gland.

The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the impact of the total thyroidectomy as well as of the perdition of the thyroid calcitonin to the bone mass in patients with non - malignant diseases of the thyroid gland. From the 198 patients that were studied, 35 were males (average age: 48, 85 years) and 163 females (average age: 47, 63 years). The pre - menopausal patients were 112 (average age: 40, 68 years) and the post-menopausal 51 (average age: 62, 40 years). The bone density of the collum of the thighbone and the lumbar region of the spinal column were determined in all patients preoperational. Moreover, the alteration of the bone density was determined six and twelve months after the total thyroidectomy. The patients were graded in four groups according to their disease (Grave’s disease, toxic multinodular goiter, multinodular goiter and <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule).</b> Additionally, the enrolled women were separated in premenopausal and postmenopausal groups. Exogenous Solomon calsitonin was administered as intranasal spray to the half of the above mentioned patients, post operational. It was observed that: 1) total thyroidectomy significantly reduces the bone density of the collum of the thighbone in premenopausal women with multinodular goiter, the bone density of the lumbar region of the spinal columnin premenopausal women with Grave’s disease and of the lumbar region of the spinal column in postmenopausal women with Grave’s disease. 2) The exogenous administration of sCT leads to a significant increase of the bone density in the lumbar region of the spinal column in men with Grave’s disease and multinodular goiter, in the bone density of the collum of the thighbone in pre - menopausal women with multinodular goiter, in the lumbar region of the spinal column in premenopausal women with <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule</b> and in premenopausal women with toxic multinodular goiter. 3) The postoperational administration of sCT increases with statistical significance the bone density both of the collum of the thighbone and the lumbar region of the spinal column in pre - menopausal women with toxic goiter, compared with the group of postmenopausal women, who received sCT and had the same thyroid disorders. In contrary, it was observed that postmenopausal women with toxic goiter, who did not receive sCT, had a significant increase in the bone density of the lumbar region of the spinal column compared with the pre - menopausal women, with the same thyroid disorders and with no sCT treatment.

Moreover, we investigated whether changes in Ga protein expression are pathophysiologically relevant in HTNs or <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules</b> (CTNs). Methods: Wild-type TSH receptor and mutated TSH receptors were coexpressed with Gas, Gai or Gaq/ 11, and cAMP and inositol phosphate (IP) production was measured after stimulation with TSH. The expression of Gas, Gai and Gaq/ 11 proteins was examined by Western blotting in 28 HTNs and 14 CTNs. Results: Coexpression of Gas with the WT TSH receptor in COS 7 cells significantly increased the basal and TSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation while coexpression of the Gaq or Ga 11 protein significantly increased the production of cAMP and inositol triphosphate (IP 3). The coexpression of the TSH recep-tor mutants (I 486 F, DEL 613 – 621), known to couple constitutively to Gas and Gaq with Gas an...|$|R
40|$|Abstractβ-Arrestins mediate agonist {{dependent}} desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. Somatic TSH receptor mutations {{were identified}} {{in the majority of}} hot <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules.</b> When transiently overexpressed in COS 7 cells these mutations resulted in constitutive activation of the cAMP pathway. However, the in vivo mechanisms and the in vivo desensitization of these TSH receptor mutations are unknown. Moreover, constitutively activated β-adrenergic receptors are known to be constitutively desensitized. Therefore, we investigated the expression of β-arrestins in toxic <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules</b> (TTNs) with and without somatic TSH receptor mutation and in <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules</b> (CTNs) by Western blotting and ELISA. Expression of β-arrestin 2 was increased in all TTNs while β-arrestin 2 expression was decreased in CTNs compared to their corresponding surrounding tissue. The mean β-arrestin 1 expression was unchanged in the cytosol of TTNs, in membranes and cytosol of CTNs and decreased in the membranes of TTNs compared to their surrounding tissue. Transient coexpression of β-arrestins 1 or 2 with the TSH receptor in HEK 293 cells and subsequent determination of cAMP showed that in vitro both β-arrestins interact with the TSH receptor and are able to desensitize the receptor. The increased β-arrestin 2 expression in TTNs and the desensitization of the TSH receptor by β-arrestin 2 in vitro suggest that the β-arrestin 2 expression is cAMP dependent and that β-arrestin 2 very likely desensitizes the constitutively activated TSH receptor in toxic <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology and thyroid scintigraphy (TS) in patients with solitary <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules.</b> We retrospectively reviewed a series of 657 consecutive patients (531 (80. 8 %) women and 126 (19. 2 %) men, median age 45 years, range 16 - 81 years) with solitary <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules.</b> Prior to surgery, all patients underwent FNA cytology whilst 99 mTc-pertechnetate TS was performed in 496 (75. 5 %) patients. Final histopathology showed 533 (81. 1 %) benign nodules, including 251 (38. 2 %) follicular adenomas and 124 (18. 9 %) thyroid carcinomas. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy in the detection of thyroid cancer were 95. 8 %, 21. 1 %, 22. 6 %, 95. 5 % and 35. 7 % for TS, and 81. 4 %, 99. 4 %, 97. 1 %, 95. 8 % and 96. 0 % for FNA cytology. The presence of thyroid cancer was confirmed in 92 out of 407 (22. 6 %) patients with a "cold" nodule, in 4 (4. 5 %) patients who had normal or increased uptake on TS, in 101 out of 104 (97. 1 %) patients with smears suggesting malignancy, and in 3 out of 533 (0. 6 %) smears suggesting benign lesions. In conclusion, the specificity of TS is low and this technique should be abandoned as a routine test in patients with nontoxic <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules.</b> However, a more careful evaluation should be suggested for patients with <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules</b> and a FNA cytology that reads follicular neoplasm...|$|R
40|$|We report {{two cases}} of well {{differentiated}} thyroid carcinoma (DTC) in two girls who showed their first symptoms at 4 years 6 months and 7 years 2 months. Both underwent total thyroidectomy and removal of metastatic lymph nodes. In {{the first case}} pathology informed a mixed DTC (papillar/follicular). In the first case we discuss the difficulties that may arise due to the unspecified signs and symptoms that led to an initial diagnosis of goiter and thyroiditis. We {{emphasize the importance of}} age, sex, the presence of cervical adenopathy and associated hoarness in order to establish the diagnosis of DTC. In the second case we point out the diagnostic importance of the progressive growth of the <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule.</b> We review the different surgical approaches of resection supporting the advantages of the total over the subtotal thyroidectomy we had done on our patients. We analyze the concepts of uni and multifocality of DTC taking into consideration the possibility of death even among low risk patients. We discuss the higher frequency of relapse in patients who were not treated with radioactive iodine (I- 131) or who were given low doses of iodine. We establish the advantages of post-surgical ablation with high doses (100 to 150 mCi) of I- 131, based on the longer patient survival and minimum recurrences. The first studied case has had 15 years 9 month of survival with no recurrences up to date. The second studied case has had 6 years 10 month of survival, also with no recurrences up to date. We also emphasize the importance of an adequate suppressive hormone dose (200 mcg day of thyroxine) based on the concept of the TSH dependance of this tumors.

40|$|Introduction: Various radiopharmaceuticals, {{including}} 67 Ga, 201 Tl, and 99 mTc-sestamibi {{have been}} used to differentiate benign from malignant thyroid nodules. 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin, a lipophilic cationic radiotracer, and 99 mTc-sestamibi have also been reported to accumulate in thyroid tumors. In this study, we evaluated the role of 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin in the differentiation of malignant from benign thyroid nodules. Methods: We prospectively studied 108 patients with solitary <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule</b> on 99 mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy (33 malignant and 75 benign) to investigate the diagnostic value of 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin scintigraphy. 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin scintigraphy was performed 15, 60, and 120 minutes following IV injection of 20 mCi (740 MBq) of radiotracer in the anterior planar mode with a gamma camera equipped with LEAP collimator. The scans were visually analyzed by two experienced nuclear physician. The nodules with late tracer retention (activity more than adjacent thyroid tissue) were classified as positive and nodules without late retention were interpreted as negative for malignancy. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed in all patients in 3 - 7 days interval. 52 patients were subsequently operated on while 56 patients refused surgery. These 56 patients, however, had at least two negative FNA results. Results: 45 out of 108 nodules show high 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin uptake on delayed images; 27 of them were malignant. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated to be 81. 8 %, 76. 0 %, 54. 0 %, and 90. 4 % respectively. Accuracy of the test was also determined to be 77. 7 %. Conclusion: We concluded that 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin scintigraphy is a relatively sensitive, but not enough specific, method in diagnosing malignant thyroid nodules. This agent could be of value in the presence of FNA limitations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Nodular {{thyroid disease}} {{is the most}} common {{endocrine}} disorder. Nonfunctioning thyroid nodules are identified by their low radioiodide uptake compared with the normal extranodular tissue, which, at thyroid scintiscan, produces the typical picture of a <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodule.</b> Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that the majority of nonfunctioning thyroid nodules have a specific defect in iodide transport that accounts for their failure to accumulate radioactive iodide in vivo. A defect in the expression or structure of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) gene has been hypothesized as a possible cause of the impaired iodide trapping in nonfunctioning thyroid nodules. We studied 22 patients who were submitted to surgery for a solitary nonfunctioning thyroid nodule that originated in an otherwise normal gland. Thyroid scintigraphy was performed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 h after the oral administration of a tracer dose of 131 I (iodine). All patients showed absence of 131 I uptake in the nodule, with normal uptake in the extranodular tissue and in the contralateral thyroid lobe. Eight patients with toxic adenomas who underwent lobectomy were also included in the study. We first studied the expression of human NIS (hNIS) protein by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissue sections using a specific anti-hNIS monoclonal antibody. Subsequently, we searched for somatic mutations of hNIS gene in nonfunctioning thyroid nodules. The level of hNIS expression was determined in both the nodules and the normal tissue from the same thyroid gland. In all functioning thyroid nodules (toxic adenomas), a high expression of hNIS protein was detected with respect to normal surrounding tissue. Similar to the normal thyroid tissue, follicular cells of toxic thyroid adenomas showed an exclusive expression of hNIS protein at the cell membrane. Fifty-four percent of benign nonfunctioning thyroid nodules overexpressed hNIS protein compared with the normal surrounding tissue, but in these nodules the hNIS protein failed to target the cell membrane, being mostly localized inside the cytoplasm. hNIS protein was not detected by immunohistochemistry in 46...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The adenylyl cyclase system {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the control of both thyroid follicular and anterior pituitary cell function. Activating mutations affecting important pathway components such as the TSH receptor and Gsa occur in the majority of autonomously functioning <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules.</b> Only a small proportion of other types of thyroid tumours, however, have been reported to harbour these mutations. Activating mutations of Gsa have been reported to occur in up to 40 % of pituitary somatotroph adenomas. As the majority of <b>cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules</b> and pituitary tumours are unaffected by these mutations, we have investigated the possibility of activating mutations occurring in protein kinase A (PKA), which is another key component of the adenylyl cyclase pathway. Design: Genomic DNA and cDNA were analysed for the presence of PKA Ca mutations by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridisation and single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Patients: A total of 171 tissue samples were investigated. These comprised 66 benign and 24 malignant thyroid neoplasms, 21 somatotroph adenomas, 35 non-functioning pituitary adenomas, 2 cortico-troph adenomas, 1 malignant prolactinoma, and 22 normal pituitary tissue samples. Results: No mutations of PKA Ca were identified using either allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridisa-tion or single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Conclusions: It appears that PKA Ca mutations at the codons investigated do not represent an oncogenetic mechanism in the development of thyroid and pituitary neoplasms.

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules</b> (CTNs) {{represent}} a frequent endocrine disorder accounting {{for up to}} 85 % of <b>thyroid</b> <b>nodules</b> in a population living in an iodine-deficient area. Benign CTNs need to be distinguished from thyroid cancer, which is relatively rare. The molecular etiology of benign CTNs is unresolved. To obtain novel insights into their pathogenesis, protein expression profiling was performed {{in a series of}} 27 solitary CTNs (10 follicular adenoma and 20 adenomatous nodules) and surrounding normal thyroid tissues using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry analysis, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The proteome analysis revealed a specific fingerprint of CTNs with up-regulation of three functional systems: 1) thyroid cell proliferation, 2) turnover of thyroglobulin, and 3) H 2 O 2 detoxification. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry confirmed the proteome data and showed that CTNs exhibit significant up-regulation of proteins involved in thyroid hormone synthesis yet are deficient in T- 4 -containing thyroglobulin. This is consequential to intranodular iodide deficiency, mainly due to cytoplasmic sodium iodide symporter localization, and portrays the CTN as an activated proliferating lesion with an intranodular hypothyroid milieu. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that up-regulation of H 2 O 2 generation in CTNs could override the antioxidative system resulting in oxidative stress, which is suggested by the finding of raised 8 -oxo-guanidine DNA adduct formation in CTNs...|$|R
