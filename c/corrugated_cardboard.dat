The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, <b>corrugated</b> <b>cardboard</b> covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E

40|$|A new {{technological}} {{approach for}} manufacturing of porous thin sheets the s. c. sinterpaper has been developed. The manufacturing {{consists of a}} combination of paper and sinter technology. Sinterpaper in the thickness range between 0. 2 and 0. 7 mm have been prepared, whereas the porosity level can reach up to 75 %. The pore size has a bimodal character, i. e. longish coarse pores of around 200 micron and small pores less than 20 micron. Investigations of the sinter temperature have shown a significant influence on the porosity {{as well as on the}} mechanical properties. The new technology for sinterpaper manufacturing has some advantages like materials flexibility, thin sheet manufacturing, simple shaping and after treatment (like plain paper), variation in length and width and tailoring of the pore size, pore size distribution and total porosity. The process can be up scaled and is characterized by low cost processing. Based on the advantages above numerous fields of potential applications can be selected. Filters for gases, liquids and particle should be one of the main fields of applications. Furthermore porous sinterpaper should be applied for thermal insulation, for electromagnetic shielding. Other interesting applications could be electrodes, heat exchanger (heat pipes), vaporizers and evaporators, catalyst substrates and light-weight structural components. Further investigations and activities are focused in the development of graded porous sinterpaper (membranes). Additional shaped products like <b>corrugated</b> sinterpaper, <b>cardboard</b> and tubes will be developed and tested...|$|R

Promotion and effective implementation of housing improvement (including key peridomestic structures) combined with appropriate insecticide use and host management practices are needed to eliminate infestations. Fewer refuges are likely to result in fewer residual foci after insecticide spraying, and will facilitate community-based vector surveillance.

The reissuance or metamorphosis of these tacky cardboard discards through the media of printmaking, painting, drawing and assemblage allows the use of common materials to combine, reform, overlay and reshape. A new image is then synthesized and extracted, ready once again for future discard, salvage and synthesis. My intent is to take these discards and record, through illusion, their reanimation and redefinition in context with their new environment.

40|$|It {{is known}} already from 1970 ´s that laser beam is {{suitable}} for processing paper materials. In this thesis, term paper materials mean all wood-fibre based materials, like dried pulp, copy paper, newspaper, <b>cardboard,</b> <b>corrugated</b> board, tissue paper etc. Accordingly, laser processing in this thesis means all laser treatments resulting material removal, like cutting, partial cutting, marking, creasing, perforation etc. {{that can be used}} to process paper materials. Laser technology provides many advantages for processing of paper materials: non-contact method, freedom of processing geometry, reliable technology for non-stop production etc. Especially packaging industry is very promising area for laser processing applications. However, there are only few industrial laser processing applications worldwide even in beginning of 2010 ´s. One reason for small-scale use of lasers in paper material manufacturing is that there is a shortage of published research and scientific articles. Another problem, restraining the use of laser for processing of paper materials, is colouration of paper material i. e. the yellowish and/or greyish colour of cut edge appearing during cutting or after cutting. These are the main reasons for selecting the topic of this thesis to concern characterization of interaction of laser beam and paper materials. This study was carried out in Laboratory of Laser Processing at Lappeenranta University of Technology (Finland). Laser equipment used in this study was TRUMPF TLF 2700 carbon dioxide laser that produces a beam with wavelength of 10. 6 μm with power range of 190 - 2500 W (laser power on work piece). Study of laser beam and paper material interaction was carried out by treating dried kraft pulp (grammage of 67 g m- 2) with different laser power levels, focal plane postion settings and interaction times. Interaction between laser beam and dried kraft pulp was detected with different monitoring devices, i. e. spectrometer, pyrometer and active illumination imaging system. This way it was possible to create an input and output parameter diagram and to study the effects of input and output parameters in this thesis. When interaction phenomena are understood also process development can be carried out and even new innovations developed. Fulfilling the lack of information on interaction phenomena can assist in the way of lasers for wider use of technology in paper making and converting industry. It was concluded in this thesis that interaction of laser beam and paper material has two mechanisms that are dependent on focal plane position range. Assumed interaction mechanism B appears in range of average focal plane position of 3. 4 mm and 2. 4 mm and assumed interaction mechanism A in range of average focal plane position of 0. 4 mm and - 0. 6 mm both in used experimental set up. Focal plane position 1. 4 mm represents midzone of these two mechanisms. Holes during laser beam and paper material interaction are formed gradually: first small hole is formed to interaction area in the centre of laser beam cross-section and after that, as function of interaction time, hole expands, until interaction between laser beam and dried kraft pulp is ended. By the image analysis it can be seen that in beginning of laser beam and dried kraft pulp material interaction small holes off very good quality are formed. It is obvious that black colour and heat affected zone appear as function of interaction time. This reveals that there still are different interaction phases within interaction mechanisms A and B. These interaction phases appear as function of time and also as function of peak intensity of laser beam. Limit peak intensity is the value that divides interaction mechanism A and B from one-phase interaction into dual-phase interaction. So all peak intensity values under limit peak intensity belong to MAOM (interaction mechanism A one-phase mode) or to MBOM (interaction mechanism B onephase mode) and values over that belong to MADM (interaction mechanism A dual-phase mode) or to MBDM (interaction mechanism B dual-phase mode). Decomposition process of cellulose is evolution of hydrocarbons when temperature is between 380 - 500 °C. This means that long cellulose molecule is split into smaller volatile hydrocarbons in this temperature range. As temperature increases, decomposition process of cellulose molecule changes. In range of 700 - 900 °C, cellulose molecule is mainly decomposed into H 2 gas; this is why this range is called evolution of hydrogen. Interaction in this range starts (as in range of MAOM and MBOM), when a small good quality hole is formed. This is due to “direct evaporation” of pulp via decomposition process of evolution of hydrogen. And this can be seen can be seen in spectrometer as high intensity peak of yellow light (in range of 588 - 589 nm) which refers to temperature of ~ 1750 ºC. Pyrometer does not detect this high intensity peak since it is not able to detect physical phase change from solid kraft pulp to gaseous compounds. As interaction time between laser beam and dried kraft pulp continues, hypothesis is that three auto ignition processes occurs. Auto ignition of substance is the lowest temperature in which it will spontaneously ignite in a normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition, such as a flame or spark. Three auto ignition processes appears in range of MADM and MBDM, namely: 1. temperature of auto ignition of hydrogen atom (H 2) is 500 ºC, 2. temperature of auto ignition of carbon monoxide molecule (CO) is 609 ºC and 3. temperature of auto ignition of carbon atom (C) is 700 ºC. These three auto ignition processes leads to formation of plasma plume which has strong emission of radiation in range of visible light. Formation of this plasma plume can be seen as increase of intensity in wavelength range of ~ 475 - 652 nm. Pyrometer shows maximum temperature just after this ignition. This plasma plume is assumed to scatter laser beam so that it interacts with larger area of dried kraft pulp than what is actual area of beam cross-section. This assumed scattering reduces also peak intensity. So result shows that assumably scattered light with low peak intensity is interacting with large area of hole edges and due to low peak intensity this interaction happens in low temperature. So interaction between laser beam and dried kraft pulp turns from evolution of hydrogen to evolution of hydrocarbons. This leads to black colour of hole edges...|$|R
