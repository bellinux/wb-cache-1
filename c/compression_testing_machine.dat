The porosity of the regolith on the surface of asteroids is changed by applied pressure, and the relationship between pressure and porosity depends on the particle properties of the regolith. We performed compression measurements on samples of different materials, particle size distributions, and shapes {{to examine the relationship between}} particle size and pressure required for compression.

The initial porosity before compression was generally higher for samples with smaller particles and narrower particle size distributions. A sample compressed more easily when it consisted of smaller particles, probably due to smaller frictional forces between particles.

Steel strip surface {{oxidation}} during hot mill processing represents an industrial and environmental problem: secondary oxide is removed after roughing, but tertiary oxide scales already start to form {{before entering the}} finishing stands. Their properties affect the final steel surface quality and its response to further processing. Controlling the oxide layer growth kinetics and mechanical properties can make pickling easier and improve downstream behaviour. A thin wustite-dominated scale layer (< 20 µm) is created under controlled conditions in an original laboratory device adequately positioned in a <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> to investigate plane strain compression. A first series of oxidation tests were performed on a ULC steel grade to measure the kinetics of oxide scale growth. The samples were first heated up under a protective atmosphere (nitrogen), before being oxidised in air at different temperatures for various oxidation times. These experiments can be considered fair quantitative and qualitative simulations of scale growth as it occurs in a hot strip mill, insofar as the results thus obtained are in good agreement with the literature. After the oxide growth, plane strain compression (PSC) was performed immediately to simulate the hot rolling process. The oxide layers were characterised before and after <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> by optical and secondary electron microscopy. As expected, the oxide is seen to deform during compression.
