40|$|In {{recent years}} {{attention}} has been given to the problems of the <b>chronically</b> mentally <b>ill</b> in regard to the effects of deinstitutionalization and a need for community supports. In this study, 77 service providers to the <b>chronically</b> mentally <b>ill</b> of Multnomah County (Portland), Oregon were interviewed to assess the components of the existing community support system for this population, as well as to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the system.

30|$|The {{profile of}} <b>chronically</b> {{critically}} <b>ill</b> {{is different from}} the acute patient. Chronic ill patients have more lung and blood infection as well as dependence on mechanical ventilation as life support. Besides, the <b>chronically</b> critically <b>ill</b> have a higher survival rate in the first 21 days in ICU; however, after that period, they begin to show a progressively higher mortality.|$|R
40|$|<b>Chronically</b> {{critically}} <b>ill</b> patients often undergo prolonged mechanical ventilation. The role of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) during weaning {{of these}} patients remains unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the value of NIV and whether a parameter can predict the need for NIV in <b>chronically</b> critically <b>ill</b> patients during the weaning process. We conducted a prospective study that included <b>chronically</b> critically <b>ill</b> patients admitted to Spanish respiratory care units. The weaning method used consisted of progressive periods of spontaneous breathing trials. Patients were transferred to NIV when it proved impossible to increase the duration of spontaneous breathing trials beyond 18  h. 231 <b>chronically</b> critically <b>ill</b> patients were included in the study. 198 (85. 71 %) patients achieved weaning success (mean weaning time 25. 45 ± 16. 71  days), of whom 40 (21. 4 %) needed NIV during the weaning process. The variable which predicted the need for NIV was arterial carbon dioxide tension at respiratory care unit admission (OR 1. 08 (95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 15), p= 0. 013), with a cut-off point of 45. 5  mmHg (sensitivity 0. 76, specificity 0. 67, positive predictive value 0. 76, negative predictive value 0. 97). NIV is a useful tool during weaning in <b>chronically</b> critically <b>ill</b> patients. Hypercapnia despite mechanical ventilation at respiratory care unit admission is the main predictor of the need for NIV during weaning...|$|R
5|$|In 1996, {{cannabis}} was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} <b>chronically</b> <b>ill</b> residents. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed {{people to}} have and use cannabis but only when prescribed by a doctor/physician. Cannabis was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma. It was implemented {{as a way to}} try and help those who needed cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin Coolidge Jr. {{was born}} in Plymouth Notch, Windsor County, Vermont, on July 4, 1872, the only U.S. {{president}} to be born on Independence Day. He was the elder of the two children of John Calvin Coolidge Sr. (1845–1926) and Victoria Josephine Moor (1846–85). Coolidge Senior engaged in many occupations, and developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, storekeeper and public servant. He held various local offices, including {{justice of the peace}} and tax collector and served in the Vermont House of Representatives as well as the Vermont Senate. Coolidge's mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer. She was <b>chronically</b> <b>ill</b> and died, perhaps from tuberculosis, when Coolidge was twelve years old. His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875–1890), {{died at the age of}} fifteen, probably of appendicitis, when Coolidge was eighteen. Coolidge's father married a Plymouth schoolteacher in 1891, and lived to the age of eighty.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{traveled}} to New York and Philadelphia and, with letters of introduction in hand, {{was able to}} further acquaint himself with his adopted country and meet noted leaders, including George Washington and New York governors John Jay and George Clinton. Despite his enjoyment of this high society, he returned to Williamsburg and there began a courtship with Mary Byrd Farley, who was possessed of much charm and fortune, and to whom he proposed. Though he had initially preferred to delay the wedding until he had passed the bar, he gave in to his heart's desire, borrowed the needed funds from an uncle, and they married in October 1797. To help Mary, who was <b>chronically</b> <b>ill</b> with consumption, Tucker arranged a trip to his old home in Bermuda. The stay there provided Mary no relief from her illness and confirmed his desire to be in Virginia. They returned to Williamsburg, setting up residence, with his intention to read for the bar exam. Except for trips to North Carolina to collect rents on his wife's property, Tucker avoided his work, attended horse races in Fredericksburg, and frequented fashionable watering places with friends and family; he made Thomas Jefferson's acquaintance at this time. Mary never recovered from her infirmities, and died childless in 1799.|$|E

40|$|The {{intent of}} this study was to examine the {{perceived}} resources and obstacles which were related to the utilization of mental health services by <b>chronically</b> mentally <b>ill</b> Mexican American clients. Specifically, the study identified resources and obstacles encountered by six <b>chronically</b> mentally <b>ill</b> clients and six family members as they accessed various mental health services. The study was conducted in the fall of 1985 from clients currently receiving services from La Frontera Center, Inc., Tucson, Arizona. Data were interpreted through content analysis to conceptualize and categorize client and family member responses. <b>Chronically</b> mentally <b>ill</b> clients relied heavily on individuals such as friends, therapist and priest as resources for mental health service support. In contrast, family members focused primarily on institutions for resource support. Financial resources, institutional policies, denial, and the lack of personal direction were listed as obstacles to seeking mental health services by clients and family members. Study results suggested that the perceptions of traditional and nontraditional obstacles and resources by Mexican American clients and family members continue to strongly influence utilization of mental health services In particular, the issue of "stigma" and the personal qualities and abilities of the therapist emerged as significant descriptors in client and family member self statements...|$|R

25|$|In Canada, an NP is a {{registered}} nurse with a graduate degree in nursing. Canada recognizes them in the following specialties: primary healthcare NPs (PHCNP) and acute care NPs (ACNP). NPs diagnose illnesses, prescribe pharmaceuticals, order and interpret diagnostic tests, and perform procedures in their scope of practice. PHCNPs work in places like community healthcare centers, primary healthcare settings and long term care institutions. The main focus of PHCNPs includes health promotion, preventative care, treatment and diagnosis of acute illnesses and injuries, and overseeing and managing chronic diseases. ANCNPs are specialized NPs who serve a specific population of patients. They administer care to individuals who are acutely, critically or <b>chronically</b> <b>ill</b> patients. ANCNPs generally work in in-patient facilities that include neonatology, nephrology, and cardiology units.|$|E
25|$|Hospice {{care is a}} type of {{care and}} {{philosophy}} of care that focuses on the palliation of a <b>chronically</b> <b>ill,</b> terminally ill or seriously ill patient's pain and symptoms, and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs. In Western society, the concept of hospice has been evolving in Europe since the 11th century. Then, and for centuries thereafter in Roman Catholic tradition, hospices were places of hospitality for the sick, wounded, or dying, as well as those for travelers and pilgrims. The modern concept of hospice includes palliative care for the incurably ill given in such institutions as hospitals or nursing homes, but also care provided to those who would rather spend their last months and days of life in their own homes. The first modern hospice care was created by Cicely Saunders in 1967.|$|E
500|$|Pneumonia affects {{approximately}} 450million people globally (7% of the population) {{and results}} in about 4million deaths per year.

40|$|Background <b>Chronically</b> {{critically}} <b>ill</b> patients {{often have}} {{high costs of}} care and poor outcomes and thus might benefit from a disease management program. Objectives To evaluate how adding a disease management program to the usual care system affects outcomes after dis-charge from the hospital (mortality, health-related quality of life, resource use) in <b>chronically</b> critically <b>ill</b> patients. Methods In a prospective experimental design, 335 intensive care patients who received more than 3 days of mechanical ventilation at a university medical center were recruited. For 8 weeks after discharge, advanced practice nurses provided an intervention that focused on case management and interdisci-plinary communication to patients in the experimental group.
