40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the procedures and results of constructing a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory for South Africa, using the official national energy balance for 1998. In doing so, the paper offers {{a snapshot of}} the South African energy supply and demand profile and encompassing greenhouse gas emissions profiles, disaggregated into 40 economic sectors, for the reference year. For convenience, energy supply and use are reported in both native units and terra joule (TJ), while emissions are expressed in <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>equivalents</b> and reported in giga-gram (Gg). While <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> makes an overwhelming contribution to global anthropogenic GHG emissions, the inclusion of methane and nitrous oxide offers considerable richness to the analysis of climate change policies. Applying the energy balances, it was possible to compile a comprehensive emissions inventory using a consistent methodology across all sectors of the economy. The inventory allows the economic analyst to model various economic policies either with fuel as an input to production, or the consumption of fuel or the emissions generated during combustion, as a base of the analysis. The dominant role of coal as a source of energy, with a total primary energy supply (TPES) of 3. 3 million TJ or 70 per cent of the total TPES, is clearly shown. Emissions from coal combustion (263 783 Gg of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>equivalents</b> or 74. 7 per cent of total emissions) are henceforth the largest contributor to total emissions, estimated to be 352 932 Gg <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>equivalents.</b> Keywords: energy balances, greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas inventory, emission factors, economic sectors, IPCC, South Afric...|$|R

25|$|In March 2013, climate {{scientists}} Pushker Kharecha and James Hansen {{published a}} paper in Environmental Science & Technology, entitled Prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power.

The paper examined mortality levels per unit of electrical energy produced from fossil fuels (coal and natural gas) as well as nuclear power. Kharecha and Hansen assert that their results are probably conservative, as they analyze only deaths and do not include a range of serious but non-fatal respiratory illnesses, cancers, hereditary effects and heart problems, nor do they include the fact that fossil fuel combustion in developing countries tends to have a higher carbon and air pollution footprint than in developed countries. The authors also conclude that the emission of some 64 billion tonnes of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>equivalent</b> have been avoided by nuclear power between 1971 and 2009, and that between 2010 and 2050, nuclear could additionally avoid up to 80 to 240 billion tonnes.|$|E
