He cooperated with police officers on several occasions to lead them around the vicinity and point out the locations of his crimes. The data generated by this was later used with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and <b>crime</b> <b>mapping</b> technology to provide diagrams of the geographical extent of the serial murders. The Wemmer Pan serial killer trial {{was one of the}} earliest uses of GIS to aid in court prosecution by the SAPS. Geographic profiling later revealed that the majority of Maake's murders were centered on his two residences, the place where he worked, and the residences of his brother and girlfriend.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1999 {{meeting of}} the Redlands, California city council, Councilman Kasey Haws urged that the Copeland Lowery be hired because [...] "it is {{expected}} that (the cost) will be returned many times over in federal funds received." [...] The initial contract in January 2000 was for $30,000. One year later, the city reported that more than $6 million in federal funding had been dedicated to local interests, including San Timoteo Creek, the Redlands Trolley, a regional <b>crime</b> <b>mapping</b> and analysis project hosted by the police department, and the Redlands Community Center. [...] The city has continued to pay the firm $30,000 per year. (The Center for Public Integrity's database shows [...] "less than $10,000" [...] in fees paid for both 2003 and 2004; the difference was presumably part of the underreporting that was identified in June 2006.) [...] In all, the city estimated that Copeland Lowery helped Redlands secure at least $36.7 million in federal money in six years.|$|E

A hierarchical model dealing with crime analysis is proposed and applied to the regional analysis of crime in Tehran, the model helps to identify spatial concentration of crimes in specific area (area based method). In area-based methods, crime data are aggregated into geographical areas such as blocks, precincts, and for each area, the analyst computes a measure of crime value. Multicriteria evaluation concept has been used to assess the crime rate in various blocks a discrete (part) of Tehran city. In this part we used two methods for crime density assessment: • Crime assessment based on crime per block, • Crime assessment based on density of crime per population. After determination of hot spots based on two methods mentioned above spatial function is used to find suitable location to establish new police station or direct patrol to the hot spots to reduce of crime...|$|R

40|$|<b>Crime</b> <b>maps</b> are {{becoming}} significant tools in crime and justice. Advances {{in the areas}} of information technology, computing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have opened new opportunities for the use of (computerized) <b>mapping</b> in <b>crime</b> control and prevention programs. <b>Crime</b> <b>maps</b> are also valuable {{for the study of the}} ecology and the locational aspects of <b>crime.</b> <b>Maps</b> enable areas of unusually high or low concentration of crime to be visually identified. Maps are however only pictorial representations of the results of more or less complex spatial data analyses. This paper discusses the methodological problems with the spatial analysis of crime rates. The Poisson distribution is a natural candidate to model this type of data, but it has the problem that the variance is a function of the mean. In addition, rates in areas with small populations are more variable than in areas where populations are large. Moreover, data may exhibit spatial correlation, so a simple Poisson model fails to account for the whole variability in the underlying crime rates. As a consequence, maps based on crude crime rates and probability maps are misleading. A hierarchical model dealing with all these problems is proposed and applied to the regional analysis of firearm homicides in the Eastern Australian states. The analysis addresses the question of whether rural and non-rural areas differ in their associated risks of firearm-related homicide. It is shown that this risk is not associated with the rural character of an area, but with factors relating to social and economic disadvantage, which affect both rural and non-rural regions equally. 1...|$|R
