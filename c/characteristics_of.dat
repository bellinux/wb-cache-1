5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> a tropical cyclone and some <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E

30|$|In their {{examination}} of the antecedents to engagement, Schaufeli and Bakker (2004) focused on job resources and demands at the task, interpersonal, and organizational level (performance feedback, support from colleagues, and supervisory coaching). Here, we leverage complements to supervisory leadership, focusing on feedback from the work itself (task <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the work), knowledge to work independently (task <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the worker), and alternative workplace use (contextual <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the work). We also consider the mediated effects of technology support <b>of</b> work (contextual <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the work), and supervisor electronic communication (social <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the work). Below, and consistent with Schaufeli and Bakker (2004), we see engagement as supported by the achievement of work goals and the reduction of energy-depleting constraints. We outline the specific relationships, their support, and predicted outcomes, below.|$|R
