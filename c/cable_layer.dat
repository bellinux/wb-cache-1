25|$|Dynamic {{positioning}} (DP) is a {{computer-controlled system}} to automatically maintain a vessel's position and heading by using its own propellers and thrusters. Position reference sensors, combined with wind sensors, motion sensors and gyrocompasses, provide {{information to the}} computer pertaining to the vessel's position and the magnitude and direction of environmental forces affecting its position. Examples of vessel types that employ DP include, {{but are not limited}} to, ships and semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling units (MODU), oceanographic research vessels, <b>cable</b> <b>layer</b> ships and cruise ships.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model {{to study the}} static pressure distribution among the layers of an optical fiber cable spool based on the force analysis of the cable system. Using the distributed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technique, the static pressures within the fiber <b>cable</b> <b>layers</b> of the spool were measured according to the Bragg wavelength shifts of the FBGs embedded in the cable. The effects of the cable spool shrinkage owing to the pressure from outer fiber <b>cable</b> <b>layers</b> on the <b>cable</b> tension and the radial pressure were analyzed in detail. As a result, {{the relationship between the}} applied static pressure upon the fiber and the resulted Bragg wavelength shift of the FBG was deduced. The static pressure distribution of the fiber optical cable spool is obtained both in theory and experiment. Theoretical simulations coincide with experimental results.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} losses in a two conducting-layer REBCO cable {{fabricated}} {{by researchers at}} Furukawa Electric Co. Ltd. The losses were calculated {{using a combination of}} my electric circuit (EC) model with a two-dimensional finite element method (2 D FEM). The helical pitches of the tapes in each layer, P 1 and P 2, were adjusted to equalize the current in both <b>cable</b> <b>layers,</b> although the loss calculation assumed infinite helical pitches and the same current in each layer at first. The results showed that the losses depended on the relative tape-position angle between the layers (θ/θ’), because the vertical field between adjacent tapes in the same layer varied with θ/θ’. When simulating the real cable, the helical pitches were adjusted and the layer currents were calculated by the EC model. These currents were input to the 2 D FEM to compute the losses. The losses changed along the cable length because the difference between P 1 and P 2 altered the θ/θ’ along this direction. The average angle-dependent and position-dependent losses were equal and closely approximated the measured losses. As an example to reduce the loss in this cable, the angle and the helical pitches were fixed at θ/θ’ = 0. 5 and P 1 = P 2 = 100 mm (S-direction). The calculation with these conditions indicated that the loss is about one order of magnitude lower than the measurement...|$|R
40|$|Lafarge Gruntar™ {{material}} is proposed {{in this paper}} as a new thermal backfill component, and different mass fractions such as 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % are examined. The thermal properties of the developed backfill are determined by experiments with respect to water content and time. Based on the experimental data {{it is found that}} the 15 % mass fraction Lafarge Gruntar™ material provides the most favorable thermal conductivity i. e. over 1. 00 W/(m K) in the dry state. This paper also presents a thermal performance optimization procedure for the high voltage underground power cable system. The new thermal backfill {{material is}} considered to be installed within the cable system to improve its thermal performance. The analyzed system consists of three underground power cables situated in a flat formation (in−line arrangement) in thermal backfill, buried in the native soil. To avoid extensive mechanical loads caused by vibrations, when locating beneath a paved ground (e. g. under road crossings), the cables are situated in High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) casing pipes filled with sand−bentonite mixture. The pipes are then placed into a thermal backfill and buried in the native soil. The Installation of thermal backfill material is relatively expensive since in many cases the buried line is installed over many kilometers. Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal dimensions of the <b>cable</b> bedding <b>layer</b> to minimize the material and installation costs while keeping efficient heat dissipation from the cables. The momentum-type Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) solver, with a dynamic penalty function, is used to minimize the cable backfill cross-sectional area while not exceeding the allowable temperature of the cable operation. The performed optimization procedure obtains the converged solution. The temperature distribution in soil, cables, and the <b>cable</b> backfill <b>layer</b> is determined using the Finite Element Method. The Campbell − de Vries thermal conductivity model is employed for the soil surrounding the underground power cable system. An MATLAB code is written for solving the heat conduction equation and to determine the temperature distribution within the underground power cable system. By using the momentum-type Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, it is possible to design the best-found dimensions of the <b>cable</b> bedding <b>layer</b> (width and height). Moreover, the dynamic penalty function employed in the optimization procedure has assured the determination of the maximum temperature of cable conductor close to its best-found value...|$|R
