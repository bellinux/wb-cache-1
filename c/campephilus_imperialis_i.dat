5000|$|Imperial woodpecker, <b>Campephilus</b> <b>imperialis</b> - {{probably}} extinct (late 20th century) ...|$|R
50|$|The largest known {{woodpecker}} is the {{possibly extinct}} imperial woodpecker (<b>Campephilus</b> <b>imperialis)</b> {{with a total}} length of about 22 inches (50 centimeters). The largest woodpecker confirmed to be extant is the great slaty woodpecker (Mulleripicus pulverulentus).|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season of C. p. bairdii occurred from March-June. It has been surmised that the woodpecker's foraging specialisation {{may have led}} to its forming small groups, much like <b>Campephilus</b> <b>imperialis</b> which was occasionally reported in groups of eight or more individuals; this behaviour would enable the birds to best exploit a patchily-occurring food source.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of agrarian reform in the 1930s and 1940s, federal lands and cattle ranches that would become Janos were redistributed to the landless poor. In {{subsequent}} years, overgrazing and forestry companies significantly altered environmental conditions. The grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis), gray wolves (Canis lupus) and imperial woodpeckers (<b>Campephilus</b> <b>imperialis)</b> that inhabited the mountains became extinct.|$|R
50|$|The museum {{also has}} {{numerous}} rare items in its collection, including two specimens of the likely-to-be extinct imperial woodpecker (<b>Campephilus</b> <b>imperialis).</b> Only 120 museum specimens {{of the bird}} are known {{to exist in the}} world. Since there are no known photographs or recordings of a living imperial woodpecker these specimens are the only records ornithologists have to study and understand the species.|$|R
50|$|The Magellanic {{woodpecker}} is 36 to 45 cm in length. Males of {{this species}} weigh 312-363 g (11-13 oz), and females weigh 276-312 g (9.7-11 oz). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 20.5 to 23 cm, the tail is 13.9 to 16.8 cm, the bill is 4.3 to 6 cm and the tarsus is 3.3 to 3.9 cm. They are the largest South American woodpeckers {{and one of the}} largest woodpeckers in the world. Among the species known to be extant, only the non-neotropical members of the Dryocopus genus and the great slaty woodpeckers (Mulleripicus pulverulentus) are larger-bodied. With the likely extinction of the Ivory-billed and imperial woodpeckers (<b>Campephilus</b> <b>imperialis),</b> the Magellanic woodpecker is the largest remaining member of the Campephilus genus.|$|R
50|$|The {{imperial}} woodpecker (<b>Campephilus</b> <b>imperialis)</b> {{is a member}} of the woodpecker family, Picidae. The genus Campephilus is essentially a tropical one, embracing 13 species, including the {{imperial woodpecker}}. If it is not extinct, it is the world's largest woodpecker species, at 56 - 60 cm long. Researchers have discovered that the imperial woodpecker has slow climbing strides and a fast wing-flap rate compared with other woodpeckers. Owing to its close taxonomic relationship, and a similarity in appearance, to the ivory-billed woodpecker, it is sometimes called the Mexican ivorybill, but this name is also used for the pale-billed woodpecker. The large and conspicuous bird has long been known to the native inhabitants of Mexico and was called cuauhtotomomi in Nahuatl, uagam by the Tepehuán, and cumecócari by the Tarahumara.|$|R
40|$|We used ancient DNA {{analysis}} of seven museum specimens {{of the endangered}} North American ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) and three specimens of the species from Cuba to document their degree of differentiation and their relationships to other Campephilus woodpeckers. Analysis of these mtDNA sequences reveals that the Cuban and North American ivory bills, along with the imperial woodpecker (<b>Campephilus</b> <b>imperialis)</b> of Mexico, are a monophyletic group and are roughly equidistant genetically, suggesting each lineage may be a separate species. Application of {{both internal and external}} rate calibrations indicates that the three lineages split more than one million years ago, in the Mid-Pleistocene. We thus can exclude the hypothesis that Native Americans introduced North American ivory-billed woodpeckers to Cuba. Our sequences of all three woodpeckers also provide an important DNA barcoding resource for identification of non-invasive samples or remains of these critically endangered and charismatic woodpeckers...|$|R

2500|$|Dr. Michael Collins {{reported}} nine {{sightings of}} Ivory-billed Woodpeckers in the Pearl River in Louisiana in 2006 and 2008, including an encounter in which kent calls came from two directions {{at the same}} time, and an additional sighting (of two birds) in the Choctawhatchee River in 2007. Three of these sightings are supported by video evidence. Additional analysis of these videos was published in an earlier paper, along with comments by independent experts. Bret Tobalske, an ornithologist who specializes in the flight mechanics of woodpeckers, performed an analysis of wing motion {{and concluded that the}} bird in the 2008 video is a large woodpecker. Only two large woodpeckers occur north of Mexico, but the flap rate is about ten standard deviations greater than the mean flap rate of the pileated woodpecker. The flight speed, narrow wings, and prominent white patches on the dorsal surfaces of the wings are also consistent with ivory-billed but not pileated woodpecker. Avian artist Julie Zickefoose analyzed the 2006 video and commented on the [...] "rared-back pose, long but fluffy and squared-off crest, and extremely long, erect head and neck" [...] and an unusual short flight that {{does not seem to be}} consistent with a pileated woodpecker. A size comparison was carried out using part of the tree in which the bird in the 2006 video was perched. Two forks made it possible to scale frames from the video relative to a photo of a pileated woodpecker specimen that was mounted on the tree. On the basis of the comparison, it is clear that the bird in the video is a large woodpecker, and the size appears to be consistent with an ivory-billed woodpecker. The 2007 video shows events involving a woodpecker delivering a blow that is accompanied by an audible double knock, unusual swooping flights that are consistent with historical accounts of the ivory-billed woodpecker, and a takeoff with deep and rapid flaps that are similar to the flaps of the closely related imperial woodpecker (<b>Campephilus</b> <b>imperialis)</b> taking off.|$|R

40|$|The pine-oak {{forests of}} the Sierra Madre Occidental, a {{mountain}} range in NW Mexico, have recently been recognized as an area of high endemism and biodiversity. Selective logging threatens three bird species endemic to this habitat, who depend on standing dead trees (snags). This report {{is based on an}} 11 month field survey that aimed to locate oldgrowth remnants and to assess the status of the endemic birds. Old-growth is defined here as a forest that has never been logged mechanically. Old-growth forests were located by ground-truthing of areas predicted by various methods: analyses of topographical maps and satellite images, aerial surveys, interviews with forestry technicians and local inhabitants, and literature studies. None of the prediction methods gives unambiguous results on their own. Only by applying the whole set of techniques could a comprehensive inventory be obtained of old-growth sites. Of the original 93, 560 km² of pine-oak habitat in the Sierra Madre Occidental, 571 km² remained as old-growth in 1995. This is a reduction of 99. 4 %. The forests on high mesas, where the largest and most accessible timber stood, have been reduced to 22 km² uncut forest. In logged forests pines greater than 30 cm girth have been extracted and snags have been cut for the production of paper pulp. Small settlements are everywhere. Information on the Imperial Woodpecker <b>Campephilus</b> <b>imperialis</b> was obtained through interviews with 62 elder inhabitants who had known the bird. The extinction peak of this species was between 1946 and 1965, when 60 % of the informants saw their last Imperial Woodpecker. Hunting by settlers and loggers, for fun and for medicinal purposes, quickly decimated populations. Recovery from the shooting became impossible through the ensuing logging of nearly all the pine-oak habitat. Mature pines and pine snags were removed, depriving the Imperial Woodpecker of foraging and nesting sites. Imperial Woodpeckers were often seen in groups. A typical group consisted of seven or eight birds. With an estimated average density of one Imperial Woodpecker per 13 km², the original pine-oak habitat in the whole range of the species may have carried only 8, 000 individuals or 1060 groups. Interviews, and workings found in one old-growth area, indicate that very few Imperial Woodpeckers may have survived into the 1990 s. Extinction of the species seems nevertheless inevitable since nowhere does any breeding habitat remain. Cutting of snags is the main threat to the Thick-billed Parrot Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha. This species only breeds at altitudes above 2300 m, but snags are scarce on the exploited mesa forests in the highest parts of the sierra. The breeding range runs from within 85 km of the US border in northern Chihuahua south to central western Durango, with an apparent gap in southern Chihuahua. Pine seeds for foraging are widely available in young recovering forest. Compared with historical records, encountered groups of wintering Thick-billed Parrots were small, few groups were seen, and the numbers of bathing and drinking parrots at a waterfall in northern Chihuahua were low. This indicates numbers have sharply declined {{in the course of the}} 20 th century. The status of the Eared Trogon Euptilotis neoxenus is far less critical. Eared Trogons were observed at 55 locations, mainly in canyons. Nests were found in riparian corridors in canyons. Such corridors are hardly accessible to the logging industry. The ability, and probable preference, of the Eared Trogon to breed in canyons likely explains why it is still fairly common. The erroneous notion that the Eared Trogon is a local and rare species must stem from the paucity of field studies in the Sierra Madre Occidental, as well as the wariness of the bird. It is mostly to be detected by its vocalizations. Efforts are being made to ensure the total protection of three priority areas (figures 26 to 28). These areas encompass the main old-growth fragments in the Sierra Madre Occidental. They are also of major importance to the endemic fauna. Protection of snags is required for three breeding areas of the Thick-billed Parrot (figures 29 to 31). Ideally, exploitation of snags should be banned throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental...|$|R
