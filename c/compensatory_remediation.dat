40|$|The Environmental Liability Directive (ELD) {{establishes}} {{a framework of}} liability based on the 'polluter-pays' principle to prevent and remedy environmental damage. The ELD requires the testing of appropriate equivalency methods to assess the scale of compensatory measures needed to offset damage. The aim {{of this paper is}} to contribute to fill the existing knowledge gap on the application of the value equivalency approach for damage compensation in this context. We analyze the toxic spill damaging the Doñana National Park (Spain) in 1998. The welfare losses associated with the resource damage are estimated using non-market valuation and compared to the value of the compensatory measures taken after the accident. Our results show that the in-kind compensation may have been insufficient to offset the welfare losses. We conclude that a more comprehensive knowledge of the human welfare effects caused by environmental damage is of substantial importance to determine <b>compensatory</b> <b>remediation,</b> as insufficient information in this respect can lead to erroneous decisions causing loss to society. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Nigeria {{has been}} engaged in the {{business}} of oil exploration, prospecting and marketing for several years now. The exploratory activities of the oil multinational companies (MNCs) in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria have contributed to the deprivation of the inhabitants and have led to the loss of biodiversity and the disruption of the ecosystem. Paradoxically, the compensation the local inhabitants receive is often not paid, inadequate, delayed or contentious, thus leaving them poorer. Although there are several Nigerian laws protecting the environment, there is no comprehensive legislation that addresses the issue of compensation and liability for inhabitants suffering from the consequences of environmental damage. This article reveals the inadequacies of Nigerian laws on compensation and suggests the need for an acceptable <b>compensatory</b> and <b>remediation</b> regime to protect the interests of the environment and the victims of environmental harm...|$|R
50|$|A 58-year-old male {{presented}} with Bálint's syndrome secondary to severe {{traumatic brain injury}} 4-months post-injury onset. He had completed a comprehensive post-acute brain injury rehabilitation program. He received 6 months of rehabilitation services as an inpatient. A three-pronged approach included the implementation of (a) <b>compensatory</b> strategies, (b) <b>remediation</b> exercises and (c) transfer of learned skills in multiple environments and situations. Comprehensive neuropsychological and occupational therapy evaluations were performed at admission and at discharge. Neuropsychological test improvements were noted on tasks that assess visuospatial functioning, although most gains were noted for functional and physical abilities.|$|R
