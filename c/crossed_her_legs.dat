6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{sitting in}} a chair and <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> [...] "I've found my forte at last. For three years, nearly, I've been {{employed}} by the Secret Service Department at Washington." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the Bertin portrait, which required of Ingres a prolonged struggle {{to arrive at the}} final seated pose, Ingres apparently settled on the basic composition of the Rothschild portrait at the very first session. The arrangement of Rothschild's upper body may have been partly inspired by a pastel by the Swiss artist Jean-Étienne Liotard, the Portrait of Louise d'Épinay (1759), which Ingres is known to have especially admired. The liveliness of Ingres' portrait is enhanced by the casual way the sitter leans forward over <b>her</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>legs.</b> According to the art historian Aileen Ribiero, [...] "Madame de Rothschild's pose - the way she <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> so that the shape of her knee can clearly be seen - might have been regarded as rather risqué, if we are to believe the etiquette books", which at the time cautioned that a woman should not <b>cross</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> when seated.|$|R
6000|$|MAUD. [Struggling to {{withdraw}} {{her hand and}} finally succeeding. Her voice is rather faint.] Ye-es, er [...] . Bob [...] . er [...] . {{glad to see you}} again.

6000|$|She wheezed in, sighed, gave Carol a pulpy hand, sighed, glanced sharply at {{the revelation}} of ankles as Carol <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> sighed, {{inspected}} the new blue chairs, smiled with a coy sighing sound, and gave voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you live, as I understand, over at {{the pretty}} little cottage. It is very {{nice of you to}} call so early. I don't suppose that we shall get on, but still the {{intention}} is equally good." [...] She <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> and leaned her back against the marble mantelpiece.|$|E
60|$|The Countess {{stepped into}} the room in silence, threw herself on a chair, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs.</b> In her lace and velvet, with a good display of smooth black {{stocking}} and of snowy petticoat, and with the refined profile of her face and slender plumpness of her body, she showed in singular contrast to the big, black, intellectual satyr by the fire.|$|E
5000|$|Hays' {{philosophy}} {{might best}} be summed up by a statement he reportedly made to a movie director: [...] "When you make a woman <b>cross</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> in the films, maybe you don't need {{to see how she}} can cross them and stay within the law; but how low she can cross them and still be interesting".|$|R
60|$|Then {{came the}} timid archdeacon, a little bewildered {{by the company}} in which he found himself, glad that his {{daughter}} was considered to have distinguished herself, but unable to help glancing at her {{from time to time}} with nervous apprehension. But Tuppence behaved admirably. She forbore to <b>cross</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> set a guard upon her tongue, and steadfastly refused to smoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "He don't {{go by the}} photographs," [...] Martha Grimes explained. [...] "He {{believes}} that he crossed from Liverpool with this Mr. Douglas Romilly, and that you," [...] she continued, <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> and smoothing down her skirt to hide her shabby shoes, [...] "are so much like him that he came down last night {{to see if there}} was anything else he could find out from me before he paid a visit to police headquarters." ...|$|R
60|$|He stood quite dumb. The girl's newly-revealed {{personality}} {{seemed to}} fill the room. He felt crowded out. She was, at that stage, absolutely mistress of the situation.... She passed him carelessly by, flung herself into the easy-chair and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs.</b> As though he were looking at some person in another world, he {{realized that she was}} wearing shoes of shapely cut, and silk stockings.|$|E
60|$|I {{did not get}} her, at all. When she {{got tired}} of the game at last, she rose from almost under my hand and flew aloft with the rush and whir of a shell and lit on the highest limb of a great tree and sat down and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> and smiled down at me, and seemed gratified to see me so astonished.|$|E
6000|$|He beckoned {{with his}} hand, calling out, [...] "Louisa! Louisa! come here, please"; and, presently, {{one of the}} Laspara girls (they had been staring at Razumov from behind the samovar) came along, {{trailing}} a bedraggled tail of dirty flounces, and dragging with her a chair, which she set against the door, and, sitting down on it, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs.</b> The young man thanked her effusively, and rejoined a group carrying on an animated discussion in low tones. Razumov lost himself for a moment.|$|E
5000|$|These musicians {{were bound}} by an {{unofficial}} set of morals (artistic and personal) dictated by Welk, {{and if he}} believed the audience did not find them wholesome enough, they would be fired. Former [...] "Champagne Lady" [...] Alice Lon was fired in 1959 for <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> on a desk, which angered Welk. After he fired Lon, thousands of letters filled the ABC mailroom, demanding an apology, and that she be rehired. Welk tried to get Lon back but she refused.|$|R
5000|$|Next up, Little Kitty {{attempts}} to recite [...] "Mary Had a Little Lamb". She is so nervous that she forgets {{a couple of}} lines (even confusing snow for corn flakes) and then proceeds with the rhyme but gradually speeds up her voice to a high pitch. Throughout her performance she is fidgeting and <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> {{in a way to}} suggest she urgently needs the toilet. She reaches the end of the rhyme as she makes a hasty exit, to a building that may be the school outhouse.|$|R
2500|$|On 8 September {{she arrived}} in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her {{masculine}} appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with la Grande Mademoiselle, she, as the latter recalls, [...] "surprised me very much – applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in <b>her</b> chair, <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature".|$|R
60|$|It was true, {{but he was}} so glad to see {{her that}} he forgot his annoyance. He had been {{occupied}} for over an hour in making things ready for her, and he now had his reward in seeing her look right and left, as she slipped her cloak from her shoulders, with evident satisfaction, although she said nothing. He had seen that the fire burnt well; jam-pots were on the table, tin covers shone in the fender, and the shabby comfort of the room was extreme. He was dressed in his old crimson dressing-gown, which was faded irregularly, and had bright new patches on it, like the paler grass which one finds on lifting a stone. He made the tea, and Katharine drew off her gloves, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> with a gesture that was rather masculine in its ease. Nor did they talk much until they were smoking cigarettes over the fire, having placed their teacups upon the floor between them.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{find him}} monotonous, I suppose. But you know--" [...] He opened the book, and began searching for {{passages}} to read aloud, {{and in a}} little time he found a good one which he considered suitable. But {{there was nothing in}} the world that bored Ridley more than being read aloud to, and he was besides scrupulously fastidious as to the dress and behaviour of ladies. In the space of fifteen minutes he had decided against Mrs. Flushing on the ground that her orange plume did not suit her complexion, that she spoke too loud, that she <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> and finally, when he saw her accept a cigarette that Hewet offered her, he jumped up, exclaiming something about [...] "bar parlours," [...] and left them. Mrs. Flushing was evidently relieved by his departure. She puffed her cigarette, stuck her legs out, and examined Helen closely as to the character and reputation of their common friend Mrs. Raymond Parry. By a series of little strategems she drove her to define Mrs. Parry as somewhat elderly, by no means beautiful, very much made up--an insolent old harridan, in short, whose parties were amusing because one met odd people; but Helen herself always pitied poor Mr. Parry, who was understood to be shut up downstairs with cases full of gems, while his wife enjoyed herself in the drawing-room. [...] "Not that I believe what people say against her--although she hints, of course--" [...] Upon which Mrs. Flushing cried out with delight: ...|$|E
50|$|He {{became the}} {{retained}} jockey for Sir Joseph Hawley {{and was therefore}} most often found riding for that owner's trainer, George Manning, who was based at Cannons Heath, near Kingsclere, Berkshire. Early on in his professional career, he suffered a serious accident while riding the mare Freedom in the Earl Spencer's Plate at Northampton in April 1852. As two horses closed on her to overtake, she <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> and fell, breaking her back and dying instantly. Wells himself was left with severe concussion.|$|E
5000|$|Hilton Als, in The New Yorker, {{wrote about}} the play : [...] "...is less about what happens than about how it happens—which, in the theatre, means how it’s said. Mommy and Daddy speak in rhythmic banalities. Greeting a guest named Mrs. Barker, Mommy asks, progressively, if she’d like a smoke, a drink, to <b>cross</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> and to remove her dress. Mrs. Barker {{responds}} to each inquiry in the same way: “I don’t mind if I do.” Albee is showing us the trauma of repetition: the noxious glue that holds his married couples together, despite their rage—or because of it." ...|$|R

60|$|Seeing that {{something}} was amiss, the child quietly obeyed, and perching herself in an ancient arm-chair <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> short <b>legs,</b> folded <b>her</b> plump hands over the diminutive travelling-bag she carried, and sat looking about {{the room with a}} pair of very large blue eyes, quite unabashed, though rather pensive, as if the memory of some tender parting were still fresh in her little heart.|$|R
5000|$|Ferris {{appeared}} on RTÉ's The Late Late Show in February 2006; {{in an interview}} with Pat Kenny, she said she could not condemn the killing of Garda Jerry McCabe in 1996. She stated that [...] "It wouldn’t be fair to condemn one individual action when over 3,000 were killed. I don’t feel I have the right, or that it would be fair to condemn one individual act." [...] The Late Late Show interview also caused comment because her [...] "knee-length" [...] skirt hiked up when she <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs.</b> RTÉ was sharply criticised for having their cameras pan her legs and skirt {{in the middle of the}} interview and creating a [...] "tabloid" [...] atmosphere and cheapening her appearance.|$|E
50|$|In {{the version}} {{followed}} by Ovid in Metamorphoses, Galanthis was the red-gold haired servant of Alcmene, who assisted {{her during the}} birth of Heracles. When Alcmene was in labor, she was having difficulty giving birth to a child so large. After seven days she called for assistance from Lucina, the goddess of childbirth (that is, the Greek Eileithyia). However, Lucina did not help her due to the wishes of Hera. Instead, she clasped her hands and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> preventing the child from being born. Alcmene struggled in pain, cursed the heavens, and became close to death. Galanthis noticed Lucina and deduced Hera's plans. She told the goddess that the baby was born; this so startled her that she jumped up and unclasped her hands. This freed Alcmene, {{and she was able}} to give birth. Galanthis laughed and ridiculed Lucina, and as a punishment was turned into a weasel or cat. She continued to live with Alcmene after her transformation, thus initiating the practice of weasels being kept as household animals.|$|E
40|$|A thirty-year-old {{woman with}} a history offirst degree {{prolapse}} with cystocele and enterocele after ten days of normal delivery was referred for physiotherapy. The patient complained of general discomfort and low back pain while walking. She was treated using faradic electrical stimulation with 2000 ms pulse duration and lOOOms pulse interval at an intensity of 37 mA. This output was used for 20 minutes at each treatment session twice a weekfor seven weeks. The indifferent electrode was placed at the lumbosacral region with the patient in supine position. The active electrode was {{placed in front of}} the labia majus {{due to a lack of}} vaginal electrode, and the patient was asked to <b>cross</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> in order to hold the electrode in place with the adductor muscles. The prolapse resolved and the low back pain disappeared after seven weeks oftreatment. Key words: electrostimulation, uterine prolapse, pelvic floor muscles, exercis...|$|R
60|$|She {{moved in}} her chair a little nervously, <b>crossing</b> and uncrossing <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> more than once. Her white silk {{stockings}} underneath her black skirt were exceedingly effective, a fact of which she never lost consciousness, although at that moment she was scarcely inspired to play the coquette.|$|R
5000|$|Ana Gasteyer {{played the}} host of a TV show called Pretty Living. Each episode {{featured}} Molly Shannon as Helen Madden, an exuberant self-proclaimed [...] "Joyologist" [...] whose trademark phrase was [...] "I love, I love it!" [...] while kicking <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> and <b>crossing</b> and uncrossing <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> repeatedly. Helen Madden also appeared in an earlier 1996 sketch called [...] "Single and Loving it" [...] with Cheri Oteri. Debuted March 14, 1998.|$|R
5000|$|In R. Nichole Rougeau's 2005 dissertation, {{she writes}} of the gypsy {{photograph}} of Evelyn (upper right): [...] "Evelyn symbolizes {{a form of}} the Blakean child, not really existing in the society depicted by the gypsy camp in the upper right of the photograph. Instead she {{is a part of}} the landscape, leaning against what could be interpreted as the tree of knowledge. She seeks knowledge about her sexuality and her eventual move away from the water of her youth to the society of the camp behind her. In calling her a “gipsy” Carroll infers the child is in a perpetual state of movement, belonging neither to society nor completely to nature. He blurs her nipples and has <b>her</b> <b>cross</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> again to hide genitalia and to suggest he is not commenting on the child’s reproductive ability, but her innocent sexuality. In picturing her this way, he strips her of her naturalness. She is not a true child, but a fictional one, Carroll’s ideal, the woman child who will never have sex." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{the devil}} may {{describe}} them, for I cannot; but, for example--Since her brother has insisted on her receiving me, or I should rather say on her appearing when I visit Shaws-Castle, {{one would think}} her invention has toiled in discovering different ways of showing want of respect to me, and dislike to my presence. Instead of dressing herself as a lady should, especially on such occasions, she chooses some fantastic, or old-fashioned, or negligent bedizening, which makes her at least look odd, if it cannot make her ridiculous--such triple tiaras of various-coloured gauze on her head--such pieces of old tapestry, I think, instead of shawls and pelisses--such thick-soled shoes--such tan-leather gloves--mercy upon us, Hal, the very sight of her equipment would drive mad a whole conclave of milliners! Then her postures are so strange--she does so stoop and lollop, as the women call it, so <b>cross</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> and square <b>her</b> arms--were the goddess of grace to look down on her, it would put her to flight for ever!" ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Buskbody now {{placed her}} left {{foot on the}} fender, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> right <b>leg</b> over <b>her</b> knee, lay back on the chair, and looked towards the ceiling. When I {{observed}} her assume this contemplative mood, I concluded she was studying some farther cross-examination, and therefore took my hat and wished her a hasty good-night, ere the Demon of Criticism had supplied her with any more queries. In like manner, gentle Reader, returning you my thanks for the patience which has conducted you thus far, I take the liberty to withdraw myself from you for the present.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{of these}} {{conditions}} are self-correcting during childhood. In the worst cases, surgery may be needed. [...] Most of the time, this involves lengthening the Achilles tendon. Less severe treatment options for pigeon toe include keeping a child from <b>crossing</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> use of corrective shoes, and casting of the foot and lower legs, which is normally done before the child reaches 12 months of age or older.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] is a French term meaning [...] "arrow," [...] {{referring}} to the surprising style of the attack. Under FIE rules it is illegal for a sabreur to <b>cross</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> making the flèche illegal. Sabreurs can instead use a flunge - a portmanteau of flying and lunge - where a lunge (generally cutting to head) is made with a leap to give speed and close the extra distance.|$|R

60|$|With the recoil of her exerted strength, she too reeled, {{staggered}} back, {{and sat on}} {{the edge}} of the bed. Out of breath, but calm and unabashed, she busied herself in readjusting under her arms the brown and yellow figured Celebes sarong, the tuck of which had come undone during the fight. Then, folding her bare arms tightly on her breast, she leaned forward on <b>her</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>legs,</b> determined and without fear.|$|R
