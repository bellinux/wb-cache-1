500|$|Alejandro González Iñárritu was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} appointed as director, but film commitments later forced him {{to pull out of}} the project. Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of what it must be like to be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> all live our lives. That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier—I've never analyzed books about that kind of stuff and I've never really watched procedurals.

[...] According to UN.GIFT, before Not My Life, there was [...] "no single communication tool that effectively depict the problem as a whole for a mass audience." [...] Susan Bissell, UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief, agreed with this assertion, and said that the film [...] "takes {{a close look at the}} underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [...] it will <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> see our lives, in some very fundamental ways." [...] She also said that Not My Life is an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse. A reviewer from Medical News Today praised the film for [...] "raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects," [...] arguing that these activities [...] "are critical to empower families, communities, and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harris {{says the}} idea of free will [...] "cannot be mapped on to any {{conceivable}} reality" [...] and is incoherent. According to Harris, science [...] "reveals {{you to be a}} biochemical puppet." [...] People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, [...] "emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control." [...] Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> think about {{some of the most important}} questions in life.|$|E
2500|$|... "Researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a Department of Energy lab in Tennessee, have {{discovered}} a mechanism for converting carbon dioxide into ethanol. Their method takes advantage of nanotechnology, creating a catalyst that produces ethanol from a solution of carbon dioxide in water. 'We discovered somewhat by accident that this material worked,' said Adam Rondinone, the lead {{author of a new}} study in the journal ChemistrySelect. 'We were trying to study the first step of a proposed reaction when we realized that the catalyst was doing the entire reaction on its own.' The discovery may <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> think about carbon dioxide. If it could be captured and turned into a fuel, then carbon dioxide – the earth-polluting byproduct of global dependence on fossil fuels – could help high-energy societies work toward energy independence. Repurposing carbon dioxide could be invaluable for the environment, the researchers say. Converting it into ethanol can turn a greenhouse gas into a gasoline-like fuel source. Ethanol contains one-third less energy than gasoline but produces far fewer byproducts when burned in engines, which can limit further carbon emissions. 'Closing the carbon cycle by utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for currently used commodities, in order to displace a fossil feedstock, is an appropriate intermediate step towards a carbon-free future,” the researchers wrote in the study." ...|$|E
