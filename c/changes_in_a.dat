5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small set of conserved genes.|$|E

5|$|Bute {{was closely}} {{involved}} in the developments across Glamorganshire {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> short period of time. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soured, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a major industrial enterprise.|$|E

Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy.

5|$|Pregnancy {{presents}} substantial health risks, even {{in developed}} countries, and despite advances in obstetrical science and practice. Maternal mortality remains {{a major problem}} in global health and is considered a sentinel event in judging the quality of health care systems. Adolescent pregnancy represents a particular problem, whether intended or unintended, and whether within marriage or a union or not. Pregnancy results in major <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> girl's life, physically, emotionally, socially and economically and jeopardises her transition into adulthood. Adolescent pregnancy, more often than not, stems from a girl's lack of choices. or abuse. Child marriage (see below) is a major contributor worldwide, since 90% of births to girls aged 15–19 occur within marriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E

This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E
