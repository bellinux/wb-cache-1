Between 1993 and 1999, BRTA administrator Diane Smith worked to advance plans for an intermodal transit center.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{character of}} the coastal erosion phenomenon imposes to Public Administrations huge investments in order to defend beaches and the connected economic activities. Forsaken the illusion about “definitive ” coastal defence jobs, which have created more problems than they have resolved, it appears more and more evident that the preserve of sandy coasts suffering by erosion, {{is tied to the}} beach nourishment. However this technique of coastal defence, that concerns beach reconstruction or maintenance, demands the availability of significant deposits of good quality and low cost sand. The Public Administrations have the problem to face important expenses for these jobs in front of which the tourist economic activities record remarkable advantages. The shoreline defence cost sustainability is connected to the contribution that local Administrations and tourist companies are able to offer. A right <b>cost-benefits</b> <b>analysis</b> helps to verify the feasibility of a job and helps also to estimate the charge to the local companies in order to bear maintenance costs. The Lazio Region has faced the study of the nourishment cost-benefits by means of various appraisal systems, carried out in the BEACHEMD european project. Two main assessment systems of the benefits regard a first local level (beach areas direct profits) and a second more general level (global induced economy). With study of the first level it has been possible to calculate the cash flows connected to a reconstruction and maintenance activity managed in a private way. The <b>cost-benefits</b> <b>analysis</b> allows moreover characterizing project criteria as the optimal beach amplitude or the maintenance sustainable cost. New and specific analysis about this matter, are scheduled to be developed {{in the context of the}} new european project BEACHMED_e...|$|R

25|$|<b>Cost–benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is often}} used by {{organizations}} to appraise the desirability of a given policy. It is {{an analysis of the}} expected balance of benefits and costs, including an account of foregone alternatives and the status quo. CBA helps predict whether the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs, and by how much relative to other alternatives, so that one can rank alternate policies in terms of the cost–benefit ratio. Generally, accurate <b>cost–benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> identifies choices that increase welfare from a utilitarian perspective. Assuming an accurate CBA, changing the status quo by implementing the alternative with the lowest cost–benefit ratio can improve Pareto efficiency. While CBA can offer a well-educated estimate of the best alternative – perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and benefits is difficult –, perfection in terms of economic efficiency and social welfare are not guaranteed.|$|E

The recommendations will range from broad philosophical statements about questionnaires to specific points about their construction. It should be remembered that the recommendations are ideals and are couched in value statements, and thus consideration entails a <b>cost-benefits</b> <b>analysis.</b> For example, even though a particular recommendation may present the ideal course of action, the availability of funds or personnel at DRC may restrict the fulfillment of the ideal.
