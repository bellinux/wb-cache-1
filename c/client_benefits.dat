5000|$|Currently, {{the most}} widely used mode of Internet writing therapy is via e-mail (see {{analytic}} psychotherapist Nathan Field's paper [...] "The Therapeutic Action of Writing in Self-Disclosure and Self-Expression"). It is i.e. messages are passed between therapist and client within an agreed time frame (for instance, one week), but at any time within that week.

40|$|State {{policies}} {{vary widely}} on paying {{friends and family}} rather than home care agencies {{to care for the}} elderly. We explore two state programs that exemplify different payment options: Michigan, which pays clients ’ informal caregivers, and Illinois, which generally pays agencies to provide services. We ask how different payment policies affect clients, specifically exploring program structure (division of labor and bases for need determination) and financing incentives created by Medicaid (centralization, means testing, and quality assurance). These factors shape provider and client preferences, well-being, and assessment of care quality. Comparatively, Illinois’s approach favors professionalism, high cost/quality, documentation, and an orientation toward medical and physical needs. It has experienced high worker turnover and less regard for caregiver-client relationships. Michigan’s approach favors informality, casual accountability, long-term stability of helping relationships, and respect for client preferences and autonomy. Both approaches offer important <b>client</b> <b>benefits,</b> but state precedents and incentives to administering agencies have shaped their overall directions.

40|$|While anecdotal {{evidence}} indicates financial advice affects consumers’ financial well-being, this research project {{is motivated by}} the absence of empirically-grounded research relating to the extent to which, and, importantly, how, financial planning advice contributes to broader client well-being. Accordingly, the aim of this project is to establish how the quality of financial planning advice can be optimised to add value, not only to clients’ financial situation, but also to broader aspects of their well-being. This broader construct of well-being captures a range of process and outcome factors that map to concepts of security, control, choice, mastery, and life satisfaction (Irving, 2012; Gallery, Gallery, Irving & Newton, 2011; Irving, Gallery, and Gallery, 2009). Financial planning is commonly purported to confer not only tangible benefits, but also intangible benefits, such as increased security and peace of mind that are considered as important, if not more important, than material outcomes. Such claims are intuitively appealing; however, little empirical evidence exists for the notion that engaging with a financial planner or adviser promotes peace of mind, feelings of security, and expands choices and possibilities. Nor is there evidence signalling what mechanisms might underpin such <b>client</b> <b>benefits.</b> In addressing this issue, we examine the financial planning advice (including financial product advice) provided to retail clients, and consider the short- and longer-term impacts on clients’ financial satisfaction and broader well-being.

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{as part of a}} wider study to discover if speech and language therapists working in the UK and Ireland are using sensory and chemesthetic stimuli in oropharyngeal dysphagia treatment and management and the reasoning behind its use. This is the qualitative component of the study. From analysis of the literature it appears that sensory and chemesthetic stimuli are not being utilized in oropharyngeal dysphagia therapy (Foley et al 2008; McCurtin 2012). Research evidence has emerged in recent years on the effectiveness of these stimuli. Objectives: To explicate the reasoning behind why speech and language therapists use or do not use sensory and chemesthetic stimuli in the management and treatment of dysphagia. Methods: A survey methodology was used. The survey link and recruitment email was sent out to the secretaries of dysphagia Special Interest Groups in Ireland and the UK. Thematic analysis was used. Results: Six main themes emerged. These themes include – what stimuli are used and when, to improve, risk factors, <b>client</b> <b>benefits,</b> lack of knowledge, lack of evidence and external factors. Both sensory and chemesthetic stimuli were reported as being used. A super-theme was developed from analysis of these themes entitled ‘Practice as specific, individual and safety conscious inhibited by barriers of a lack of knowledge, practicality and procedure’. This will be further explained in the discussion of results. Conclusions: From detailed analysis of the results the findings suggest that speech and language therapists have a clearly reasoned and though out approach for the management of dysphagia clients.

30|$|The {{participants}} {{involved in}} the processes take on different roles according to the process type. In material clauses, Actor is an inherent participant role and participant roles of Goal, Initiator, Scope, Recipient, Client, and Attribute may be {{involved in the}} process. Actor is the doer of the material process (e.g., ‘you’ in ‘You normally give me a script for Oxynorm’). Goal in material clauses receives the impact of the action (e.g., ‘a script’ in ‘You normally give me a script for Oxynorm’). Recipient occurs in [transitive] and [transformative: extending] clauses where a transfer of the possession of goods is taking place (e.g., ‘me’ in ‘You normally give me a script for Oxynorm’). Client is similar to Recipient {{in the sense that they}} both represent a benefactive role. However, while a Recipient benefits from goods, a <b>Client</b> <b>benefits</b> from services (e.g., ‘me’ in ‘They took the stitches out for me’). Scope either construes the material action (e.g., ‘chemo’ in ‘I had chemo two weeks ago’) or the domain over which the material action takes place (e.g., ‘the nurse’ in ‘I can contact the nurse’). It is different from Goal in the sense that it is not affected by the material action. Attribute may be used in a material clause ‘to construe the resultant qualitative state of the Actor or Goal after the process has been completed’ (e.g., ‘beautiful’ in ‘And the scones came out beautiful’) or ‘to specify the state in which the Actor or Goal is when it takes part in the process’ (Halliday and Matthiessen 2014). Finally, Initiator construes a participant who brings about the material action performed by the Actor (e.g., ‘I’ in ‘Can I get this stuff shipped out?’).|$|E

40|$|Widespread {{replication}} of information can ameliorate {{the problem of}} server overloading but raises the allied question of server selection. Clients may be assigned to a replica in a static manner or they may choose among replicas based on client-initiated measurements. The latter technique, called dynamic server selection (DSS), can provide significantly improved response time to users when compared with static server assignment policies (for example, based on network distance in hops). In {{the first part of}} this paper we demonstrate the idea of DSS using experiments performed in the Internet. We compare a range of policies for DSS and show that obtaining additional information about servers and paths in the Internet before choosing a server improves response time significantly. The best policy we examine adopts a strategy of never adding more than 1 % additional traffic to the network, and is still able to provide nearly all the benefits of the most expensive policies. While these results suggest that DSS is beneficial from the network user's standpoint, the system-wide effects of DSS schemes should also be closely examined. In the second part of this paper we use large-scale simulation to study the system-wide network impact of dynamic server selection. We use a simulated network of over 100 hosts that allows local-area effects to be distinguished from wide-area effects within traffic patterns. In this environment we compare DSS with static server selection schemes and confirm that <b>client</b> <b>benefits</b> remain even when many use DSS simultaneously.

40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} that group therapy for people with aphasia is effective, but {{the skills needed to}} interact with people with aphasia are complex. There is also evidence that training and guided experience can improve the skills of family members and health professionals in communicating with people with aphasia. However, there is limited research into how student speech pathologists learn to develop the communication strategies that they will teach others to use when interacting with people with aphasia. Aim: This qualitative study aimed to explore perceptions of the student learning experience in aphasia group therapy of four student speech pathologists, their clinical educator and group members with aphasia. Methods & Procedures: Four student speech pathologists, three clients with aphasia and two spouses participated in four consecutive aphasia group therapy sessions under the supervision of a speech pathology clinical educator. Semi-structured interviews with each student and the clinical educator, following the first, third and final group session, were audio recorded. Following the final session, each participant with aphasia was also interviewed. The interviews were transcribed and qualitative content analysis was used to describe the perspectives of the participants. Outcomes & Results: Analysis of the interviews revealed that student perceptions of their experience were linked to their understanding of group therapy for aphasia, their understanding of the role of communication strategies and their ideas concerning saving face and discourse equality. Findings indicated a close alignment of the perspectives of students, clinical educator and participants with aphasia in their understanding of the contribution of aphasia group therapy to student learning and <b>client</b> <b>benefits.</b> Conclusions: The findings of the present study provide preliminary information for the development of educational practices relevant to speech pathology students preparing for work with people with aphasia. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The sole {{electricity}} supplier in South Africa, Eskom, currently has an electricity supply crisis. The supplier requires additional available electricity urgently, {{particularly during the}} evening peak period between 18 : 00 and 20 : 00. This electricity shortage {{is due to a}} steady increase in the demand for electricity, which exceeded the increase in supply capacity, and the inefficient utilisation of electricity. In order to address this problem, Eskom introduced a Demand Side Management (DSM) programme. The aim of DSM projects is to reduce the load of consumers without negatively affecting consumers. Demand Side Management is beneficial for both Eskom and the client. The <b>client</b> <b>benefits</b> from a lower electricity bill and new equipment, while Eskom benefits from a reduced power demand. Various DSM strategies are implemented in different sectors, such as mining and residential. These projects are managed by Energy Service Companies (ESCo). The ESCo is responsible for the identifying, implementing, and maintaining the DSM project. Any identified DSM project is presented to Eskom, which agrees to fund the project depending on the proposed power saving. The mining industry, which has been selected as a candidate for DSM projects, as it is a major consumer of energy with numerous DSM opportunities, is examined in this dissertation. Because compressors are major consumers of electricity on the mines, significant DSM opportunities exist on compressed air systems. The purpose of this research project is to investigate and implement sustainable DSM projects on the compressed air systems of the mining industry. The focus is on automatically controlling the underground demand for compressed air. Reducing the demand for compressed air will result in lower power consumption by the compressors. Master...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – For {{more than}} 25 years {{auditing}} research has examined whether knowledge spillovers or synergies exist from the joint provision of audit and non-audit services {{as well as}} whether the audit <b>client</b> <b>benefits</b> from knowledge spillovers. However, empirical evidence on knowledge spillover remains mixed and elusive. This article seeks to contribute to this debate, using a large sample covering both the pre- and the post-Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) era. A post-SOX focus can be potentially informative because SOX has fundamentally changed the mix of audit and non-audit services that can be offered to audit clients. Design/methodology/approach – A two-stage least squares regression model is used to control for simultaneous bias due to the joint determination of audit and non-audit fees. A panel dataset is also used. Findings – A strong and significant negative relationship is found between audit fees and non-audit fees. The results suggest that knowledge spillover flows from non-audit to the audit side, {{as well as from}} the audit side to the non-audit side. For the overall sample, a 1 percent increase in non-audit fees is associated with a 0. 59 percent decrease in audit fees. Similarly, a 1 percent increase in audit fees is associated with a 0. 49 percent decrease in non-audit fees. Research limitations/implications – Though a comprehensive set of determinants of audit and non-audit fees is used, it is possible that the model may not include some other unknown determinants of fees paid to auditors. Practical implications – The study contributes to the debate on whether regulators should ban all non-audit services. It is found that when the same audit firm performs both audit and non-audit services, there are synergies, i. e. insight learned from performing one function helps the other. Social implications – At the economy level, the findings suggest that cost savings, due to knowledge spillover, are partly passed on to the clients, particularly by Big 4 auditors. Originality/value – The findings on the existence of knowledge spillover in the post-SOX era are potentially informative to regulators, auditors, audit clients, and audit committee members.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to identify the best alternative method of load shifting on clear water pumping systems in the mining industry. This can be done through a comparison analysis between manual and automated Demand Side Management (DSM) projects. The study holds benefits for Eskom and any client wishing {{to participate in the}} program. Eskom, by choosing the best method, will ensure sustainable load shifting while the <b>client</b> <b>benefits</b> financially through lower electricity costs. In order to perform this study, research was conducted on the requirements for additional electricity supply in South Africa. Research showed that there is an urgent requirement for additional electricity supply to ensure continued economical growth. DSM was identified {{as one of the most}} favourable methods that could be implemented to address the problem. A reason for this is DSM projects are economically viable and can be implemented in a relatively short time. The initiative would also decrease the need for increasing electrical generation capacity. During the research study important information regarding the computation process for load shifting and cost saving performance was gathered. Research was also conducted on the effect of DSM on labour and maintenance cost reduction, as well as economical engineering methods that can be used for alternative selection. The difference in performance between automated and manual systems was compared. The results showed that a 40 % improvement of automated systems over manual systems were attainable and sustainable. This will realise a total saving of approximately 45 % in electricity costs for the client. Savings in labour and maintenance costs are shown to be achievable through the automation of pumping systems. These saving results were used in the Engineering Economic alternative selection methods where applicable. Economic calculations confirmed that automated projects are the most viable control method. From the comparison study, it is shown that automated controlled systems are more advantageous than manually controlled systems. It will therefore be in the best interest of the client to automate a manually controlled pumping system, as it will result in additional load shifting and cost saving. Master...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} {{we use the}} tGAP (Topological Generalized Area Partition) methodology to create and consume a variable-scale topological reactive data structure to progressively transfer vector-based GIS data in client/server architectures. Many researches {{has been carried out}} in the past in this subject and different approaches and variations of the tGAP data structure have been proposed, but {{the problem of how to}} effectively communicate and transfer the data between clients and servers in client/server architecture has not been the main focus of the previous works. We describe various tGAP data structures and implement an ameliorated version of the tGAP data structure using left-right topology without edge references that minimizes both usage of the network bandwidth and the amount of data stored in the database which in turn minimizes the execution time of attribute and spatial queries. We propose two different architectures and perform methodology comparisons. First, we design a client that progressively polls vector-based spatial data from a server. The client application initiates the requests based on its current map extent and keeps track of the features drawn on the map. Every time the user pans or zooms to a smaller/larger scale in the map the multi-threaded application will asynchronously request for the termination of the previous request (if it is still in progress) and polls the data for the new scale/extent. The advantage of multi-threaded architecture in the client is that the UI thread never gets blocked while the background thread is submitting the request and retrieving the spatial data from the server. On the other hand usage of the tGAP data structures will allow the server to transfer spatial data from higher importance levels down to the lower importance levels based upon the hierarchical information that has been stored for all the faces and the edges, i. e. generalized versions of the faces will be transferred first and the client will progressively update the content of its map view by retrieving lower important neighboring objects to obtain more details. In our second design the client submits a request for the geographical data in a given map extent and server fetches the data from a spatial database. The difference with the previous approach is that this time the server pushes the data to the client and keeps track of the objects submitted to each client (session). A background thread in each client retrieves objects from the server in the same fashion, i. e. objects with higher importance levels come and drawn first etc [...] . Since the <b>client</b> <b>benefits</b> from multi-threaded mechanism users would be able to interact with the map while data are pushing from the server and no blockage in their UI thread will occur. In the end we will analyze and compare both methodologies and investigate the effectiveness of database indexes as well as spatial indexes in their performance and will show how both approaches could benefit from them...|$|E
