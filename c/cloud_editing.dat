40|$|Capturing the {{geometry}} of a large heritage site via laser scanning can produce thousands of high resolution range scans. These must be cleaned to remove unwanted artefacts. We identified three areas that can be improved upon in order to accelerate the cleaning process. Firstly {{the speed at which}} the a user can navigate to an area of interest has a direct impact on task duration. Secondly, design constraints in generalised point <b>cloud</b> <b>editing</b> software result in inefficient abstraction of layers that may extend a task duration due to memory pressure. Finally, existing semi-automated segmentation tools have difficulty targeting the diverse set of segmentation targets in heritage scans. We present a point cloud cleaning framework that attempts to improve each of these areas. First, we present a novel layering technique aimed at segmentation, rather than generic point <b>cloud</b> <b>editing.</b> This technique represents 'layers' of related points in a way that greatly reduces memory consumption and provides efficient set operations between layers. These set operations (union, difference, intersection) allow the creation of new layers which aid in the segmentation task. Next, we introduce roll-corrected 3 D camera navigation that allows a user to look around freely while reducing disorientation. A user study shows that this camera mode significantly reduces a user's navigation time (29. 8 % to 57. 8 %) between locations in a large point cloud thus reducing the overhead between point selection operations. Finally, we show how Random Forests can be trained interactively, per scan, to assist users in a point cloud cleaning task. We use a set of features selected for their discriminative power on a set of challenging heritage scans. Interactivity is achieved by down-sampling training data on the fly. A simple map data structure allows us to propagate labels in the down-sampled data back to the input point set. We show that training and classification on down-sampled point clouds can be performed in under 10 seconds with little effect on accuracy. A user study shows that a user's total segmentation time decreases between 8. 9 % and 20. 4 % when our Random Forest classifier is used. Although this initial study did not indicate a significant difference in overall task performance when compared to manual segmentation, performance improvement is likely with multi-resolution features or the use of colour range images, which are now commonplace...|$|E
40|$|The photogrammetric {{point cloud}} is a revolutionary product that {{represents}} an important breakthrough in Photogrammetry. The {{purpose of this}} research is to establish the workflow in the generation of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the photogrammetric point cloud. The photogrammetric datasets were acquired using Digital Modular Camera 01 (DMC 01) over the Putrajaya area. The main steps for Digital Elevation Model generation using the digital photogrammetric software were involved post processing image and Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU), aerial triangulation, and photogrammetric point cloud generation, point <b>cloud</b> <b>editing</b> and surfacing. The whole process was successfully performed and the output was delivered in the raster DEM format. The generated Digital Elevation Model were statistically compared with DEM’s available from airborne Light, Detect and Ranging (LiDAR) technique and ground control points (GCP’s) to measure the accuracy of DEM produced by Semi Global Matching(SGM) using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and F-test analysis. Based on the analysis, horizontal accuracy meets the expected accuracy; 0. 5 - 1. 0 Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) of images and sub-meter accuracy were obtained for vertical accuracy. In closing, elevation data generated from the SGM approach with this accuracy meet the standard practice of Department Survey and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM) for vertical direction (height) requirement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Hindu and Buddhist monuments of Angkor in Cambodia are {{the legacy}} of highly {{developed}} Khmer empires. Well-known for their structural and surface complexity they constitute a great challenge to any attempt towards precise and detailed 3 D measurements and modeling. This paper reports about a pilot project using modern techniques of analytical and digital photogrammetry to derive a photorealistic 3 D model {{of one of the}} very complex towers of the famous Bayon temple of the ancient city of Angkor Thom. This high quality model will then be subject to visualization and animation. On occasion of a balloon photogrammetry mission over the Bayon temple of Angkor, the first author took a number of tourist-type terrestrial images with a Minolta Dynax 500 si analogue SRL camera of one of the many Buddha-faced towers of Bayon. We aim at deriving automatically, after scanning of the images, a texture mapped 3 D model of the very complex object. In a first step we have generated already such a model with a mixture of manual (phototriangulation) and automated procedures (image matching for surface reconstruction, editing for blunder removal, texture mapping, visualization and animation). This result has been presented in Visnovcova et al., 2001 and includes already some novel methods for point cloud blunder editing and view-dependent texture mapping. Now we will include more images than before, intend to automate the phototriangulation procedure, develop a matching approach based on MPGC (Multiphoto Geometrically Constrained) Matching and also improve the procedure of color texture mapping. With these combined new approaches we expect a higher level of completion of the object, an improvement of the modeling quality and a shortening of the processing time to generate the 3 D model. We streamline our new method of point <b>cloud</b> <b>editing</b> and improve our new technique of view-dependent texture mapping. Finally we show how different forms of high quality visualization techniques can be used on low-cost platforms. The ultimate goal of this activity and investigation is to develop a system that is capable of producing high quality photorealistic 3 D models in fully automated mode. ...|$|E

Galaxy surveys find far fewer galaxies than predicted by analytical estimates and numerical simulations. In this paper, we suggest that these dark halos are not missing, but have been merely misplaced in the galactic astronomy section of the journals: they are the High Velocity Clouds (HVCs). We review the predictions of our model for the Local Group origin of the HVCs and its implications for the formation and the evolution of our Galaxy. We describe recent observations that confirm many of earlier predictions and discuss future tests of the model.

The aim of this program is the analysis of the mining activities’ impacts on environment and human societies. Unfortunately, there is {{only a limited number of}} specific regions (e. g. Mitterberg) to offer possibilities to investigate the former mining expansions. Within this multidisciplinary project, the archaeological sites and finds are analyzed by the Surveying and Geoinformation Unit at the University of Innsbruck. This paper shows data fusion of different surveying and post-processing methods to achieve a photo-realistic digital 3 D model of one of these most important finds, the Bronze Age sluice box from the Mitterberg. The applied workflow consists of four steps: 1. Point cloud processing, 2. Meshing of the point <b>clouds</b> and <b>editing</b> of the models, 3. Image orientation, bundle and image adjustment, 4. Model texturing. In addition, a short range laser scanning survey was organized before the conservation process of this wooden find.

40|$|Biological {{anthropology}} as {{a discipline}} continues to be holistic in both its approaches to understanding research problems and its borrowing of methods from many related disciplines. More and more, digital imaging is becoming {{an integral part of}} data acquisition and analysis in biological anthropological research. With many new emerging technologies, however, these techniques are also now contributing even more to research dissemination. One of the newest tools in anthropological research is 3 D object printing. Stereolithography has seen limited use, but the costs are often prohibitive. New developments in 3 D object printing have begun to make this technology more available to osteological studies. Here we discuss the use of 3 D laser scanning and 3 D printing to re-create human skeletal remains for a museum exhibit. A Polhemus 3 D laser scanner is used to capture the geometry and shape of the individual bones. The point <b>clouds</b> are then <b>edited</b> and exported as STL files for printing on a Z-Corp Z 406 3 D printer. The recreated bones are then incorporated into the exhibit, yielding an accurate and realistic depiction of the original skeleton. An overview of the challenges associated with the project and its successful completion are discussed {{in the context of the}} role of 3 D printing in bioarchaeological research...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} three {{techniques}} are proposed to be integrated: Terrestrial Synthetic Aperture Radar, Terrestrial Laser Scanner and Traditional Topography. Terrestrial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an evolving instrument {{that can be}} been used to detect deformations with high accuracy. The Ground-Based SAR instrument used in this paper has an intrinsic accuracy of submillimeter level which makes it suitable for high accuracy deformation detection. It is however fundamental {{to be able to}} geo-reference radar deformation data to an accurate surface model of the area of interest. This was accomplished using a terrestrial laser scanner. The use of a terrestrial laser scanner allowed a full facade overview analysis. A high resolution 3 D model has been created by registering and optimizing the scanner’s raw data point <b>clouds,</b> creating and <b>editing</b> a polygonal model and texturizing the result with high resolution photos. The created digital 3 D model, is not only a virtual reproduction, useful in visualization and exploration applications, it has also been used to collect all survey results at different levels of integration into one single environment. By using the DSM generated from laser scanner a geocoding of GB-SAR data was possible while, at the same time, the digital model was georeferenced in the UTM (ED 50) 31 N Cartographic Coordinates System by using GPS static observations to establish a reference base from which coordinates of the elements were observed using a non-prism total station. The paper describes in detail all the data collection process during the survey campaign, the three levels of data elaboration and interpretation, and the algorithm for the assessment of the GB-SAR-RAR geocoding.

The information in these reports relating to clouds, including the present weather information, was extracted and put {{through a series of}} quality control checks. Correctable inconsistencies within reports were edited for consistency, so that the ``edited cloud report`` can be used for cloud analysis. Cases of ``sky obscured`` were interpreted by reference to the present weather code as to whether they indicated fog, rain or snow and were given appropriate cloud type designations. Nimbostratus clouds were also given a special designation. Changes made to an original report are indicated in the edited report so that the original report can be reconstructed if desired. While low cloud amount is normally given directly in the synoptic report, the <b>edited</b> <b>cloud</b> report also includes the amounts, either directly reported or inferred, of middle and high clouds, both the non-overlapped amounts and the ``actual`` amounts.

40|$|Terrestrial laser {{scanning}} technology {{is one of}} the most important revolutions in surveying: it is a fast, accurate, and cost-efficient method of gathering three-dimensional data for use in 3 D models and mapping; it can be widely used in many interrelated fields, such as engineering constructions and 3 D measurements, owing to its prominent characteristics of high efficiency and high precision, moreover laser scanner images can also be used in virtual reality applications which can be used to study complex three dimensional data and to explore human interaction with results that are still in digital format. The example presented in this paper, the Cave of Olèrdola, is an ideal environment to test and to develop interactive applications in a complex urban scale model, which will allow exploring possible reconstructions and its comparison to its present day situation. In this case study it’s possible to demonstrate the potentiality of the integration between two systems: a fast accurate 3 D modeling from Terrestrial Laser Scanner and GIS data, and its real-time visualization in a virtual reality environment. The choice of using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner to survey the test site was due to its complexity; irregular slope, difficult accessibility and, as consequence, in measuring its conformation with traditional topographic methods. A one day campaign was necessary to acquire the laser scanner raw data (point clouds) and the photos with which the 3 d model has been created by registering and optimizing the point <b>clouds,</b> creating and <b>editing</b> a polygonal model and texturizing the result with high resolution photos.

40|$|The first {{paper was}} Multidecadal changes in near-global cloud cover and {{estimated}} cloud cover radiative forcing, by J. R. Norris (2005, J. Geophys. Res. - Atmos., 110, D 08206, doi: lO. l 029 / 2004 JD 005600). This study examined variability in zonal mean surface-observed upper-level (combined midlevel and high-level) and low-level cloud cover over land during 1971 - 1 996 and over ocean during 1952 - 1997. These data were averaged from individual synoptic {{reports in the}} Extended <b>Edited</b> <b>Cloud</b> Report Archive (EECRA). Although substantial interdecadal variability {{is present in the}} time series, long-term decreases in upper-level cloud cover occur over land and ocean at low and middle latitudes in both hemispheres. Near-global upper-level cloud cover declined by 1. 5 %-sky-cover over land between 1971 and 1996 and by 1. 3 %-sky-cover over ocean between 1952 and 1997. Consistency between EECRA upper-level cloud cover anomalies and those from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) during 1984 - 1 997 suggests the surface-observed trends are real. The reduction in surface-observed upper-level cloud cover between the 1980 s and 1990 s is also consistent with the decadal increase in all-sky outgoing longwave radiation reported by the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (EMS). Discrepancies occur between time series of EECRA and ISCCP low-level cloud cover due to identified and probable artifacts in satellite and surface cloud data. Radiative effects of surface-observed cloud cover anomalies, called "cloud cover radiative forcing (CCRF) anomalies," are estimated based on a linear relationship to climatological cloud radiative forcing per unit cloud cover. Zonal mean estimated longwave CCRF has decreased over most of the globe. Estimated shortwave CCRF has become slightly stronger over northern midlatitude oceans and slightly weaker over northern midlatitude land areas. A long-term decline in the magnitude of estimated shortwave CCRF occurs over low-latitude land and ocean, but comparison with EMS all-sky reflected shortwave radiation during 1985 - 1997 suggests this decrease may be underestimated...|$|R

As I write this review {{en route to the}} 1998 WHA meeting in Sacramento, I can reflect on the passage of time and feel {{satisfied}} that these five years have not been wasted ones. At that first encounter Bob and I began our friendship, one initially based on a growing respect and admiration for a remarkable nineteenth-century man. We concluded that this Oglala leader had been underappreciated by too many Western historians. Bob 2 ̆ 7 s goal was the writing of a new biography of Red <b>Cloud,</b> mine the <b>editing</b> of the war leader 2 ̆ 7 s recently authenticated autobiography. With the publication of Red Cloud: Warrior-Statesman of the Lakota Sioux, he has succeeded admirably. The subject of our mutual endeavors was born in Nebraska in 1821 and through a series of accomplishments achieved great acclaim and high status among his people. As a skilled warrior and shrewd leader, Red Cloud had few peers. After he entered the national stage in the late 1860 s, his chroniclers focused on his political wranglings and continual resistance to reservation confinement. His was a grand story, a life of glorious victories and ignoble defeats, and to tell it well, even dramatically, would require all the skills of a veteran his to- 53 rian. Fortunately Red Cloud 2 ̆ 2 found 2 ̆ 2 a talented biographer in Larson, whose book manages to do what all good biographies should-to tell us something new about a person, even one whom readers think they already know. Red Cloud, for the first time, gives the complete, balanced life story, one that spanned {{the rise and fall of}} nations. This is Volume 13 in The Oklahoma Western Biographies, a University of Oklahoma Press series whose purposes are clearly stated in editor Richard W. Etulain 2 ̆ 7 s preface. Contributors of individual volumes have come under considerable criticism for the perceived sins of the series, which primarily consist of an apparent lack of notes and other scholarly apparatus. Such criticism is becoming tiresome, whether aimed at Red Cloud or Robert Utley 2 ̆ 7 s biography of George Custer or Glenda Riley 2 ̆ 7 s of Annie Oakley. The series has consistently presented-and Larson 2 ̆ 7 s contribution is no exception-superior narratives of notable persons. Larson has expertly navigated these shoals by including an excellent bibliographic essay and deftly encompassing historical sources within his text.
