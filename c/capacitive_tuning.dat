A communication subsystem for the mission will be composed of an uplink, a downlink, and satellite-tosatellite crosslink. The uplink will operate at UHF. The downlink and crosslink both will operate in the S-band. The design and successful implementation of a low profile, compact element with desirable properties at UHF within the physical constraints of a nanosatellite is a challenge.

40|$|Packaging of MMIC LNA (monolithic {{microwave}} {{integrated circuit}} low-noise amplifier) chips at frequencies over 200 GHz {{has always been}} problematic due to the high loss in the transition between the MMIC chip and the waveguide medium in which the chip will typically be used. In addition, above 200 GHz, wire-bond inductance between the LNA and the waveguide can severely limit the RF matching and bandwidth of the final waveguide amplifier module. This work resulted {{in the development of}} a low-loss quartz waveguide transition that includes a capacitive transmission line between the MMIC and the waveguide probe element. This capacitive transmission line tunes out the wirebond inductance (where the wire-bond is required to bond between the MMIC and the probe element). This inductance can severely limit the RF matching and bandwidth of the final waveguide amplifier module. The amplifier module consists of a quartz E-plane waveguide probe transition, a short <b>capacitive</b> <b>tuning</b> element, a short wire-bond to the MMIC, and the MMIC LNA. The output structure is similar, with a short wire-bond at the output of the MMIC, a quartz E-plane waveguide probe transition, and the output waveguide. The quartz probe element is made of 3 -mil quartz, which is the thinnest commercially available material. The waveguide band used is WR 4, from 170 to 260 GHz.

40|$|Excellent {{progress}} {{in the development of}} Submillimeter-wave SIS and HEBmixers has been demonstrated in recent years. At frequencies below 800 GHz these mixers are typically implemented using waveguide techniques, while above 800 GHz quasi-optical (open structure) methods are often used. The choice of waveguide offers several advantages over quasi-optical techniques, {{such as the use of}} broadband corrugated feed-horns with well defined on axis (Gaussian) beam patterns. However, it has in practice been a problem to efficiently couple energy to the mixer (DUT) over a large fractional RF bandwidth. Many waveguide probe transitions have been proposed over the years, most of which with RF bandwidth less than 35 %. Some of these probe designs require significant reductions in waveguide height (lower impedance). Unfortunately, reducing the height makes machining of mixer components at terahertz frequencies rather difficult. It also increases RF loss as the current density in the waveguide goes up, and surface quality is degraded. We propose a variation on the “single sided ” rectangular microstrip probe that is found in common use at the lower microwave and millimeter wave frequency bands.

To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air he set up a test facility at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899.

40|$|Next {{generation}} wireless devices will {{be required}} to support a wide variety of commercial standards and operate over a wide range of frequency bands. Two examples that are already receiving a lot of attention are software-defined and cognitive radios. Therefore, components that are capable of operating over ultra-wide frequency ranges are required. Quadrature oscillators are a major component in any communication system. They are often needed in RF transceivers to support spectrally efficient modulation techniques. Furthermore, modern telecommunication standards require very low phase noise oscillators and because of their outstanding noise performance, LC-oscillators, are a popular choice. Hence, a lot of effort has been invested in studying and improving the figure of merit (FOM) of wide tuning range LC-Quadrature voltage controlled oscillators (QVCO). So far this effort has been primarily focused on three areas, expanding the tuning range, improving phase noise performance, and reducing the power consumption. Although many techniques have been proposed and used successfully in the literature, a lot of them lack sufficient theoretical analysis. First, the recently proposed, inductive current tuning methodology for expanding the tuning range of QVCO beyond <b>capacitive</b> <b>tuning</b> only is fully analyzed. In addition, a new low phase noise architecture that employs current tuning technique is proposed. The phase noise, tuning range and power consumption of two existing architectures and the proposed one are compared. The three designs are simulated and their FOMs are calculated and compared to identify the highest FOM architecture. Next, a popular architecture that is being utilized in the recent literature for the purpose of improving phase noise and expanding the tuning range, the transformer-based (T-based) oscillator, is analyzed. Linear time variant analysis is used to derive a new 1 /f 2 phase noise expression for the T-based oscillators that is distinct from the commonly used expression for the inductor-based (L-based) oscillators. The new analysis allows for new techniques to optimize the FOM of T-based oscillators through improving the phase noise performance. An oscillator that is implemented in a commercially available 130 nm technology is used to demonstrate these techniques. Finally, the FOM of an optimized QVCO that combines the use of transformer and inductive current tuning is compared to an inductively tuned L-based QVCO. In addition to the higher FOM, T-based QVCO proves to be more stable than L-based QVCO. A full analysis of stability and tuning range of both oscillators is presented and verified through simulations using inductor models extracted using ADS momentum...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{consumer}} {{adoption of}} mobile services {{is leading to}} an exponential growth in wireless data traffic. In order to accommodate more concurrent high data-rate users, the required complexity of transmitting radio base station (RBS) power amplifiers (PAs) is increasing. There is a drive to reduce costs and environmental footprint by developing novel PA architectures. Dynamic load modulation (DLM) is a proven method to improve the PA energy efficiency when transmitting modern communication signals (3 G and beyond). In DLM a tunable network, employing one or several varactors, is used to realize optimal PA load impedances versus output power. In this work wide bandgap silicon carbide (SiC) Schottky diode varactors, specifically {{for use in the}} DLM of PAs, have been designed, fabricated, and evaluated. A tailored doping profile in the epitaxial layers is used to distribute the <b>capacitive</b> <b>tuning</b> over a large bias voltage range. This enables good tunability even at large voltage swings, resulting in good power handling capabilities. Devices have been realized with a small-signal tuning range of 6 : 1, while capable of supporting a 3 : 1 tuning range at 36 V swing. Breakdown voltages are measured in the − 150 to − 200 V range. The high critical electric field in SiC allows for incorporation of high doping concentrations, resulting in low varactor series resistance, enabling microwave frequency operation. To reduce the parasitic series resistance a self-aligned interdigitated layout is used. A highest zero-bias Q-factor of 44 has been extracted at 2 GHz, with a corresponding Q-factor exceeding 800 at the − 50 V punch-through. Advanced microwave characterization, using a multi-harmonic active source and load-pull measurement setup, has been used to study device operation versus bias, available power, and second harmonic load impedance. The results emphasize that varactors are inherently nonlinear devices, and not linear tunable capacitances, leading to conclusions on their optimal use in tunable networks. Nonlinear device models for harmonic balance (HB) simulations in circuit design have been developed and validated both on-wafer and in hybrid circuits. The fabricated varactors have been evaluated in several DLM PAs with good efficiency enhancement results. The measured drain efficiency of an RF pulse-width modulated (RFPWM) class-E PA is improved from 40 % to 75 % at 5 dB power back-off upon inclusion of an integrated SiC varactor-tuned DLM network...|$|E
40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Cognitive {{radio is}} an {{emerging}} radio technology, promising intelligent and {{effective use of}} spectrum resources. State-of-the-art measurement campaigns show that the allocated spectrum is not efficiently used by the licensed users. On the other hand, future radio technologies require more spectrum to meet high capacity and quality of service requirements. Cognitive radio proposes secondary usage of the under-utilised spectrum resources while preserving the access-rights of the licensed (primary) users. Since the introduction of cognitive radio, in 1999, the focus of cognitive radio communications has been on frequency resources. However, frequency resourcealone may {{not be sufficient to}} fulfil the needs of future communication systems. A combination of frequency, space/direction, and time can ensure a more efficient use of the spectrum, by employing techniques like direction-of-arrival estimation, interference mitigation, etcetera. Approaches to design and analyse compact multi-band directional antennas, required to support directional as well as frequency resources, are proposed in this thesis. Design of such antennas was accomplished with orthogonal arrangement of multi-band antennas, and with compact multi-band antenna arrays. Analysis of directional antennas was carried out with simulations, measurement campaigns, and emulation of channel sounder measurements. A concentric arrangement of monopole antenna arrays was used as a reference antenna system, where directional patterns were obtained using metallic/absorber walls between antenna elements. This reference antenna system was used to perform proof-of-principle measurement campaigns. With an antenna array of nine elements, nine degrees-of-freedom (frequency-directional resources) were obtained at the antenna ports. These consist of three selectable frequency bands, namely GSM 900 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, and IEEE 802. 11 b/g, and three directions per frequency band. The reference antenna system was capable of separating frequency and directions with a signal-to-interference-ratio of 20 dB, inside an anechoic chamber. An outdoor measurement of such an antenna system was carried out for GSM 1800 MHz, at a location surrounded by four base-stations. Power detection was used as the spectrum sensing algorithm. The opportunity to communicate in a certain direction using the occupied frequency channels was observed for about 50 % of the sensing time for various GSM channels. This concentric arrangement was made compact by reducing the inter-element spacing. The reduction of inter-element spacing results in mutual coupling between the antenna elements, which disturbs the current distribution and hence the beam patterns of the antenna arrays. To reduce this negative effect, a multiband decoupling and matching network was designed to mitigate the element coupling and to match the elements with mode-specific loads. Reconfigurable networks were designed {{with the help of the}} <b>capacitive</b> <b>tuning</b> of varactor diodes. The multi-band decoupling and matching network, and the reconfigurable network for GSM 900 MHz were manufactured on a printed circuit board, and tested in terms of decoupling, matching, and resulting port beam patterns. The 10 dB bandwidth for matching and decoupling by the fixed network, for compact antenna arrangement with an inter-element spacing of lambda/ 6, was about 30 MHz. Reconfigurable network provided a bandwidth above 100 MHz, achievable with five reconfigurable states. The patterns were orthogonal in different directions with correlation coefficients less than 30 % and self-similar at different frequency bands with a correlation better than 70 %. Finally, the behaviour of directional antennas under heterogeneous propagation scenarios was studied using simulation and emulation. This involved channel models for statistical simulation of static scenarios, and existing channel sounder measurements for emulation of mobility scenarios. Various measured and analytical beam patterns were used to study the availability of directional communications resources for cognitive radio. Simulations with analytical patterns of uniform circular arrays indicated that the received signal strength is directly proportional to the side-lobe level of the directional patterns. A side-lobe level of 20 dB, achievable with an array of 6 elements, was found to be optimum. The opportunity to communicate in certain directions using the occupied frequency channels (directional opportunity) was obtained for 50 % of the total snapshots for a threshold level lower than - 120 dB, in mobility scenarios. The availability of directional resources was dependent on the threshold level chosen for the spectrum sensing algorithm. It is concluded that well-designed directional antennas can identify the existence of directional resources for cognitive radio communications. Exploitation of unexplored antenna strategies for cognitive radio empowers a cognitive node with significant additional degrees-of-freedom. However, angular distribution of multipath, mobility of primary or secondary user, and speed of detection influence the usability of directional resources for cognitive radio. Decoupling and matching networks for compact arrays can be fabricated with off-the-shelf lumped elements with tight tolerances. Such networks can be made reconfigurable using varactor diodes. The work presented in the thesis is expected to facilitate the design of future directional antennas for cognitive radios resulting in more efficient utilisation of the spectrum...|$|E

40|$|Communication and {{reconnaissance}} {{systems are}} requiring increasing flexibility concerning functionality and efficiency for multiband and broadband frequency applications. Circuit-based reconfiguration mechanisms continue to promote radio frequency (RF) application flexibility; however, increasing limitations {{have resulted in}} hindering performance. Therefore, {{the implementation of a}} "wireless" reconfiguration mechanism provides the required agility and amicability for microwave circuits and antennas without local overhead. The wireless reconfiguration mechanism in this thesis integrates dynamic, fluidic-based material systems to achieve electromagnetic agility and reduce the need for "wired" reconfiguration technologies. The dynamic material system component has become known as electromagnetically functionalized colloidal dispersions (EFCDs). In a microfluidic reconfiguration system, they provide electromagnetic agility by altering the colloidal volume fraction of EFCDs - their name highlights the special considerations we give to material systems in applied electromagnetics towards lowering loss and reducing system complexity. Utilizing EFCDs at the RF device-level produced the first circuit-type integration of this reconfiguration system; this is identified as the coaxial stub microfluidic impedance transformer (COSMIX). The COSMIX is a small hollowed segment of transmission line with results showing a full reactive loop (<b>capacitive</b> to inductive <b>tuning)</b> around the Smith chart over a 1. 2 GHz bandwidth. A second microfluidic application demonstrates a novel antenna reconfiguration mechanism for a 3 GHz microstrip patch antenna. Results showed a 300 MHz downward frequency shift by dielectric colloidal dispersions. Magnetic material produced a 40 MHz frequency shift. The final application demonstrates the dynamically altering microfluidic system for a 3 GHz 1 x 2 array of linearly polarized microstrip patch antennas. The parallel microfluidic capillaries were imbedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Both E- and H-plane designs showed a 250 MHz frequency shift by dielectric colloidal dispersions. Results showed a strong correlation between decreasing electrical length of the elements and an increase of the volume fraction, causing frequency to decrease and mutual coupling to increase. Measured, modeled, and analytical results for impedance, voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), and radiation behavior (where applicable) are provided...|$|R
