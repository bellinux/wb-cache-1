40|$|In the {{fabrication}} of microelectronic chips, microlithography {{is used to}} transfer a pattern of <b>circuit</b> <b>geometry</b> from mask to semiconductor wafer. An important step in this process is the deposition of a thin and uniform layer of photoresist (often called resist) on which the lithographic image is exposed.

Spin coating is the prevalent coating method to produce the required thickness and uniformity, but it typically wastes over 90 % of the photoresist applied.

As {{part of an ongoing}} solderability study, Sandia National Laboratories has investigated the solder flow behavior of two azole-based organic solderability preservations, immersion Au, immersion Ag, electroless Pd, and electroless Pd/Ni on fine line copper features. The coated substrates were solder tested in the as-fabricated and environmentally-stressed conditions. Samples were processed through an inerted reflow machine.
