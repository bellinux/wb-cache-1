5|$|The Octopus <b>card</b> <b>system</b> {{is owned}} and {{operated}} by Octopus Cards Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Octopus Holdings Limited. The company was founded as Creative Star Limited in 1994 to oversee {{the development and implementation of}} the Octopus <b>card</b> <b>system,</b> and was renamed as its current name of Octopus Cards Limited in 2002. Creative Star was formed as a joint-venture company by five major transit companies in Hong Kong—MTR Corporation, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, Kowloon Motor Bus, Citybus, and Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry. In January 2001, the shares of Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry in the company was transferred to New World First Bus and New World First Ferry. In the same year, together with MTR Corporation, the company was transformed from its previous non-profit making status to a profit making enterprise.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to present}} the concept of two-sided markets on the example of payment <b>card</b> <b>systems,</b> which have {{attracted}} the attention of regulatory and antitrust authorities in recent years.

The following analysis focuses on arguments that speak in favour of a regulatory or antitrust intervention into payment <b>card</b> <b>systems.</b> Finally, some of the potential problems that antitrust authorities must face when assessing two-sided markets are presented on the basis of an assessment of the decisional practice of the UOKiK President and the European Commission. ...|$|R
5|$|The Octopus card won the Chairman's Award of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance's 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for, {{among other}} things, being the world's leading complex {{automatic}} fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system. According to Octopus Cards Limited, operator of the Octopus <b>card</b> <b>system,</b> {{there are more than}} 20 million cards in circulation, nearly three times the population of Hong Kong. The cards are used by 95% of the population of Hong Kong aged 16 to 65, generating over 12 million daily transactions worth a total over HK$130 million.|$|E
5|$|All trips {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster <b>card</b> <b>system</b> on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E
5|$|The Octopus card uses {{encryption}} for all airborne {{communication and}} performs mutual authentication between {{the card and}} reader based on the ISO 9798-2 three-pass mutual authentication protocol. In other words, data communications are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key. This means that {{the security of the}} Octopus <b>card</b> <b>system</b> would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any Octopus card without authorization. Nevertheless, as of 2003, the Octopus card and system have never been successfully hacked.|$|E

5|$|The Puerto Rico Department of the Family {{currently}} {{provides the}} benefits to each participating family through a debit card, which replaced the physical cheques in the early 2000s. The monthly benefit is deposited through an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system into a government-designated personal bank account, which can be accessed at any time with the debit card to withdraw cash or to make food purchases from authorized retailers. Since September 2001, 75% of each family’s monthly benefit has been designated exclusively for making direct food and grocery purchases, while the remaining 25% can be withdrawn as a cash benefit. The EBT debit <b>card</b> <b>system</b> has improved the program’s payment accuracy rate to 96.4% in 2003, 4 years ahead of its 2007 goal of 95% accuracy.|$|E
5|$|As {{proposed}} in their election manifesto, in February 2003 Livingstone's administration introduced a congestion charge covering 8 square miles in central London, charging motorists £5 {{a day for}} driving through the area. It was introduced {{in an attempt to}} deter traffic and reduce congestion; Livingstone himself took the London Underground to work, and tried to inspire more Londoners to use public transport rather than cars. The policy was highly controversial, and strongly opposed by businesses, resident groups, the roads lobby, and the Labour government; many commentators recognised that if opposition resulted in the policy being abandoned then it could lead to the end of Livingstone's political career. That year, the Political Studies Association named Livingstone 'Politician of the Year' due to his implementation of the 'bold and imaginative' scheme. The scheme resulted in a marked reduction on traffic in central London, resulting in improved bus services, and by 2007, TfL could claim that the charge had reduced congestion by 20%. To further encourage the use of public transport, in June 2003, the Oyster <b>card</b> <b>system</b> was introduced, while bus and Underground journeys were made free for people aged 11 to 18.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit {{announced}} that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the Easy <b>Card</b> <b>system</b> by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail fare gates from a reloadable card. The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009. Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers using Metrorail must use either an Easy Card or Easy Ticket to enter stations. For almost the full first year of use, the Easy Card ticket vending machines allowed anyone to purchase thousands of dollars worth of Easy Cards by credit card without entering a PIN or billing zip code, which led to credit card thieves putting high dollar values on Easy Cards and selling them at a discounted rate for cash. Miami-Dade Transit initially mitigated this issue by limiting credit card transactions to three per day and a value limit of $112, and later by requiring zip code verification for all cards.|$|E

5|$|The metro {{operates}} with a proof-of-payment system, so riders {{must have}} a valid ticket before entering the station platforms. The system is divided into zones, and the fare structure is integrated with other public transport in Copenhagen, including the buses managed by Movia, local DSB trains and the S-train. The system lies within four different zones. Ticket machines are available at all stations, where special tickets for dogs and bicycles can also be purchased. A two-zone ticket costs DKK24, and a three-zone ticket DKK36, and tickets are good for 60 minutes. Holders of the Copenhagen Card museum pass ride free of charge, as do up to two children under twelve years of age accompanied by an adult. As of 2012, the metro has fully adapted to the national electronic fare <b>card</b> <b>system</b> Rejsekort. Outside the Central zones, the outer zones are divided into sub-zones and ticketing {{can be a bit}} confusing for visitors familiar with how zones work in London or Berlin.

40|$|Votomatic-style punch <b>card</b> voting <b>systems</b> produce {{higher rates}} of {{residual}} voting than other technologies, but the effect of punch <b>card</b> voting <b>systems</b> is not uniform. Minority voters {{are less likely to}} have their votes properly recorded with punch <b>card</b> <b>systems</b> than are nonminorities. This racial gap occurs, for the most part, because punch <b>card</b> <b>systems</b> lead to {{higher rates of}} “undervoting ” by minorities. When election administrators switch to other systems, such as optical scan systems, the racial gap is significantly reduced. Punch <b>card</b> voting <b>systems,</b> then, constitute a disproportionate obstacle to minority voting. This effectively gives less weight to votes cast by minorities than to votes cast by nonminorities, and arguably violates constitutional requirements for equal voting rights. The mechanism is similar to the literacy tests that were abandoned after the 1970 amendments to the Voting Rights Act. P unch card voting has been with us for over forty years. It originated at the University of California, Berkeley,where Professor Joseph Harris and his collaborators came up with a method of using simple, inexpensive, easily portable equipment to record votes that could be tabulated mechanically using the computer technology of the day. Because punch <b>card</b> <b>systems</b> were cheap and their results could be tal-lied quickly, the technology was widely adopted.
