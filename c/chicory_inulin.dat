5000|$|Inulin is {{increasingly}} used in processed foods {{because it has}} unusually adaptable characteristics. Its flavor ranges from bland to subtly sweet (about 10% of the sweetness of sugar/sucrose). It {{can be used to}} replace sugar, fat, and flour. This is advantageous because inulin contains 25-35% of the food energy of carbohydrates (starch, sugar). In addition to being a versatile ingredient, inulin has many health benefits. It increases calcium absorption and possibly magnesium absorption, while promoting the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria. <b>Chicory</b> <b>inulin</b> is reported to increase absorption of calcium in young women with lower calcium absorption [...] and in young men. In terms of nutrition, it is considered a form of soluble fiber and is sometimes categorized as a prebiotic. Conversely, it is also considered a FODMAP, a class of carbohydrates which are rapidly fermented in the colon producing gas and drawing water into the colon which is a problem for individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. The consumption of large quantities (in particular, by sensitive or unaccustomed individuals) can lead to gas and bloating, and products that contain inulin will sometimes include a warning to add it gradually to one's diet.|$|E

40|$|Non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli, such as Sphingomonas paucimobilis (S. paucimobilis), {{are among}} the most {{widespread}} causes of nosocomial infections. Up to now, no definitive guidelines exist for antimicrobial therapy for S. paucimobilis infections. As we have shown that some dietary fibers exhibit pronounced immune-regulatory properties, we hypothesized that specific immune active dietary fibers might modulate the responses against S. paucimobilis. We studied the immunomodulatory effects of dietary fibers against S. paucimobilis on cytokine release and maturation of human dendritic cells (DCs) in co-cultures of DCs and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). S. paucimobilis infection resulted in increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by DCs/IECs; these effects were strongly attenuated by specific dietary fibers. <b>Chicory</b> <b>inulin,</b> sugar beet pectin, and both starches had the strongest regulatory effects. IL- 12 and TNF-alpha were drastically diminished upon exposure to <b>chicory</b> <b>inulin</b> and sugar beet pectin, or both starches.

40|$|Scope In {{the present}} study, the direct {{interaction}} of commonly consumed fibers with epithelial or dendritic cells (DCs) was studied. Methods and results The fibers were characterized for their sugar composition and chain length profile. When in direct contact, fibers activate DCs only mildly. This was different when DCs and fibers were co-cultured together with supernatants from human epithelial cells (Caco spent medium). Caco spent medium enhanced {{the production of}} IL- 12, IL- 1 Ra, IL- 6, IL- 8, TNF-a, MCP- 1 (monocyte chemotactic protein), and MIP- 1 a but this was strongly attenuated by the dietary fibers. This attenuating effect on proinflammatory cytokines was dependent on {{the interaction of the}} fibers with Toll-like receptors as it was reduced by Pepinh-myd 88. The interaction of galacto-oligosaccharides, <b>chicory</b> <b>inulin,</b> wheat arabinoxylan, barley ß-glucan with epithelial cells and DCs led to changes in the production of the Th 1 cytokines in autologous T cells, while <b>chicory</b> <b>inulin,</b> and barley ß-glucan reduced the Th 2 cytokine IL- 6. The Treg-promoting cytokine IL- 10 was induced by galacto-oligosaccharides whereas <b>chicory</b> <b>inulin</b> decreased the IL- 10 production.

40|$|Dietary carbohydrates, {{which are}} absorbed as hexose, (glucose, fructose) have a caloric value of 3. 9 kcal/g (16. 3 kJ/g), and their {{cellular}} metabolism produces approximately 38 mol ATP/mol. However, <b>chicory</b> <b>inulin</b> and oligofructose resist digestion {{and they are}} not absorbed in {{the upper part of the}} gastrointestinal tract. After oral ingestion, they reach the colon intact where they become hydrolyzed and extensively fermented by saccharolytic bacteria, which produce short-chain carboxylic and lactic acids as electron sinks. Depending on both the degree of their colonic fermentation and the assumptions of the model used, the caloric value of such nondigested but fermented carbohydrates varies between 0 and 2. 5 kcal/g. Through the catabolism of the absorbed short-chain carboxylic and lactic acids, they may produce up to 17 mol ATP/mol of fermented sugar moiety. Because the daily intake of these dietary carbohydrates is likely to remain relatively small (5 % of total daily calorie intake), it is of low relevance nutritionally to give them a precise caloric value. On the basis of biochemical balance charts for carbon atoms, metabolic pathways and energy yields to the host, the caloric value of a fructosyl residue in <b>chicory</b> <b>inulin</b> and oligofructose has been calculated to be approximately 25 - 35 % that of a fully digested and absorbed fructose molecule. For the purpose of food labeling, it is recommended that <b>chicory</b> <b>inulin</b> and oligofructose, like all the other carbohydrates that are more or less completely fermented in the human colon, should be given a caloric value of 1. 5 kcal/g (6. 3 kJ/g) ...|$|E

We studied the effect of inulin (0, 5 and 10 g/ 100 g diet) on whole-body bone mineral content (WBBMC), whole-body bone area (WBBA) and whole-body bone mineral density (WBBMD) in live, growing male rats fed diets containing 0. 2, 0. 5 or 1 g Ca/ 100 g. Three experiments, each corresponding to one of the different dietary Ca concentrations, were performed using male Wistar rats (n = 108; 4 wk old).

This protocol produced a 60 -fold purification and a specific activity of 14. 5 mu mol. (mg protein) (- 1). min(- 1). The mass of the enzyme was 69 kDa as estimated by gel filtration. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, 52 -kDa and 17 -kDa fragments were found, suggesting that the enzyme was a heterodimer. Optimal activity was found between pH 5. 5 and 6. 5. The enzyme used 1 -kestose, 1, 1 -nystose, oligofructan and commercial <b>chicory</b> root <b>inulin</b> (degree of polymerization {{greater than or equal to}} 10) as donors and accepters. Sucrose was the best acceptor but could not be used as a donor. However, at higher concentrations sucrose acted as a competitive inhibitor for donors of FFT. 1 -Kestose was the most efficient and 1, 1 -nystose the least efficient donor. The purified enzyme exhibited beta-fructosidase activity, specially at higher temperatures and lower substrate concentrations. The synthesis of fructans from 1 -kestose decreased at higher temperatures (5 - 50 degrees C). Therefore enzyme assays were performed at 0 degrees C.

Textural and rheological tests were conducted after an overnight storage at 4 C and during a shelf life of 28 days. A good correlation was observed between the two tests. During storage, all inulin-containing yogurts {{in comparison with the}} control NFY were characterized by lower values of firmness, apparent viscosity, yield stress, complex viscosity, storage modulus and loss modulus. NFYs supplemented with long-chain inulin demonstrated a rheological behavior closer to that of control full-fat yogurt. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The use of inulin and oligofructose in the food industry has grown recently because of their interesting nutritional and technological properties. In the work presented here, three commercial inulin products with different chemical composition and functions were added to yogurt milk, and changes in rheological properties of yogurt were investigated in comparison with nonsupplemented control yogurts.

The effects of prebiotics and probiotics or direct fed microbials (DFM) on gut health and performance in poultry as well as other species are studied. The interactions between intestinal microbiota, the gut epithelium and the immune system are important in the competitive exclusion process. Such feed additives have already been shown to affect relevant functions of the intestinal mucosa such as lowering the secretory response to theophylline or stimulating sodium/glucose cotransport in rat, but knowledge of the plausible interactions between food contaminants and natural components has not yet been studied.

The effects of prebiotics and probiotics or direct fed microbials (DFM) on gut health and performance in poultry as well as other species are studied. The interactions between intestinal microbiota, the gut epithelium and the immune system are important in the competitive exclusion process. Such feed additives have already been shown to affect relevant functions of the intestinal mucosa such as lowering the secretory response to theophylline or stimulating sodium/glucose cotransport in rat, but knowledge of the plausible interactions between food contaminants and natural components has not yet been studied. In this study we examined the effects of prefeeding of a microbial feed additive (Lactobacillus sp.), prebiotic (<b>chicory</b> rich in <b>inulin)</b> and synbiotic feed additive (combination of probiotic strain Enterococcus faecium, prebiotic <b>chicory</b> rich in <b>inulin</b> and immune stimulating substances derived from sea algae) on glucose transport of isolated jejunal mucosa of broiler chicks in {{the presence or absence of}} deoxynivalenol by the Ussing chamber technique. The addition of glucose on the mucosal side in Ussing chamber produced a significant increase in short-circuit current (Isc) (P 0. 05). While, the glucose addition after preincubation of the tissue with DON produced a higher increase in the Isc from the basal values in the prebiotic group (70 %), probiotic group (20 %) and the synbiotic group (26 %) compared with the control group (13 %), suggesting that the dietary prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic supplementation of the broilers increased the glucose transport in the presence of DON which could be promising to reduce the alterations caused by DON on gut physiology. This may offer the host protection against the negative effects of DON on intestinal glucose absorption. Thus, this study supports the concept that probiotics, prebiotic and synbiotic may exert beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract...|$|R
40|$|Boar taint is an {{off-flavour}} of pork caused {{primarily by}} a microbial breakdown product, skatole and a testicular steroid, androstenone. As skatole {{is produced in}} the large intestine from tryptophan, {{it is possible that}} some "bioactive" ingredients could modify protein fermentation and, in the process, diminish boar taint. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of inulin-rich chicory roots (Cichorium intybus L.) on boar taint. In the first of three trials individually penned, entire males and females were given an organic concentrate in which 0 · 25 of the daily energy intake was replaced with crude chicory roots for 9 or 4 weeks prior to slaughter. In the second trial, entire male pigs were given diets that included, either crude chicory roots, dried <b>chicory</b> roots, or <b>inulin</b> (extracted from <b>chicory</b> roots) for 6 weeks pre-slaughter. In the third trial, intact male pigs were given the dried chicory diet for either 2 or 1 week before slaughter. In all trials the chicory diets were offered on a scale at 0 · 95 of the Danish recommendation for energy intake, and pig performance was compared with a control group given the organic concentrate at 0 · 95 of recommended energy intake plus silage ad libitum. In trial 1 an additional control group was offered the organic concentrate at a daily energy intake level of 1 · 0 of Danish recommendations. The pigs in trials 1, 2, and 3 were slaughtered at an average live weight of 118, 124, and 110 kg, respectively, in order to ensure that they had achieved sexual maturity. Overall, skatole concentrations in blood plasma and backfat at slaughter were reduced to almost zero levels by including crude or dried <b>chicory</b> or <b>inulin</b> in the diet. This occurred irrespective of sex and length of feeding period (1 to 9 weeks). In trial 3 a significant effect on blood plasma concentration was observed after 3 days of feeding a diet containing dried chicory. The only significant reduction in plasma androstenone levels was detected in pigs given the crude chicory for a 9 week duration in trial 1. The production and proportion of lean was generally not affected by the addition of either form of chicory to the diets in trials 1 and 2. Therefore, dried chicory may be the most suitable form for commercial use because it: had no initial adverse effects on food intake, consistently reduced skatole without reducing performance, was easy to handle throughout the entire year and is relatively inexpensive. ...|$|R
40|$|Inulin-type fructans are {{polymers}} of fructose {{molecules and}} {{are known for}} their capacity to enhance absorption of calcium and magnesium, to modulate gut microbiota and energy metabolism, and to improve glycemia. We evaluated and compared the effects of <b>Chicory</b> <b>inulin</b> “Synergy 1 ®” and inulin from Mexican agave “Metlin®” in two experimental models of colon cancer and bone calcium metabolism in mice and rats. Inulins inhibited the development of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and colon cancer in mice; these fructans reduced the concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha and prevented the formation of intestinal polyps, villous atrophy, and lymphoid hyperplasia. On the other hand, inulin treatments significantly increased bone densitometry (femur and vertebra) in ovariectomized rats without altering the concentration of many serum biochemical parameters and urinary parameters. Histopathology results were compared between different experimental groups. There were no apparent histological changes in rats treated with inulins and a mixture of inulins-isoflavones. Our results showed that inulin-type fructans have health-promoting properties related to enhanced calcium absorption, potential anticancer properties, and anti-inflammatory effects. The use of inulin as a prebiotic can improve health and prevent development of chronic diseases such as cancer and osteoporosis...|$|E
40|$|Using a Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME), we {{investigated}} the chemopreventive potential of prebiotic <b>chicory</b> <b>inulin</b> towards the in vitro bioactivation of 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo[4, 5 -b]pyridine (PhIP) by human intestinal microbiota. HPLC data revealed that inulin significantly decreased {{the formation of}} the genotoxic PhIP-M 1 metabolite, with the highest inhibitory activity in the colon ascendens (87 % decrease). Interestingly, this chemopreventive effect correlated with alterations of bacterial community composition and metabolism in the different colon compartments. Conventional culture-based techniques and PCR-DGGE analysis on the SHIME colon suspension revealed significant bifidogenic effects during inulin treatment, whereas the overall microbial community kept relatively unchanged. Additionally, the production of short-chain fatty acids increased with 12 %, 3 % and 7 %, while ammonia concentrations decreased with 3 %, 4 % and 3 % in the ascending, transverse and descending colon compartments, respectively. These results indicate that the prebiotic effects from inulin may also purport protective effects towards microbial PhIP bioactivation. As the colonic microbiota may contribute significantly to the carcinogenic potential of PhIP, the search for dietary constituents that decrease the formation of this harmful metabolite, may help in preventing its risk towards human health...|$|E
40|$|The {{artichoke}} (Cyanara scolymus L.) contains inulin, {{a characteristic}} carbohydrate of Compositae, which exhibits several functional and nutritional properties. Inulin fermentation increases gas production and thereby can provokes digestive discomfort in some people. This study examined gas production and gas composition from fermentation of extracted artichoke's inulin compared with inulin of other plant species and of different degree of polymerization. The effects of common household practises, such as preservation {{at ambient temperature}} and cooking in acidic boiling water, on gas generation were also investigated. Each substrate was fermented in vitro using human faecal inoculum. Fermentation characteristics were quantified after 20 h of incubation. Gas and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production data showed that short-chains artichoke inulin and <b>chicory</b> <b>inulin</b> produced more gas and SCFA than substrates with higher degrees of polymerization (long-chains artichoke inulin, extracted artichoke inulin and dahlia inulin). Fermentation of cooked and preserved artichokes resulted in lower gas production than fermentation of fresh artichoke. Preservation of artichokes a few days at ambient temperature and cooking in acidic boiling water could {{be of interest to}} reduce negative side-effects for people suffering from intestinal discomfort...|$|E
40|$|Prebiotic {{dietary fiber}} {{supplements}} are commonly consumed to help meet fiber recommendations and improve gastrointestinal health by stimulating beneficial bacteria {{and the production}} of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), molecules beneficial to host health. The objective of this research project was to compare potential prebiotic effects and fermentability of five commonly consumed fibers using an in vitro fermentation system measuring changes in fecal microbiota, total gas production and formation of common SCFAs. Fecal donations were collected from three healthy volunteers. Materials analyzed included: pure beta-glucan, Oatwell (commercially available oat-bran containing 22 % oat β-glucan), xylooligosaccharides (XOS), WholeFiber (dried <b>chicory</b> root containing <b>inulin,</b> pectin, and hemi/celluloses), and pure inulin. Oatwell had the highest production of propionate at 12 h (4. 76 μmol/mL) compared to inulin, WholeFiber and XOS samples (p < 0. 03). Oatwell’s effect was {{similar to those of the}} pure beta-glucan samples, both samples promoted the highest mean propionate production at 24 h. XOS resulted in a significant increase in the genus Bifidobacterium after 24 h of fermentation (0 h: 0. 67 OTUs (operational taxonomic unit); 24 h: 5. 22 OTUs; p = 0. 038). Inulin and WholeFiber increased the beneficial genus Collinsella, consistent with findings in clinical studies. All analyzed compounds were fermentable and promoted the formation of beneficial SCFAs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different experimental gnawing blocks as cage enrichment in rabbits. One hundred and five pregnant rabbit does housed in conventional wire cages were distributed according to their parity number in 4 homogenous treatment groups. Throughout one complete reproductive cycle (from day 18 of pregnancy till weaning of the litter), does either received no enrichment (controls) or a gnawing block hung from a wire on the cage wall. The 3 different blocks had the same basal components (wheat, molasses and oligoelements), but additionally wood mash (WM), wood mash+chicory pulp (ChP) or wood mash and inulin syrup (I) were respectively incorporated. After weaning, each litter continued to receive the same blocks as before and block consumption was measured as well as the performance of the fatteners. Weight development during the lactation was comparable except in does that received the wood powder blocks. These females had a significantly lower weight (P< 0. 05) at different time points compared to controls. Litter weight or kit weight was not significantly different at any of the time points measured, but again the treatment with wood powder blocks presented the lowest weight. The consumption of blocks during the whole reproduction cycle (42 d) was 11. 0 ± 1. 1; 6. 8 ± 1. 0 and 4. 4 ± 0. 7 g/d per cage for wood mash, <b>chicory</b> pulp or <b>inulin</b> enriched blocks, respectively. A very high variability in consumption of blocks was observed between females. This varied between 1 and 5 (I or ChP group) or even 1 and 9 blocks (WM group) per reproductive cycle. In fatteners, daily block consumption was significantly different (P< 0. 05) and reached on average 7. 0 ± 0. 5; 3. 9 ± 0. 5 and 2. 2 ± 0. 2 g/d per fattener, respectively for WM, ChP and I. Five females with a block and 5 females without a block were observed for 1 h 3 d before the expected parturition and at 2 time points during lactation. Distinction was made between 15 different behaviours. Although the presence of a block did not significantly increase the total number of behavioural transitions, locomotion and intake behaviour were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased when a gnawing block was available. The observation period influenced the frequency of many behavioural transitions and before parturition was significantly higher than post parturition, respectively 56. 1 ± 11. 1 vs. 13. 7 ± 3. 8 (Week 1, P< 0. 01) and 25. 1 ± 5. 5 (Week 2, P< 0. 01). However, a very large variability was observed between does and, moreover, some does were mostly inactive after parturition during the observation period. Based on the consumption pattern and behaviour, these gnawing blocks could be considered as cage enrichment and those with the chicory pulp best fulfilled the objective of a suitable gnawing material...|$|R

Foram utilizados 1056 pintos de um dia de idade, alojados sobre cama reutilizada, em um delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado, com oito tratamentos e seis repetiÃÃes e 22 aves por unidade experimental, os quais foram arranjados em um esquema fatorial 2 x 4, onde o primeiro fator foi a utilizaÃÃo de duas dietas (vegetal e animal) e o segundo fator representado por quatro nÃveis de inclusÃo de inulina (0, 00; 0, 25; 0, 50; 0, 75 %). O probiÃtico utilizado era composto por Lactobacillus acidophillus; Streptococcus faecium e Bifidobacterium bifidum. As caracterÃsticas avaliadas foram ganho de peso, peso final, consumo mÃdio de raÃÃo, conversÃo alimentar, viabilidade de 1 a 40 dias de idade. Aos 21 e 35 dias de idade foram mensurados os parÃmetros sanguÃneos (cÃlcio, fÃsforo, Ãcido Ãrico e proteÃnas totais). Aos 40 dias foi realizado o abate das aves para avaliar o rendimento de carcaÃa, peito, coxa, sobrecoxa, asa e percentual de gordura abdominal. Dentro da anÃlise da viabilidade econÃmica foram calculados os custos das dietas experimentais, o Ãndice de eficiÃncia econÃmica e o Ãndice de custo. Na fase inicial e de crescimento nÃo foi encontrado resultado significativo para as variÃveis de desempenho. No perÃodo total de criaÃÃo de 1 a 40 dias de idade, para a variÃvel conversÃo alimentar houve efeito significativo (P< 0, 05) para os nÃveis de inclusÃo. O rendimento de carcaÃa foi influenciado (P< 0, 05) pelo tipo de raÃÃo independente dos nÃveis de inclusÃo de inulina. Para os cortes, somente a coxa apresentou diferenÃa significativa (P< 0, 05) para o tipo de raÃÃo. Na gordura abdominal foi observado interaÃÃo (P< 0, 05) entre o tipo de raÃÃo (vegetal e animal) e os nÃveis de inclusÃo de inulina. Para os parÃmetros sanguÃneos aos 21 dias foi observada diferenÃa significativa (P< 0, 05) entre os nÃveis de inclusÃo inulina para as variÃveis fÃsforo e proteÃnas totais, e aos 35 novamente foi observada diferenÃa significativa (P< 0, 05) para o fÃsforo. As demais variÃveis nÃo foram afetadas com a utilizaÃÃo da inulina. A utilizaÃÃo de 2, 5 g/kg de inulina proporciona melhor conversÃo alimentar para aves de 1 a 40 dias de idade. A inclusÃo de inulina reduz a deposiÃÃo de gordura abdominal independentemente do tipo de raÃÃo. A utilizaÃÃo de raÃÃo com ingredientes de origem animal proporciona melhor rendimento de carcaÃa e maior rendimento de coxa.

The probiotic used was composed of Lactobacillus acidophillus, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus faecium. The characteristics evaluated were weight gain, final weight, average feed intake, feed conversion, viability 1 - 40 days of age. At 21 and 35 days of age were measured blood parameters (calcium, phosphorus, uric acid and total protein). At 40 days was carried out the slaughter of birds to assess the yield of carcass, breast, drumstick, thigh, wing and abdominal fat percentage. Within the analysis of economic viability was calculated the cost of the experimental diets, the index of economic efficiency and cost index. In the initial phase and growth was not found significant results for the performance variables. In the total periods of 1 - 40 days of age for the variable feed no significant effect (P < 0. 05) for levels of inclusion. Carcass yield was influenced (P < 0. 05) by food type regardless of the levels of inclusion of inulin. For the cuts, only the thigh showed a significant difference (P < 0. 05) for the type of diet. Was observed in abdominal fat interaction (P < 0. 05) between type of diet (plant and animal) and the levels of inclusion of inulin. For the blood parameters for 21 days was significantly different (P < 0. 05) between levels of inulin inclusion for the variables P and total protein, and 35 was again a significant difference (P < 0. 05) for phosphorus. The other variables were not affected with the use of inulin. The use of 2. 5 g / kg inulin provides better feed for broilers at 1 - 40 days old. Inclusion of inulin reduces abdominal fat independent mind the type of diet. The use of feed containing animal ingredients provides improved higher carcass yield and higher thigh yield. The use of inulin affected the phosphorus stock you live at 21 and 35 days old.
