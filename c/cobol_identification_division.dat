50|$|In 1935, the Bureau {{was renamed}} the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1939, the FBI became {{pre-eminent}} {{in the field}} of domestic intelligence, {{thanks in large part to}} changes made by Hoover, such as expanding and combining fingerprint files in the <b>Identification</b> <b>Division,</b> to compile the largest collection of fingerprints to date, and Hoover's help to expand the FBI's recruitment and create the FBI Laboratory, a division established in 1932 to examine and analyze evidence found by the FBI.|$|R
30|$|Cyanoacrylate fuming is a {{chemical}} method {{for the detection}} of latent fingermarks on non-porous surfaces such as plastic, glass, rubber bands, finished and unfinished wood etc. The method relies on the deposition of polymerized cyanoacrylate ester on latent fingermark residue (Ramotowski 2012). In 1978, Criminal <b>Identification</b> <b>Division</b> of the Japanese National Police Agency devised this method (Carrick 1983). L.W.

50|$|By {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of January 15, an autopsy on the female victim was completed by the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office. The victim's fingerprints were scheduled to be airmailed to the FBI fingerprint <b>identification</b> <b>division</b> in Washington, D.C. Examiner Assistant Managing Editor Warden Woolard suggested to Los Angeles police Capt. Jack Donahoe, who was chief of the department’s homicide division, that the victim’s fingerprints be transmitted to the FBI by using the Examiner's new soundphoto machine. During {{the early morning hours}} of January 16, the International News Photo wire service received the prints via photo transmission from the Examiner.

40|$|A refugee worker {{conflict}} at the JBS Swift {{plant in}} Grand Island, Nebraska {{serves as a}} representative anecdote of the dominant media discourses about refugees in the United States. This study adopts a critical cultural perspective and applies Burke’s (1969) concepts of <b>identification</b> and <b>division</b> {{to the ways in}} which refugees are described in comparison to other immigrants in the media coverage of the conflict. These <b>identifications</b> and <b>divisions</b> generate ideologically powerful official roles for refugees in American society. This study finds that refugees, especially refugees who are also Muslim, are defined in the media coverage of the Grand Island conflict as the ‘least preferred immigrant’ because of their perceived distance from the ideal American immigration myth...|$|R
40|$|Criminology is {{a science}} dealing with the {{protection}} of citizens and state from infringement. Criminology uses mostly biological or genetic methods for crime detection.

Two working models of the environment were developed, the internal and external model, and from these scenarios the projection of possible future work load volume and mixture was developed. Possible drivers of work load change were identified and assessed for upper and lower bounds of effects.

40|$|Background: Peroperative <b>identification</b> and {{subsequent}} <b>division</b> or {{preservation of the}} inguinal nerves during open hernia repair may influence the incidence of chronic postoperative pain. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to identify studies investigating the influence {{of different types of}} nerve management. Results: Based on three randomized studies the pooled mean percentage of patients with chronic pain after <b>identification</b> and <b>division</b> of the ilioinguinal nerve was similar to that after identification and preservation of the ilioinguinal nerve. Two cohort studies suggested that the incidence of chronic pain was significantly lower after identification of all inguinal nerves compared with no identification of any nerve. Another cohort study reported {{a significant difference in the}} incidence of chronic pain in favour of identification and facultative pragmatic division of the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve compared with no identification at all. Conclusion: The nerves should probably be identified during open hernia repair. Division of and preservation of the ilioinguinal nerve show similar results...|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that {{perceived}} external prestige (PEP) and communication climate influence employees' overall organizational identification. This paper presents the results of a longitudinal study into the determinants of organizational identification at two organizational levels during an internal merger. Data were collected in a university where four divisions merged into two new divisions. Respondents filled out a questionnaire on organizational identification, PEP and communication climate 4 months before the merger (T 1) and 2 years after the merger (T 2). Results indicate that pre-merger identification primarily influences post-merger identification at the same organizational level. Furthermore, the determinants of employees' overall organizational identification differ from the determinants of employees' <b>division</b> <b>identification.</b> Internal communication climate is particularly important for employees' <b>identification</b> with their <b>division.</b> PEP affects employees' identification with the overall organization. Management implications are discussed for monitoring employee identification both in times of (internal) mergers and in genera...|$|R
