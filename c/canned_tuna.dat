5|$|It can {{be served}} either as a {{composed}} salad or as a tossed salad. Freshly cooked or <b>canned</b> <b>tuna</b> may be used. For decades, there has been significant disagreement between traditionalists and innovators regarding which ingredients should {{and should not be}} included in a salade niçoise. According to traditionalists, it excludes cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked green beans and potatoes are commonly served in variations of salade niçoise that are popular around the world.|$|E
5|$|Even though Agatha passed {{close to}} Mexico as it weakened, no impact {{is known to}} have been caused. Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the Polynesian Diakan. A Greek {{freighter}} en route from Pago Pago to Terminal Island, California, the Polynesian Diakan began flooding on June 3, forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel. The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due to cargo shifting and not the weather. The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Three members required hospitalization. After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt, the vessel capsized and sank near San Clemente Island on June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71 containers of <b>canned</b> <b>tuna</b> with it. The reason for the sinking was unknown.|$|E

25|$|Thimerosal is a mercury-containing {{antimicrobial}} that {{is added}} to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose to prevent contamination and growth of potentially harmful bacteria.

500|$|Former Nice {{mayor and}} {{cookbook}} author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist.

[...] Médecin wrote that the salad should be made [...] "predominately of tomatoes" [...] which should be [...] "salted three times and moistened with olive oil". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or <b>canned</b> <b>tuna,</b> [...] but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise [...] "was {{a product of the}} sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi." [...] Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, [...] commenting, [...] "As the various ingredients that go into salade niçoise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl." ...|$|E
