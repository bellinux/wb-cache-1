5|$|Almost every {{sizeable}} body {{of water}} in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip {{have been seen as}} counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping <b>children</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner has {{suggested}} that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping <b>children</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E

25|$|In 1980 Swedish naturalist {{and author}} Bengt Sjögren wrote that present beliefs in lake monsters {{such as the}} Loch Ness Monster are {{associated}} with kelpie legends. According to Sjögren, accounts of loch monsters have changed over time; originally describing horse-like creatures, they were intended to keep <b>children</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the loch. Sjögren wrote that the kelpie legends have developed into descriptions reflecting a modern awareness of plesiosaurs.|$|E

25|$|The two craft {{were brought}} down to Langstone Harbour for {{competitive}} trials. On its trials on a misty morning, {{the noise from}} the two 120hp Chryslers in the Birmabright alloy hull scared some mothers who hurried their <b>children</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Isle of Wight beaches as the craft came inshore. The conclusions of the trial left no one in doubt. A platoon of Royal Marines disembarked from the Fleming craft in {{a quarter of the}} time taken by the platoon in the Thornycroft, the silhouette of the Fleming craft was less, it created less disturbance when steaming, and it beached better. But, and this was later the deciding factor, the Birmabright craft was so noisy that it meant sacrificing tactical surprise, while it was impossible to mount armour on its sides. The failings of the Thornycroft craft on the other hand could all be overcome. A second prototype from Thornycroft had a double-diagonal mahogany hull with twin engines and those features — low silhouette, quiet engines, little bow wave — which appealed to the Centre's staff in their search for a craft that could make surprise landings. The craft beached satisfactorily, a quality retained in all LCA designs, but the troops took too long to disembark across this prototype's narrow ramp. Armour could easily take the place of the outer mahogany planking, the exit could be lowered, the silhouette could be cut down and the engines could be so silenced {{that they would not be}} heard at twenty-five yards. So although the Fleming boat won at the trial, it was the Thornycroft design, duly altered, that became the assault landing craft. A third prototype — ALC No 2 — was therefore built after the DNC had worked with Thornycroft on modifications to the design.|$|E
500|$|The {{fourth season}} was test-marketed for American audiences in April on PBS and Univision {{stations}} in Miami, Dallas–Fort Worth, and Los Angeles. [...] The test-run was successful, so PBS and Univision began airing it nationally in December; it reached 92% of the country's Spanish-speaking households. [...] At first, Plaza Sésamos producers {{were concerned that}} the show would be attacked, but The Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "even some staunch opponents of bilingual education concede that Plaza Sésamo has its merits". [...] The L.A. Times also stated that its broadcast in the U.S. was an acknowledgment that Spanish was a prominent language in the U.S. and that more children were bilingual. [...] The show's supporters believed that exposure to an educational program like Plaza Sésamo {{would result in the}} transfer of Spanish skills to English and increase literacy in both languages. [...] Bilingual education opponents disagreed, but were not against the show's entertainment value. [...] According to Knell, the CTW found that watching the Spanish version did not draw <b>children</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the English version.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{and other}} {{political}} radicals during {{the last quarter of}} the 18th century focused their reform efforts on education because they believed that if people were educated correctly, Britain would experience a moral and political revolution. Religious Dissenters, especially, embraced this view; Wollstonecraft's philosophy in Thoughts and elsewhere closely resembles that of the Dissenters she met while teaching in Newington Green, such as the theologian, educator, and scientist Joseph Priestley and the minister Richard Price. Dissenters [...] "were most concerned with molding children into people of good moral character and habits". However, political conservatives, who also believed that childhood was the crucial time for the formation of a person's character, used their own educational works to deflect rebellion by promoting theories of compliance. Liberals and conservatives alike subscribed to Lockean and Hartleian associationist psychology: that is, they believed that a person's sense of self was built up through a set of associations made between things in the external world and ideas in the mind. Both Locke and Hartley had argued that the associations formed in childhood were nearly irreversible and must thus be formed with care. Locke famously advised parents to keep their <b>children</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> servants, as they would only tell children frightening stories that would foster a fear of the dark.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning December 20, 1940, various {{humanitarian}} aid organizations intervened to lend their services: {{in addition to}} the Basque government in exile, posts were set up in Gurs belonging to the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit, Jewish French organizations tolerated by the Vichy regime, and Protestant organizations such as the Quakers, CIMADE, and the YMCA. Despite the fact that the camp was situated in a region where the great majority of the population was Catholic, not one Catholic organization offered its help to the inmates. On February 15, 1941, the [...] Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (Children’s Aid Society) installed a medical post and obtained permission to take numerous <b>children</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Gurs, who would be housed in private homes throughout France.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are cases}} where, {{if the child}} is returned, the {{abductor}} will not or cannot return with the child out of safety concerns.

Another concern regarding signing the treaty is the possibility that implementing it would, in practice, [...] "tear the child away from a parent", as a primary caregiver would be unable to accompany the children to countries which have criminalized parental abduction.
