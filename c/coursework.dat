The school also exhibits a unique culture because the majority of its student and faculty bodies are members of the LDS Church.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech also {{operates}} a campus in Metz, in northeastern France, known as Georgia Tech Lorraine. It was opened in October 1990, it offers master's-level courses in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering and Ph.D. <b>coursework</b> in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.

5|$|Priestley {{eventually}} {{decided to}} return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at Daventry, a Dissenting academy. Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip {{the first two years of}} <b>coursework.</b> He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a Rational Dissenter. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of the natural world and the Bible.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, Captain Lyman Hall was {{appointed}} Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor (and consequently {{head of the}} school's mathematics department). He had a solid background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his <b>coursework.</b> He had an energetic personality and quickly assumed a leadership position among the faculty. At the first faculty meeting on October 5, 1888, he was elected secretary. On June 25, 1895, Professor Hall was invited to speak to Georgia Tech's board about the school's needs. While there were no recorded minutes, subsequent board actions suggest that he recommended the construction of on-campus dormitories to reduce disciplinary problems, and a more proactive recruitment of students.|$|E

5|$|Once {{undergraduate}} education is completed the individual should proceed to graduate level courses. Typically, forensic anthropologists obtain doctorates in physical anthropology and have completed <b>coursework</b> in osteology, forensics, and archaeology. It is also recommended that individuals looking {{to pursue a}} forensic anthropology profession get experience in dissection usually through a gross anatomy class as well as useful internships with investigative agencies or practicing anthropologists. Once educational requirements are complete one can become certified by the forensic anthropology society in the region. This can include the IALM exam given by the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe or the certification exam given by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology.|$|E
5|$|The {{program began}} in 1984 as the Advanced Operational Studies Fellowship (AOSF) by {{diverting}} lieutenant colonel War College selectees to Fort Leavenworth for an equivalent education program. The AOSF program had students completing the AMSP <b>coursework,</b> and then {{serving as the}} principal instructors of AMSP during their second year. In 1995, {{the name of the}} program was changed to the Advanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship (AOASF), and in the early 21st century its curriculum was more closely aligned to the strategic level of war. In 2013, the program was again modified in part to bring it more in alignment with TRADOC policies, and to prepare it for Joint Professional Education II accreditation. It was at that time renamed the Advanced Strategic Leadership Studies Program (ASLSP).|$|E

In February 1899, Georgia Tech opened the first textile engineering school in the Southern United States, with $10,000 from the Georgia General Assembly, $20,000 of donated machinery, and $13,500 from supporters. It named the A. French Textile School after its chief donor and supporter, Aaron S. French. The textile engineering program would move to the Harrison Hightower Textile Engineering Building in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The Public Relations Society of America and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication {{commissioned}} {{studies in}} 1975 and 1987 {{on the state}} of public relations in education. They found that too many classes were taught by educators with little or no experience in the field and that most didn't have a post-graduate degree. Several standards in education were established by the studies, including that 75 percent of <b>coursework</b> for PR professionals be outside the major. In 1991, PRSA hosted a Task Force on the Structure and Role on Public Relations, which found that public relations teachers still lacked practical experience. In 1993 PRSA published a Professional Career Guide, which classified skills and knowledge that were needed at five different levels of someone's career. PRSA also advocates that MBA programs include communications programs, so business executives will be more prepared for a crisis.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a Linguistic Institute was first {{proposed}} {{in the spring of}} 1927 by Reinhold Saleski. The fledgling Society was hesitant at first, but Edgar Sturtevant was keen on the idea. Sturtevant molded Saleski's idea into a model still used today: a gathering of scholars in conjunction with <b>coursework.</b> The Executive Committee voted to authorize the first Linguistic Institute, to be held 1928, along with authorization for a second institute in 1929. After the fourth Institute in 1931, the program took a four-year hiatus due to the great depression. Institutes were held every year concurrently with summer meetings of the LSA until 1988 when, due to increasing costs, the Society announced that the Linguistic Institutes would be held every other year. It was at that same time that the summer meeting of the LSA was also discontinued.|$|E
5|$|He and {{his brother}} Jonathan were sent to Le Mans Military Academy in Rolling Prairie, Indiana, after Jackson was {{diagnosed}} as hyperactive.

5|$|Uttar Pradesh {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of education, although historically it was primarily confined to the elite class and religious schools. Sanskrit-based learning formed the major part of education from the Vedic to the Gupta periods. As cultures travelled through the region they brought their bodies of knowledge with them, adding Pali, Persian and Arabic scholarship to the community. These formed the core of Hindu-Buddhist-Muslim education until the rise of British colonialism. The present schools-to-university system of education owes its inception and development in the state (as {{in the rest of the}} country) to foreign Christian missionaries and the British colonial administration. Schools in the state are either managed by the government or by private trusts. Hindi is used as a medium of instruction in most of the schools except those affiliated to the CBSE or the Council for ICSE boards. Under the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for 2 years in a junior college, also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the Uttar Pradesh Board of High School and Intermediate Education or a central board. Students choose from one of three streams, namely liberal arts, commerce, or science.
