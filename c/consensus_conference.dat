He went 22-for-35 for 235yards and three touchdowns in a win over Rice University on September 2, and was named the Conference USA Player of the Week for his efforts. He was named as a finalist for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award on November 1. He was named the Conference USA Offensive Player of the Year on November 30. Kolb won the conference's offensive MVP, but Houston lost to South Carolina 44-36 in the Liberty Bowl. He finished the season with 3,808passingyards, 30touchdowns and four interceptions. Kolb ended his career with 12,964 total passing yards, fifth all-time.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} where on the BMI scale the {{threshold}} for overweight and obese should be set. Because of this the standards have varied {{over the past few}} decades. Between 1980 and 2000 the U.S. Dietary Guidelines have defined overweight at a variety of levels ranging from a BMI of 24.9 to 27.1.

50|$|<b>Consensus</b> <b>conferences</b> {{originated}} in Denmark in the 1980s and {{are one of}} the earliest attempts by policymakers to include the lay publics’ opinions in their decision-making through public engagement.

40|$|In this chapter, we shed {{new light}} on the epistemic {{struggle}} between establishing consensus and acknowledging plurality, by explicating different ways of consensus-making in science and society and examining the impact hereof on their field of intersection, i. e. <b>consensus</b> <b>conferences</b> (in particular those organized by the National Institute of Health). We draw a distinction between, what we call, academic and interface consensus, to capture the wide appeal to consensus in existing literature. We investigate such accounts - i. e. from Miriam Solomon, John Beatty and Alfred Moore, and Boaz Miller - as to put forth a new understanding of consensus-making, focusing on the meta-consensus. We further defend how (NIH) <b>consensus</b> <b>conferences</b> enable epistemic work, through demands of epistemic adequacy and contestability, contrary to the claim that <b>consensus</b> <b>conferences</b> miss a window for epistemic opportunity (Solomon M, The social epistemology of NIH <b>consensus</b> <b>conferences.</b> In: Kincaid H, McKitrick J (ed) Establishing medical reality: methodological and metaphysical issues in philosophy of medicine. Springer, Dordrecht, 2007). Paying attention to the dynamics surrounding consensus, moreover, allows us to illustrate how the public understanding of science and the public use of the ideal of consensus could be well modified...|$|R

The American Psychiatric Association released its second task force report in 1990 where specific details on the delivery, education, and training of ECT were documented. Finally, in 2001 the American Psychiatric Association released its latest task force report. This report emphasizes the importance of informed consent, and the expanded role that the procedure has in modern medicine.
