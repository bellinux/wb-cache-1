40|$|When small {{children}} travel in minibuses, during for example daycare transports, they seldom have adequate protection {{in terms of}} crash safety. To be sufficiently protected the child should travel in a rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> (CRS).

The overall aim is to find factors that enables the increase in usage of rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems,</b> including the increase of usage time to as long as possible.   Swedish accident data, obtained by the Swedish Traffic Data Acquisation, was studied. It was found that the fatally injured children during car accidents in Sweden between the years 2000 - 2016 commonly were involved in extraordinarily accident scenarios with an outcome independent of how they were restrained. The literature study and the survey that was made were both supporting the statement of inconvenience while using rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems.</b> The inconvenience often corresponded to different types of misuse. The main issue with rearward facing according to the responding parents was lack of leg space, both for their child but also for the driver and the front seat passenger. These issues made some parents turning their children forward facing at early age, whereas they could still fit in the rearward facing child restraint system.   One key in order to increase the global use of rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> lies in changes of the materials and design. A more lightweight and compact design is suggested, providing a more spacious travel environment for the children and easier mounting for the parents.

40|$|The {{head and}} thorax {{of the child}} {{occupant}} are mainly injured regions in passenger car side impacts. In {{order to reduce the}} injury risks of head and thorax, a multi-objective optimization design of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> (CRS) and side airbag is conducted in terms of CRS safety performances. A mathematical model of a child occupant in side collision is developed by using MADYMO software and the validity of the model is evaluated by comparing results between simulation and sled test. For the purpose of minimizing accelerations of child head and thorax, a sensitivity analysis of the design variables is conducted using the orthogonal design of experiment (DOE) and analysis of variance. The primary design variables are therefore determined, including material permeability of side airbag, location of top tether in X-direction and stiffness coefficient of lower anchorage. The objective functions for accelerations of child head and thorax are generated with second-order multinomial regression equations in terms of the determined design variables. Optimization is carried out byusing non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The optimized configuration of the CRS is obtained by further analysis based on the Pareto-optimal solutions. The results indicate that main design parameters of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> are material permeability 0. 037 of side airbag, location − 0. 25 m of top tether in X-direction, stiffness coefficient 0. 5 of lower anchorage.

40|$|According to the German {{road traffic}} {{regulations}} children up {{to the age of}} 12 or a body height below 150 cm have to use approved and appropriate <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> (CRS). CRS must be approved according to UN-ECE Regulation No. 44. The regulation classifies CRS in 5 body weight categories. The upper weight group is approved for children from 22 to 36 kg. However, studies show that already today many children weigh more than 36 kg although they have not reached a size of 150 cm. Therefore, no ECE R 44 approved CRS is available for these "overweight " children. In conclusion, today’s sizes and weights of children are no longer represented by the current version of the ECE R 44. The heaviest used dummy (P 10) weighs just 32. 6 kg and has a body height of 137. 9 cm. Statistical data of German children show that already 5 % of the children at a size of 137. 9 cm have a body weight above 45. 3 kg.
