40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} {{two aspects of}} {{continuous}} powder mixing, namely characterizing the effects of material properties on the bulk powder flow behavior, and developing continuous blending strategies suitable for <b>cohesive</b> <b>materials.</b> The relative effects of process parameters and material properties on the bulk powder flow behavior were analyzed by performing a PLS analysis of the output parameters, including mean residence time, and axial dispersion coefficient {{as a function of}} input parameters (impeller speed, flow rate, bulk density and cohesion). The mean residence time was primarily affected by the bulk density and impeller speed, whereas the axial dispersion coefficient was affected by impeller speed and cohesion. Based on previously developed knowledge of mixing performance as a function of process parameters [1], a design rule to select the optimal number of impeller passes based on the bulk density was proposed. Impeller speed and cohesion showed a significant interacting effect on the output variable, the axial dispersion coefficient. Increase in cohesion leads to increase in the axial dispersion coefficient at higher impeller speeds, whereas a negligible effect of cohesion on the axial dispersion coefficient was observed at lower impeller speeds. In {{the second part of the}} paper, a continuous blending methodology for blending <b>cohesive</b> <b>materials</b> was demonstrated. Considering the feeding limitations of <b>cohesive</b> <b>materials,</b> and limitations in the application of shear in the bladed continuous mixer, a combination of high shear and low shear mixing with high-shear mixing as a first step exhibited an optimal mixing strategy...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{response}} of {{a thin layer}} of granular material to an external pure shear imposed at its base is investigated. The experiments show that, even for non-cohesive materials, the resulting deformation of the material is inhomogeneous.

These observations are in contrast with the observation of the fracture pattern previously observed in <b>cohesive</b> granular <b>materials</b> subjected to stretching. For <b>cohesive</b> <b>materials,</b> the instability is due to the weakening of the material which results from the rupture of capillary bridges that bond the grains to one another.

50|$|Hydraulic toe erosion {{occurs when}} flow {{is in the}} {{direction}} of a bank at the bend of the river and the highest velocity is at the outer edge and in the center depth of the water. Centrifugal forces raise the water elevation so that it is highest on the outside bend, and as gravity pulls the water downward, a rolling, helical spiral happens, with downward velocities against the bank (erosive force). It will be highest in tight bends. The worst erosion will be immediately downstream from the point of maximum curvature. In cases with noncohesive layers, currents remove the material and create a cantilever overhang of <b>cohesive</b> <b>material.</b> Shear exceeds the critical shear at the toe of the bank, and particles are eroded. This then causes an overhang eventually resulting in bank retreat and failure.|$|E
50|$|MIKE 3 is a {{generalised}} {{mathematical modelling}} system {{designed for a}} wide range of applications in areas such as oceanography,coastal regions and estuaries and lakes. The system is fully three-dimensional solving the momentum equation and continuity equationsin the three Cartesian directions.MIKE 3 simulates unsteady flow taking into account density variations, bathymetry and external forcing such as meteorology, tidal elevations, currents and other hydrographic conditions. MIKE 3 can be applied to oceanographic studies,coastal circulation studies, water pollution studies,environmental impact assessment studies,heat and salt recirculation studies and sedimentation studies. MIKE 3 is composed of three fundamental modules: The hydrodynamic (HD) module, the turbulence module and the advection-dispersion (AD) module. Various features such as free surface description, laminar flow description and density variations are optionally invoked within the three fundamental modules. A number of application modules have been implemented and can be invoked optionally. These are advection-dispersion of conservative or linearly decaying substances, a water quality (WQ)module describing BOD-DO relations, nutrients and hygienic problems, a eutrophication (EU) module simulating algae growth and primary production, and a mud transport (MT) module simulating transport along with erosion and deposition of <b>cohesive</b> <b>material.</b> A Lagrangian-based particle (PA) module can also be invoked for simulating e.g. tracers, sediment transport or the spreading and decay of E-Coli bacteria. The modelling system is based on the conservation of mass and momentum in three dimensions of a Newtonian fluid. The flow is decomposed into mean quantities and turbulent fluctuations. The closure problem is solved through the Boussinesq eddy viscosity concept relating the Reynold stresses to the mean velocity field. To handle density variations, the equations for conservation of salinity and temperature are included. An equation of state constitutes the relation between the density and the variations in salinity and temperature and ñ if the MT calculations are invoked ñ mud concentration. In the hydrodynamic module, the prognostic variables are the velocity components in the three directions and the fluid pressure. The model equations are discretised in an implicit, finite difference scheme on a staggered grid and solved non-iteratively by use of the alternating directions' implicit technique. A phase and amplification analysis neglecting effects of viscosity, convective terms, rotation, density variations, etc. has been performed. Under these circumstances, the finite difference scheme is unconditionally stable.|$|E

The bond characteristics contribute to the effectiveness of the stress transfer achieved between the FRP composite and the concrete substrate. Debonding of the FRP composite reinforcement is the most critical concern in this type of application. Under monotonic and fatigue loading conditions, FRP-concrete shear debonding has been idealized as a Mode-II fracture problem along the bi-material interface. A <b>cohesive</b> <b>material</b> law is used to describe the interfacial stress transfer at the macroscopic level.
