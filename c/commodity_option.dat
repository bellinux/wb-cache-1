40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} shows that log-return relatives on commodity futures prices are not normally distributed. This departure from normality seems {{to be caused by}} large price changes occurring in the commodity markets with the arrival of important new information. This suggests that a jump-diffusion model may be a plausible choice for modeling the stochastic process underlying <b>commodity</b> <b>option</b> prices. Merton (1976 a) develops a jump-diffusion option pricing model assuming that jump risk is unsystematic. However, the jump-diffusion model developed by Bates (1991) is more appropriate for <b>commodity</b> <b>option</b> pricing since it allows jump risk to be systematic. In this article, recent transactions data on futures and futures options are used to test out-of-sample options using American versions of Black's diffusion and Bates's jump-diffusion models. The results show that Bates's model performs considerably better than Black's model. Jump-diffusion Asian option prices are also shown to differ considerably from geometric Brownian motion Asian option prices. Copyright 1999, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|Commodity {{options are}} {{the right to buy}} or sell a {{specified}} quantity of a commodity, or commodity futures contract, at a specified price. The publicity surrounding several "boiler room" scams involving unwary buyers has given commodity options a bad name. Currently, only a handful of firms sell legitimate commodity options. Commodity options can, however, offer social benefits not provided by other investment vehicles. For example, they have several advantages over futures contracts. Their prices reflect information more quickly and fully than the prices of futures contracts. They allow investors to eliminate the risk of margin calls by paying an option "premium" up front. They allow producers and investors to hedge quantity, as well as price, risk for seasonal crops; using futures contracts, a farmer can form a perfect riskless hedge only if he knows exactly how much of a commodity he will have after a future harvest. Furthermore, the distribution of returns on options, which ensures that only the premium is lost regardless of how much futures prices fall, may attract to <b>commodity</b> <b>option</b> markets investors who need to hedge their assets against volatile fluctuations in price. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have recently moved to allow exchange trading of commodity options. Organized exchange trading may be expected to increase trading in, hence expand the social benefits of, commodity options. Exchange trading might also improve price "efficiency" in option markets. Tests using a variant of the Black-Scholes formula for option pricing indicate that, under the current system of private firm market-making, <b>commodity</b> <b>option</b> prices do not always accurately reflect all available information...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} valuing a European-style <b>commodity</b> <b>option</b> and a futures option is {{discussed}} {{with a view}} to incorporating the impact of changing hidden economic conditions on commodity price dynamics. The proposed model may be thought of as an extension to the Gibson-Schwartz two-factor model, where the model parameters vary when the hidden state of an economy switches. A semi-analytical approach to valuing commodity options and futures options is adopted, where the closed-form expressions for the characteristic functions of the logarithmic commodity price and futures price are derived. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) approach is then applied to provide a practical and efficient way to evaluate the option prices. Real data studies and numerical examples are used to illustrate the practical implementation of the model. 10 page(s...|$|E

However, unlike the case of forward/futures contracts, the presence of fairly priced <b>commodity</b> <b>options</b> cannot induce the firm to produce up to the certainty equivalent level.

40|$|We {{document}} a new stylized fact {{regarding the}} dynamics of the commodity convenience yield: the volatility of the convenience yield is heteroskedastic for industrial commodities; specifically, the volatility (variance) of the convenience yield depends on the convenience yield level. To explore the economic and statistical significance of the improved specification of the convenience yield process, we propose an affine model with three state variables (log spot price, interest rate, and the convenience yield). Our model captures three important features of commodity futures [...] the heteroskedasticity of the convenience yield, the positive relationship between spot-price volatility and the convenience yield and the dependence of futures risk premium on the convenience yield. Moreover our model predicts an upward sloping implied volatility smile, commonly observed in <b>commodity</b> <b>option</b> market.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a novel approach}} to modelling of commodity prices {{and apply it to}} <b>commodity</b> <b>option</b> pricing and volatility estimation. This approach is particularly suited for prices with multiple attraction regions, such as crude oil and other energy and agricultural commodities. The price is modelled as a diffusion process governed by a potential function with minima at the attraction points. When applied to crude oil prices, the method captures characteristic behaviour of the prices remarkably well. Pricing of European options on spot and futures commodity contracts is developed within the potential model, and compared to the Black-Scholes framework. The approach provides a new way of estimating the volatility, which is particularly useful when option prices (and hence implied volatilities) are not readily available; this is often the case for commodity markets. European options on physical commodities and commodity futures are priced using the volatility forecasts obtained from the model. The performance of the model is evaluated {{on the basis of the}} hedging costs of an option. For options on crude oil, the method outperforms - in terms of hedging costs - the Black-Scholes approach with historical volatility...|$|E

40|$|How to {{regulate}} wholesale access on next generation access (NGA) networks {{is probably the}} most pressing issue faced by European telecoms regulars today. The lack of actual competitive restraint from cable operators precludes the replication of US-like regulatory forbearance, as it might lead to the (re-) monopolization of broadband markets by telecoms incumbents, thus spoiling the celebrated achievements over the last decade, whereby competing operators have penetrated the market thanks to widespread access regulation over the DSL platform. However, as NGA networks are largely yet to be deployed, the threat of similar measures being extended is keeping incumbents from undertaking investments into NGA. This is particularly so given the perceived uncertainty about consumers' willingness to pay for next-generation Internet access services, which raises deep reservations about the viability of the business case for NGA. Such a stalemate is exacerbated by the difficulty of envisaging practical solutions to reach a "new regulatory contract", where conflicting interests are effectively balanced out {{for the benefit of the}} society overall. This article represents an attempt to address this vacuum. A "division of labour" between regulators and the market is proposed, in order to reflect distinctive capabilities in an incentive-compatible way. In particular, while regulators would be responsible for setting wholesale access terms, the market would be left to price the risk in NGA deployment through the functioning of a <b>commodity</b> <b>option</b> market.

The technology of the information age, allowing instant communication and electronic trading, has revolutionized financial markets, instituting around-the-clock, around-the-globe trading, globally active market users and market intermediaries, and an increasing pace of market innovation. Market crises now have the potential for widespread financial impact and require international regulatory response. The 1997 - 1998 Asian financial crisis that caused equity and currency markets to tremble demonstrated more vividly than ever before that world markets are inextricably linked through related products and common market participants. Events that occur in one market can and frequently do cause global regulatory concerns. The shocks to the world financial system caused by several recent crises illustrate that this is true for derivatives markets as well as securities and currency markets. The CFTC has taken a leading role in encouraging international cooperation to address the issues of systemic risk posed by linked markets and global market participation and in facilitating worldwide adoption of higher regulatory standards. This article focuses on these international activities of the CFTC in the past decade and particularly on its reactions to three international derivatives crises occurring in the mid-to-late 1990 s - the Barings Plc. failure in 1995, Sumitomo Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s manipulation of the copper markets in 1995 and 1996, and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management L.

The article describes the CFTC 2 ̆ 7 s response to those crises and particularly the CFTC 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to work with foreign regulators to fashion international protections against the harmful widespread repercussions that such crises may have.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Crosby {{introduced}} a multi-factor jump-diffusion model {{which would allow}} futures (or forward) commodity prices to be modelled {{in a way which}} captured empirically observed features of the <b>commodity</b> and <b>commodity</b> <b>options</b> markets. However, the model focused on modelling a single individual underlying commodity. In this paper, we investigate an extension of this model which would allow the prices of multiple commodities to be modelled simultaneously in a simple but realistic fashion. We then price a class of simple exotic options whose payoff depends on the difference (or ratio) between the prices of two different commodities (for example, spread options), or between the prices of two different (i. e. with different tenors) futures contracts on the same underlying commodity, or between the prices of a single futures contract as observed at two different calendar times (for example, forward start or cliquet options). We show that it is possible, using a Fourier transform-based algorithm, to derive a single unifying form for the prices of all these aforementioned exotic options and some of their generalizations. Although we focus on pricing options within the model of Crosby, most of our results would be applicable to other models where the relevant 'extended' characteristic function is available in analytical form. <b>Commodity</b> <b>options,</b> <b>Option</b> pricing, <b>Commodity</b> prices, Continuous time finance, Jump-diffusion, Commodity derivatives, Pricing of derivatives,...|$|R
