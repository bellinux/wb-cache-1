The basic idea is similar to a <b>clamp</b> <b>coupling</b> but the moment of rotation is closer {{to the center of the}} shaft. An alternative coupling device to the traditional parallel key, the tapered lock removes the possibility of play due to worn keyways. It is more robust than using a key because maintenance only requires one tool and the self-centering balanced rotation means it lasts longer than a keyed joint would, but the downside is that it costs more.|$|E

However, {{it is not clear whether}} insulin resistance is an independent feature of NAFLD, and it remains to be determined which of the in vivo actions of insulin are impaired in this condition. Methods: We performed a twostep (1. 5 and 6 pmol min(- 1) kg(- 1)) euglycaemic insulin <b>clamp</b> <b>coupled</b> with tracer infusion ([6, 6 -H- 2 (2) ] glucose and [H- 2 (5) ] glycerol) and indirect calorimetry in 12 non-obese, normolipidaemic, normotensive, non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and six control subjects. Results: In NAFLD patients, endogenous glucose production (basal and during the clamp) was normal; however, peripheral glucose disposal was markedly decreased (by 30 % and 45 % at the low and high insulin doses, respectively, p< 0. 0001) at higher plasma insulin levels (p = 0. 05), due to impaired glucose oxidation (p = 0. 003) and glycogen synthesis (p< 0. 001). Compared with control subjects, glycerol appearance and lipid oxidation were significantly increased in NAFLD patients in the basal state, and were suppressed by insulin to a lesser extent (p< 0. 05 - 0. 001). The lag phase of the in vitro copper-catalysed peroxidation of LDL particles was significantly shorter in the patients than in the control subjects (48 +/- 12 vs 63 +/- 13 min, p< 0. 04).

Studies in insulin resistant rodents show an improvement in skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and oxidative stress following antioxidant supplementation. We therefore investigated the potential ameliorative effects of antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA) supplementation on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and oxidative stress in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Participants with stable glucose control commenced a randomized cross-over study involving four months of AA (2 × 500 mg/day) or placebo supplementation. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic <b>clamp</b> <b>coupled</b> with infusion of 6, 6 -D 2 glucose. Muscle biopsies were measured for AA concentration and oxidative stress markers that included basal measures (22 ̆ 7, 72 ̆ 7 -dichlorofluorescin [DCFH] oxidation, ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione [GSH/GSSG] and F 2 -Isoprostanes) and insulin-stimulated measures (DCFH oxidation). Antioxidant concentrations, citrate synthase activity and protein abundances of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT 2), total Akt and phosphorylated Akt (ser 473) were also measured in muscle samples. RESULTS: AA supplementation significantly increased insulin-mediated glucose disposal (delta rate of glucose disappearance; ∆Rd) (p= 0. 009), peripheral insulin-sensitivity index (p= 0. 046), skeletal muscle AA concentration (p= 0. 017) and muscle SVCT 2 protein expression (p= 0. 008); but significantly decreased skeletal muscle DCFH oxidation during hyperinsulinaemia (p= 0. 007) when compared with placebo. Total superoxide dismutase activity was also lower following AA supplementation when compared with placebo (p= 0. 006). Basal oxidative stress markers, citrate synthase activity, endogenous glucose production, HbA 1 C and muscle Akt expression were not significantly altered by AA supplementation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In summary, oral AA supplementation ameliorates skeletal muscle oxidative stress during hyperinsulinaemia and improves insulin-mediated glucose disposal in people with type 2 diabetes.

Fate is also the reason the three girls consider each other [...] "sisters"; another idea that elaborates people being tied together (family cannot be chosen). Clamp also explores the idea of chaste or pure love (as in the manga Chobits).

40|$|AbstractMechanisms {{regulating}} {{the expression of}} intercellular coupling, development of membrane excitability, and cellular responsiveness to neurotransmitters during neuronal ontogeny are largely unknown. To define the temporal relationship among these properties during neurogenesis, murine embryonic hippocampal progenitor cells immortalized with a temperature-sensitive allele of the SV 40 large T-antigen were examined during successive stages of neuronal differentiation in vitro using patch <b>clamp,</b> dye <b>coupling,</b> and Ca 2 + imaging techniques. Electrotonic and dye coupling between untreated neuroblasts were frequent in cells maintained at the temperature (39 °C) nonpermissive for T-antigen expression. However, as neuroblasts differentiated into neurons {{under the influence of}} interleukin- 7 added alone or concurrently with transforming growth factor-α after basic fibroblast growth factor, both junctional conductance and the extent of dye coupling progressively decreased. Voltage-dependent inward currents were present within 2 to 6 days after differentiating treatments began. During intermediate developmental stages (3 to 5 days in culture), cells became responsive to GABA (≥ μM) but not to glutamate, glycine, or to acetylcholine (≤ 1 mM), as indicated by [Ca 2 +]i measurements and patch clamp recordings. In contrast, voltage- and ligand-gated responses but not electrotonic coupling were frequently observed in mature neuronal primary cultures. Together, these results indicate that certain cytokines may orchestrate the progressive expression of functional neuronal phenotypes in vitro, in which the gradual disappearance of intercellular coupling parallels the onset of voltage-dependent responses and both of which precede the expression of neurotransmitter chemosensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{the plasma}} {{membrane}} potential is most commonly associated with the generation of action potentials in excitable cells, however, experimental evidence suggests that this membrane potential is also linked to various behaviours in all cells (Blackiston et al., 2009). These cell behaviours include cell proliferation, cell migration and even cell survival. The membrane potential has been thought to influence these cell behaviours upstream of the classical transduction pathways. Recent {{evidence suggests that the}} membrane potential is dynamic rather than static and this dynamic behaviour may encode information on cell behaviours. The whole cell patch <b>clamping</b> technique <b>coupled</b> with the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) technique was used to investigate the presence of fluctuations and oscillations in the membrane potential of Jurkat cells and HMEC- 1 cells. The underlying nature of the membrane potential dynamics of Jurkat cells was investigated by perturbing the extracellular concentration of either K+, Na+ or Cl-. The membrane potential dynamics of proliferating, non-proliferating and activated Jurkat cells was investigated by either varying the culture medium or treating the cells with the concavalin A mitogen. The membrane potential dynamics of HMEC- 1 endothelial cells was also investigated. The magnitude of the static membrane potential of proliferating Jurkat cells was significantly more depolarised that non-proliferating Jurkat cells – a trend which has been observed {{in a wide range of}} cell types. The membrane potential dynamics appear to be driven by the conductance of ions rather than the magnitude of the static membrane potential per se. In summary, this thesis has proven that the membrane potential varies with cell state and the CWT technique can be used to interrogate recordings of the membrane potential to ascertain information on the membrane potential dynamics that cannot be currently determined by other techniques...|$|R

Lectin receptors were labeled with fluorescent derivatives of succinyl- concanavalin A (Con A) or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and their mobility was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Of the receptors for WGA, approximately 53 % were free to diffuse in {{the plane of the}} membrane, with an average diffusion coefficient as found in other preparations (D = 6. 4 X 10 (- 11) cm 2 /s).

Our results with K currents are best fit if 25 % of the K channels diffuse with D = 5 X 10 (- 11) cm 2 /s, with the remainder being immobile. For both Na and K channels, photodestruction by UV was most effective at a wavelength of approximately 289 nm. At this wavelength, the energy density required for an e-fold reduction in the number of functional channels was 0. 40 J/cm 2 for Na channels and 0. 94 J/cm 2 for K channels. Irradiation at this wavelength and dose did not measurably diminish the mobility of WGA receptors; hence, the immobility of Na and most K channels is not due to UV irradiation.

Here, we developed a simulation model to study the role of stretch-activated channel (SAC) currents in triggering EADs in ventricular myocytes under oxidative stress. We adapted our <b>coupling</b> <b>clamp</b> circuit so that a model ionic current representing the actual SAC current was injected into ventricular myocytes and added as a real-time current. This current was calculated as ISAC = GSAC * (Vm − ESAC), where GSAC is the stretch-activated conductance, Vm is the membrane potential, and ESAC is the reversal potential. In rat ventricular myocytes, application of GSAC did not produce sustained automaticity or EADs, although turn-on of GSAC did produce some transient automaticity at high levels of GSAC. Exposure of myocytes to 100 μM H 2 O 2 induced significant APD prolongation and increase in intracellular Ca 2 + load and transient, but no EAD or sustained automaticity was generated in the absence of GSAC. However, the combination of GSAC and H 2 O 2 consistently produced EADs at lower levels of GSAC (2. 6 ± 0. 4 nS, n = 14, P < 0. 05). Pacing myocytes at a faster rate further prolonged APD and promoted the development of EADs.

40|$|Chromosomal {{replication}} is {{an essential}} process in all life. This dissertation highlights regulatory roles for two critical protein complexes {{at the heart of}} the replication fork: 1) the sliding clamp, the major polymerase processivity factor, and 2) the sliding clamp loader, a spiral-shaped AAA+ ATPase, which loads the clamp onto DNA. The clamp is a promiscuous binding protein that interacts with at least 100 binding partners to orchestrate many processes on DNA, but spatiotemporal regulation of these binding interactions is unknown. Remarkably, a recent disease-causing mutant of the sliding clamp showed specific defects in DNA repair pathways. We aimed to use this mutant as a tool to understand the binding specificity of clamp interactions, and investigate the disease further. We solved three structures of the mutant, and biochemically showed perturbation of partnerbinding for some, but not all, ligands. Using a fission yeast model, we showed that mutant cells are sensitive to select DNA damaging agents. These data revealed significant flexibility within the binding site, which likely regulates partner binding. Before the clamp can act on DNA, the sliding clamp loader places the clamp onto DNA at primer/template (p/t) junctions. The <b>clamp</b> loader reaction <b>couples</b> p/t binding and subsequent ATP hydrolysis to clamp closure. Here we show that composition (RNA vs. DNA) of the primer strand affects clamp loader binding, and that the order of ATP hydrolysis around the spiral is likely sequential.

40|$|Insulin {{sensitivity}} and {{the activity of}} the hypothalamic-growth hormone (GH) - insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis both decline with age. Treatment with IGF-I increases insulin sensitivity in healthy young subjects. We hypothesized that increasing plasma IGF-I in postmenopausal women to levels characteristic of young women would enhance insulin sensitivity. To test the hypothesis, fasting glucose kinetics and insulin sensitivity were measured in 24 healthy, normoglycemic, postmenopausal women before and after 5 weeks of treatment with either recombinant human (rh) IGF-I (15 microg/kg body weight/d twice daily) or placebo in a double-blind study. Diet energy content and composition were rigidly controlled to maintain energy balance. A hyperglycemic <b>clamp</b> (8 mmol/L) <b>coupled</b> with stable isotope infusion ([6, 6 (2) H]glucose) was performed before and after treatment to assess whole-body insulin sensitivity; defined as the glucose rate of disappearance (Rd) or rate of infusion (GRIF) scaled to the steady-state insulin concentration (I). There were no differences in fasting glucose or insulin concentrations, glucose kinetics, or glucose oxidation after either treatment. During the clamps, steady-state insulin concentrations with placebo (pre = 151 +/- 28 pmol/L, post = 173 +/- 31 pmol/L) were slightly different than with IGF-I (pre = 182 +/- 37 pmol/L, post = 163 +/- 33 pmol/L), but the variations were not significant. No significant changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity were observed after treatment with IGF-I, calculated as Rd/I (pre = 17. 7 +/- 2. 6 microg/kg/min/pmol/L, post = 19. 3 +/- 2. 0 microg/kg/min/pmol/L for IGF-I v pre = 24. 2 +/- 2. 5 microg/kg/min/pmol/L, post = 22. 8 +/- 3. 4 microg/kg/min/pmol/L for placebo) or as GRIF/I (pre = 18. 0 +/- 3. 9 microg/kg/min/pmol/L, post = 22. 3 +/- 3. 5 microg/kg/min/pmol/L for IGF-I v pre = 26. 4 +/- 6. 2 microg/kg/min/pmol/L, post = 26. 9 +/- 4. 8 microg/kg/min/pmol/L for placebo). Baseline insulin sensitivity in women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT, n = 15) was similar to nonusers (n = 9), but HRT users derived a greater portion of energy expenditure from carbohydrate oxidation compared with nonusers. HRT use had no impact on the response to IGF-I. Overall, we observed subtle, but physiologically insignificant, variations after IGF-I treatment in the direction of enhanced insulin sensitivity. The data suggest that 5 weeks of low-dose rhIGF-I treatment has no material influence on whole-body insulin sensitivity in normoglycemic postmenopausal women...|$|R
40|$| {{designed}} models. We {{and others}} embarked {{into the study}} of implants following vaginal implantation. Having experience with rabbits, and given earlier studies on this being a model for vaginal surgery, we also did set up experiments in rabbits. Unfortunately, the vaginal extrusion rate was as high as 50 %, which is far from what is observed clinically. Exposure is a common observation in rabbit vaginal implant studies. Though the exact cause of {{it may not be}} determined with certainty, we speculated that both mesh size and its suturing were not appropriate. Additionally, the relative thin vaginal epithelium and its limited vascularization following dissection may predispose to wound healing problems. Further, contraction was that frequent, that actual biomechanical measurements were not possible, if not, unreliable. In view of the relevance we think biomechanical studies have, we feel that, at least in our hands, small animal vaginal models are less appropriate. In essence, appropriate biomechanical testing requires sufficiently large specimens, for which we now are using a sheep model. Lastly one might comment on the animal models and techniques used in this work. Our initial work started off with determining the ultimate strength of implanted materials in a rat model. Alponat designed this model for experiments relating to repair of abdominal wall defects, but we successfully applied in previous experiments. As we initially did the experiments, this yielded explants of limited dimensions. For more extensive biomechanical testing, one would require larger samples and therefore larger implants. The rabbit model, which was also used as an abdominal hernia model, is very much in line with the rat model. We speculated that not only its size, but probably also we thought the larger bowel system would induce more important forces, which together would make the rabbit more appropriate. Next to that rabbits can be used for longer term studies. The possible disadvantages of an altered collagen metabolism and a higher susceptibility to infections as well as the costly housing and breeding of the animals are potential limitations. With larger explants for uniaxial testing, we also expanded the outcome parameters of our biomechanical evaluations so that the experiments are more comprehensive. Several limitations of our setup however have to be pointed out. These include <b>clamping</b> influences, axial <b>coupling</b> and inadequate strain measurement. These factors might lead to important scatter in results, as in the experiments comparing Ultrapro with SPMM after implantation. On the other hand, our set-up did allow to distinguish between the directional differences within one material (Ultrapro). We feel comfortable with these methods, which essentially those commonly used in urogynecological or hernia experiments. Exploring other techniques, such as multi-axial measurement, however may yield unanticipated outcomes. Therefore, further methodologic study is required, and actually ongoing with us as with others. Future research directions The mathematical model describes how membrane tensions are higher, and increase more in patients with prolapse. Though it cannot be determined whether this is cause or consequence, we would complement these observations by calculating membrane tensions following repair. Actually this should be done in patients undergoing successful repair, as well as in a longitudinal study with patients who fail ultimately. Such studies could demonstrate that the latter patients have increased membrane tension, as compared to those who remain without prolapse. Nevertheless such mathematical model remains an approximation of the true physiological conditions. One could therefore embark on a series of finite element models to unravel this problem. Although the authors truly believe in such an approach, different problems occur when using these models, which are not easily overcome. One would have to model each component, each fiber and each muscle separately, i. e. one needs to know its exact location and dimensions anatomically, its origin and its attachments and most importantly, its response to physiological conditions. This then comes down on a series of translational experiments, involving medical imaging, finite element modeling and in vitro experiments. When one would finally succeed in such a piece of art, its findings would still have to be validated. Our group has meanwhile decided to further investigate the potential of non invasive in vivo biomechanical measurements. This will allow for longitudinal follow up of experimental animals, as well as clinical subjects, and correlate those findings with functional outcomes. We also conclude that there was stillroom for making lighter, more compliant, or in other words less strong products. None of the tested implant materials ever yielded biomechanical properties of native tissues, where at the same time none of them was actually the weakest element in the chain. Reducing weight of materials apparently introduces new problems, such as inappropriate handling properties, folding or shrinking. Therefore manufacturers may focus rather on structural changes of the fabrics, rather than only reducing the amount of material, or move away from textiles towards other manufacturing methods. nrpages: 176 status: publishe...|$|R
