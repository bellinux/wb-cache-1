Consequently, recommendations are made with regard to a secured hygrothermal implementation of the thermal insulation of the reveals...|$|R
50|$|In Roman art of {{the late}} Republic and early Empire, stucco was used {{extensively}} for the decoration of vaults.

50|$|Illusionistic ceiling painting, which {{includes}} the techniques of perspective di sotto in sù and quadratura, is the tradition in Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo art in which trompe l'oeil, perspective tools such as foreshortening, and other spatial effects are used {{to create the illusion}} of three-dimensional space on an otherwise two-dimensional or mostly flat <b>ceiling</b> <b>surface</b> above the viewer. It is frequently used to visually suggest an open sky, such as with the oculus in Andrea Mantegna's Camera degli Sposi, or a fictive architectural space such as in the illusionistic cupola, one of Andrea Pozzo's frescoes in Sant'Ignazio, Rome.|$|E
50|$|In some offices, {{particularly}} warehouses {{that have}} been converted to office space, there is no ceiling plenum. Masking speakers are hung {{in a similar manner}} to those above suspended ceilings but the speaker spacing and height is different. Typically, the speakers are mounted higher and the spacing between them is closer. The height of the structural ceiling above is a large factor in spacing, as is {{the presence or absence of}} sound absorbing materials on the <b>ceiling</b> <b>surface.</b> Reasonably good uniformity of sound masking can be achieved. Some office designs employ the use of scattered (as opposed to continuous) ceiling tiles (clouds). Careful design is needed to achieve reasonable sound masking uniformity.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} space offers another play in contrast. Jaffe inverts the traditional relationship between cold stone and warm wood, pairing floors of soft, sensual Jerusalem limestone with clear Alaskan cedar paneling. The irregular stones, chipped at the edges, recalled a horizontal Wailing Wall. On the dados where the wood-clad walls meet stone, the exposed vertical edges are unfinished, a Jewish tradition for cornerstones. We, like stones, are works in progress. Every wall and <b>ceiling</b> <b>surface</b> {{is covered in}} paneling. Together with the pews and bima, crafted from the same material, this architectural condition contributes a unifying effect that prevents the elaborately detailed carvings from becoming overly dominant. Jaffe layered wood in a hierarchical fashion: beyond the smooth wood cladding of the interior, congregants see the aged shingles of the exterior and beyond these, mature trees.|$|E

The coolness of the roost also plays a factor in Macrotus selection of roosts, which is why Macrotus would choose to roost in a cool cave in the hot summers.

40|$|New {{examinations}} of a predictive {{model for the}} IS 0 9705 room-comer test have been made {{for a series of}} materials.

Predictions for melting materials indicate that a significant reduction in the total available energy can provide reasonable fire growth predictions. Examples of materials that remain in place during combustion are also presented and appear to be predicted well by the model.

40|$|The rate {{at which}} {{particles}} deposit and re-suspend from indoor surfaces is an essential parameter in determining human exposure to aerosol particles. In this study, we investigate experimentally particle deposition and forced re-suspension in a cubical enclosure for three particle sizes (0. 7, 1. 5 and 4 m). For particle deposition, the results are presented in terms of particle deposition velocity. It was observed that the particle deposition velocity is particularly significant for the floor surface. Deposition on vertical and <b>ceiling</b> <b>surfaces</b> becomes important only when these surfaces are electrically charged. Air humidity did not influence the particle deposition apart from when {{it was close to}} saturation. Re-suspension of particles from the floor surface due to household activities was also studied.

Besides, there is a pressure above which re-suspension is very likely to occur (minimum re-suspension pressure). This minimum pressure is dependent on the particle size...|$|R
30|$|The {{collection}} of high temperature gases within a compartment {{is also a}} source of heat flux that can cause damage. A ceiling jet is formed by {{the intersection of the}} plume with the ceiling, which will cause greater heat to be transferred first to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>surface</b> and later to the intersecting wall surfaces. The temperature of the plume will be greatest near the plume centerline and therefore the greatest heat flux to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>surface</b> will be at this location at this point throughout the duration of the fire. The temperature and resultant heat flux decreases with increasing radial distance from the plume centerline. In addition, the ceiling jet velocity is highest near the centerline of the plume and decreases as it moves outward (Heskestad 2008). Consequently, these two factors combine to inflict more damage and create more pronounced fire effects near the plume centerline, with the damage decreasing as the distance from the centerline is increased (Jowsey 2007). When the flame plume has not intersected the ceiling, heat fluxes along the <b>ceiling</b> <b>surface</b> near the centerline of a plume have been recorded to range between 80 and 100  kW/m 2 within 0 – 1  m radial distance, while heat fluxes between 1.0 and 1.6  m radial distances ranges between 10 and 70  kW/m 2 (Dillon 1998; Lattimer and Sorathia 2003).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This chapter {{summarizes}} the spatial disorientation problems and navigation difficulties described by astronauts and cosmonauts, and relates them to research findings on orientation and navigation in humans and animals. Spacecraft crew are uniquely free to float in any relative orientation {{with respect to}} the cabin, and experience no vestibular and haptic cues that directly indicate the direction of “down”. They frequently traverse areas with inconsistently aligned visual vertical cues. As a result, most experience “Visual Reorientation Illusions ” (VRIs) where the spacecraft floors, walls and <b>ceiling</b> <b>surfaces</b> exchange subjective identities. The illusion apparently results from a sudden reorientation of the observer’s allocentric reference frame. Normally this frame realigns to local interior surfaces, but in some cases it can jump to the Earth beyond, as with “Inversion Illusions ” and EVA height vertigo. These perceptual illusions make it difficult for crew to maintain a veridical perception of orientation and place within the spacecraft, make them more reliant upon landmark and route strategies for 3 D navigation, and ca...|$|R
