In February 1917, Murray commanded a company during the battalion's attack on the German position of Stormy Trench. During the engagement, the company was able to capture the position and repulse three fierce counter-attacks, with Murray often leading bayonet and bombing charges himself. For his actions during the battle, Murray was awarded the Victoria Cross. Soon after his Victoria <b>Cross</b> <b>action,</b> he was promoted to major and earned a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order during an attack on the Hindenburg Line near Bullecourt.

500|$|Prior to his Victoria <b>Cross</b> <b>action,</b> McGee {{had been}} {{noted in the}} 40th Battalion for his {{leadership}} qualities, and had attained a [...] "famous fighting record". In addition to his decoration, McGee had been recommended for a commission {{as a result of}} his actions at Broodseinde, with an officer in his battalion declaring [...] "had he lived his commission would have been assured". His original company commander, Major Leslie Payne, noted McGee's [...] "sterling qualities as a leader" [...] and stated: [...] "His ability in the carrying out of certain important tasks early in the year was most marked and...there is in my opinion, and the opinion of many others, no more gallant and capable non-commissioned officer in the battalion." ...|$|E
500|$|McNamara was {{appointed}} AOC British Forces Aden in late 1942, and arrived {{to take up}} the posting on 9 January 1943. Described in the official history of Australia in the war as a [...] "backwater", British Forces Aden's main functions were conducting anti-submarine patrols and escorting convoys. McNamara flew on these missions whenever he could, generally as an observer, but enemy contact was rare. He {{was appointed}} a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1945 New Year Honours, and returned to London in March. That month McNamara was deeply affected by the loss of his close friend Peter Drummond, who had helped keep attacking cavalry at bay during his Victoria <b>Cross</b> <b>action</b> in 1917. Drummond's Consolidated B-24 Liberator disappeared near the Azores en route to Canada and all aboard were presumed killed; McNamara had to break the news to his widow, Isabel. McNamara's health had also suffered from exposure to the desert dust in Aden, and he was unable to take up his next position as the RAAF's representative at the Ministry of Defence until September. His entire war was spent outside Australia.|$|E

In April 1937, attorney's {{allegedly}} {{acting on behalf of}} Jennie May Burleson [...] "filed a <b>cross</b> <b>action</b> for divorce," [...] which resulted in a divorce. However, Jennie Burleson alleged that she had not authorized the <b>cross</b> <b>action</b> suit. On September 27, 1937, Jennie May Burleson filed a [...] "voluminous" [...] report to have the April 1937 divorce judgment retracted [...] "because the defense of insanity was not set up in some manner as against either spouse obtaining a divorce; and charged her attorneys with fraud, collusion, and misrepresentation in filing her <b>cross</b> <b>action</b> for divorce, knowing her nervous and mental state, and in not securing an order of the court to place her under [...] "observation and a judgment as to her sanity before submitting to a trial." [...] Her submission was dismissed by Justice Blair. The divorce made headlines in the media as a society scandal.|$|E
