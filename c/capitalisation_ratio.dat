40|$|This {{research}} empirically {{examines the}} relationship between stock market development and {{economic growth in the}} context of Nigeria. The question guiding this study is focused on whether the development of the stock market has had an impact on economic growth in Nigeria. The thesis examines the long run causal relationship between the stock market and economic growth. It uses one bank and three measures of stock market development: the loans to deposit ratio of banks, Market <b>capitalisation</b> <b>ratio,</b> value traded to market <b>capitalisation</b> <b>ratio</b> as well as value traded to GDP ratio. Essentially the study uses the endogenous growth theory as a basis of its theoretical foundation. The study exploits time series analysis techniques to test for the existence of a relationship and, where one is found to exist, the casual nature of that relationship. The study particularly applies Multivariate vector autoregressive models (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) in testing for the existence of a relationship. The evidence obtained from the study shows the existence of co-integration between the stock market development and economic growth in the short as well as the long run. This suggests that stock market development has impacted on economic growth in Nigeria. The Granger causality test findings indicate the presence of a bi-directional relationship between stock market development and economic growth. The findings of the study support the view that stock market development and economic growth in Nigeria are complementary and any improvements in the stock market would {{have a positive impact on}} economic growth in Nigeria. The findings also support the hypothesis of endogenous growth models that financial development causes higher economic growth. The contribution of this study lies in the fact that it provides additional evidence on the ongoing debate of the impact stock markets on the economic growth process within a specific country...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE of {{this paper}} is to examine the impact of {{globalisation}} on stock market development in India using commonly recognised indicators to test this impact. India implemented significant reforms to foster development in capital markets. These reforms were brought in with the objective of improving market efficiency, transparency, and preventing unfair trade practices. Indicators used in our study are good proxies for the test of market development and deepening. Results of this study show that the stock markets in India have experienced exponential growth over the study period. Our analysis finds that all selected indicators show significant improvement in stock markets of India. After liberalisation market <b>capitalisation</b> <b>ratio,</b> value traded ratio and turn-over ratio increases and volatility ratio has declined. Our results demonstrate overall development in stock markets and operational efficiency in stock markets of India. No Full Tex...|$|E

The combination of high education standards and <b>capitalisation</b> <b>ratios</b> in investment projects resulted in considerable improvements in labour productivity for the economy as a whole. This resulted in increased wage levels for the traded sector of the economy.|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} the stock performance of America’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens following the annual survey by Business Ethics. We examine both possible short-term announcement effects {{around the time}} of the survey’s publication, and whether longer-term returns are higher for firms that are listed as good citizens. We find some evidence of a positive market reaction to a firm’s presence in the Top 100 firms that are made public, and that holders of the stock of such firms earn small abnormal returns during an announcement window. Over the year following the announcement, companies in the Top 100 yield negative abnormal returns of around 3 %. However, such companies tend to be large and with stocks exhibiting a growth style, which existing studies suggest will tend to perform poorly. Once we allow for these firm characteristics, the poor performance of the highly rated firms declines. We also find companies that are newly listed as good citizens can provide considerable positive abnormal returns to investors, even after allowing for their market <b>capitalisation,</b> price-to-book <b>ratios,</b> and sectoral classification.

40|$|We {{examine the}} long-run {{performance}} of firms that offer seasoned equity on the Swiss market. Swiss firms use offerings with rights to raise new equity {{and they can}} issue three types of securities. Moreover, the tax law has for some firms the effect of increasing the issuing frequency. We find that most SEOs are small {{as a percentage of}} the firm’s market <b>capitalisation.</b> The leverage <b>ratios</b> change often (up and down) during a three-period post-SEO horizon. The long-run abnormal returns are insignificant relative to size and book-to-market matching portfolios. These findings are corroborated by the fact that a portfolio of issuing firms do not exhibit a risk adjusted (Fama and French three factor model and Time-varying beta) abnormal performance. These findings are in accordance with the growing literature showing that the US SEOs do no more have abnorma...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into Internet financial reporting {{carried out in}} June 2005 that focused on stock-market listed Croatian and Slovene joint-stock companies has two basic aspects, comparative and explanatory. The comparative aspect of the research showed that Slovene corporations have a statistically significant higher level of financial reporting (as measured with IFR score). The average IFR score for 55 corporate entities from Croatia came to just 6. 85, while the average IFR score for 30 Slovene firms was 17. 63. The second aspect of the investigation was explanatory, and {{at the level of}} each state and sample the intention was to find the variables that affect IFR scores significantly. With respect to the Croatian sample it was shown that the IFR score was statistically significantly and positively correlated with size, profitability, number of shareholders, and amount of traffic on the stock markets. Then regression analysis showed that majority foreign ownership had a positive effect on the IFR score. A statistically significant but negative correlation was established for two sectors, tourism and marine transport. For the Slovene sample, comprising 30 firms, the size, profitability and number of stockholders were not significant variables. However, official listing, proportion of market <b>capitalisation</b> and <b>ratio</b> of market to book values of shares were statistically significantly and positively correlated with the IFR score. Only one sector, transport, was significantly and negatively correlated with the IFR score. financial reporting, joint stock companies, Internet, Croatia, Slovenia...|$|R
40|$|The {{point of}} this thesis is to compare classic asset pricing models using {{historic}} UK data. It looks at {{three of the most}} commonly used asset pricing models in Finance and tests the suitability of each for the UK market. The models considered are the Capital Asset Pricing Model (1964, 65 and 66) (CAPM), the Fama-French 3 -Factor Model (1993) (FF 3 F) and the Carhart 4 -Factor Model (1997) (C 4 F). The models are analysed using a 34 year sample period (1980 - 2014). The sample data follows the structure explained in Gregory et al (2013) and is compiled of stocks from the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The stocks are grouped into portfolios arranged by market <b>capitalisation,</b> book-to-market <b>ratio,</b> past 2 - 12 month stock return and past 12 month standard deviation of stock return. Statistical analysis is performed and the suitability of the models is tested using the methods of Black, Jensen & Scholes (1972), Fama & MacBeth (1973) and Gibbons, Ross & Shanken (1989). The results compare descriptive and test statistics across the range of risk factors and test portfolios for the each testing method on all three models. They show that although the UK market has some noticeable factor anomalies, none of the models clearly explains the 1980 - 2014 stock returns. However, of the three models, C 4 F shows the highest explanatory power in predicting stock returns...|$|R
40|$|The {{link between}} stock market {{development}} and economic activity {{has always been}} the subject of considerable debate in the field of economics and it raises empirical question whether stock market development influences economic activity or whether it is a consequence of increased economic activity. This study attempts to investigate the direction of causality between stock market development and economic growth in the Indian context. Using the cointegration and causality tests for the period June 1991 to June 2013, the study confirms a well defined long-run equilibrium relationship between the stock market development indicators and economic growth in India. The empirical results show bidirectional causality between market capitalisation and economic growth and unidirectional causality from turnover ratio to economic growth in the long-run and short-run. By and large, it can be inferred that the stock market development indicators viz. market <b>capitalisation</b> and turnover <b>ratio</b> have a positive influence on economic growth in India. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{financial}} development, {{economic growth and}} market volatility in Nigeria and South Africa. For Nigeria, the thesis examines the long-run causality between financial development and economic growth. It uses three measures of financial development: financial development index measured using principal component analysis, bank credit to private sector, and liquid liabilities. For South Africa, the thesis evaluates the causal relationship between stock market development and economic growth. It uses both bank and stock market variables: bank credit to private sector, market <b>capitalisation,</b> turnover <b>ratio,</b> and value shares traded. The study applies Multivariate vector autoregressive (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). It further uses Generalised Impulse Response Function (GIRF) and Variance Decomposition (VDC). The results for Nigeria suggest the existence of unidirectional causality from economic growth to financial development using bank credit to private sector. While using liquid liabilities, it indicates bidirectional causality between financial development and economic growth. In the case of South Africa, the findings suggest the existence of bidirectional causality between financial development and economic growth using the banking system. However, {{when the stock market}} variables are used, the results indicate unidirectional causality from economic growth to stock market system. The thesis further examines the effect of financial liberalisation on the Nigerian and South African equity markets. It applies the Exponential Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model and endogenous structural break tests. These are examined over pre- and post-liberalisation periods. The official liberalisation dummy is added to the augmented EGARCH model to capture the effect of financial liberalisation. The findings show that none of the estimated break dates coincides with the official liberalisation dates for the two countries. When structural breaks are taken into account, volatility tends to decline following financial liberalisation, and the effect of financial liberalisation on the stock markets is negative and statistically significant.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the cost efficiency scores of the banking sectors in 10 Southeast Asian countries and areas (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Macao, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Thailand and South Korea) over the period of 1998 - 2012 using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). The overall cost efficiency score of banking sectors in the ten Southeast Asian countries is 0. 7203, indicating that the banking sector should reduce 29. 97 % costs to match the performance with the best practice banks. And the banking sector in Macao shows a best performance in cost efficient, with 0. 8404 efficiency score, while South Korea is the least cost efficient country with the efficiency of 0. 6433. At the second stage of analysis, one step regression analysis is employed to find out the determinants of cost efficiency in the sample. And the results suggest that the stock market <b>capitalisation</b> and equity <b>ratio</b> have significantly positive correlation to banks’ cost efficiency, while the bank claims to private sector and market concentration are negatively linked to cost efficient level. Finally, there is no evidence to support the real GDP growth and annual inflation statistically correlate to banks’ cost efficiency...|$|R
40|$|MBA thesis - WBSThe aim {{of market}} investors is to {{maximise}} their {{returns from the}} market. Often they do this {{by the use of}} historical financial (and other relevant) information about companies and their share prices. The search for arbitrage opportunities has led to the identification of anomalies such as the size and book-to-market effects but very little research has gone into the changing of these effects over time. They have generally only been identified over long time periods on markets around the world. This investigation used the returns of portfolios based on market <b>capitalisation</b> or book-to-market <b>ratio</b> (or both) and regression analyses at specific dates at which the market conditions changed from those of a bull market to those of a bear market. This study has shown that magnitude and direction of the size and book-to-market effects change over time and that the market condition (bull or bear) is not a direct indicator {{of the state of the}} effect, although it does seem to suggest a lagged impact. The research suggests that there are significant and exploitable differences in portfolios chosen along the lines of market capitalisation or value indicators. Though no causal relationship for the existence of these anomalies has yet been identified, it seems that bear-market conditions have an impact on the magnitude (and direction) of anomalies. Since this impact continues to be seen after the bear markets, this knowledge could be exploited to reduce losses (by disinvesting in stocks that are likely to yield worse results) or even increase gains in portfolios depending on prevailing market condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} between implied and realized variances or variance risk premia (VRP) {{has been documented}} as a good proxy for capturing the time-varying macroeconomic uncertainty and the aggregate level of risk aversion. Motivated by these findings, this thesis extends on the prior literature on VRP by jointly modelling the predictability of the time-series variation in aggregate U. S. stock market and 10 -year Treasury bond returns, with the respective stock and bond VRPs acting as predictor variables over the 1990 - 2012 sample period in a bivariate two-state regime-switching framework. In a “tranquil” regime characterised by periods of economic expansion, the stock and bond VRPs predict a significant positive risk premium for stocks; and a negative but insignificant risk premium for bond. In a “crisis” regime characterised by periods of economic contraction, only the stock VRP predicts a significant positive risk premium for bonds; while both the stock and bond VRP predict a negative but insignificant risk premium for stocks. This pattern suggests periodic shifts {{in the degree of}} risk aversion as investors respond to episodes of economic crises, which {{plays an important role in}} unravelling the “flight to/from quality” phenomenon and the co-movement between stock and bond returns. The magnitude of the predictability is the strongest at the one-month forecast horizon, and reduces as the horizon increases. Such short-run predictability is complementary to the inclusion of conventional predictor variables – term spread, default spread and short rate. Using a time-varying probability regime-switching framework, this thesis also shows that the stock VRP is informative about the future probability of transitioning from periods of economic expansion to periods of economic contraction. Finally, this thesis documents that the stock and bond VRPs have some predictability of the variations in expected market returns captured by market <b>capitalisation</b> and book-to-market <b>ratios...</b>|$|R
40|$|Contrary to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), styles-based {{variables}} of value, size and momentum {{have been well}} documented to show strong associations with cross-sectional equity returns on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (Hoffman, 2012; C. Muller & Ward, 2013) and on international stock exchanges (Carhart, 1997; Fama & French, 1992). Yet little research has exclusively focused on style-based variables and the JSE listed property sector. It is worth noting the total market value of property stocks or {{real estate investment trusts}} (REITs) has grown rapidly both in South African and Internationally. In 1995 the market capitalisation of the JSE listed property sector was R 15 billion, but by November 2015 this had grown to a market capitalisation of R 665 billion (iNET Bridge, 2015). This research study examined the effects of 22 style-based variables on all JSE listed property companies over the period December 1995 to December 2015. The style-based variables included property specific variables, such as geography location, sector allocation, and vacancy percentage. Since such data was not readily available from financial data libraries, a database was created directly from the financial statements reported by each company. The same methodology and graphical time series approach as C. Muller and Ward (2013) was used to evaluate the performance of the examined styles. The study found that portfolios constructed on the basis of ranked style-variables exhibited significant effects over the period. Most notably, both the size (market capitalisation) and value (earnings yield) effects showed significant excess returns and linear relationships, but persistence has not been evident after 2010. Other style-variables that exhibited effects over the period were: total geographic concentration, price to NAV, vacancy percentage of portfolio, value traded, value traded as a percentage of market <b>capitalisation,</b> interest cover <b>ratio,</b> loan to value and geographic international percentage. Furthermore, the study found no evidence of the momentum effect, which was found to be the best performing strategy by C. Muller and Ward (2013) for general equities.

40|$|Issues and Significance: It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that good corporate governance {{is an important factor}} in improving the value of a firm in both developing and developed financial markets. However, the relationship between corporate governance and the value of a firm (the CGVF relationship) differs in developing and developed financial markets due to disparate corporate governance structures in these markets resulting from the dissimilar social, economic and regulatory conditions in these countries. There is a need to understand the differences which affect the value of a firm for academic investigations, financial and management practices and public regulation of markets and corporations. Existing Literature and Limitations: The existing literature on how good corporate governance contributes to improving the value of a firm is not well developed and has several limitations. No single research thus far, has undertaken a comprehensive study of the differences in the relationship between the level of corporate governance sophistication of the firm and its contribution to firm value. In the context of developing markets the relationships between corporate governance and the value of a firm are not defined properly and these relationships are not adequately tested by incorporating the relevant factors affecting them. Furthermore, comparative analyses of the relevance of different management theories (such as agency theory, stewardship theory, etc.) in shedding light on the nature and process of the CGVF relationships in developing and developed markets have not been reported in literature. Therefore, there is a need to redefine and properly analyse CGVF relationships by incorporating the factors relevant for a firm operating in developing and developed financial markets. Objectives of the Study: To help overcome the limitations of the existing literature, this study develops separate models for the CGVF relationships for developed and developing markets keeping in mind the differences between these markets; defines the concept of corporate governance and the value of a firm suitable for developing and developed financial markets; highlights the differences in the process by which corporate governance affects the value of a firm in developing and developed financial markets; and states the implications of different management theories in explaining the differences in CGVF relationships in these markets. Methodology and Data: Two typical financial markets, Australia (developed) and Malaysia (developing) are selected for the present study. The panel data is collected from 2000 to 2003 for Tobin’s Q, price to book value <b>ratio,</b> market <b>capitalisation,</b> gearing <b>ratio,</b> return on total assets, shareholder’s concentration (agency cost), CEO duality, board size, and judicial and regulatory authority efficiency. Multifactor corporate governance and the value of a firm (CGVF) models relevant for developed and developing markets are constructed and econometric analyses are performed to test the relationship between corporate governance instruments and the value of a firm. Incremental tests are also carried out to see the importance of individual variables in the model for developing and developed financial markets. In addition, tests for the complementarities of corporate governance instruments in affecting the value of a firm are also performed. Results and Implications of CGVF Relationships The results of the corporate governance model for developing, developed and crossmarket analysis suggest a positive relationship between corporate governance and the value of a firm. The results on the relationship between the value of a firm and corporate governance mechanism in the developed market suggest a negative relationship between debt and the value of a firm. The result confirms agency theory, as managers do not handle the debt properly. Also, there is a negative relationship between the value of a firm and a larger board, further confirming agency theory. On the contrary, control variables such as market capitalisation and the price to book value ratio have a positive relationship with the value of a firm in this market. The managers are stewards in this case and are inclined to support the interests of the shareholders thereby supporting stewardship theory. Similarly, the results on the relationship between corporate governance and the value of a firm in the developing financial market suggest a negative relationship between shareholder concentration and the value of a firm. The results of this model confirm agency theory where the majority shareholders, as agents, are involved in empire building. Similarly, control variables such as return on total assets, market capitalisation and price to book value ratio have a positive relationship with the value of a firm in the developing financial market. The results support stewardship theory. Finally, the bigger board size has a positive relationship with the value of a firm in the developing financial market. The results on the cross-market analysis show that higher debt and inefficient regulatory authority have a negative relationship with the value of a firm. There is an agency cost involved in handling debt. Furthermore, the inefficient regulatory authority deteriorates the value of a firm supporting agency theory. On the contrary, control variables such as return on total assets and price to book value ratio have a positive relationship with the value of a firm in both developed and developing financial markets, supporting stewardship theory. The incremental regression shows that price to book value ratio is the most significant factor in improving the value of a firm in all the CGVF models. The tests of complementarities in the cross-market analysis suggest that board size improves the marginal benefit of CEO duality. Similarly, the regulatory regime encourages an independent CEO to improve the value of a firm. Finally, the value of a firm in a developing market is a broad concept and also incorporates the social value in addition to the monetary value of a firm. The difference in the results for developing and developed markets is due to the different social, regulatory and corporate governance systems in their financial markets. Due to these variations in the selected financial markets, the process by which the value of a firm is affected is also different. Conclusion: In light of the above findings, the study has highlighted the role of corporate governance in effective utilisation of assets to improve the value of a firm. The role of the board and regulatory authority is important in disciplining the CEO and majority shareholders in the financial markets. A bigger board creates value for shareholders in developing financial markets. On the contrary, a smaller board and less debt create value in developed financial markets. The current study makes an original contribution by suggesting that there is a positive relationship between corporate governance and the value of a firm in both developing and developed markets, although, the nature of this relationship differs due to differences in the characteristics of developing and developed markets. The divergence in the social, economic and organisational aspects of these markets makes the relevance of various organisational and management theories in explaining the CGVF relationships different as well. These insights in explaining the CGVF relationships are useful for academic understanding and business and public policy formulations...|$|R
