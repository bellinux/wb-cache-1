50|$|The early ribbon cables {{were used}} in the {{mainframe}} computer industry, on card readers, <b>card</b> <b>punching</b> machines, and tape machines. Subsequently ribbon cables were manufactured by a number of different companies, including 3M. Methods and materials were developed to simplify and reduce the cost of ribbon cables, by standardizing the design and spacing of the wires, and the thickness of the insulation, so that they could be easily terminated through the use of insulation displacement connectors (IDC). The simplicity of the cables, their low profile (compared to contemporary alternatives), and low cost due to standardization, meant ribbon cables were long used in computers, printers, and many electronic devices.|$|E
50|$|The 7090 series {{features}} a data channel architecture for input and output, a forerunner of modern {{direct memory access}} I/O. Up to eight data channels can be attached, with up to ten IBM 729 tape drives attached to each channel. The data channels have their own very limited set of operations called commands. These are used with tape (and later, disk) storage as well as card units and printers, and offered high performance for the time. Printing and punched card I/O, however, employed the same modified unit record equipment introduced with the 704 and was slow. It became common to use a less expensive IBM 1401 computer to read cards onto magnetic tape for transfer to the 7090/94. Output would be spooled onto tape and transferred to the 1401 for printing or <b>card</b> <b>punching</b> using its much faster peripherals, notably the IBM 1403 line printer. Later IBM introduced the 7094/7044 Direct Coupled System, using data channel to data channel communication, with the 7094 primarily performing computations and the 7044 performing I/O operations using its fast 1400-series peripherals.|$|E

50|$|The {{card reader}} could read 600 {{standard}} <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> per minute, {{each with a}} capacity of up to 80 characters. The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> could <b>punch</b> 100 <b>cards</b> per minute.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> had {{a maximum}} rate of 150 cards per minute. Timing was quite {{critical}} throughout {{the operation of}} the <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> the <b>card</b> reader and the printer, all being based on electromechanical principles. The basic <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> mechanism was manufactured by Bull, a French company which owned patents on 80 column <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> machines. The machine came in two versions, the P147 and the P67, the main difference being electromagnetic clutch or a solenoid operated mechanical [...] "dog" [...] clutch to initiate a punch cycle. Since many gears, electrical contact cams were affixed to the main shaft with taper pins, the P 67 with its severe stopping dog clutch would cause timing loss more frequently than the P 147. Most emergency maintenance time was spent replacing worn and damaged taper pins and retiming the machine. The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> had a preread station, a punch station and a checkread station. The machine could be quite difficult to maintain and required much skill to troubleshoot and maintain. The machine cycle was oddly divided into 420 [...] "points" [...] or [...] "Bull degrees".|$|R
50|$|A lace <b>card</b> is a <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> {{with all}} holes punched (also called a whoopee card, {{ventilator}} card, flyswatter card, or IBM doily). They were mainly used as practical jokes to cause unwanted disruption in card readers. Card readers tended to jam when a lace card was inserted, as the resulting card had too little structural strength to avoid buckling inside the mechanism. <b>Card</b> <b>punches</b> could also jam trying to produce cards with all holes punched, owing to power-supply problems. When a lace card was fed through the reader, a card knife or card saw (a flat tool used with <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers and <b>card</b> <b>punches)</b> {{was needed to}} clear the jam.|$|R
