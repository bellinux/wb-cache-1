As you surmise, it's necessary in My Position to be conservative, and perhaps endeavor to maintain a certain standard of dignity. Yet I think you'll find me somewhat progressive. In our bank, for example, I hope I may {{say that we have}} as modern a method of publicity and advertising as any in the <b>city.</b> <b>Yes,</b> I fancy you'll find us oldsters quite cognizant of the shifting spiritual values of the age. Yes, oh yes. And so, in fact, it pleases {{me to be able to}} say that though personally I might prefer the sterner Presbyterianism of an earlier era--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a little}} {{difficult}} to tell you for she spoke in a strange tongue, and I had to translate it in my head, as it were. But this is the gist of it. That you were to have that chest and what was in it. There's a writing there, she says, or part of a writing for some has gone--rotted away. You are to read that writing or to get it read and to print {{it so that the}} world may read it also. She said that 'Hubert' wishes you to do so. I am sure the name was Hubert, though she also spoke of him with some other title which I do not understand. That's all I can remember, except something about a <b>city,</b> <b>yes,</b> a City of Gold and a last great battle in which Hubert fell, covered with glory and conquering. I understood that she wanted to talk about that because it isn't in the writing, but you interrupted and of course she's gone. Yes, the price is £50 and not a farthing less, but you can pay it when you like for I know you're as honest as most, and whether you pay it or not, you must have that chest and what's in it and no one else." ...|$|E

"Yes, yes," [...] said John, {{with one}} of his quizzing expressions, [...] "Colonel Jarvis, that must be the alderman; they are {{commonly}} colonels of <b>city</b> volunteers: <b>yes,</b> that must have been the old gem'mun who spoke to us, and I was right after all about the bandboxes." ...|$|R
25|$|In a 2002 {{address at}} a {{convention}} of the NAACP, Street said that “the brothers and sisters are running the <b>city.</b> Oh, <b>yes.</b> The brothers and sisters are running this city. Running it! Don’t you let nobody fool you, we {{are in charge of}} the City of Brotherly Love. We are in charge! We are in charge!” This observation attracted some criticism and charges of racial divisiveness.|$|R

5000|$|... 'S gibt nur a Kaiserstadt, 's gibt nur a Wien! [...] is a polka {{written by}} Johann Strauss II in 1864. The {{title of this}} polka was {{inspired}} from the waltz duet in the Singspiel (musical comedy) 'Aline' by Adolf Bäuerle with music by Wenzel Müller first performed at the Theater in der Leopoldstadt on 9 October 1822. The song titled 'Was macht denn der Prater' was a hit during its day whereas its refrain 'Ja nur ein' Kaiserstadt, ja nur a Wien' (Yes, only one Imperial <b>City,</b> <b>yes</b> only one Vienna!) became a popular household phrase.|$|E

50|$|On 19 August 2015, Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III signed Republic Act No. 10675 which {{converted}} the municipality of General Trias into a component city of Cavite. The bill finally came into full effect after {{majority of the}} <b>city's</b> residents voted <b>yes</b> to cityhood through a plebiscite. General Trias thus became the seventh city in the province and the 145th in the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{this may}} have driven me mad; I am not sure. I know there is one angle of the road down the pass where the rock leans out a little, and on windy nights I seem to hear it clashing {{overhead}} with other rocks-- <b>yes,</b> <b>city</b> against city and citadel against citadel, far up into the night. It was on such an evening that the strange man struggled up the pass. Broadly speaking, only strange men did struggle up the pass. But I had never seen one like this one before.|$|R
5000|$|At the Delectable Mountains, three Shepherds are at evening prayer. Pilgrim {{approaches}} {{them and}} asks {{if he is}} on the path to the Celestial <b>City.</b> They reply <b>yes,</b> and after asking why he wishes to journey there, invite Pilgrim to rest with them momentarily. The voice of a bird sings praises to God. A Celestial Messenger appears and tells Pilgrim that [...] "the Master" [...] summons him that day. The Messenger ceremonially pierces Pilgrim's heart with an arrow [...] "with the point sharpened with love". The Shepherds anoint Pilgrim. The Messenger directs Pilgrim on the path to the Celestial City, to which he must first cross the River of Death. The Shepherds pray for Pilgrim.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{that you should}} have had so much trouble," [...] he said, shaking hands with Harry. Clavering {{declared}} that he had incurred no trouble, and declared also that he would be only too happy to have taken any trouble in obeying a behest from his friend Lady Ongar. Had he been a Pole as was the count, he would not have forgotten to add that he would have been equally willing to exert himself with the view of making the count's acquaintance; but being simply a young Englishman, he was much too awkward for any such courtesy as that. The count observed the omission, smiled, and bowed. Then he spoke of the weather, and said that London was a magnificent <b>city.</b> Oh, <b>yes,</b> he knew London well; had known it these twenty years; had been for fifteen years a member of the Travellers'; he liked everything English, except hunting. English hunting he had found to be dull work. But he liked shooting for an hour or two. He could not rival, he said, the intense energy of an Englishman, who would work all day with his gun harder than ploughmen with their ploughs. Englishmen sported, he said, as though more than their bread--as though their honor, their wives, their souls, depended on it. It was very fine! He often wished that he was an Englishman. Then he shrugged his shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|At Mudie's {{corner in}} Oxford Street all {{the red and}} blue beads had run {{together}} on the string. The motor omnibuses were locked. Mr. Spalding going to the city looked at Mr. Charles Budgeon bound for Shepherd's Bush. The proximity of the omnibuses gave the outside passengers an opportunity to stare into each other's faces. Yet few took advantage of it. Each had his own business to think of. Each had his past shut in him like the leaves of a book known to him by heart; and his friends could only read the title, James Spalding, or Charles Budgeon, and the passengers going the opposite way could read nothing at all--save [...] "a man with a red moustache," [...] "a young man in grey smoking a pipe." [...] The October sunlight rested upon all {{these men and women}} sitting immobile; and little Johnnie Sturgeon took the chance to swing down the staircase, carrying his large mysterious parcel, and so dodging a zigzag course between the wheels he reached the pavement, started to whistle a tune and was soon out of sight--for ever. The omnibuses jerked on, and every single person felt relief at being a little nearer to his journey's end, though some cajoled themselves past the immediate engagement by promise of indulgence beyond--steak and kidney pudding, drink or a game of dominoes in the smoky corner of a <b>city</b> restaurant. Oh <b>yes,</b> human life is very tolerable on the top of an omnibus in Holborn, when the policeman holds up his arm and the sun beats on your back, and {{if there is such a}} thing as a shell secreted by man to fit man himself here we find it, on the banks of the Thames, where the great streets join and St. Paul's Cathedral, like the volute on the top of the snail shell, finishes it off. Jacob, getting off his omnibus, loitered up the steps, consulted his watch, and finally made up his mind to go in.... Does it need an effort? Yes. These changes of mood wear us out.|$|R
