25|$|Energy {{requirements}} for transportation of concrete are low {{because it is}} produced locally from local resources, typically manufactured within 100 kilometers of the job site. Similarly, relatively little energy is used in producing and combining the raw materials (although large amounts of CO2 are produced by the chemical reactions in <b>cement</b> <b>manufacture).</b> The overall embodied energy of concrete at roughly 1 to 1.5 megajoules per kilogram is therefore lower than for most structural and construction materials.|$|E

25|$|Of most {{concern in}} these {{anthropogenic}} factors is {{the increase in}} CO2 levels. This is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, followed by aerosols (particulate matter in the atmosphere), and the CO2 released by <b>cement</b> <b>manufacture.</b> Other factors, including land use, ozone depletion, animal husbandry (ruminant animals such as cattle produce methane, as do termites), and deforestation, are also of concern in the roles they playnbsp&– both separately and {{in conjunction with other}} factorsnbsp&– in affecting climate, microclimate, and measures of climate variables.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{effect of}} {{artificial}} pozzolan (waste brick) on the physico-chemical properties of <b>cement</b> <b>manufactured</b> was investigated. The waste brick {{is generated by}} the manufacture of bricks. It {{was used in the}} proportions of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % by mass of cement to study its effect on the physico-chemical properties of cement incorporating artificial pozzolan. The physicochemical properties of cement at anhydrous state and the hydrated state (chemical composition, specific weight, fineness, consistency of the cement paste and setting times) were studied. The experimental results obtained show that the quantity of pozzolanic admixture (waste brick) of <b>cement</b> <b>manufactured</b> is the principal parameter who influences on the variation of the physico-chemical properties of the cement tested.
