5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (spread {{to other places}} in the body), is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular <b>cancer</b> <b>treatments</b> (such as the use of central venous catheters for chemotherapy) may increase the risk of thrombosis further.|$|E

Being able to model and alter protein–DNA interactions specifically, like those of homing endonucleases, gives computational protein design methods like Rosetta an important role in gene therapy (which includes possible <b>cancer</b> <b>treatments).</b>|$|E

40|$|Toxicities {{associated}} with {{head and neck}} <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> are common events. Despite {{the fact that many}} side effects of <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> are now well controlled, some, such as mucositis and salivary gland hypofunction, continue to be almost inevitable outcomes of <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment.</b> Furthermore, improvements in <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> itself as well as new modalities, such as targeted treatments, may be {{associated with}} different toxicities. In this review, common toxicities associated with head and neck <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> will be discussed including those reported to occur with targeted therapies. This review also considers the concept of toxicity clusters, risk factors for toxicity (for example genetics) and individualisation of <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment.</b> Richard M Logan[URL]...|$|R
50|$|Tumor board {{review is}} a {{treatment}} planning approach {{in which a}} number of doctors who are experts in different medical specialties review and discuss the medical condition and treatment options of a patient. In <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment,</b> a tumor board review may include that of a medical oncologist (who provides <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> with drugs), a surgical oncologist (who provides <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> with surgery), and a radiation oncologist (who provides <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> with radiation).

5|$|While {{antioxidant}} supplementation {{is widely}} used in attempts to prevent the development of cancer, antioxidants may interfere with <b>cancer</b> <b>treatments,</b> since the environment of cancer cells causes high levels of oxidative stress, making these cells more susceptible to the further oxidative stress induced by treatments. As a result, by reducing the redox stress in cancer cells, antioxidant supplements (and pharmaceuticals) could decrease the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. On the other hand, other reviews have suggested that antioxidants could reduce side effects or increase survival times.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{mushrooms}} enjoy usage as therapeutics in folk medicines, such as Traditional Chinese medicine. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in <b>cancer</b> <b>treatments</b> in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy.|$|E
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched {{as a treatment for}} people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial <b>cancer.</b> <b>Treatments</b> for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and ifosfamide.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that traditional Chinese medicines (CMs) and their active compounds {{play an important role in}} liver <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> by preventing tumor formation, inhibiting tumor growth, metastasis and recurrence as well as improving the quality of life and reducing side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Mechanism studies have proved the advantage of multicomponent, multitarget and multipathway combinational regulation by CMs in liver <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment.</b> This chapter emphatically introduces the molecular mechanisms underlying liver <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> by CMs. In addition, we also put forward discussion on existing obstacles and prospect of the future development on liver <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> using CMs, in terms of providing a comprehensive understanding of action of CMs in liver <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment.</b> link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: There {{is a lack}} of {{longitudinal}} studies investigating fatigue from before <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> to long after successful <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment.</b> OBJECTIVES: This prospective follow-up study aimed to determine the prevalence and predictors of persistent fatigue in cancer survivors in the first year after completion of <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment.</b> METHODS: Sixty patients with various malignancies were assessed before (T 1), shortly after curative <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> (T 2), and one year after T 2 (T 3). Fatigue was assessed monthly between T 2 and T 3. Fatigue severity was measured using the subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength. Questionnaires were used to measure impaired sleep and rest, physical activity, social support, fatigue catastrophizing, and somatic-related attributions regarding fatigue. Linear regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of persistent fatigue. RESULTS: In total, 22 % of survivors had severe persistent fatigue over the last six months in the first year after <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment.</b> Fatigue at T 1, T 2, and negative interactions predicted the severity of persistent fatigue. Analyses without fatigue showed that more negative interactions, impaired sleep and rest, fatigue catastrophizing, and lower self-reported physical activity at T 2 were associated with the severity of persistent fatigue. CONCLUSION: Twenty-two percent of the survivors had severe persistent fatigue in the year after <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment.</b> Fatigue and cognitive behavioral factors predicted persistent fatigue in the year after <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment.</b> Diagnosis or <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment</b> did not predict persistent fatigue. The implication is that cognitive behavioral therapy for postcancer fatigue, aimed at the fatigue-perpetuating factors, could be offered from two months after successful <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|R

25|$|Saliva {{production}} may be pharmacologically {{stimulated by}} sialagogues such as pilocarpine and cevimeline.
