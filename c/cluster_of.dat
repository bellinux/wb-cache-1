40|$|A {{clustering}} {{method that}} combined density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise with mathematical morphology clustering is proposed {{to adapt to}} the features of driver’s fixation such as points’ dispersion and fixation regions’ irregularity and solve the problems of conventional density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise method’s large influence by parameters and mathematical morphology clustering’s needs of much manual intervention. Drivers’ fixation data were collected by Smart Eye Pro 5. 7 eye tracking system, and the data were processed and clustered using conventional clustering methods and density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise–mathematical morphology clustering method. The results show that the method proposed in this article takes into account the advantages <b>of</b> density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise and mathematical morphology clustering to cluster irregular regions and makes up for defects <b>of</b> conventional <b>clustering</b> methods. It is verified that density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise–mathematical morphology clustering method is better than the conventional hierarchical clustering method and density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise method in driver’s fixation points clustering and can improve the quality of driver’s fixation region division...|$|R
40|$|Correlations {{between the}} <b>clustering</b> {{patterns}} <b>of</b> the vacuolation ('spongiform change'), prion protein (PrP) deposits, and surviving neurons were {{studied in the}} cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in 11 cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). Differences in the sizes <b>of</b> the <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> vacuoles were observed between brain regions and in the cerebral cortex, between {{the upper and lower}} laminae. With the exception of the parietal cortex, mean <b>cluster</b> size <b>of</b> the vacuoles was {{similar to that of the}} PrP deposits in each brain area. <b>Clusters</b> <b>of</b> the vacuoles were spatially correlated with the density of surviving neurons and with the <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> PrP deposits in 47 % and 53 % of cortical areas analysed respectively but there were few spatial correlation between the PrP deposits and the density of surviving neurons. The data suggest that the pathology of sCJD may spread through the brain via specific anatomical pathways. Development <b>of</b> the <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> vacuoles is spatially related to surviving neurons while the appearance <b>of</b> <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> PrP deposits is related to the development of the vacuolation...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{distinct}} but related clustering problems with microarray data.

The <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> tissues so obtained in the first problem can play a useful role in the discovery and understanding of new subclasses <b>of</b> diseases. The <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> genes obtained in the second problem can be used to search for genetic pathways or groups of genes that might be regulated together. Also, in the first problem, we may wish first to summarize the information in the very large number <b>of</b> genes by <b>clustering</b> them into groups (of hyperspherical shape), which can be represented by some metagenes, such as the group sample means. We can then carry out the <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> the tissues in terms of these metagenes.

40|$|The {{histological}} {{features of}} cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) are often distributed in the brain in clusters. This study investigated the spatial associations between the <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> the vacuoles, surviving neurons, and prion protein (PrP) deposits in various brain areas in 11 cases <b>of</b> vCJD. <b>Clusters</b> <b>of</b> vacuoles and surviving neurons were positively correlated in the cerebral cortex but negatively correlated in the dentate gyrus. <b>Clusters</b> <b>of</b> the florid and diffuse type of PrP deposit were not positively correlated with those of either the vacuoles or the surviving neurons although a negative correlation was observed between the florid plaques and surviving neurons in some cortical areas. <b>Clusters</b> <b>of</b> the florid and diffuse deposits were either negatively correlated or uncorrelated. These data suggest: 1) that <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> vacuoles in the cerebral cortex {{are associated with the}} presence of surviving neuronal cell bodies, 2) that the <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> vacuoles are not spatially related to those of the PrP deposits, and 3) different factors are involved in the pathogenesis of the florid and diffuse PrP deposits...|$|R

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{longitudinal}} relationships between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and sleep problems among adolescent survivors in the Wenchuan earthquake, China. 350 adolescent survivors {{were randomly selected}} from several primary and secondary schools in the counties of Wenchuan and Maoxian, the two areas most severely affected by the Wenchuan earthquake. Participants completed Revised Child PTSD Symptom Scale and Sleep Problems Subscale of Self-generated Child Behavior Problems Questionnaire at one year (T 1), one-and-a-half years (T 2), two years (T 3) after the earthquake, respectively. There was a bidirectional relationship between intrusive symptom <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> PTSD and sleep problems from T 1 to T 2, and this relationship became non-significant from T 2 to T 3. There was a one-way predictive relationship <b>of</b> avoidance symptom <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> PTSD onto sleep problems from T 1 to T 3. The hyperarousal symptom <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> PTSD had effects on sleep problems from T 1 to T 2 but not from T 2 to T 3, while sleep problems have no significant effect on hyperarousal symptom <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> PTSD from T 1 to T 3.
