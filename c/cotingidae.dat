5|$|Tityridae {{is family}} of suboscine {{passerine}} birds found in forest and woodland in the Neotropics. The approximately 30 species {{in this family}} were formerly lumped with the families Pipridae and <b>Cotingidae</b> (see Taxonomy).|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other species}} of the family <b>Cotingidae,</b> the Guianan cock-of-the-rock makes its nest on rocky cliff faces and caves {{rather than in the}} trees. The female lays one or two eggs in the nest of mud and plant material, which is {{attached}} by saliva to a vertical rock. The male does not participate in the building of the nest or the incubation of the eggs. Eggs typically incubate for 27–28 days. The ideal nesting sites for this species are usually located in a cave or vertical rock face with crevices that provide some shelter and protection from the elements. The nests themselves are solid moldings formed from mud and plant material deposited into the crevices. Due to the solid nature of these nests, they typically persist from one breeding season to the next. Females will make repairs to their nests as a breeding season begins.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} (Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema) is {{a species of}} bird in the cotinga family, <b>Cotingidae.</b> It {{is found in the}} western Amazon {{rainforest}} of South America; its range extends from southern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil. It lives in the canopy or along the borders of humid forest throughout its range. The purple-throated cotinga is monotypic within the genus Porphyrolaema and has no known subspecies. It is one of the smaller cotinga species and expresses strong sexual dimorphism. Males have black upperparts with a bold white wingstripe and white edges to the tertial feathers and a white belly with some black barring on the rear flanks. The throat is a deep purple, giving the bird both its common and scientific names. Females are dark brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts, buffy cinnamon with black barring on the underparts, and rufous on the throat. The male has a powerful voice.|$|E
25|$|Sexual dichromatism is {{very rare}} among the basal {{lineages}} of Passerida, and probably their plesiomorphic condition. But among the youngest passerid clade, the Passeroidea, extremely colorful males and drab females are common, if not the rule. On the other hand, among the basalmost Passeri {{a considerable number of}} strongly dimorphic lineages exist, too, such as the very ancient Menuridae, as well as many Meliphagoidea and Corvoidea. Sexual dimorphism is also not uncommon in the Acanthisittidae and prominent in some suboscines such as the Pipridae and <b>Cotingidae.</b>|$|E
500|$|Tityridae {{is family}} of suboscine {{passerine}} birds found in forests and woodlands in the Neotropics. The approximately 30 species {{in this family}} were formerly spread over the families Tyrannidae, Pipridae and <b>Cotingidae</b> (see Taxonomy). As of yet, no widely accepted common name exists for the family, although [...] "tityras and allies" [...] and [...] "tityras, mourners and allies" [...] have been used. They are small to medium-sized birds.|$|E
500|$|Which {{family the}} species belonged to {{remained}} unresolved {{for over a}} century. According to the Handbook of the Birds of the World, Xenopsaris and its allies were [...] "taxonomically problematic genera that have {{for more than a}} hundred years been shifted back and forth between the cotingas (<b>Cotingidae)</b> and the Tyrannidae". When placed with the tyrant-flycatchers, Tyrannidae, it was considered closely related to the genera Suiriri, Serpophaga and Knipolegus. The uncertainty was not confined to this species, as there was a general confusion about where to draw the lines between the cotingas, tyrant-flycatchers and manakins.|$|E
500|$|One of {{two species}} in the genus Rupicola, the other being the Guianan cock-of-the-rock, the Andean cock-of-the-rock was first {{described}} by English ornithologist John Latham in 1790. It is classified in the <b>Cotingidae,</b> a family of largely frugivorous tropical forest suboscine passerines. The generic name {{is derived from the}} Latin stems rupes [...] "rock" [...] or [...] "cliff", and cola [...] "inhabiting", and is derived from its habit of nesting in rock walls. Its specific epithet peruvianus [...] "of Peru" [...] is masculine despite the -a ending of the genus name (in Latin, names in -cola were masculine or neuter); peruviana is seen in older works.|$|E

6000|$|... 1. Chatterers (<b>Cotingidæ).</b> These {{comprise}} some of {{the most}} gorgeous birds in the world, vivid blues, rich purples, and bright reds, being the most characteristic colours. The females are always obscurely tinted, and are often of a greenish hue, not easily visible among the foliage.|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} birds, many species, the sexes of which differ greatly from each other, are {{certainly}} monogamous. In Great Britain we see well-marked sexual differences in, for instance, the wild-duck which pairs {{with a single}} female, with the common blackbird, and with the bullfinch which is said to pair for life. So it is, as I am informed by Mr. Wallace, with the Chatterers or <b>Cotingidæ</b> of South America, and numerous other birds. In several groups I {{have not been able}} to discover whether the species are polygamous or monogamous. Lesson says that birds of paradise, so remarkable for their sexual differences, are polygamous, but Mr. Wallace doubts whether he had sufficient evidence. Mr. Salvin informs me that he has been led to believe that humming-birds are polygamous. The male widow-bird; remarkable for his caudal plumes, certainly seems to be a polygamist.[343] I have been assured by Mr. Jenner Weir and by others, that three starlings not rarely frequent the same nest; but whether this is a case of polygamy or polyandry has not been ascertained.|$|E

Lloyd, 'Game Birds of Sweden,' 1867, pp. 19, and 182. Montagu and Selby speak of the Black Grouse as polygamous and of the Red Grouse as monogamous.) I have been assured by Mr. Jenner Weir and by others, that it is somewhat common for three starlings to frequent the same nest; but whether this is a case of polygamy or polyandry has not been ascertained.|$|E
60|$|As far as I can {{discover}} {{there are few}} large groups of birds {{in which all the}} species have both sexes alike and brilliantly coloured, but I hear from Mr. Sclater, that this appears to be the case with the Musophagae or plantain-eaters. Nor do I believe that any large group exists in which the sexes of all the species are widely dissimilar in colour: Mr. Wallace informs me that the chatterers of S. America (<b>Cotingidae)</b> offer one of the best instances; but with some of the species, in which the male has a splendid red breast, the female exhibits some red on her breast; and the females of other species shew traces of the green and other colours of the males. Nevertheless we have a near approach to close sexual similarity or dissimilarity throughout several groups: and this, from what has just been said of the fluctuating nature of inheritance, is a somewhat surprising circumstance. But that the same laws should largely prevail with allied animals is not surprising. The domestic fowl has produced a great number of breeds and sub-breeds, and in these the sexes generally differ in plumage; so that it has been noticed as an unusual circumstance when in certain sub-breeds they resemble each other. On the other hand, the domestic pigeon has likewise produced a vast number of distinct breeds and sub-breeds, and in these, with rare exceptions, the two sexes are identically alike.|$|E
6000|$|Although {{the females}} {{of the above}} closely-allied species, {{together}} with their young, differ hardly at all from each other, so that the males alone can be distinguished, yet {{in most cases the}} females of the species within the same genus obviously differ from each other. The differences, however, are rarely as great as between the males. We see this clearly in the whole family of the Gallinaceæ: the females, for instance, of the common and Japan pheasant, and especially of the gold and Amherst pheasant—of the silver pheasant and the wild fowl—resemble each other very closely in colour, whilst the males differ to an extraordinary degree. So it is with the females of most of the <b>Cotingidæ,</b> Fringillidæ, and many other families. There can indeed be no doubt that, as a general rule, the females have been modified to a less extent than the males. Some few birds, however, offer a singular and inexplicable exception; thus the females of Paradisea apoda and P. papuana differ from each other more than do their respective males;[235] the female of the latter species having the under surface pure white, whilst the female P. apoda is deep brown beneath. So, again, as I hear from Professor Newton, the males of two species of Oxynotus (shrikes), which represent each other in the islands of Mauritius and Bourbon,[236] differ but little in colour, whilst the females differ much. In the Bourbon species the female appears to have partially retained an immature condition of plumage, for at first sight she “might be taken for the young of the Mauritian species.” These differences may be compared with those which occur, independently of selection by man, and which we cannot explain, in certain sub-breeds of the game-fowl, in which the females are very different, whilst the males can hardly be distinguished.[237] ...|$|E

On the other hand, the domestic pigeon has likewise produced a vast number of distinct breeds and sub-breeds, and in these, with rare exceptions, the two sexes are identically alike. Therefore if other species of Gallus and Columba were domesticated and varied, it would not be rash to predict that the same general rules of sexual similarity and dissimilarity, depending on the form of transmission, would, in both cases, hold good. In a similar manner the same form of transmission has generally prevailed throughout the same natural groups, although marked exceptions to this rule occur. Within the same family or even genus, the sexes may be identically alike or very different in colour. Instances have already been given relating to the same genus, as with sparrows, fly-catchers, thrushes and grouse. In the family of pheasants the males and females of almost all the species are wonderfully dissimilar, but are quite similar in the eared pheasant or Crossoptilon auritum. In two species of Chloephaga, a genus of geese, the males cannot be distinguished from the females, except by size; whilst in two others, the sexes are so unlike that they might easily be mistaken for distinct species.[225] ...|$|E
