The C 1 bituminous coal widely used in the high-incidence area of lung cancer in Xuanwei was selected as experiment group, while the C 2 + 1, K 7, and M 30 bituminous coal that was mined and used in the low-incidence area of lung cancer in Xuanwei for more than 10 years were selected as control group. Fourteen paraffin-embedded cancer tissue samples from the non-smoking women with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} who were born in Xuanwei and were at least the 3 rd generation of the family living there were collected from the department of pathology, the third affiliated hospital of kunming medical university (tumor hospital of yunnan province). Titrimetric potassium silicofluoride method was used to measure {{the content of}} silica in raw coal and its bottom ashes in 20 samples from the experimental group and control group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of silica particles in C 1 bituminous coal and its bottom ashes, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX) was used to analyze the microscopic composition. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe the morphology of silica particles in the bottom ashes and <b>coal</b> <b>soot</b> of C 1 bituminous coal as well as the lung cancer tissue from the non-smoking women in Xuanwei, and transmission electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (TEM-EDX) was used to analyze the microscopic composition. The silica particles were separated from the <b>coal</b> <b>soot</b> and bottom ashes and characterized by physical method. The silica content in C 1 bituminous coal and its bottom ashes was significantly higher than that in C 2 + 1, K 7, and M 30 bituminous coal (P < 0. 05). The bottom ashes of C 1 bituminous coal contained a large quantity of silica particles, mostly with microscale sizes. Silica particles were found in the soot of C 1 bituminous coal and the lung cancer tissue from non-smoking women in Xuanwei. The silica particles in the bottom ashes were mostly 120 ∼ 500 nm in diameter, had various shapes, and contained such elements as iron, aluminium, calcium, and potassium; the silica particles in the <b>coal</b> <b>soot</b> were mostly nanoscale, ranging from 37 nm to 80 nm in diameter, had various shapes, with some in fibrous form, had non smooth surfaces, and contained such elements as iron, potassium, calcium, aluminium, and sulfur. In Xuanwei, the incidence of lung cancer among non-smoking women is high in the area where silica-rich C 1 bituminous coal is produced. There are silica particles enriched in both the combustion products (<b>coal</b> <b>soot</b> and bottom ashes) of C 1 bituminous coal and the cancer tissue from the non-smoking women with non-small cell lung cancer, with similar morphology and microscopic composition. We hypothesize that the silica particles from combusted C 1 bituminous coal in Xuanwei are mixed with indoor air and inhaled along with other suspended particles. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

However, the cancer-causing culprit is not settled as Tian [Tian, L., 2005. Coal Combustion Emissions and Lung Cancer in Xuan Wei, China. Ph. D. thesis, University of California, Berkeley. ] found nanometer quartz in these <b>coals,</b> <b>soot</b> emissions, and lung cancer tissues. We have conducted mineralogical and geochemical studies of the coals from Xuan Wei for the purpose of shedding light on the minerals which {{may be related to the}} epidemic lung cancer. In this paper, abundances, modes of occurrence, and origins of minerals and elements in the coals from two mines in Xuan Wei have been studied using optical microscope, low-temperature ashing, X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, and inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The minerals in the coals are mainly composed of quartz, chamosite, kaolinite, and calcite. The particle size of quartz is rather small, mostly less than 20  μm and it is of authigenic origin. Chamosite occurs mainly as cell-fillings. The occurrence of quartz and chamosite indicates that they were derived from the hydrothermal fluids. Epigenetic calcite is derived from calcic fluids. Kaolinite is derived mainly from sediment source region of Kangdian Oldland to the west of coal basin. The composition of Xuan Wei coal is high in SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2, CaO, MnO, V, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. The high SiO 2 content is attributed to quartz, and the Fe 2 O 3 content to chamosite. The high Mn and low Mg contents in the coal indicate the inputs of hydrothermal fluids. CaO occurs mainly in epigenetic calcite. Elements Ti, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and rare earth elements were derived from the basaltic rocks at sediment source region. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{results of}} applying the palynological and carbon isotopic {{analysis of the}} organic fraction of Total Suspended Particles (TSP) to discriminate distinct pollution sources and assess the anthropogenic impact for the investigated areas. The samples of atmospheric particles were collected in Czerniawa and Cieplice (two health resorts in Lower Silesia, SW Poland) twice a year in summer and winter season (from July 2006 to February 2008). The palynological spectra represent {{in the vast majority}} local plant communities without a noticeable contribution of long-transported plant particles. Palynological analysis revealed also differences in the specificity of the two sampling areas, i. e. the higher contribution of identified organic material in Czerniawa stands for more natural character of this site, but is also responsible for the higher allergic pressure when compared to Cieplice. The carbon isotopic composition of TSP varied seasonally (ä 13 C value from − 27. 09 in summer to − 25. 47 in winter). The increased ä 13 C value in winter (heating period) is most probably caused by uncontrolled contribution of <b>coal</b> <b>soot.</b> On the basis of isotopic mass balance the calculated contribution of anthropogenic organic particles in the atmosphere reached in winter season 72 % in Czerniawa and 79 % in Cieplice...|$|E
40|$|Characterisation of the {{mechanisms}} {{and consequences of}} global warming {{is one of the}} most important topics in modem science. It requires a detailed investigation of the infrared properties of the constituents of the terrestrial atmosphere: gaseous, particulate and liquid. In this 'thesis Fourier-Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy is Used to pro vi-de data on the absorption and scattering cross sections needed to evaluate the radiative forcing of several substances present in the terrestrial atmosphere. CF 31 is being considered as replacements for some of the highly global warming and ozone depleting gases currently used in industry. High-Resolution FTIR spectra has been recorded for CF 31 over a range of temperatures and pressures and used to calculate approximate values of its global warming potential. Aerosols may affect the terrestrial radiation budget in two ways: i) they may induce global cooling due to scattering and reflection of incident solar radiation and ii) global warming due to absorption of terrestrial infrared radiation. To asses the net contribution of these aerosols one must know the concentration and location of any aerosol and also absorption and scattering coefficients. One method of monitoring the amount of aerosol in the atmosphere is to use satellites such as - the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIP AS) or Meteostat second generation (MSG). Both the satellite retrieval of aerosol concentrations and the calculation of their scattering and absorption coefficients require knowledge of the optical properties of these aerosols. Studying the spectroscopy of aerosols has proven to be a difficult problem since aerosols settle out quickly under the influence of gravity and so have short residence times ID aerosol chambers thus, radiative properties of aerosols provide one of the largest uncertainties in atmospheric modelling. In this thesis an 'acoustic trap' has been developed to counteract gravity allowing us to record spectra of some common atmospheric aerosols: volcanic ash, <b>coal</b> <b>soot</b> and sand. Descriptions of the design of this novel trap and methods for its effective use are presented along with suggestions for further improvements.

In this study toxicity and biodegradation of three types of soot by two soil bacteria strains i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis were compared. Two additives were selected to produce soot samples: (i) commonly used and containing significant quantities of NaCl (40 – 44 %) and copper (Cu-additive), (ii) newly developed without NaCl and with triiron tetraoxide instead of copper (Feadditive). Average number of bacterial colonies was similar when soot produced during combustion without additive and with Feadditive were used. It was about 50 % higher than number of colonies when soot formed with Cu-additive was applied. The soot biodegradation was tested by HS-GC-MS analysis. The highest biodegradation level (about 80 %) was obtained for samples with P. aeruginosa cultures and Fe-additive soot.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a {{class of}} persistent, {{bioaccumulative}} and toxic legacy contaminants found widespread in the environment. Although PCBs were banned in the United States in 1976, reservoirs of PCB-impacted sediments continue to pose risks to ecological and human health today. Sediments are heterogeneous mixtures of many different particle types, such as sand, clay, wood, detritus, <b>coal,</b> <b>soot,</b> and even plastic, and these different particles have varying capacity and affinity for sorbing hydrophobic organic contaminants which leads to PCBs being differentially bioavailable in different matrices. The dominant role of condensed, black carbon particles, such as coal or activated carbon (AC), to strongly sorb PCBs and limit bioavailability, both via aqueous and digestive pathways of exposure, is demonstrated in this body of work using both direct and surrogate measures of bioavailability. The primary objective {{of this research was}} to assess, in a 4 -year long-term monitoring effort, the effectiveness of AC amendment in a freshwater river to reduce bioavailability of PCBs {{at the base of the}} aquatic food web, and to limit diffusive flux from sediments to the overlying water column. After treatment with AC applied at a dose similar to the native organic carbon of sediment, bioaccumulation in freshwater oligochaete worms measured in both laboratory and field exposures was reduced by 62 - 99 % and concentrations of PCBs in water at equilibrium with the sediment was reduced by > 95 % compared to measurements with unamended background sediments in each year. Passive samplers showed that the chemical activities in pore waters of treated sediments were reduced in comparison to untreated sediments and the overlying water, indicating a lower potential for contaminant flux following AC amendment. Furthermore, it was observed that AC aged in sediments for several years in the field was still capable of sorbing additional HOCs, although sorption was attenuated in comparison to fresh AC addition. Overall, this research demonstrates that PCB exposure from moderately contaminated river sediments may be managed effectively through activated carbon amendment to sediments...|$|E
40|$|The {{patterns}} of colour on stone buildings change with time.

Colouring patterns that outline or shadow architectural elements are publicly more acceptable {{than those that}} cut across them e. g. rain streaking.

When soot loading of the ambient air is high, e. g. near busy roads, buildings are dark and typically viewed as unacceptable. However at lower concentrations (2 - 3 &# 206;&# 188;g m - 3 elemental carbon), building appearance is typically seen as more acceptable. The future offers a potential for variation in building colour, arising through different biological growth under changing climates or the presence of different pollutants. In future urban atmospheres more dominated by organic pollutants a yellowing process may be more important. Diesel soot has many organic compounds that can oxidise to brownish-coloured humic-like (HULIS) materials.

As we found previously for natural soils, the ultrasonic energy needed for complete dispersion varies between 450 and 500 J ml(- 1), but the resulting particle size distributions differ from those obtained by standard textural analysis.

Comparing the solid-state N- 15 NMR spectra of plant incubates obtained before and after HF treatment revealed no major alteration of the nitrogen fraction induced by HF.

The calculated high contribution of peptides to the total organic carbon and nitrogen of the samples confirms earlier studies demonstrating that peptide-like material plays a more important role in refractory soil organic matter formation than commonly thought.

Xuan Wei, Beijing and Tai Yuan) (Mumford et al., 1987). 3. 1 <b>Coal</b> smoke and <b>soots</b> from household combustion of coal 3. 1. 1 Whole-body and inhalation exposure (a) Mous...|$|R
50|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200 years after his death. Inhalation of <b>coal</b> dust or <b>soot</b> (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|R
40|$|This {{laboratory}} study uses a novel furnace to resolve nitrogen evolution {{during the three}} stages of pulverized coal combustion: primary devolatilization, secondary pyrolysis, and combustion. The behavior of six coals depicts continuous rank variations, as well as suppressed nitrogen evolution from low volatility coals. During primary devolatilization of any coal, aromatic compounds in tar and oils are virtually the only shuttles for nitrogen out of the coal matrix. The small amounts of HCN observed while primary devolatilization winds down probably come from the char, because char particles are significantly hotter than tar in these experiments. Secondary pyrolysis promotes additional HCN evolution from both char and tar. Moreover, substantial fractions of the volatile-nitrogen from primary devolatilization is reincorporated into a carbonaceous soot matrix for all coal types. The fraction of coal nitrogen incorporated into soot remains constant, even while soot yields dramatically increase. Incorporation of nitrogen into soot {{has the potential to}} substantially reduce the amount of coal nitrogen amenable to aerodynamic NOx abatement strategies for coals with large tar yields. This potential limitation is compounded by another limitation for low volatility coals. Whereas one-half to two-thirds of the coal-nitrogen is expelled by thermal decomposition from other coal types, only 30 to 40 % is expelled from low volatility samples. This tendency suggests that nitrogen functionalities become much more refractory as their surrounding aromatic domains become more extensive, either in high rank <b>coals</b> or <b>soot.</b> For such systems, our measurements indicate {{that the only way to}} expel the nitrogen is to burn it away...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the {{study on the}} extraction of organic compounds (low-molecular weight - diterpenes, high-molecular weight - fullerenes and humic acids) from Handlová brown <b>coal</b> and pyrolytic <b>soot.</b> It was confirmed that the coal extract with a diterpene content - 16 β (H) kaurene was obtained by the supercritical fluid extraction (using CO 2 and modificator - tetrahydrofurane/acetone, 8 : 2 w/w) at T = 90 oC and p = 30 MPa. The occurrence of fullerenes in the toluene extract of solid carbon product has confirmed by the MALDI - TOF - MS and UV-VIS spectroscopy. In the extraction process of GACL (Grinding Aqueous Caustic Leaching) at the concentration of 0. 1 % NaOH, the content of humic acids (HK) in the physically untreated and pretreated sample increased by 6. 09 and 4. 57 times, respectively. In the case of higher leaching agent concentration (2 % NaOH), the content of HK in the physically untreated and pretreated sample increased by 8, 67 and 8, 21 times, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Comunicación oral presentada en la Sesión: Advanced Characterization of Natural Organic Matter NMR and Optical Spectroscopy. [...] Congreso celebrado del 28 - 08 al 1 - 09 de 2005, en Washington, D. C., USA. Soils of {{industrial}} areas in Europe often contain technogenic materials derived from industrial and mining processes, which alter composition and structural {{properties of the}} soil organic matter (SOM) and affect sorption of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC). In the present study several natural SOM, soils with technogenic input and carbonaceous organic material such as <b>soot,</b> <b>coal</b> residues and their combustion remains were characterized by solid state 13 C NMR spectroscopy. The structural properties were related to Freundlich sorption isotherms of different HOC. Structural parameters obtained from advanced 13 C NMR techniques showed distinct differences between natural soils and soils with technogenic input. Dipolar dephasing and variable contact time experiments showed that the basic aromatic structure is composed of clusters with a size of maximal six rings. A significant relationship between sorption of HOC and the proportions of bridged and protonated aromatic domains showed that both aromatic domains are important sorption sites. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSituated in {{the near}} of Schwarze Pumpe power station {{southeast}} of Berlin, Germany, Vattenfall operates a 30  MWth pilot plant in order to investigate the Oxyfuel process. Hitachi Power Europe delivered a DST-burner (DST-Brenner®) for the indirect firing system of the plant which was installed without modifications to the pressure part of the boiler. The combustion behavior during Oxyfuel operation was investigated and optimal burner settings for different operation points were established. The {{results show that the}} burner can be operated {{in a wide range of}} oxygen concentrations in the oxidant gas flow. The burner is characterized by low emissions of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. The high flame stability was found to be unaffected by operational influences such as fluctuations in the coal mass flow, <b>coal</b> quality or <b>soot</b> blowing. Due to the high flame stability the change-over from air blown to Oxyfuel combustion can be realized very easily and is automated. During Oxyfuel operation measurements of temperatures and flue gas species in the flame were performed. The measurement values were compared with the values of the combustion modeling by computational fluid dynamics. The good agreement between both measurement and modeling shows the suitability of the applied models to predict the combustion behavior under Oxyfuel conditions...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining a {{contamination}} {{free sample}} preparation lab for biological 14 C AMS requires {{the same or}} more diligence as a radiocarbon dating prep lab. Isotope ratios of materials routinely range over 4 – 8 orders of magnitude in a single experiment, dosing solutions contain thousands of DPM and gels used to separate proteins possess 14 C ratios of 1 amol 14 C/mg C. Radiocarbon contamination is a legacy of earlier tracer work in most biological laboratories, {{even if they were}} never hot labs. Removable surface contamination can be found and monitored using swipes. Contamination can be found on any surface routinely touched: door knobs, light switches, drawer handles, water faucets. In general, all surfaces routinely touched need to be covered with paper, foil or plastic that can be changed frequently. Shared air supplies can also present problems by distributing hot aerosols throughout a building. Aerosols can be monitored for 14 C content using graphitized <b>coal</b> or fullerene <b>soot</b> mixed with metal powder as an absorber. The monitors can be set out in work spaces for 1 – 2 weeks and measured by AMS with regular samples. Frequent air changes help minimize aerosol contamination in many cases. Cross-contamination of samples can be minimized by using disposable plastic or glassware in the prep lab, isolating samples from the air when possible and using positive displacement pipettors...|$|R
