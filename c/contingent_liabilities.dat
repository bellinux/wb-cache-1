40|$|The recent {{financial}} turmoil {{highlights the}} incentive of highly leveraged financial institutions to take excessive risk, given {{the protection of}} limited liability. During the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} century, many banks operated under liability rules which obligated shareholders to bear larger costs of bank insolvency in the form of contingent, or even unlimited liability. This paper examines the empirical relationship between the size of banks’ <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> and their risk-taking behavior using data on British banks from 1878 - 1912.

40|$|This essay {{examines}} how the Banking Acts of the 1933 and 1935 and related New Deal legislation influenced risk {{taking in the}} financial sector of the U. S. economy. The analysis focuses on <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> of bank owners for losses incurred by their firms and how the elimination of this liability influenced leverage and lending by commercial banks. Using a new panel data set, we find <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> reduced risk taking. In states with <b>contingent</b> <b>liability,</b> banks used less leverage and converted each dollar of capital into fewer loans, and thus could survive larger loan losses (as a fraction of their portfolio) than banks in limited liability states. In states with limited liability, banks took on more leverage and risk, particularly in states that required banks with limited liability to join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the long run, the New Deal replaced a regime of <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> with deposit insurance, stricter balance sheet regulation, and increased capital requirements, shifting the onus of risk management from bankers to state and federal regulators...|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} argued that banks hold an {{insufficient}} amount of capital. Put differently, banks issue too much debt relative to equity. This claim is particularly important because, all else equal, lower levels of capital put banks at greater risk of insolvency. As a result, some have advocated imposing capital requirements on banks. However, even if one accepts the proposition that banks hold too little capital, it does not necessarily follow that the correct policy response is to force banks to hold more capital. An alternative to higher capital requirements is a system in which banks have <b>contingent</b> <b>liability.</b> Under <b>contingent</b> <b>liability,</b> shareholders are liable for at least some portion of depositor losses. This alternative is not unprecedented. Historical evidence from the United States and elsewhere suggest that banks with <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> have more desirable characteristics than those with limited liability and that depositors tend to prefer <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> when given the choice. Successful banking reform should be aimed at re-aligning bank incentives rather than providing new rules for bank behavior...|$|R

Our analysis focuses on <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> of bank owners for losses incurred by their firms and how the elimination of this liability influenced leverage and lending by commercial banks.

40|$|Bank owner <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> {{has been}} {{important}} {{in the development of}} many industrial countries. Unlimited liability on bank owners was an important element in the success of Scottish banking, which led Scotland to be free of the banking and monetary upheavals that occurred in Britain and the United States. The unlimited liability provision effectively minimized the losses suffered by bank noteholders and other creditors. Three factors were vital to the success of unlimited liability in Scotland: 1) the identities of bank owners were made publicly available, and their level of wealth could be verified; 2) under Scottish bankruptcy law, owner liability extended to both personal and inheritable wealth; and 3) the transfer of ownership claims in private and provincial banks required that ownership first be dissolved before a new bank could be formed. A <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> system has three advantages: 1) because double liability imposes postclosure losses on bank stockholders, it increases incentives for banks to hold capital and decreases moral hazard incentives; 2) a <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> system can ameliorate asymmetric information problems between bank creditors and owners; and 3) <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> can lead to more efficient capital formation if potential capital sources are predominantly in the form of fixed wealth, as is true in many developing countries. But a free-rider problem arises when less-wealthy stockholders rely on the monitoring efforts of wealthier stockholders, who have more incentive to monitor. And in a free and anonymous exchange market, investors with less personal fixed wealth will outbid those with greater wealth, so the value of double liability could collapse overtime.

50|$|In {{the less}} common {{unassigned}} case, the defendant or property/casualty insurer retains the periodic payment obligation and funds it by purchasing an annuity {{from a life}} insurance company, thereby offsetting its obligation with a matching asset. The payment stream purchased under the annuity matches exactly, in timing and amounts, the periodic payments agreed to in the settlement agreement. The defendant or property/casualty company owns the annuity and names the claimant as the payee under the annuity, thereby directing the annuity issuer to send payments directly to the claimant. One of the reasons an unassigned case is less popular is that the obligation is not truly off the books, and the defendant or casualty insurer retains a <b>contingent</b> <b>liability.</b> While a default is a rare occurrence, <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> did come into play with the liquidation of Executive Life Insurance Company of New York.

5000|$|The {{term was}} coined by U.S. Treasury {{officials}} {{to describe a}} variety of tax shelters that sought to wipe out taxes on capital gains {{from the sale of}} a business or other appreciated asset; for example, by artificially inflating the basis of a partnership by contributing an asset paired with a <b>contingent</b> <b>liability.</b> The partnership contribution rules at the time ignored the <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> that effectively offset the asset. The result was an inflated basis that allowed the taxpayer to claim a loss from the partnership's subsequent unwinding. The shelters involved creating paper losses to offset real gains.

While capital flows crises are sudden nonlinear events (sudden stops), their likelihood fluctuates over time. The question we address in the paper is how should a country react to these fluctuations. Depending on the hedging possibilities the country faces, the options range from pure self-insurance to hedging the sudden stop jump itself. In between, there is the more likely possibility to hedge the smoother fluctuations in the likelihood of sudden stops. The main contribution of the paper is to provide an analytically and empirically tractable model that allows us to characterize and quantify optimal <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> management in a variety of scenarios. We show, with a concrete example, that the gains from <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> management can easily exceed the equivalent of cutting a country's external liabilities by 10 percent of GDP. *This is a revision of the June 2003 version. ...|$|R
