25|$|A genetic {{discrimination}} is possible but difficult, {{since there are}} only a few genetic characteristics that differentiate dingoes from other domestic dogs. A <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> some scientists from the University of New South Wales developed a relatively reliable method with 20 genetic “fingerprints” using DNA from skin and blood samples to determine the “purity” of a dingo. If one of these “fingerprints” would be found, this would indicate that the examined dog is possibly a hybrid and not a “pure” dingo. The reference group for this test was a group of captive dingoes, thought to cover the whole range of the dingo population. Samples that lay outside of this range would be regarded as hybrids. With increasing development this method might be possible to use on hair and scat samples and provide more exact results.|$|E

6000|$|In other words, {{with a few}} needful qualifications, to be made hereafter, Australia is, so to speak, {{a fossil}} continent, a country still in its {{secondary}} age, a surviving fragment of the primitive world of the chalk period or earlier ages. Isolated from all {{the remainder of the}} earth about the beginning of the tertiary epoch, long before the mammoth and the mastodon had yet dreamt of appearing upon the stage of existence, long before the first shadowy ancestor of the horse had turned tail on nature's rough draft of the still undeveloped and unspecialised lion, long before the extinct dinotheriums and gigantic Irish elks and colossal giraffes of late tertiary times had even begun to run their race on the broad plains of Europe and America, the Australian continent found itself at an early period of its development cut off entirely from all social intercourse with the remainder of our planet, and turned upon itself, like the German philosopher, to evolve its own plants and animals out of its own inner consciousness. The natural consequence was that progress in Australia has been absurdly slow, and that {{the country as a whole}} has fallen most woefully behind the times in all matters pertaining to the existence of life upon its surface.

For many thousand years, with occasional warmer spells, that vast ice-sheet brooded, silent and grim, over {{the face of the}} two continents. Life was extinct as far south as the latitude of New York and London. No plant or animal survived the general freezing. Not a creature broke the monotony of that endless glacial desert. At last, as the celestial cycle came round in due season, fresh conditions supervened. Warmer weather set in, and the ice began to melt. Then the plants and animals of the sub-glacial district were pushed slowly northward by the warmth after the retreating ice-cap. As time went on, the climate of the plains got too hot to hold them. The summer was too much for the glacial types to endure. They remained only on the highest mountain peaks or close to the southern limit of eternal snow. In this way, every isolated range in either continent has its own little colony of arctic or glacial plants and animals, which still survive by themselves, unaffected by intercourse with their unknown and unsuspected fellow-creatures elsewhere.|$|R

The movement grew from the initial 25 wineries to the 21, 000 that participate today in opening their doors to the public, while visitors grew in numbers from a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred, 20 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> to the current 4 to 6 million. Wine tourists can be divided into four main groups: wine tourists by chance, classic wine tourists, talent scouts, and lovers of luxury. Each group is examined according to its consumption, its conduct, and its expectations. Wine tourism in Italy boasts around 170 territorial networks: “Strade del Vino” (wine routes) regulated by law. After an initial pioneer phase during which preexisting wineries adapted to the growing number of tourists, modern-day wineries were created with bespoke areas for the welcoming of visitors. Wineries in Italy can be classified into the following main types: “functional wineries” that concentrate on productive efficiency; “cathedrals” – renovated historic buildings or modern “starchitecture” designs in which esthetics play an important role; wineries with a “strong identity” linked to the owner or wine producer with the special imprint of his or her personal wine making passion. Other features of Italian wine territories such as food and wellness centers not to speak of the ever present cultural heritage also play a part in attracting wine tourists. Lastly, an evaluation is made of business and communication aspects with a specific reference {{to the use of the}} web.

40|$|Background: Understanding the {{principles}} of spiritual care in end-of-life care pertaining to the Indian context is crucial {{for the development of}} an appropriate approach to spiritual care for Indian palliative care. The rich and diverse spiritual and cultural traditions around the care of the dying in the country provide useful resources for such a perception. Aims: This study seeks to examine the features of the care of the dying that were prevalent in the past in South India {{in order to understand the}} values and principles of spiritual care in the care of the dying in India. Methods: Taking a historical-cultural perspective, in-depth oral history interviews were conducted with thirty older adults belonging to different religions and none. Participants were recruited using purposive and snowballing sampling technique from Kanyakumari district, South India. Results: Several religious and cultural care practices that were customary in the care of the dying and beliefs about good death that prevailed over a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decades 40 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> emerged from the data. ‘Union with the divine’, ‘being at peace’ and ‘preserving dignity’ were the three core principles that were found to be at the heart of these practices and beliefs. All these practices and beliefs were found to have meanings and values attached to them that relate to these core principles. Conclusions: Care practices around the care of the dying and beliefs about good death are clearly characterised by spiritual beliefs. Perspectives on the present Indian scenario suggest that the above said principles play a vital role in shaping the current understanding of death and ideas of good death. Considerable contextual changes in the Indian society have caused the breakdown of traditional patterns of intergenerational dissemination of these practices and their meanings making these core principles hard to achieve...|$|R
