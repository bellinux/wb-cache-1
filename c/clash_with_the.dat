5|$|The UK Singles Downloads Chart is {{a weekly}} music chart that ranks the most-downloaded singles in the United Kingdom.

It was compiled using weekly sales from Sunday to Saturday, and was published each Wednesday afternoon, {{so as not to}} <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sunday evening announcement of the UK Singles Chart.|$|E

5|$|The colonial {{impact on}} the Igbo in Achebe's novels is often {{effected}} by individuals from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in No Longer at Ease succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; the temptations of his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude. The courts and the position of District Commissioner in Things Fall Apart likewise <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> traditions of the Igbo, and remove their ability to participate in structures of decision-making.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of the 2004 NRL rookies, including Hunt, had been much anticipated. After a few games, his peers and the media singled Hunt out as the next superstar of the game. To minimise the impact of excessive media pressure on Hunt's performance, Bennett banned him from speaking to the media. Hunt scored four tries in the Round 17 <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> South Sydney Rabbitohs, equalling the team record. His form earned him the Brisbane Broncos and Dally M Rookie of the Year awards.|$|E
5|$|To {{reassure the}} Sector West Croatian Serb population, CANBAT 1 {{performed}} an Operation Backstop exercise and the tasks needed to evacuate NEPBAT in March or April 1993.

Hague felt that if Operation Backstop triggered an armed <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> HV the UNPROFOR would be forced to withdraw through Croatia, exposing the peacekeepers to grave danger.|$|E

5|$|During {{the day on}} September 3, Coulter and the KMAG {{advisers}} {{continued to}} <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ROK 3rd Division commander, who repeatedly attempted to withdraw his troops against their orders. That night, September 3/4, {{the remainder of the}} ROK I Corps front collapsed. Three North Korean T-34 tanks overran a battery of ROK artillery and then scattered two battalions of the newly arrived ROK 5th Regiment. Following a mortar preparation, the North Koreans entered An'gang-ni at 0220. An hour later the command post of the Capital Division withdrew from the town and fighting became increasingly confused. American units disengaged and withdrew and by nightfall, North Koreans held the town and began advancing southward along the railroad.|$|E
5|$|González and Olid {{had arrived}} at an uneasy accord, neither wishing to openly <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other. However, Olid's men outnumbered those of his rival, and González had {{made the mistake of}} {{dividing}} his forces when he had left most of his companions {{on the banks of the}} Dulce river; Olid sent one of his captains, Pedro de Briones, to attack one portion of González' forces, while Olid made ready his ships to sail along the coast and attack other detachments. Briones swiftly weakened González' position and captured about half of his men. At this point, Las Casas' fleet appeared off the coast.|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{the reform}} law, in August 1952, communist-led riots broke out at textile {{factories}} in Kafr el-Dawwar, {{leading to a}} <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> army that left nine people dead. While most of the RCC insisted on executing the riot's two ringleaders, Nasser opposed this. Nonetheless, the sentences were carried out. The Muslim Brotherhood supported the RCC, and after Naguib's assumption of power, demanded four ministerial portfolios in the new cabinet. Nasser turned down their demands and instead hoped to co-opt the Brotherhood by giving two of its members, {{who were willing to}} serve officially as independents, minor ministerial posts.|$|E

5|$|Robson {{was granted}} a wild card in the {{qualifying}} draw for the women's singles of the Australian Open. In her first match, she defeated Sophie Ferguson of Australia. In her second match she lost to Michaëlla Krajicek of the Netherlands. Robson, however, received a wildcard into the main draw of the doubles, partnering Sally Peers. They defeated Craybas and Spears {{to set up a}} second round <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> twelfth seeds Chuang Chia-jung and Květa Peschke, who they beat in straight sets. Peers and Robson won their third round clash with Vera Dushevina of Russia and Anastasia Rodionova of Australia to advance to the quarter-finals, before falling to the No. 15 seeds, Maria Kirilenko and Agnieszka Radwańska.|$|E
5|$|Alboin first {{distinguished}} {{himself on}} the battlefield in a <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Gepids. At the Battle of Asfeld (552), he killed Turismod, son of the Gepid king Thurisind, in a victory {{that resulted in the}} Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers. After the battle, according to a tradition reported by Paul the Deacon, to be granted the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation, he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms. Walter Goffart believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely a typical topos of an epic poem.|$|E
5|$|At the 2003 Women's World Cup in the United States, Germany {{was drawn}} {{in a group}} with Canada, Japan and Argentina. After winning all three group games, the German team {{defeated}} Russia 7–1 in the quarter-final, which set up another <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United States. Germany's Kerstin Garefrekes scored after 15 minutes and goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg made several key saves. In the dying minutes of the semi-final, Maren Meinert and Birgit Prinz sealed the 3–0 win. On 12 October 2003, Germany met Sweden in the World Cup final in Los Angeles. The Scandinavians went ahead before half time, but Maren Meinert equalized shortly after the break. The game went to extra time, where Nia Künzer headed the winning golden goal in the 98th minute to claim Germany's first Women's World Cup title. Birgit Prinz was honoured as the tournament's best player and top goalscorer.|$|E

5|$|From late April 1916, after a German-led Ottoman force {{attacked}} British yeomanry at Katia, British Empire {{forces in}} the region at first doubled from one brigade to two and then grew as rapidly as the developing infrastructure could support them. The construction of the railway and a water pipeline soon enabled an infantry division to join the light horse and mounted rifle brigades at Romani. During the heat of summer, regular mounted patrols and reconnaissance were carried out from their base at Romani, while the infantry constructed an extensive series of defensive redoubts. On 19 July, the advance of a large German, Austrian and Ottoman force across the northern Sinai was reported. From 20 July until the battle began, the Australian 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades took turns pushing out to <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advancing hostile column.|$|E
5|$|Isaac's reign was {{cut short}} by his <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{powerful}} Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Keroularios, who had been instrumental in securing Michael VI's abdication, and the powerful civil aristocracy of the capital. Keroularios and his supporters led the opposition against Isaac's stringent economizing policies, forcing him to resign on 22 November 1059, after which he withdrew to the Stoudios Monastery. The crown then passed to Constantine X Doukas (r. 1059–67), although Bryennios asserts that it was first offered to John, who refused it, despite the pressure of his wife, Anna Dalassene, to accept. According to the historian Konstantinos Varzos, however, this version is suspect, and {{may well be a}} post-fact attempt at legitimizing the eventual usurpation of the throne by John's son, Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118).|$|E
5|$|Many of the weekend's Premier League {{fixtures}} were {{rescheduled to}} avoid a <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> final, with some kicking off at 12:45 on Saturday and others on Sunday. By coincidence, Manchester City and Stoke City were scheduled {{to meet in the}} league on cup final day. The league match was rearranged for the Wednesday after the final. This prompted criticism from Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp, whose team was challenging Manchester City for a place in the 2011–12 Champions League. Redknapp stated that if Manchester City won the final, it would then be in Stoke City's interest to lose against Manchester City in the league match, as it would make Europa League qualification for Stoke more likely. Stoke City refuted this accusation strongly, but ultimately this scenario was avoided. Champions League qualification was settled four days before the final, when Manchester City beat Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 in a league match.|$|E

5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E
5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, {{just four days}} before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E
