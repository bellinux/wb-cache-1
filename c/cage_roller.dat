Techniques with lower costs than conventional undersowing by separate drilling are often regarded as unreliable. Undersowing by drilling after sowing spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was compared with broadcast sowing simultaneously with drilling barley. Various implements were coupled behind the combined drill in cases where seed was broadcast: a press-wheel attachment, a long-tined harrow and a <b>cage</b> <b>roller.</b> A fourth treatment did not include an implement coupled behind the drill. The undersown crop was sown as a seed mixture of 3 kg ha- 1 red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and 6 kg ha- 1 meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Hudson). The numbers of plants and weeds and the plant height were measured five times during the growing season. Above-ground biomass of the undersown species was determined at barley harvest and in late autumn. Grain yield of spring barley was recorded. Drilling resulted in the highest yield of undersown crop when an early summer drought occurred, but broadcasting in combination with use of seed covering equipment led to the least variation in biomass production over the 4 years the experiment was conducted. The relative proportion of meadow fescue in the crop was low in three years, and lower when broadcast than when drilled. Barley grain yield was highest when the seed was broadcast and seed covering equipment was used. Use of a <b>cage</b> <b>roller</b> creased weed biomass, but press-wheels and a long-tined harrow did not.

In the ploughless tillage system, only the herbicide Roundup 360 SL (active substance - glyphosate) was applied after the harvest of the forecrop. In both tillage treatments, spring tillage involved field cultivating {{and the use of}} a tillage assembly consisting of a cultivator, <b>cage</b> <b>roller,</b> and harrow.

40|$|Purpose: In this study, a {{numerical}} simulation {{model of the}} oil spraying system is established. Design/methodology/approach: Spraying lubrication is a common form of the rolling bearing lubrication. Butwith the increase of the bearing speed, the <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> is frequently shattered, which may lead to failure of thebearing. The shatter of <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> {{may be related to}} the spraying mode of oil. For high-speed rolling bearing,the <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> shatter can be cracked due to the shortage of oil, caused by lubricating oil not sprayed into theroller cage shatter. This condition can be ameliorated by changing the spraying mode of oil supply system. Themodel considered the spraying speed, spraying angle, oil pressure, oil viscosity, structure of <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> shatter,rotating speed as the main parameters. By optimization, the best way of oil spraying was obtained which canmeet lubrication requirement of high-speed rolling bearing. At the same time, the numerical simulation resultsalso revealed that the optimal spraying mode is different for different rolling bearings. Findings: The simulating results indicate that due to the effect of the air pressure and airflow thickness, theoptimal spraying position is at a region closer to the inner ring of the bearings. Practical implications: This paper will provide useful information to applying numerical simulation of the oilspraying system.

The momentum balanced drive is rated at 302 rad/sec (2880 rpm) input speed, and dual output torques of 434 N-m (3840 in-lbf).

Each of the differential drives features dual roller-gear or roller arrangements consisting of a sun, four first row planets, four second row planets, and a ring. The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive (DC- 400) has a planetary roller system with a reduction ratio of 24 : 1 with both outputs counterrotating at equal speed.

Outputs are taken from both the <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> and the ring which counterrotate. Test results reported for all three drives include angular and torque ripple (linearity and cogging), viscous and Coulomb friction, and forward and reverse power efficiency. Of the two differential drives, the Differential Roller Drive had better linearity and less cogging than did the Differential Roller-Gear Drive, but it had higher friction and lower efficiency (particularly at low power throughput levels). Use of full preloading rather than a variable preload system in the Differential Roller Drive assessed a heavy penalty in part load efficiency. Maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 % for the Differential Roller-Gear Drive and 86 % for the Differential Roller Drive. The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive performed as expected kinematically. Reduction r-atios to the two counterrotating outputs (design nominal= 24 : 1) were measured to be 23. 98 : 1 and 24. 12 : 1 at zero load [...] At 25 ONm (2200 in-lbf) output torque the ratio changed 2 % due to roller creep. This drive was the smoothest of all three as determined from linearity and cogging tests, and maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 %. The disadvantages of full preloading as comvared to variable preload were apparent in this drive as in the Differential Roller Drive. Efficiencies at part load were low, but improved dramatically with increases in torque. These were consistent with friction measurements which indicated losses primarily from Coulomb friction.

Although being one of the more complicated parts of a tapered roller bearing historically, very little specific engineering has been done to provide a design basis for the cage. This dissertation analyzed specifically the <b>cages</b> from tapered <b>roller</b> bearings as used in the railway industry. ^ Metallurgical testing of cages with cracks has revealed that the failure mode of the cages was fatigue fracture which initiated at the small-end cage pocket. Factors which contributed to the fatigue failure were determined. Analysis included vibration and finite element analysis (FEA). Cages analyzed included 6 1 / 2 x 12 and 7 x 12 steel cages and 6 1 / 2 x 12 plastic cages. ^ The natural frequencies of the cage were determined and then compared to the exciting frequencies of the bearings. Vibrations, internal and external to the bearing, were considered. The magnitude and frequencies of these excitation vibrations were input into the finite element modeling software, Algor, to find response of the cage. It was found that the stresses generated in the small end cage pocket of larger 7 x 12 steel cages were as much as twice that of the 61 / 2 x 12 steel cages. The stress generated at the pocket of the 6 1 / 2 x 12 plastic cage was smaller than the 6 1 / 2 x 12 steel cage. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Multileaf {{collimator}} (MLC) is {{state of}} the art among the radiation field shaping systems for conformal radiotherapy techniques. Some advantages of this system are as follow: reduction of treatment time, higher precision in conforming the radiation field to the projection of the target volume and lowering the chance of errors made by technologists. The purpose of this research was to design and construct the mechanical section of a prototype MLC.   Material and Methods: The MLC consists of a base plate, 52 leaves, 2 leaf carriages, 2 nuts and 52 triangular thread screws. The leaves are arranged in two opposing banks each containing 26 leaves. The carriages are used to extend the movement of the leaves. The components of the MLC are fabricated by machining processes. The MLC is designed to be mounted on the conventional linear accelerators as an add-on accessory. The leaves were made of aluminum. The dimensions of the leaves are 5 x 200 x 50 mm.   Result: The collimator system weighs approximately 37 kg excluding the leaves. The projected width of each leaf on the isocenter of a Varian linear accelerator is 10 mm. The movement of the leaves is accomplished by using the triangular thread screws. The screws required to have a low axial backlash which in turn results in lower precision positioning of the leaves. The positioning accuracy of each leaf is approximately 1. 4 mm. Discussion and Conclusion: Mashhad MLC system, in it’s present form and design weighs 37 kg. but if Aluminum blades are replaced by tungsten ones then the over all weights of MLC may exceed the weight limit a linac may hold. Therefore futher modifications are required to reduce the MLC total weight. It is desirable to use ball screws and <b>roller</b> <b>cages</b> instead of triangular thread screws to achive a higher positioning pereision of the blade...|$|R
