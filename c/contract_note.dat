50|$|Derivatives {{transactions}} are usually entered into orally or electronically and the contract {{between the parties}} is formed at this time. The evidence {{of the terms of}} the transaction is contained in a confirmation (also known as a trading advice or <b>contract</b> <b>note),</b> usually a short letter, fax or email. The form of the confirmation is set out in the Master Agreement and a limited period of time is usually allowed for objections or amendments to the confirmation after its receipt. Confirmations are usually very short (except for complex transactions) and contain little more than dates, amounts, and rates. Confirmations are exchanged to minimise the possibility of a dispute as to the terms of a transaction occurring.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{additional}} features (usually offered by banks) are as follows. Some DPs offer a frequent-trader account, where they charge frequent traders at lower rates than the standard charges. Demat account holders are generally required to pay the DP an advance fee for each account that will be adjusted against the various service charges. The account holder needs to raise the balance when it falls below a certain amount prescribed by the DP. However, if the holders also hold a savings account with the DP, they can provide a debit authorisation to the DP for paying this charge. Finally, once choosing a DP, it would be prudent to keep all accounts with that DP, so that tracking of capital gains liability is easier. This is because when calculating capital gains tax, the period of holding {{will be determined by}} the DP, and different DPs follow different methods. For instance, ICICI Bank uses the first in first out (FIFO) method to compute the period of holding. The proof of the cost of acquisition will be the <b>contract</b> <b>note.</b> The computation of capital gains is done account-wise.|$|E

5000|$|While {{working with}} the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on the sequel project, and with the asset manager, LGT A/M, Mr. Karat cites the reason for {{developing}} the system as simple. The process before STP was very antiquated: sales traders would have to fill in a deal ticket, blue for buy and red for sell. The order was invariably scribbled and mostly unreadable. Upon receiving the order, the trader would execute on the market a usually incorrect investment. The runner picking up the ticket (in this case, Mr Karat) would input the order into the system to send out a <b>contract</b> <b>note.</b> For example, if the client wished to purchase 100,000 shares, but the trader only executed 10,000, the runner would send out the contract for 1,000. In those days, there was a T10 settlement so any errors were [...] "fixable". However, with the new introduction of T5, the settlement arena changed, and STP was born. Mr. Karat realised that to reduce the exposure of risk, failed settlement, there could only be one [...] "golden source" [...] of information and that the onus was on the sales trader to be correct as he/she {{had the power to}} correct any discrepancies with the client directly.|$|E
30|$|A minimal no-arbitrage {{requirement}} for an underlying market model {{is that it}} should be arbitrage-free with respect to the null <b>contract.</b> <b>Note</b> that, consistently with Assumption 3 and the concept of replication (for the general formulation of replication of a non-null contract, see Definition 18), it is implicitly assumed in Definition 10 that the price at which the null contract is traded at time zero equals zero.

30|$|We {{also asked}} {{additional}} questions {{to individuals who}} {{by the time of}} the interview had eventually obtained a job through the program (treated) or were using alternative channels (for the untreated). In particular, we asked whether before applying to the ICS program, they had the opportunity to collaborate with the firm that eventually hired them. In the event of a positive answer, they were asked what type of relationship they had. Among the (female) treated, 64 % answered positively to the first question; conversely, when the same question was asked to the non-treated individuals who eventually found a job without program support, this percentage drops to 6 %. Moreover, when asked about the type of collaboration they had with the firm before applying for the ICS policy, 93 % of the interviewed sample refused to answer, whereas among the very few that gave an answer, 5 % declared that they had been working under an informal employment <b>contract.</b> <b>Note</b> that the high rejection rate observed for this question has an easy explanation because in theory: it was possible to infer from their answers the firms that had behaved illegally.|$|E
