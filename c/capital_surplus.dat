25|$|One {{narrative}} {{for explaining}} {{the economic and}} budgetary performance during President Obama's tenure uses sectoral balances. By definition, a country running a trade deficit (<b>capital</b> <b>surplus)</b> and where private savings exceeds business investment (private sector surplus) must run a government budget deficit, as the three must net to zero. Both Martin Wolf and Paul Krugman explained that as the Great Recession hit, the saving (deleveraging) {{of the private sector}} significantly increased, while business investment declined in the face of reduced consumer spending. This created an enormous private sector surplus. Since the trade deficit did not change significantly, the offset was a large increase in the government budget deficit. The record drop in tax revenue and large increases in automatic stabilizer expenditures (such as unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments) were the mechanism for much of the additional deficit and debt increases, even before new economic policies were implemented. The significant reduction in demand implied by the increase in the private sector surplus (i.e., consumers and businesses saving rather than spending or investing) created a severe recession.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} {{fiscal balance}} {{is one of}} three major financial sectoral balances in the national economy, the others being the foreign financial sector and the private financial sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by definition. Hence, a foreign financial surplus (or <b>capital</b> <b>surplus)</b> exists because capital is imported (net) to fund the trade deficit. Further, there is a private sector financial surplus due to household savings exceeding business investment. By definition, there must therefore exist a government budget deficit so all three net to zero. The government sector includes federal, state and local. For example, the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal), offsetting a <b>capital</b> <b>surplus</b> of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of 6% GDP.|$|E

50|$|The {{translation}} of trade deficits to budget deficits works through sectoral balances. Greece ran current account (trade) deficits averaging 9.1% GDP from 2000-2011. By definition, a trade deficit requires capital inflow (mainly borrowing) to fund; this {{is referred to}} as a <b>capital</b> <b>surplus</b> or foreign financial surplus. This can drive higher levels of government budget deficits, if the private sector maintains relatively even amounts of savings and investment, as the three financial sectors (foreign, government, and private) by definition must balance to zero.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{par value}} {{was such an}} {{unreliable}} indicator of the actual value of stock, and because high par values could create liability for investors if the corporation went into bankruptcy, corporate lawyers began advising their clients to issue stocks with low par values.

50|$|Lending-limit {{regulations}} {{restrict the}} total amount of loans and credits that a bank may extend to a single borrower.

Both federal and state laws generally allow for a higher lending limit (up to 25% of <b>capital</b> and <b>surplus</b> for national banks) when the portion of the credit that exceeds the initial lending limit is fully secured.|$|R
