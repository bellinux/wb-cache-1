25|$|Emmaus {{was settled}} in the 1740s and dates its {{founding}} to 1759. For approximately 100 years, until the mid-19th century, it was a <b>closed</b> <b>community</b> of the Moravian Church. The original land on which the town now lies was donated by Sebastian Heinrich Knauss and Jacob Ehrenhardt {{for use by the}} Moravian church. The founders and original residents of the town were members of the Lutheran and Reformed faiths, who joined the Moravian church when their own denominations were unable to provide ministers. Emmaus was one of the four leading Moravian communities in the northeast United States {{at the time of its}} founding; Bethlehem, PA, Lititz, PA and Nazareth, PA were the three others.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s, British metalheads {{coalesced}} into a <b>closed</b> <b>community</b> {{of peers}} that exalted power and celebrated masculinity. According to Deena Weinstein's analysis, their male camaraderie and the general absence of women in their ranks did not turn into machismo and misogyny. In the same article, she wrote that British heavy metal: [...] "is not racist, despite its uniformly white performers, and its lyrics are devoid of racial references." [...] Another characteristic of the subculture was its latent homophobia, less violent, but not dissimilar to British skinheads' disposition; in his book Running with the Devil: Power, Gender and Madness in Heavy Metal Music, Robert Walser calls it a [...] "collective affirmation of heterosexuality", and in a journal British sociologist John Clarke regards it as [...] "a reaction against the erosion of traditionally available stereotypes of masculinity".|$|E

60|$|The billiard-room at the Green Dragon was the {{constant}} resort {{of a certain}} set, most of whom, like our acquaintance Mr. Bambridge, were regarded as men of pleasure. It was here that poor Fred Vincy had made part of his memorable debt, having lost money in betting, and been obliged to borrow of that gay companion. It was generally known in Middlemarch that {{a good deal of}} money was lost and won in this way; and the consequent repute of the Green Dragon as a place of dissipation naturally heightened in some quarters the temptation to go there. Probably its regular visitants, like the initiates of freemasonry, wished that there were something a little more tremendous to keep to themselves concerning it; but they were not a <b>closed</b> <b>community,</b> and many decent seniors as well as juniors occasionally turned into the billiard-room {{to see what was going}} on. Lydgate, who had the muscular aptitude for billiards, and was fond of the game, had once or twice in the early days after his arrival in Middlemarch taken his turn with the cue at the Green Dragon; but afterwards he had no leisure for the game, and no inclination for the socialities there. One evening, however, he had occasion to seek Mr. Bambridge at that resort. The horsedealer had engaged to get him a customer for his remaining good horse, for which Lydgate had determined to substitute a cheap hack, hoping by this reduction of style to get perhaps twenty pounds; and he cared now for every small sum, as a help towards feeding the patience of his tradesmen. To run up to the billiard-room, as he was passing, would save time.|$|E
