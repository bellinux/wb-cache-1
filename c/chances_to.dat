5|$|During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France {{chose to}} have their heirs {{apparent}} crowned during their own lifetime {{in order to avoid}} succession disputes. This practice was later adopted by Angevin Kings of England, Kings of Hungary and other European monarchs. From the moment of their coronation, the heirs were regarded as junior kings (rex iunior), but they exercised little power and historically {{were not included in the}} numbering of monarchs if they predeceased their fathers. The nobility disliked this custom, as it reduced their <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> benefit from a possible succession dispute.|$|E

Hokie quarterback Sean Glennon threw three interceptions and fumbled the ball once, giving Georgia {{excellent}} field position and many <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> score.

The Hokies closed the gap to 31–24 with a late field goal, but Georgia's defense held and the Bulldogs clinched the victory.|$|E

5|$|In a {{retrospective}} Virtual Console review, IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commended the gameplay depth and the detailed visual presentation. He acknowledged the difficulty, even on easy, but praised {{the game as}} one of the best examples of the niche shooting gallery genre. Mat Allen of Nintendo Life found the game to be an excellent example of what the Virtual Console is for: providing gamers <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> experience quality games that were overlooked in their time. He highlighted the release as providing a cheap option to play a game which has become an expensive collector's item.|$|E

5|$|Most Polish historians {{agree that}} the Polish {{capitulation}} was a mistake both from the military perspective, and the political one. In the realm of military, the Poles had reasonable <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> defend the Vistula river line, and exhaust the Russian invading forces.

5|$|Since 1990, {{only four}} {{pitchers}} {{have joined the}} 300win club: Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Johnson. Changes in {{the game in the}} last decade of the 20th century have made attaining 300career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20thcentury. The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened year for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E

5|$|A pair of aces {{gives the}} {{blackjack}} player a starting hand value of either a 2 or a soft 12 {{which is a}} problematic starting hand in either case. Splitting aces gives a player two <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> hit 21. Splitting aces is so favorable to the player that most gambling establishments have rules limiting the player's rights to do so. In most casinos the player is only allowed to draw one card on each split ace. As a general rule, a ten on a split ace (or vice versa) is not considered a natural blackjack and does not get any bonus. Prohibiting resplitting and redoubling is also common. Regardless of the payout for blackjack, the rules for resplitting, the rules for doubling, the rules for multiple card draws and the dealer's cards, one should always split aces.|$|E
