60|$|Again: in {{his office}} as {{governor}} of the men employed by him, the merchant or manufacturer is invested with a distinctly paternal authority and responsibility. In most cases, a youth entering a <b>commercial</b> <b>establishment</b> is withdrawn altogether from home influence; his master must become his father, else he has, for practical and constant help, no father at hand: in all cases the master's authority, together with the general tone and atmosphere of his business, and {{the character of the}} men with whom the youth is compelled in the course of it to associate, have more immediate and pressing weight than the home influence, and will usually neutralize it either for good or evil; so that the only means which the master has of doing justice to the men employed by him is to ask himself sternly whether he is dealing with such subordinate as he would with his own son, if compelled by circumstances to take such a position.|$|E

6000|$|Agreeable to appointment, I went next to Bailie Nicol Jarvie's, where a {{comfortable}} morning's repast was arranged in the parlour, {{which served as}} an apartment of all hours, and almost all work, to that honest gentleman. The bustling and benevolent magistrate had been {{as good as his}} word. I found my friend Owen at liberty, and, conscious of the refreshments and purification of brush and basin, was of course a very different person from Owen a prisoner, squalid, heart-broken, and hopeless. Yet the sense of pecuniary difficulties arising behind, before, and around him, had depressed his spirit, and the almost paternal embrace which the good man gave me, was embittered by a sigh of the deepest anxiety. And when he sate down, the heaviness in his eye and manner, so different from the quiet composed satisfaction which they usually exhibited, indicated that he was employing his arithmetic in mentally numbering up the days, the hours, the minutes, which yet remained as an interval between the dishonour of bills and the downfall of the great <b>commercial</b> <b>establishment</b> of Osbaldistone and Tresham. It was left to me, therefore, to do honour to our landlord's hospitable cheer--to his tea, right from China, which he got in a present from some eminent ship's-husband at Wapping--to his coffee, from a snug plantation of his own, as he informed us with a wink, called Saltmarket Grove, in the island of Jamaica--to his English toast and ale, his Scotch dried salmon, his Lochfine herrings, and even to the double-damask table-cloth, [...] "wrought by no hand, as you may guess," [...] save that of his deceased father the worthy Deacon Jarvie.|$|E
