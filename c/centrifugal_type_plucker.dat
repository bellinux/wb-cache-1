In this research, the behavior and mechanism of CO 2 reaction under various grinding conditions were investigated to fix and reduce CO 2.

Furthermore, the CO 2 adsorption increased with the decrease in the standard free energy of formation of each metal oxide.

Normally, BFP is high pressure unit that takes suction from condensate return system and can be of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>type</b> pump. In <b>centrifugal</b> pump, water enters axially through the impeller eyes and exits radially. Generally, electric motor is used as prime mover to run the feed pump. To force water into boiler, the pump must generate sufficient pressure to overcome steam pressure developed by boiler. In the present study, design and analysis of boiler feed pump having a flow of 2000 m 3 /hr, head of 470 m and operating at 130 ± 10 o C has been taken up. The various pump parameters are obtained from design and pump model is developed using modelling software Creo Parametric. To evaluate the results at given operating conditions, CFD analysis is carried out using Ansys CFX module. Blade number has great influence on the pump performance. Therefore, CFD analyses are carried out for the pump with 5, 6 and 7 blades. Based on performance of every pump model, the best feed pump design is selected. A steady state CFD analysis is carried out using the K-ε turbulence model to solve for the Navier-Stroke’s equation. Keywords- feed pump, pump design, CFD analysis, pump performance. I...|$|R
