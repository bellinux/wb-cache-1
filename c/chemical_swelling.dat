40|$|International audienceSilicon carbide-based {{refractory}} castables (SiC-RC) {{have high}} mechanical and chemical resistances at high temperature. Nevertheless when subjected to both high temperature and aggressive oxidizing environment, due to phase transformation, a chemical strain appears {{that leads to}} additional stresses in industrial parts and may cause degradation. In this paper, macroscopic constitutive equations are proposed to model the complex relationship between stress, strain, temperature and oxidizing atmosphere in porous SiC-RC. To model the kinetics of the <b>chemical</b> <b>swelling,</b> oxygen content in the porosity of the heterogeneous material is estimated.

40|$|Shale {{instability}} {{is one of}} {{the ongoing}} major problems when drilling oil/gas wellbores. The interaction of aqueous drilling fluids or fracturing fluids, with reactive clay minerals in shales causes swelling, in turn causing costly wellbore instabilities. In this study, the swelling of compacted commercial Na-bentonite clay mineral cores was investigated using a novel non-contact displacement meter with various organic solvents and salt solutions as the electrolyte. Swelling results with organic solvents were correlated with the dielectric constant, dipole moment, surface tension and viscosity of the solvent. It was found that swelling rate and total swelling were proportional to dielectric constant and inversely proportional to viscosity, representing the chemical and capillary components of swelling, respectively. Results of swelling tests with salt solutions are discussed in the context of diffuse double layer (DDL) theory. Swelling behaviour of smectite clay minerals were found to be highly affected by cation concentration. Tests with CaCl 2 solutions showed that divalent cations were effective at suppressing swelling at low concentrations. At high concentrations KCl and KI solutions were more effective at inhibiting swelling owing to the lower hydration enthalpy of K+ cations. Repeats of selected tests with non-swelling illite rich shale compacted cores were compared with the swelling Na-bentonite clay mineral compacted cores. Comparison between Na-bentonite and illite swelling shows that, for reconstituted compacted cores, the initial stage of clay swelling is dominated by capillary action. Then, depending on the reactivity of the clay and the medium, <b>chemical</b> <b>swelling</b> occurs. Consequently, the swelling behaviour of compacted clay cores, as used by many drilling fluid research laboratories, is highly dependent on the domination of different swelling components in different time periods as an artefact of the sample preparation and care should be taken when using ground and compacted shales to assess either reactivity of shale formations to drilling fluids or the effectiveness of swelling inhibitor systems...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} deformation mechanisms and responsiveness {{associated with the}} wrinkling, folding, and snapping of thin polymer films. We demonstrated the use of elastic instabilities in confined regimes, such as the crumpling and snapping of surface attached sheets. We gained fundatmental insight into a thin film 2 ̆ 7 s ability to localize strain. By taking advantage of geometric strain localization {{we were able to}} develop new strategies for responsive surfaces that will have a broad impact on adhesive, optical, and patterning applications. ^ Using the rapid closure of the Venus flytrap 2 ̆ 7 s leaflets as dictated by the onset of a snap instability as motivation, we created surfaces with patterned structures to transition through a snap instability at a prescribed stress state. This mechanism causes surface topography to change over large lateral length scales and very short timescales. Changes in the stress state can be related to triggers such as <b>chemical</b> <b>swelling,</b> light-induced architecture transitions, mechanical pressure, or voltage. The primary advantages of the snap transition are that the magnitude of change, the rate of change, and the sensitivity to change can be dictated by a balance of materials properties and geometry. The patterned structures that exhibit these dynamics are elastomeric shells that geometrically localize strain and can snap between concave and convex curvatures. We have demonstrated the control of the microlens shell geometry and that the transition time follows scaling relationships presented for the Venus flytrap. Furthermore, the microlens arrays have been demonstrated as surfaces that can alter wettability. ^ Using a similar novel processing technique, microarrays of freestanding elastomeric plates were placed in equibiaxial compression to fabricate crumpled morphologies with strain localized regions that are difficult to attain through traditional patterning techniques. The microstructures that form can be initially described using classical plate buckling theory for circular plates under an applied compressive strain. Upon the application of increasing compressive strain, axisymmetric microstructures undergo a secondary bifurcation into highly curved, nonaxisymmetric structures. The inherent interplay between geometry and strain in these systems provides a mechanism for generating responsiveness in the structures. By swelling the elastomeric plates with a compatible solvent, we demonstrated the microstructures ability to reversibly switch between axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric geometries. ^ To further explore the localization of strain in materials, we have fabricated sharply folded films of glassy, homogenous polymers directly on rigid substrates. The films were uniaxially compressed and buckle after delaminating from the substrate. As the applied strain is increased, we observed strain localization {{at the center of the}} delaminated features. We found that normally brittle, polystyrene films can accommodate excessive compressive strains without fracture by undergoing these strain localizing fold events. This technique provided a unique way to examine the curvature and stability of folded features, but was not adequate for understanding the onset of folding. ^ By taking thin films, either glassy or elastomeric, and simply lifting them from the surface of water, we observed and quantified the wrinkle-to-fold transition in an axisymmetric geometry. The films initially wrinkle as they are lifted with a wavelength that is determined by the film thickness and material properties. The wrinkle-to-fold transition is analogous to the transition observed in uniaxially compressed films, but the axisymmetric geometry caused the fold to act as a disclination that increased the radial stress in the film, thereby decreasing the wavelength of the remaining wrinkles. Further straining the films caused the remaining wrinkles to collapse into a discrete number of folds that is independent of film thickness and material properties. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the fabrication methodology of polymeric photonic crystals operating in the visible to near infrared regions and the correlation between the chemical deposition morphologies and the resultant photonic stopband enhancements of photonic crystals. Multiphoton lithography (MPL) is a powerful approach to the fabrication of polymeric 3 D micro- and nano-structures with a typical minimum feature size ~ 200 nm. The completely free-form 3 D fabrication capability of MPL is very well suited to the formation of tailored photonic crystals (PCs), including structures containing well defined defects. Such structures are of considerable current interest as micro-optical devices for their filtering, stop-band, dispersion, resonator, or waveguiding properties. More specifically, the stop-band characteristics of polymer PCs can be finely controlled via nanoscale changes in rod spacings and the chemical functionalities at the polymer surface can be readily utilized to impart new optical properties. Nanoscale features as small as 65 ± 5 nm have been formed reproducibly by using 520 nm femtosecond pulsed excitation of a 4, 4 '-bis(di-n-butylamino) biphenyl chromophore to initiate crosslinking in a triacrylate blend. Dosimetry studies of the photoinduced polymerization were performed on chromophores with sizable two-photon absorption cross-sections at 520 and 730 nm. These studies show that sub-diffraction limited line widths are obtained in both cases with the lines written at 520 nm being smaller. Three-dimensional multiphoton lithography at 520 nm has been used to fabricate polymeric woodpile photonic crystal structures that show stop bands in the visible to near-infrared spectral region. 85 ± 4 nm features were formed using swollen gel photoresist by 730 nm excitation MPL. An index matching oil was used to induce <b>chemical</b> <b>swelling</b> of gel resists prior to MPL fabrication. When swollen matrices were subjected to multiphoton excitation, a similar excitation volume is achieved as in normal unswollen resins. However, upon deswelling of the photoresist following development a substantial reduction in feature size was obtained. PCs with high structural fidelity across 100 µm × 100 µm × 32 layers exhibited strong reflectivity (> 60 % compared to a gold mirror) in the near infrared region. The positions of the stop-bands were tuned by varying the swelling time, the exposure power (which modifies the feature sizes), and the layer spacing between rods. Silver coatings have been applied to PCs with a range of coverage densities and thicknesses using electroless deposition. Sparse coatings resulted in enhanced reflectivity for the stop band located at ~ 5 µm, suggesting improved interface reflectivity inside the photonic crystal due to the Ag coating. Thick coatings resulted in plasmonic bandgap behavior with broadband reflectivity enhancement and PC lattice related bandedge at 1. 75 µm. Conformal titania coatings were grown onto the PCs via a surface sol-gel method. Uniform and smooth titania coatings were achieved, resulting in systematically red-shifted stopbands from their initial positions with increasing thicknesses, corresponding to the increased effective refractive index of the PC. High quality titania shell structures with modest stopbands were obtained after polymer removal. Gold replica structures were obtained by electroless deposition on the silica cell walls of naturally occurring diatoms and the subsequent silica removal. The micron-scaled periodic hole lattice originated from the diatom resulted in surface plasmon interferences when excited by infrared frequencies. The hole patterns were characterized and compared with hexagonal hole arrays fabricated by focused ion beam etching of similarly gold plated substrate. Modeling of the hole arrays concluded that while diatom replicas lack long-ranged periodicity, the local hole to hole spacings were sufficient to generate enhanced transmission of 13 % at 4. 2 µm. The work presented herein is a step towards the development of PCs with new optical and chemical functionalities. The ability to rapidly prototype polymeric PCs of various lattice parameters using MPL combined with facile coating chemistries to create structures with the desired optical properties offers a powerful means to produce tailored high performance photonic crystal devices.

Pore water salinity was found to have minor consequences on the mechanical behavior of the material at its intact state and at the original calcite content.

40|$|Microcantilevers {{were first}} {{introduced}} as imaging probes in Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) {{due to their}} extremely high sensitivity in measuring surface forces. The versatility of these probes, however, allows the sensing and measurement {{of a host of}} mechanical properties of various materials. Sensor parameters such as resonance frequency, quality factor, amplitude of vibration and bending due to a differential stress can all be simultaneously determined for a cantilever. When measuring the mechanical properties of materials, identifying and discerning the most influential parameters responsible for the observed changes in the cantilever response are important. We will, therefore, discuss the effects of various force fields such as those induced by mass loading, residual stress, internal friction of the material, and other changes in the mechanical properties of the microcantilevers. Methods to measure variations in temperature, pressure, or molecular adsorption of water molecules are also discussed. Often these effects occur simultaneously, increasing the number of parameters that need to be concurrently measured to ensure the reliability of the sensors. We therefore systematically investigate the geometric and environmental effects on cantilever measurements including the chemical nature of the underlying interactions. To address the geometric effects we have considered cantilevers with a rectangular or circular cross section. The chemical nature is addressed by using cantilevers fabricated with metals and/or dielectrics. Selective <b>chemical</b> etching, <b>swelling</b> or changes in YoungÃ¢Â€Â™s modulus of the surface were investigated by means of polymeric and inorganic coatings. Finally to address the effect of the environment in which the cantilever operates, the Knudsen number was determined to characterize the molecule-cantilever collisions. Also bimaterial cantilevers with high thermal sensitivity were used to discern the effect of temperature variations. When appropriate, we use continuum mechanics, which is justified according to the ratio between the cantilever thickness and the grain size of the materials. We will also address other potential applications such as the ageing process of nuclear materials, building materials, and optical fibers, which can be investigated by monitoring their mechanical changes with time. In summary, by virtue of the dynamic response of a miniaturized cantilever shaped material, we present useful measurements of the associated elastic properties...|$|R
40|$|A {{major concern}} in the {{development}} of hot dry rock (HDR) and hot fractured rock (HFR) reservoirs is achieving and maintaining adequate injectivity, while avoiding the development of preferential short-circuiting flow paths such as those caused by thermally-induced stress cracking. Past analyses of HDR and HFR reservoirs have tended to focus primarily on the coupling between hydrology (flow), heat transfer, and rock mechanics. Recent studies suggest that rock-fluid interactions and associated mineral dissolution and precipitation effects could {{have a major impact on}} the long-term performance of HFR reservoirs. The present paper uses recent European studies as a starting point to explore chemically-induced effects of fluid circulation in HFR systems. We examine ways in which the chemical composition of reinjected waters can be modified to improve reservoir performance by maintaining or even enhancing injectivity. Chemical manipulations considered here include pH modification and dilution with fresh water. We performed coupled thermo-hydrologic-chemical simulations in which the fractured medium was represented by a one-dimensional MINC model (multiple interacting continua), using the non-isothermal multi-phase reactive geochemical transport code TOUGHREACT. Results indicate that modifying the injection water chemistry can enhance mineral dissolution and reduce clay <b>swelling.</b> <b>Chemical</b> interactions between rocks and fluids will change a HFR reservoir over time, with some changes favorable and others not. A detailed, quantitative understanding of processes and mechanisms can suggest chemical methods for reservoir management, which may be employed to improve the performance of the geothermal system...|$|R
40|$|During {{a survey}} of black cotton soil zones of Karnataka, indigenously {{stabilized}} black cotton soil deposits were encountered in Belgaum, Bijapur, Bagalkot and Gadag Districts of Karnataka. These modified black cotton soils have low swelling and negligible shrinkage tendencies. Owing to their low volume change potential on moisture content changes, these soils are widely preferred in earth construction activities. The exact origin of these modified black cotton soil deposits is not known. According to anecdotal references, these soils were prepared by mixing unknown proportions of wood ash, organic matter and black cotton soil and allowing them to age for unknown periods of time. As wood-ash was apparently used in their preparation, these modified black cotton soils {{are referred to as}} ash-modified soils (AMS) in the thesis. The practice of preparing ash-modified soils is no longer pursued in black cotton soil regions of Karnataka and the available supply of this indigenously stabilized soil is being fast depleted. Also, attempts have not been made to characterize the physico-chemical and engineering properties of AMS deposits of Karnataka. Given the widespread utilization of ash-modified soils in black cotton soil areas of Karnataka, {{there is a need to}} understand their physico-chemical and engineering behaviour and the physico-chemical mechanisms responsible for their <b>chemical</b> modification. <b>Swelling</b> and shrinkage of expansive soil deposits are cyclic in nature due to periodic climatic changes. Chemically stabilized black cotton soil deposits are also expected to experience cyclic wetting and drying due to seasonal climatic changes. The impact of cyclic wetting and drying on the swelling behaviour of natural expansive soils is well-documented. However, the impact of alternate wetting and drying on the swelling behaviour of admixture stabilized expansive soils (these include natural - ash-modified soils and laboratory - lime stabilized black cotton soils) has not been examined. Such a study would be helpful to assess the long term behaviour of admixture stabilized soils in field situations. To achieve the above objectives, experiments are performed that study: 1. The physico-chemical and engineering properties of ash-modified soils from different Districts of Karnataka. The physico-chemical and engineering properties of natural black cotton soil (BCS) specimens from locations adjacent to ash-modified soil deposits are also examined to understand and evaluate the changes in the engineering characteristics of the ash-modified soils due to addition of admixtures. 2.

The influence of cyclic wetting and drying on the wetting induced volume changebehaviour of admixture stabilized black cotton soils, namely, ash-modified blackcotton soils and lime stabilized black cotton soils...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the main}} {{application}} of reverse osmosis (RO) filtration remains the separation or concentration of electrolytes from aqueous solvents (e. g. desalination), new promising applications including the recycling or purification of organic-rich effluents used in fermentation processes (bio-ethanol and other biofuel productions). Currently, no model exists to predict a priori the selectivity of given RO (mostly in aromatic polyamide) membrane to non-electrolyte organic compounds, such as non-dissociated acids, aldehydes, esters or aromatic compounds. The complication arises {{due to the}} mutual diffusion of water and small solutes within membrane, whose swelling {{is controlled by the}} stiffness of polymer segments and their cross-linking rates. The general objective {{of this study is to}} build atomistic-scale models of typical commercial aromatic polyamide (APA) membranes in order to analyze the contribution of their polymer <b>chemical</b> structure on <b>swelling</b> rate to water and on mutual diffusion mechanisms in the bulk. As APA membranes are polymerized in-situ as approximately 200 nm thick layer, our computational effort was combined with experimental isolation and deformulation of two commercial APA membranes (references: ESPA 2 and CPA 2, Hydranautics Membranes, USA) to provide both i) initial assumptions to build the atomistic model (monomers composition, average cross-linking rate, approximate swelling rate) and ii) independent reference data to validate the generated model at different relative humidity (X-ray structure factors). The active APA layer was separated from support by removing iteratively each support layer with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Macroscopic properties such as swelling rates, sorption isotherms were assessed by ellipsometry and Intelligent Gravimetric Analyser respectively. A maximum swelling rate of 38 % was determined. A cross-linking rate of 65 % was inferred from chemical composition analyses in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated-total reflection mode Fourier transform IR (ATR-FTIR). A first atomistic model including the number of desired monomers and water content was built by a conventional compression box technique and classical molecular dynamics code (Discover, Accelrys, San-Diego). Cross-linking was subsequently performed by applying a specific reactive force-field within our own software. The degree of freedoms were i) the initial ratios in monomers (benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarbonyle chloride with a connectivity of 3, benzene- 1, 3 -diamine with a connectivity of 2), ii) the initial length of block-oligomers (ranging from 5 to 62). Each system was finally equilibrated during long-term isobaric and isothermal molecular dynamics simulations at 600 K and 298 K. Final structure factors were in good agreement with RX scattering spectra...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the effect of pre-treatment and modification processes on the properties of hemp cellulose fibre for biopolymer composites application. Hemp fibres have been modified by various extraction, <b>swelling,</b> <b>chemical</b> and enzymatic treatments. The morphology and mechanical properties of the modified fibres have been measured. Biopolymer composites have been prepared using the modified fibres and matrices of cellulose acetate butyrate and cellulose solutions derived from hemp. The first fibre treatment employed was acetone extraction and mercerization. A low pressure acrylonitrile grafting initiated by azo-bis-isobutylonitrile was performed using alkali treated fibre. The AN grafted fibres had no transformation of crystalline structure as observed after mercerization. The mechanical properties performed by a single fibre test method were strongly influenced by the cellulose structure, lateral index of crystallinity, and fraction of grafting. Bioscouring of hemp using pectate lyase (EC 4. 2. 2. 2), Scourzyme L, was performed. Greater enzyme concentration and a longer treatment improved the removal of the low methoxy pectin component. Removal of pectate caused no crystalline transformation in the fibres, except for a slight decline in the X-ray crystalline order index. Smooth surfaces and separated fibres were evidence of successful treatment. The shortening of fibre by grinding and ball-milling was introduced to achieve a desired fibre size. An increase in the milling duration gradual ly destroyed the crystalline structure of the cellulose fibres. An increase in solvent polarity, solvent-fibre ratio, agitation speed and drying rate resulted in the rearrangement of the ball-milled cellulose crystalline structure to a greater order. The thermal degradation behaviour of hemp fibres was investigated by using TGA. The greater activation energy of treated hemp fibre compared with untreated fibre represented an increase in purity and improvement of structural order. The all hemp cellulose composites were prepared by an introduction of fibres into 12 % cellulose N-methyl-morpholine N-oxide (NMMO) solution and water-ethanol regeneration. A broadening of the scattering of the main crystalline plane, (002) and a depression of the maximum degradation temperature of the fibres were observed. These revealed a structural change in the fibres arising from the preparation. The mechanical properties of composites depended on size, surface area, crystallinity and the structural swelling of the fibres. Composites of cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and modified hemp fibres were prepared. Composites containing pectate lyase enzyme treated fibres showed better mechanical property improvement than untreated and alkali treated fibres respectively...|$|R
40|$|A thermo-economic {{model has}} been built and {{validated}} for prediction of project economics of Enhanced Geothermal Projects. The thermo-economic model calculates and iteratively optimizes the LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) for a prospective EGS (Enhanced Geothermal) site. It {{takes into account the}} local subsurface temperature gradient, the cost of drilling and reservoir creation, stimulation and power plant configuration. It calculates and optimizes the power plant configuration vs. well depth. Thus outputs from the model include optimal well depth and power plant configuration for the lowest LCOE. The main focus of this final report was to experimentally validate the thermodynamic properties that formed the basis of the thermo-economic model built in Phase 2, and thus build confidence that the predictions of the model could be used reliably for process downselection and preliminary design at a given set of geothermal (and/or waste heat) boundary conditions. The fluid and cycle downselected was based on a new proprietary fluid from a vendor in a supercritical ORC cycle at a resource condition of 200 �C inlet temperature. The team devised and executed a series of experiments to prove the suitability of the new fluid in realistic ORC cycle conditions. Furthermore, the team performed a preliminary design study for a MW-scale turbo expander that would be used for a supercritical ORC cycle with this new fluid. The following summarizes the main findings in the investigative campaign that was undertaken: 1. Chemical compatibility of the new fluid with common seal/gasket/Oring materials was found to be problematic. Neoprene, Viton, and silicone materials were found to be incompatible, suffering <b>chemical</b> decomposition, <b>swelling</b> and/or compression set issues. Of the materials tested, only TEFLON was found to be compatible under actual ORC temperature and pressure conditions. 2. Thermal stability of the new fluid at 200 �C and 40 bar was found to be acceptable after 399 hours of exposure?only 3 % of the initial charge degraded into by products. The main degradation products being an isomer and a dimer. 3. In a comparative experiment between R 245 fa and the new fluid under subcritical conditions, {{it was found that the}} new fluid operated at 1 bar lower than R 245 fa for the same power output, which was also predicted in the Aspen HSYSY model. As a drop-in replacement fluid for R 245 fa, this new fluid was found to be at least as good as R 245 fa in terms of performance and stability. Further optimization of the subcritical cycle may lead to a significant improvement in performance for the new fluid. 4. For supercritical conditions, the experiment found a good match between the measured and model predicted state point property data and duties from the energy balance. The largest percent differences occurred with densities and evaporator duty (see Figure 78). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the state point model was experimentally validated with a realistic ORC system. 5. The team also undertook a preliminary turbo-expander design study for a supercritical ORC cycle with the new working fluid. Variants of radial and axial turbo expander geometries went through preliminary design and rough costing. It was found that at 15 MWe or higher power rating, a multi-stage axial turbine is most suitable providing the best performance and cost. However, at lower power ratings in the 5 MWe range, the expander technology to be chosen depends on the application of the power block. For EGS power blocks, it is most optimal to use multi-stage axial machines. In conclusion, the predictions of the LCOE model that showed a supercritical cycle based on the new fluid to be most advantageous for geothermal power production at a resource temperature of ~ 200 C have been experimentally validated. It was found that the cycle based on the new fluid is lower in LCOE and higher in net power output (for the same boundary conditions). The project, therefore has found a new optimal configuration for low temperature geothermal power production in the form of a supercritical ORC cycle based on a new vendor fluid...|$|R
40|$|In {{biomedical}} {{science and}} engineering the use of microscale thin polymer films is widespread. These polymer films are often formed on complex geometries which can provide problems for in-situ analysis and the accurate measurement of multiple physiochemical properties of thin polymer films is critical in understanding the polymer function and performance. When undertaking physicochemical characterisation of thermoresponsive polymers we must consider polymer structure and also the environment created by a polymer when it {{is used as a}} thin film. In addition, we need to account for the infiltration of solvents and other factors which may mediate the polymer behaviour. Water uptake in a polymer film can lead to significant changes in the physiochemical properties. This in turn can affect mechanical properties and may lead to such problems, in medical devices, as reduced adhesion, pronounced physical and <b>chemical</b> aging and <b>swelling</b> and expansion, compromising the intended function of the polymer and hindering biocompatibility. Thus {{there is a need for}} a non-contact, non-destructive method of analysis of these polymer films. Fluorescence spectroscopy offers a potential non-contact method for the in-situ analysis of thin polymer films. In this work we demonstrate the use of the dual-band emission, 3 -hydroxyflavone based fluorophores for monitoring the hydration process in thin (~ 10 m) films of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm), and poly(NIPAM-co-ethylpyrrolidone-methacrylate) (poly(NIPAM-co- EPM) copolymers. The fluorescence of 3 -HF probes is very sensitive to changes in local polarity and hydrogen bonding. This is observed as shifts and changes in the relative intensity of the two emission bands (N* and T*), which originate from an excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. The spectroscopic parameters of these probes can thus be correlated with the physiochemical properties of the probe microenvironment. We incorporated the probes into films of the thermoresponsive polymers and studied their fluorescence emission behaviour at different levels of humidity. Analysis of the spectral data showed that with increasing humidity, the ratio of two emission bands (log(IN*/IT*)), for all ii fluorophores increases. Changes were also observed in position of two emission bands; as humidity increases the N* band shifts to the red with respect to the T* band. It was also observed that the spectral intensity varied with increasing humidity. When measurements were made above and below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), it was clear that the films were still absorbing water above the LCST. Fluorescence measurements also revealed that these probes are also very sensitive to the subtle differences in copolymer composition as the fraction of EPM is increased. Results indicate a more equilibrated hydration process with the incorporation of EPM. Polarity measurements performed (using the solvatochromic ReichardtÂ¿s betaine dye) revealed that increasing water content in the polymer films resulted in an increase in polarity (which would be expected due to the highly polar nature of water). However, little or no variation in band positions or ET(30) parameter indicated that polarity did not vary with changes in chemical composition, with the exception of PEPm films where a red shift of the absorption band was noted indicating a decrease in polarity. However a non-linear response of band position with increasing RH for PEPm indicated that solvent sorting was taking place...|$|R
40|$|Overview Fast {{reactors}} {{were evaluated}} {{to enable the}} transmutation of transuranic isotopes generated by nuclear energy systems. The motivation for this was that TRU isotopes have high radiotoxicity and relatively long half-lives, making them unattractive for disposal in a long-term geologic repository. Fast reactors provide an efficient means to utilize the energy content of the TRUs while destroying them. An enabling technology that requires research and development is the fabrication metallic fuel containing TRU isotopes using powder metallurgy methods. This project focused upon developing a powder metallurgical fabrication method to produce U-Zr-transuranic (TRU) alloys at relatively low processing temperatures (500 ºC to 600 ºC) using either hot extrusion or alpha-phase sintering for charecterization. Researchers quantified the fundamental aspects of both processing methods using surrogate metals to simulate the TRU elements.
