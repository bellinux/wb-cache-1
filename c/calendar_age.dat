500|$|The {{idea behind}} {{radiocarbon}} dating is straightforward, but {{years of work}} were required to develop the technique {{to the point where}} accurate dates could be obtained. Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of [...] in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years. The resulting data, {{in the form of a}} calibration curve, is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample's <b>calendar</b> <b>age.</b> Other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of [...] in different types of organisms (fractionation), and the varying levels of [...] throughout the biosphere (reservoir effects). [...] Additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the time it takes to convert biological materials to fossil fuels is substantially longer than the time it takes for its [...] to decay below detectable levels, fossil fuels contain almost no , and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of [...] in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century. Conversely, nuclear testing increased the amount of [...] in the atmosphere, which attained a maximum in 1963 of almost twice what it had been before the testing began.|$|E

500|$|The above {{calculations}} {{make several}} assumptions, {{such as that}} the level of [...] in the atmosphere has remained constant over time. In fact, the level of [...] in the atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result the values provided by the equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources. [...] This is done by calibration curves, which convert a measurement of [...] in a sample into an estimated <b>calendar</b> <b>age.</b> [...] The calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called the [...] "radiocarbon age", which is the age in [...] "radiocarbon years" [...] of the sample: an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used − the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the / ratio has not changed over time. [...] Calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for , which {{for more than a decade}} after Libby's initial work was thought to be 5,568 years. [...] This was revised in the early 1960s to 5,730 years, which meant that many calculated dates in papers published prior to this were incorrect (the error in the half-life is about 3%). [...] For consistency with these early papers, and to avoid the risk of a double correction for the incorrect half-life, radiocarbon ages are still calculated using the incorrect half-life value. [...] A correction for the half-life is incorporated into calibration curves, so even though radiocarbon ages are calculated using a half-life value that is known to be incorrect, the final reported calibrated date, in calendar years, is accurate. [...] When a date is quoted, the reader should be aware that if it is an uncalibrated date (a term used for dates given in radiocarbon years) it may differ substantially from the best estimate of the actual calendar date, both because it uses the wrong value for the half-life of , and because no correction (calibration) has been applied for the historical variation of [...] in the atmosphere over time.|$|E
500|$|A {{calibration}} curve {{is used by}} taking the radiocarbon date reported by a laboratory, and reading across from that date on the vertical axis of the graph. The point where this horizontal line intersects the curve will give the <b>calendar</b> <b>age</b> of the sample on the horizontal axis. This is the reverse {{of the way the}} curve is constructed: a point on the graph is derived from a sample of known age, such as a tree ring; when it is tested, the resulting radiocarbon age gives a data point for the graph.Over the next thirty years many {{calibration curve}}s were published using a variety of methods and statistical approaches. These were superseded by the INTCAL series of curves, beginning with INTCAL98, published in 1998, and updated in 2004, 2009, and 2013. The improvements to these curves are based on new data gathered from tree rings, varves, coral, plant macrofossils, speleothems, and foraminifera. [...] The INTCAL13 data includes separate curves for the northern and southern hemispheres, as they differ systematically because of the hemisphere effect; there is also a separate marine calibration curve. For a set of samples with a known sequence and separation in time such as a sequence of tree rings, the samples' radiocarbon ages form a small subset of the calibration curve. The resulting curve can then be matched to the actual calibration curve by identifying where, in the range suggested by the radiocarbon dates, the wiggles in the calibration curve best match the wiggles in the curve of sample dates. This [...] "wiggle-matching" [...] technique can lead to more precise dating than is possible with individual radiocarbon dates. [...] Wiggle-matching can be used in places where there is a plateau on the calibration curve, and hence can provide a much more accurate date than the intercept or probability methods are able to produce. [...] The technique is not restricted to tree rings; for example, a stratified tephra sequence in New Zealand, known to predate human colonization of the islands, has been dated to 1314AD ± 12 years by wiggle-matching. The wiggles also mean that reading a date from a calibration curve can give more than one answer: this occurs when the curve wiggles up and down enough that the radiocarbon age intercepts the curve in more than one place, which may lead to a radiocarbon result being reported as two separate age ranges, corresponding to the two parts of the curve that the radiocarbon age intercepted.|$|E

A new mathematical extrapolation method is proposed to distinguish between <b>calendar</b> <b>ageing</b> and cycling-induced ageing. The capacity losses due to <b>calendar</b> <b>aging</b> are obtained by extrapolating the total irreversible capacity losses to zero cycle number.

In this case the capacity losses are found to increase linearly with cycle number. It is furthermore found that iron dissolution from the cathode at 60 °C and the subsequent deposition onto the anode enhances significantly the SEI formation on the graphite electrode and, consequently, battery ageing. Interestingly, the graphite electrode decay has been quantified in much more detail, by analyzing the dVEMF/dQ curves.
