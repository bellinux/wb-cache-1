This paper introduces two distributed <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> auto-configuration mechanisms for mobile ad hoc networks, namely (a) RADA (Random Address Allocation) and (b) LiA (Linear Allocation). RADA is based on random <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> selection, while LiA linearly assigns new addresses by utilizing the <b>current</b> maximum <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> value. We have also introduced an improved version of LiA, known as LiACR (Linear Allocation with Collision Resolution), which reduces control overhead.

The proposed decentralized mobility framework collectively exploits the multihoming feature of mSCTP, and efficient key-value mapping of chord to provide seamless mobility. Suitability of the framework is analyzed by preliminary analysis of chord lookup efficiency, and mSCTP handover procedure using overlay weaver and NS- 2. Performance analysis shows that mSCTP multihoming feature and Chord efficient key-value mapping can provide a non-delayed, reliable, and an efficient IP handover solution...|$|E

This is causing problems including: (i) Internet backbones and regionals are suffering from the need to maintain large amounts of routing information which is growing rapidly in size (approximately doubling each year); (ii) The Internet is running out of IP network numbers to assign. There is an urgent need to develop and deploy an approach to addressing and routing which solves these problems and allows scaling to several orders of magnitude larger than the existing Internet. However, it is necessary for any change to be deployed in an incremental manner, allowing graceful transition from the current Internet without disruption of service.

This involves a gradual migration from the current Internet Suite (which is based on Internet applications, running over TCP or UDP, running over IP) to an updated suit...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mobility is a {{requirement}} not appropriately ad-dressed by the original design of the Internet since an IP address has two fundamentally different tasks. It specifies a network location (for routing) and serves as an application identifier. A plethora of suggestions {{have been made to}} overcome this, e. g., Mobile IP and HIP. Yet, each of the proposed solutions has drawbacks such as requiring fundamental changes to the Internet architecture or relying on triangular routing. We propose the Seamless Internet Mobility System (SIMS) for enabling seamless IP network layer mobility. Our goals are (1) to enable mobility even for users that do not have a permanent IP address and therefore cannot rely on a Mobile IP home agent; (2) to impose no overhead for applications initiating network traffic in the current network; (3) to preserve sessions that started in any previously visited network location; (4) to be robust, scalable, and easily deployable in the current Internet; (5) address the economics of roaming between different administrative domains.

40|$|Abstract- The wide {{deployment}} of IEEE 802. 11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) has {{made possible the}} development of application services on WLANs. Due to the small cell size in WLANs, it is practical to develop location dependent services based upon the awareness of the WLAN access points (AP) that mobile devices currently access. In this paper, we propose a location determination technique using the inherent SNMP support in WLAN APs. It is shown that {{the location of a}} mobile device can be determined effectively from the SNMP traps sent by APs. Our SNMP-based approach doesn’t need any particular software or hardware in mobile devices. This paper also considers how to determine the location of a mobile device by its IP address. In general, only the IP address of a mobile device can be seen by location-based services. However, APs identify each mobile device by its MAC address. Hence, we propose effective techniques for the mappings between IP addresses and MAC addresses. Through the address mappings, the location of a mobile device can be determined by its <b>current</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b> We further propose a web service framework to enable WLAN location-based services in WWW environments.

30|$|In {{order to}} connect VANETs to the Internet, {{vehicles}} {{have to be}} provided with a full Internet Protocol (IP) stack, as IP is the basic building block for Internet communications. IPv 6 has been adopted as the version of the IP protocol by all the previously mentioned standardization bodies and consortia and has been included in their communication architectures. We can identify three main functionalities required to bring IP into the vehicular networks: (a) the capability of vehicles to auto-configure an IP address, (b) IP mobility mechanisms suited for vehicular scenarios, and (c) mechanisms for an efficient transmission and forwarding of IP datagrams within the vehicular network. In this paper {{we focus on the}} first topic, that is the auto-configuration of IP addresses by nodes of a VANET. IPv 6 provides some standardized mechanisms of IP address auto-configuration, both stateless [3, 4] and stateful [5] that cannot--or at the very least are hard to--be applied without any modification in vehicular environments. The main causes of this fact are the multi-hop nature of VANETs and their lack of a single multicast-capable link for signaling, which prevent <b>current</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> auto-configuration-related protocol specifications from being used as is in VANETs. Therefore, a key research issue is how to auto-configure IPv 6 addresses in a VANET. The same problem occurs in general in any unmanaged multi-hop network. Among these, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) have received a remarkable attention in the research area for years, and there even exists a working group in the IETF,e called AUTO-CONF, that is chartered to work on the standardization of an address auto-configuration solution for MANETs [6].|$|E

This paper {{describes a}} proposal for how transition may be accomplished. Description of {{the manner in which}} use of CLNP, NSAP addresses, and related protocols (ES-IS, IS-IS, and IDRP) allow scaling to a worldwide Internet is outside of the scope of this paper. Originally, it was thought that any practical proposal needed to address the immediate short-term problem of routing information explosion (in addition to the long-term problem of scaling to a worldwide Internet). This could require older IP-based systems to talk to other older IP-based systems over intervening Internet backbones which did not support IP. This in turn could require either translation of IP packets into CLNP packets and vice versa, or encapsulation of IP packets inside CLNP packets. However, other shorter-term techniques [3] have been proposed which will allow the Internet to operate successfully for several years using the <b>current</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> space. This in turn allows more time for IP-to-CLNP migration, which in turn allows for a much simpler migration technique. The SCP proposal therefore makes use of a simple long-term migration proposal based on a gradual update of DNS servers (to return larger addresses) and Internet Hosts (to run Internet applications over CLNP). This proposal requires routers to be updated to support forwarding of CLNP (in addition to IP). However, this proposal does not require encapsulat [...] ...|$|E
