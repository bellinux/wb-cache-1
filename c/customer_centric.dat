Any Organization whose objectives to earn returns, profit, market share are possible only by having customer competence. In this present era marketers fate is decided by the customers who has different variety of products with international quality and prices are competitive enough. Identifying the requirements of the customers and meeting those will show success to marketers. This paper focuses to study the consumer’s ownership, acquire and usage of home appliances helping marketers to understand in detail of customers acquire and usage, framing the best marketing strategies to conquer competition and improve loyal consumers and drive towards the development of durable industry.

In {{this era of}} heightened competition and volatile global economy, delivering services originating from diverse sources, without satisfying thorough customer experience practices may increase customer dissatisfaction, and churn rate. In order to guarantee rich customer experience, the service delivery mechanism should shift towards <b>customer</b> experience <b>centric</b> approach. This shift from service to experience brings customer in the driving seat, whose intentions and needs trigger service delivery. This paper introduces ontological model for customer experience, intended for use in run time environments by policy based management systems, to initiate and enable service delivery based on customer experience. The work presented here can have valuable implications for future studies of customer experience based service delivery approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} master’s thesis was {{to develop}} a model to build a service quality <b>centric</b> <b>customer</b> {{reference}} portfolio for a software as a service company. The case company is Meltwater Finland Oy that leverages customer references externally but there is no systematic model to produce good quality customer references that are in line with the company strategy. The project was carried out as a case study, where the primary source of information were seventeen internal interviews with the employees of the case company. The theory part focuses on customer references as assets and service quality in software as a service industry. In the empirical part the research problem is solved. As a result of the case study, the model to build a service quality <b>centric</b> <b>customer</b> reference portfolio was created and further research areas were suggested. Diplomityön tavoitteena oli kehittää asiakastyytyväisyyskeskeinen malli asiakasreferenssiportfolion rakentamiseen SaaS-yrityksessä.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{not only}} the differences and similarities in marketing activities between first and second generation South Asian entrepreneurs; but {{the extent to which}} such activities lead to convergence with the mainstream small business population also. Therefore, differences are found in the fact that first generation respondents consider organic growth, thus differentiation via expansion initiatives and related diversification, as a way to access new co-ethnic and non-ethnic customer markets. This contrasts with that of the second generation. Here these particular respondents prefer to adopt a more transparent and open approach to marketing via knowledge skills advantage, and technological expertise. A feature common to both sets of respondents, and again one which this paper argues may be indicative of any small business, finds respondents following some form of self-directed informal <b>customer</b> care/customer <b>centric</b> philosophies. Interestingly, {{there is no evidence to}} support differences in customer care and practice between the various business sectors or generation, given that such practices appear even in the absence of any formal procedures and written policies also...|$|R
40|$|For {{economic}} benefits and efficient management of resources, organizations are increasingly moving towards {{the paradigm of}} “cloud computing” through which they are allowed on-demand delivery of hardware, software and data as services. Multi- tenancy and virtualization features of cloud computing enhance resource utilization and lower the cloud provider total cost of hosting <b>customers</b> data <b>centric</b> services. However, cloud vulnerabilities associated with its software and services pose many security challenges which are particularly exacerbated by multi-tenancy that allows sharing of resources among potentially untrusted tenants in access controlled cloud datacenters. Such vulnerabilities can result in {{an increased risk of}} data and information leakage. To mitigate this risk, we propose eefficient risk-aware virtual resource assignment mechanisms for cloud multi-tenant environment. In particular, we introduce the notion of sensitivity in datacenters with the objective to minimize the risk of leakage of data and its associated knowledge. Generally, the risk should not exceed in high sensitivity datacenters in comparison to low sensitivity datacenters. We present various assignment heuristics and compare their relative performance. In addition we present a distributed access control architecture that provides secure interoperation within a multi-cloud environment. ...|$|R

The Group, consisting of the fixed-line company Telkom and a 50 per cent shareholding in mobile operator Vodacom. Telkom has changed its vision to the following: “To be a leading <b>customer</b> and employee <b>centric</b> ICT solutions service provider”. The company has been retrenching staff since 1999 and the staff numbers have reduced significantly from approximately 65 000 people to 25 575 people in 2006. The {{focus has been on}} increasing shareholder value and the staff feel that their value has not been recognised. The research paper focused on the extent that employees engaged to build a performance culture in Telkom’s NCC division. The following research methodology was followed: - A literature survey to determine factors or behaviours that will enhance employee engagement in building a performance culture and what Telkom NCC can do to build the workplace that will foster higher levels of employee engagement. - A survey was conducted to determine what the engagement levels of employees are at Telkom NCC, what stops the employees from doing their best and what Telkom NCC division can do to show they care and value their staff as according to their employees by means of a questionnaire. - The findings from the literature study and empirical study would be used to determine to what extent are employees engaged to build a performance culture in Telkom’s NCC division. A self administered questionnaire was used to collect the data required for this research. In conclusion it was said that employee engagement is a partnership between the company and the employees where everyone works together to achieve the business objectives of the company and the personal aspirations of employees. The organization has the responsibility to create the conditions for this to happen (Understanding Employee Engagement, 2004 : 2). It was recommended that in order for NCC to enhance their employees attitudes toward the promoters’ team especially in terms of pride, strong attachment, feeling part of the family and motivating employees to do well promoters must concentrate on building relationships with their teams and individual members of the team. Employees must also be given decision making power for implementing the idea. NCC should educate their leaders on the value of recognition {{and the best way to}} go about it. In order for employees to grow and be promoted into higher positions, NCC must consider that if positions become available that they first be advertised in the NCC division before it be made available to the rest of the compan...|$|R

5000|$|Compared {{with the}} more {{typically}} <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> focus of Internal marketing, internal branding / brand engagement takes a more 'inside-out', value-based approach to shaping employee perceptions and behaviours, {{following the lead of}} the highly influential 'Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies' study published in the mid-90's. This sought to demonstrate that companies with consistent, distinctive and deeply held values tended to outperform those companies with a less clear and articulated ethos. While brand-led culture change is often the stated desire of these programmes their focus on communication-led, marketing methods (however, involving or experiential) has been prone to the same failings of conventional internal marketing. As Amazon.com's founder, Jeff Bezos, asserts: [...] "One of things you find in companies is that once a culture is formed it takes nuclear weaponry to change it". You cannot simply assert your way to a new culture, no more can you assert your way to a strong brand, it needs to be consistently and continuously shaped and managed, {{which is one of the}} primary reasons many organisations have turned from the short term engagement focus of internal branding initiatives to more long term focus of employer brand management.|$|E
50|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the widespread information and connections for consumers, the way to develop penetrable customer engagement is to proactively connect with customers by listening. Listening will empower the consumer, give them control, and endorse a <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> two-way dialogue. This dialogue will redefine {{the role of the}} consumer as they no longer assume the end user role in the process. Instead of the traditional transaction and/or exchange, the concept becomes a process of partnership between organisations and consumers. Particularly since the internet has provided consumers with the accumulation of much diverse knowledge and understanding, consumers now have increasingly high expectations, developed stronger sensory perceptions, and hence have become more attracted to experiential values. Therefore, it would only be profitable for businesses to submit to the new criteria, to provide the opportunity for consumers to further immerse in the consumption experience. This experience will involve organisations and consumers sharing and exchanging information, which will generate increased awareness, interest, desire to purchase, retention, and loyalty amongst consumers, evolving an intimate relationship. Significantly, total openness and strengthening customer service is the selling point here for customers, to make them feel more involved rather than just a number. This will earn trust, engagement, and ultimately word of mouth through endless social circles. Essentially, it is a more dynamic and transparent concept of customer relationship management (CRM).|$|E

40|$|Launching new {{products}} {{into the market}} is considered a means of generating growth; however the growth is often short-lived as competitors copy product innovations. Organisations are learning that customers and not products are the most valuable resource and {{are the source of}} competitiveness and growth. Consequently, the requirement to change the organisational strategy from product centricity to customer centricity has become a topic of interest. It was identified by numerous authors that to attain customer centricity organisations need to change the design of their entities and related processes by harnessing organisation design competencies. In exploring this topic, a qualitative research approach was adopted. The research was conducted using a two phase approach. The first phase entailed an analysis of published case studies of four companies that have transitioned from a product centric to a <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> strategy. The companies were from the financial services, electronics, real estate and information technology industries. The second phase of the research entailed conducting semi-structured interviews at a retail bank that {{was in the process of}} transitioning from a product centric to a <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> strategy. Sixteen semi-structured interviews with the key managers across the retail bank were conducted. A central finding of this research was that the transition from a product centric to a <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> strategy entails the understanding of key enabling factors. These are grouped into 3 categories, namely; technological, customer and organisational factors. Another central finding was the evidence in the changes in the organisation design. Changes in the structure, processes, rewards and measurements as well as people practices were noted. The role of leadership, culture and change management was highlighted. An organisation design capability was also cited as assisting in the transition to a <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> strategy.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the perspective of Irish medical device companies on <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> innovation. There is considerable growing emphasis on innovation in the medical technology (med tech) sector as a means of securing industry growth in Ireland. This shift in business orientation is not overtly coupled with calls for increased customer focus. Innovation as a business strategy is all but futile unless it can be commercially expressed and the only means to assure this is to develop new products that meet validated customer needs - the essence of customer centricity. The research technique employed is in-depth interviewing; this was conducted among industry leaders from ten medical device companies operating in Ireland. These included five foreign direct investment companies and five indigenous companies. The research findings demonstrate a commitment to <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> innovation practices and a general understanding of the importance of accurately defining customer needs through user-involvement in med tech innovation. This research indicates that different activities are employed by different companies in implementing <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> innovation, but that there is room for improvement in how companies and the industry in general execute these activities. Customer centricity is accepted as a means to generating competitive advantage but it is recognised as a complex process that requires consideration for a broad range of stakeholders ranging from clinicians, payers, patients to mention a few. The most significant deficit identified in terms of customer centricity in innovation practice is the gap that exists between the clinical community and the medical technology industry in Ireland. This research concludes that <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> innovation is perceived as an important influence in the success of medical technology innovation among Irish based companies; that it is being practised in day-to-day business activities but that improvement in this area will be necessary to sustain the industry’s overall success...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> eGovernment systems, for better services and reliable information to citizen, is increasing in {{developed and developing}} countries as part of eGovernment initiatives. This provides an opportunity to redesign government processes and also to improve efficiency and effectiveness within government institution. A review of literature indicates {{that the majority of}} eGovernment–fordevelopment projects fail either totally or partially. The gap between design and the ground reality is defined as „designreality gaps‟. This is attributed as the cause of failure. Therefore, this research study has been undertaken to propose a business process model for <b>customer</b> <b>centric</b> eGovernment system that will help to reduce the gap due to business process representation in Information System. This study has revealed that work system in eGovernment can be described as an event (Request) driven system with a pattern Request-Process-Response.

The process model chosen in PAIS is tightly-framed and workflow system, which includes P 2 A(Person-to-Application) and A 2 A(Application-to-Application) process model. The structure of process model proposed for eGovernment system is a multi-tier, non-linear and iterative structure and can be with multiple interconnected descriptive task chains.
