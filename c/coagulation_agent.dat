The principal types are electrochemical and chemical coagulation (Ngamlerdpokin et al. 2011). Chemical coagulation utilizes an external coagulant agent to bond different particles of G&O or COD in small groups, which can be easily removed {{by the addition of}} a flocculating agent (Ngamlerdpokin et al. 2011).

Lobster chitin/chitosan has been used for the removal of reactive dyes (vinyl sulfone and chlorotriazine) from aqueous solution (Juang et al. 1997). Lobster chitin/chitosan produced from this study had significantly high adsorption capacity of reactive dyes (50 – 500  mg/L) compared with a conventional absorbent (activated carbon).

30|$|Early {{inflammatory}} response is initiated {{in the late}} phase of <b>coagulation.</b> Chemo-attractive <b>agents,</b> TGF-β, complement components such as C 3 a and C 5 a, and formyl–methionyl peptides, produced by bacteria and platelets, are responsible for bringing neutrophils {{to the site of}} injury. This process occurs with 24 – 36  h of injury (Hart 2002). Alteration in adhesion molecules renders neutrophils sticky, and by the process of margination, they adhere to post-capillary venules, rolling along the surface of endothelium as blood flows. Adhesion and rolling are classified as weak attachments mediated by selecting dependent interactions. Strong adhesion system, mediated by integrin, is activated when endothelial cells release chemokines. Following strong adhesion, cell rolling and attachment come to a halt and are sequestered from post-capillary venule. Neutrophils now reside between endothelial cells. This process is known as diapedesis (Richardson 2004). Once in the wound milieu, neutrophil releases proteolytic enzymes and free oxygen radicals, thereby killing and phagocytosing the bacteria. After completing their task, neutrophils must be eliminated if wound healing is to proceed further. They are disposed as slough from wound surface by apoptosis. Apoptotic bodies are phagocytosed by macrophages without invoking an {{inflammatory response}} (Diegelmann and Evans 2004).|$|R

The expected depletion of fossil resources and the stress on the climate from burning them has, however, turned the world’s attention to renewable resources. To develop competitive high quality products from renewable resources, is indeed a challenge for the research community. Cellulose is a renewable material with a variety of properties depending on source, processing and other modifications. In liquid food packaging the cellulose-based carton is combined with plastics to make the package impermeable to water. The production of carton packages with a shapeable cellulosic material would be an interesting way to enhance its function, reduce the amount of fossil-based material in it and to make it more competitive towards plastic bottles. In this work, cellulose was made shapeable through blending with moldable polyethene. Esterified cellulose was used in order to increase the interfacial adhesion and the dispersion of cellulose in composites. Esters with various hydrophobicities, carbonyl hydrogen-bonding and degree of substitution were prepared. It was concluded that the fiber dispersion in the composites could be both improved and impaired by the esterification. Moreover, the eventual benefits of esterification on the interfacial adhesion, was counteracted by weakening and fragmentation of the fibers because of the chemical treatment and the mechanical processing. Cellulose was also made shapeable through coagulation of the cellulose-ionic liquid solutions with a <b>coagulation</b> <b>agent</b> (e. g. water), to obtain shapeable three-component gels.

The required porous transmission of these macromol. species led to an unavoidable, complex and dynamic in-pore membrane fouling in terms of fouling constituents, formation, structure and kinetics, which are the main obstacles in obtaining an economically viable flux and consistency in permeate quality. This exptl. study was carried out with the aims of understanding the dynamic interrelation between flux, fouling and system selectivity during a cross-flow beer microfiltration process so that an effective operating strategy for flux optimization could be formulated {{in conjunction with the}} parallel objective of good product (permeate) quality control. Tubular ceramic membranes (Ceramem) with nominal pore diams. of 0. 2, 0. 5, and 1. 3 micro m were used. Simultaneous measurement of flux and permeate qualities, such as sp. gr. and chill haze level enabled identification of the effect of anti-fouling techniques, such as back-flushing on transmission of essential beer components and on the filtered beer quality. The exptl. evidence lead to an understanding that the drastic flux enhancement achieved by employing back-flushing at reversed membrane morphol. was assocd. with enhanced solute transmission which could, without careful control, upset a balanced transmission of essential beer components and the retention of unwanted "chill haze" components.

40|$|Cellulose fibres have {{properties}} such as renewability, biodegradability, {{very good}} availability and low cost {{that make them}} very attractive as a reinforcement for thermoplastic polymers. Other more specific favourable properties are low density, high specific stiffness, low abrasive nature and their potential for modification. There are however, some drawbacks or limitations when processing cellulose-fibre-reinforced composites {{that need to be}} resolved in order to improve the mechanical properties of the composite. This work is focused on how to adapt the processing towards this goal and on a study of the mechanical properties of polymer composites with a high content of fibre reinforcement. Cellulose is not soluble in water or conventional organic solvents. Recently, it was found that ionic liquids (IL) are able to dissolve cellulose, opening many new possibilities. In this work, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was dissolved in two different imidazolium-based ionic liquids, and when a <b>coagulation</b> <b>agent</b> (CA) was added a gel structure was obtained. In this case, MCC was also modified to lauric acid cellulose ester (LACE) in order to study the effect of surface hydrophobisation. The thermal properties of the gels depended only on the type of cellulose whereas the absorption of CA during gelling depended on the types of IL as well as the type of cellulose. The gels showed linear viscoelastic behaviour in terms of the storage modulus G’ but not of the loss modulus G”. A higher concentration of cellulose gave stiffer gels whereas the gel network strength depended on the types of IL and CA. The difficulty of feeding the cellulose fibres into the processing equipment is a serious disadvantage, since continuous feeding is desired for industrial applications. In this work, three different continuous feeding techniques have been studied, more specifically the methods of pelletized cellulose fibres with polymer, the feeding of cellulosic tissue into the compounder and the feeding of wet cellulose masterbatch. Composites containing 20 to 35 wt% of cellulose fibres in ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer were obtained with the different processing techniques. In all cases, injection moulding was performed as a last step. It was shown that if the dispersion of cellulose fibres was performed solely by melt mixing, i. e. without compatibilisers, shorter fibres led to less fibre aggregates. Contrary to what was expected, shorter fibres resulted in composites with better mechanical performance showing the great importance of fibre dispersion together with a good adhesion fibre-matrix. The final fibre length depended on the processing technique and on the fibre concentration, but it was also observed that longer fibres were more affected by the melt processing.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{of damage to}} cerebral tissues following head trauma {{is determined by the}} primary injury, caused by the kinetic energy delivered at the time of impact, plus numerous secondary injury responses that almost inevitably worsen the primary injury. When head trauma results in a cerebral contusion, the hemorrhagic lesion often progresses during the first several hours after impact, either expanding or developing new, non-contiguous hemorrhagic lesions, a phenomenon termed hemorrhagic progression of a contusion (HPC). Because a hemorrhagic contusion marks tissues with essentially total unrecoverable loss of function, and because blood {{is one of the most}} toxic substances to which the brain can be exposed, HPC is one of the most severe types of secondary injury encountered following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Historically, HPC has been attributed to continued bleeding of microvessels fractured at the time of primary injury. This concept has given rise to the notion that continued bleeding might be due to overt or latent coagulopathy, prompting attempts to normalize <b>coagulation</b> with <b>agents</b> such as recombinant factor VIIa. Recently, a novel mechanism was postulated to account for HPC that involves delayed, progressive microvascular failure initiated by the impact.

40|$|Anodising is an {{important}} finishing technique used to produce controlled oxide coating on aluminium extrusions which impart aesthetic finish, longer life and resistance to corrosion and abrasion. The anodising process however leads to generation of significant amounts of acid and alkaline waste containing mainly aluminium. Normally these wastes are neutralised producing aluminium hydroxide sludge the disposal of which is problematic. Finex is New Zealand's most recently developed anodising plant established in Hamilton in 2004. During the first period of operation the company {{was faced with a}} costly sludge disposal problem. The present project was devised to study their production plant and wastewater treatment plant. A brief study of the sludge showed that even under optimum conditions and with use of polyelectrolyte, gravity settling produced excessive volumes of sludge. The decision was made to install a plate and frame filter press. With the reduction of its bulk by dewatering, the problem of sludge disposal was essentially solved. However the 12 tonnes per week of dewatered sludge production still posed the challenge of devising a way of using the material beneficially. The characteristics of the sludge were determined and routes to commodity products were investigated. Commodity alum was produced in good yield at 4 C by treatment of the sludge with sulphuric acid followed by crystallisation with anhydrous potassium sulphate. The product was very similar to the commercial product. Under basic conditions, sodium aluminate was produced by adding stoichiometric amount of OH-. Under acid conditions at the H+/Al(OH) 3 stoichiometric ratio of 3, 95 % of the aluminium was recovered as aluminium salt solution. When acid addition was less than the stoichiometric ratio of 3, the polyelectrolyte containing sludge showed little tendency to re-suspend. A variety of mechanical and thermal methods was used in an attempt to disaggregate and re-suspend the sludge. These included ultrasonic treatment at 80 C at frequency 14 kHz for 6 hours, autoclaving the sludge in electrical furnace at 150 C for 6 hours, homogenisation at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes at 20 C and mechanical grinding using mortar and pestle at 20 C. The ultrasonic treatment was effective in re-suspending 30 % of the sludge. The other treatments were largely ineffective. On comparing the heavy metal concentration present in the original anodising sludge with the heavy metal concentration in the recovered commodity products, it was found that heavy metal content reduction was achieved with the alum crystallisation process. On producing aluminate, Cd, Mg and Ni were reduced through the removal of insoluble hydroxides. Minimal reduction of heavy metal content was achieved in the acidic aluminium chloride solution. The acidic and alkaline products prepared from anodising sludge were tested for their usefulness as <b>coagulation</b> <b>agents.</b> Critical <b>coagulation</b> concentrations for kaolin suspensions for all products were determined to be 5 mg/L. For all systems except the ultrasonic re-suspended sludge, clear solutions of low turbidity resulted after 1 hour standing. An analysis of the cost recovery of various commodity products from waste sludge indicated that recovery of acid aluminium chloride solution was most cost effective while the recovery of alum produces the purest product. Assuming that the acid aluminium chloride solution could be substituted for and sold at the same per kg of aluminium price as polyaluminium chloride, a 52 % margin over consumables cost allows the possibility of a modest profit. The main benefit to Finex from proceeding with a sludge recovery program however is likely to be enhancement of the companies green credentials...|$|R

It was concluded that the thermal transition range of the cellulose gels was affected only by the type of cellulose and that the absorption of CA during gelling depended on the types of IL and cellulose. The rheological measurements with a stress-controlled parallel-plate rheometer showed linear vicoelastic behaviour in terms of the storage modulus G’ but not in the loss modulus G”. Gels having a high concentration of cellulose exhibited higher plateau values for G’ and the critical stress value for linearity depended on the type of IL and the type of CA. It was concluded that the G’ and G” of the gels were independent of the frequency. The difficulty of feeding the cellulose fibres into the extruder or injection moulding machine is a serious disadvantage, since continuous feeding is desired when processing this type of composite. Pelletizing the cellulose fibres made it possible to achieve continuous feeding, but this process resulted in a significant shortening of the fibre lengths and a consequent reduction in the mechanical properties of the composite. Cellulose pellets or agglomerates of cellulose in ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer (EAA) were processed with different techniques. Pellets with 30 and 70 wt% cellulose content were used. The 70 wt% cellulose content pellets were blended with additional EAA to a final cellulose content of 30 wt%. It was concluded that the melt processing after the initial agglomeration had a small or insignificant effect on the fibre length. Elongation dispersive mixing improved both stiffness and strength, probably because the number and size of the fibre aggregates were reduced.

Understanding of the regulation of smooth muscle and endothelial cell function during the development and subsequent growth of fibrofatty plaques may be useful in designing appropriate therapeutic interventions to control atherosclerotic disease...|$|R
30|$|In the {{majority}} of patients, L-NSS is performed via the transperitoneal (TP) route; conversely, posterior and postero-lateral renal tumours are best managed with a retroperitoneal approach [9, 11, 29, 30]. Preoperative ureteral catheterisation may be used, particularly when access to the collecting system is necessary. According to some authors, intraoperative ultrasonography for assessment of renal perfusion, tumour location and borders may prove beneficial and result in a change of procedure in a minority (2.5  %) of patients [31]. After laparoscopic access to the retroperitoneum and opening of Gerota’s fascia, en bloc or selective arterial clamping of the renal hilar vascular pedicle is performed to decrease bleeding and ensure a clear surgical field: the acceptable warm ischaemia time is limited to 30  min or less. Depending on the tumour’s size and location, NSS options include segmental polar nephrectomy, wedge resection, transverse resection and enucleation, to obtain complete tumour excision with a proper margin of normal tissue, and preservation of the maximum possible amount of functioning renal parenchyma. After removal of the resected renal portion, surgery requires suture repair of collecting system defects, filling of the parenchymal defect with peri-renal fat or bioabsorbable bolster agents, renal parenchymal reconstruction and closure {{with a combination of}} absorbable sutures, argon-beam <b>coagulation</b> and haemostatic <b>agents.</b> Finally, after reconstruction is finished, the vascular clamp is released to restore circulation. Hilar masses, multiple and/or infiltrating tumours with pelvicalyceal involvement pose specific and significant technical challenges for NSS. In selected patients, conversion to laparoscopic RN or O-PN may be necessary when L-NSS is deemed unfeasible by the surgeon after renal exploration [9, 11, 29, 30].|$|R
40|$|Currently, much {{attention}} is paid to development, allowing use of waste and by-products formed during certain manufacturing processes. This allows you to either reduce or completely eliminate the use of valuable and expensive raw materials. The use of this raw material in the production of synthetic rubber will not only reduce the cost of <b>coagulation</b> and acidifying <b>agents,</b> but also to improve the environmental situation. Featured in some cases effective coalescing agents based on polymeric quaternary ammonium salts (PCHSA) have a high coagulating power, and hence low consumption of the allocation of the rubber latex (3 - 5 kg 0 t- 1 rubber). Scarcity and high cost of these drugs leads to higher prices resulting rubber. Furthermore it is known that the application requires keeping PCHSA sufficiently precise dosage administered substances by the action of a latex, owing to the high capacity of the antiseptic may lead to discharge into natural waters polluted waters. However, using as the coagulating agent departing sugar production molasses solves a number of problematic steps in the production of synthetic rubber. First, a well-studied effective coagulation effect of different nitrogen derivatives relating to cationic surfactants. In freshly prepared solutions of molasses contained about 9 wt%, and this value increases significantly during enzymatic fermentation. Secondly, highly acidic environment of aqueous solutions of molasses after storage can allow their use in addition to or instead of the sulfuric acid used in large amounts (up to 15 kg m- 1 rubber) technology selection tests carried found that vulcanizates derived from rubber samples isolated molasses, consistent with the requirements and were similar to control samples prepared from the latex using sodium chloride...|$|R

40|$|Synthetic organic dyes {{comprise}} {{a significant part}} of industrial water effluents, as they are discharged in abundance by many manufacturing industries (e. g. textile industries). The potential carcinogenic properties of these dyes render their safe disposal a major environmental concern. The colored wastewater {{in the presence of the}} aforementioned dyes is a major cause of eutrophication and production of hazardous byproducts through processes such as oxidation, hydrolysis, or other chemical reactions taking place in the wastewater phase. The colored wastewater release in the ecosystem may also block both sunlight penetration and oxygen dissolution, which are essential for energy intake and the preservation of aquatic life. Thus there is a dire need to treat these colored effluents before discharging them into various water bodies. For the safe removal of dye pollutants, traditional physical techniques (adsorption on activated carbon, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, <b>coagulation</b> by chemical <b>agents,</b> ion exchange on synthetic adsorbent resins, etc.) can generally be used efficiently. Nevertheless, they are non-destructive for the pollutant, since they merely transfer the organic compounds from liquid to another phase, thus causing secondary pollution. Consequently, costly regeneration of adsorbent materials and post-treatment of solid-wastes, which are expensive operations, are mandated. Due to the large degree of aromatics present in dye molecules and the stability of modern dyes, conventional biological treatment methods (Cyclic Activated Sludge System) are ineffective for decolorization and degradation. Lately, Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), such as photochemical processes, Fenton, photo-Fenton, Fenton-like, ozonation and photocatalysis, are being applied to treat dye effluents with encouraging results. AOPs were based on the generation of very reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), that oxidize a broad range of pollutants quickly and non-selectively. Among AOPs, heterogeneous photocatalysis appears as the most promising pollutant destructive technology. Heterogeneous photocatalytic processes involve irradiation–usually UV-A (λ= 320 – 400 nm) or solar irradiation, in the presence of a semiconductor acting as a catalyst for the production of free hydroxyl radicals. The basic mechanism for generating •ΟΗ involves the adsorption of a photon, the generation of an electron-hole pair (e_cb^-+ h_vb^+) and subsequently the production of •ΟΗ. The photo-generation of a hole-electron pair is a reversible process and it can therefore correspondingly diminish the rate of •ΟΗ production. The generated electrons react with adsorbed oxygen and this inhibits the recombination step. In the absence of a surface e- acceptor species recombination of the hole-electron pair proceeds very fast. The photogenerated holes can oxidize the organic molecule to form R+, or react with OH− or H 2 O, thus oxidizing them into •OH radicals. Together with other highly oxidant species (peroxide radicals) they are reported in the literature to be responsible for the heterogeneous photodecomposition of organic substrates as dyes. Considering efficient photocatalysts, nanometric commercial Titania (Degussa P 25), is one of the most promising materials due to its potent photocatalytic properties. However, it strongly suffers from a low photocatalytic activity when employed under visible light, while also exhibiting a positive correlation with the appearance of human lung cancer, attributed to the presence of respirable, nano-sized particles. To overcome these problems, new materials need to be produced and tested for their photocatalytic properties. Utilizing high energy ultrasounds (US), in order to modify the surface of a ceramic substrate with metallic nanoparticles, is considered an easy, fast and effective approach for synthesizing photocatalysts and increase their photocatalytic potential in the visible range. In the present thesis, a sonochemical procedure exploiting high energy ultrasounds was used in order to obtain decoration (10 % W/W) of Ag metallic nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of commercial micrometric Titania Kronos 1077 (100 % anatase, average crystallite size: 110 nm, Eg= 3. 2 eV). To investigate the photocatalytic activity of the prepared sample the molecule of Methylene Blue dye was used. A parametric study of the photocatalytic oxidation was carried out, accounting for variable pH and amount of employed catalyst. Tests were conducted both under UV-A light and artificial visible light. To ensure the decoration of silver NPs on the titanium dioxide substrate two different solutions were prepared. The first solution (A) contains the silver precursor AgNO 3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99. 0 %), PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, Sigma Aldrich, 99. 0 %), TiO 2 Kronos 1077 and dist. H 2 O. The second solution (B) contains NaBH 4 (Sigma Aldrich, 99. 0 %) and dist. H 2 O. First, solution A was treated by US generated using a VCX 750 by SONICS®, utilizing a 200 W US generator and a sonication extension horn (US frequency: 20 kHz) of 13 mm diameter and maintaining the temperature at 30 ◦C using a heating circulator for 10 minutes with 33. 0 % amplitude and an intensity of 30 Wcm− 2. Without stopping sonication, solution B was then mixed with solution A and sonication continued for one hour. The presence of NaBH 4 acts as a reducing agent on the silver precursor molecules while PVP, which acts as a surfactant, plays a crucial role on the morphology and size of the final product. Ultrasound is fundamental for both the formation of NPs from the precursor and for their optimal distribution on the TiO 2 support surface. Indeed, ultrasonic irradiation speeds up the diffusion of solute in the reaction system, as well as influences the selective adsorption of the surfactant on silver, thus inducing elongation or compression in defined directions, affecting the particles morphology. Moreover, the use of US allows working in conditions that do not require high temperatures and thus they are not energy intensive. Finally, the sonicated mixture is centrifuged in order to remove the solvent and it is then washed with dist. water. After centrifugation, the obtained slurry mixture was put in an oven for two hours at 400 ◦C. XRD analysis of the modified sample showed that surface decoration does not affect the structural properties of Kronos 1077. The XRD pattern exhibits the peaks characteristic of the anatase phase [ICDD anatase file no. 21 - 1272]. The TEM analysis of bare Kronos 1077 shows that it is characterized by an average crystallites dimensions lying in the 100 – 150 nm range. Respectively, the decorated sample exhibits the main morphological features typical of the parent Kronos system, with an average Ag nanoparticle size on the Kronos surface lying in the 10 – 30 nm range. In order to test the photocalytic properties of the prepared sample, compared to the bare one, and examine certain parameters that effect the degradation of Methylene Blue molecule (pH, catalyst loading), a photocalytic apparatus was designed and build in the lab. The experiments were carried out in a glass vessel of 120 ml, transparent to UV-A irradiation. A total of 6 lamps, 11 W each, were placed above the vessel either for UV-A (PL-S 11 W/ 10 / 2 P 1 CT, λmax= 365 nm) or for VL, (PL-S 11 W/ 865 / 2 P 1 CT, λmax= 545 nm) irradiation. Since dyes are colored in nature, it is straightforward to monitor their color change during the course of the experiment. In photocatalytic studies, the sample is typically exposed to UV or VL irradiation for a given time period and the changes in solution property (such as color) are observed by a spectrophotometer. To monitor the photodegradation of the dye a sample of the solution after irradiation is transferred to a cuvette and subjected to absorption studies on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (U- 5100 Hitachi). The degree of decoloration (τ) is then calculated from the decrease of absorbance of the dye solution at its maximum absorption wavelength as follows: τ=[1 -A_i/A_ 0]× 100 where, A 0 and Ai are the absorbance values of the dye solution, before and after irradiation respectively. After each measurement the sample is returned back to the glass vessel. The MB removal was studied by monitoring the degradation of the MB dye in an aqueous solution (100 ml, 2 × 10 - 5 M), under continuous stirring and exposure to UV-A light irradiation or visible light (VL). The characteristic absorption at 663 nm was used to determine the MB concentration. In the experiments regarding the photodegradation efficiency of MB, as affected by the initial pH of the solution, the catalyst loading was kept constant at 2 mg and pH varied from the natural pH at 5. 8 to 4 and 2. Respectively, the experiments regarding the catalyst loading, the pH of the suspension was fixed and kept constant at pH value 4 and the catalyst loading varied between 1, 2 and 3 mg [...] Before starting each experiment the prepared suspension was put in an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes under dark conditions to ensure the best possible distribution of the catalysts particles in the solution and a maximum absorption of the dye molecules onto the catalyst surface. A benchmark absorption spectrum, before irradiation, was obtained. Subsequently, the lamps were turned on and the experiments lasted for one hour of illumination, taking measurements of the absorption spectra at specific time intervals during the illumination process. The photocatalytic studies under different pH solutions showed that at lower pH values the photocatalytic oxidation is enhanced. The variation in solution pH changes the surface charge of TiO 2 particles and shifts the potentials of the catalytic reactions taking place. The surface of Titania will remain positively charged in an acidic medium and negatively charged in an alkaline medium because of protonation or deprotonation respectively. Therefore as the pH|$|R
