40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{provides}} managerial insight to pursue Collaborative Planning Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) or Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) strategy {{for both the}} retailer and manufacturer under different supply chain settings. Discrete event simulation is used to investigate the <b>cost</b> <b>benefits</b> of CPFR and VMI strategies over Traditional Supply Chain (TSC) in a variable demand environment. The conceptual model is a two-echelon production-inventory system with a manufac-turer and a retailer. The {{results from this study}} suggest that when compared to TSC, both VMI and CPFR achieve <b>cost</b> <b>benefits</b> in inventory management for both the manufacturer and retailer. Under most supply chain settings, higher <b>cost</b> <b>benefits</b> are achieved in CPFR compared to VMI. Also, CPFR achieves higher <b>cost</b> <b>benefits</b> when demand variability is high, production capacity is low, backorder penalty cost is high and delivery lead time is long. However, when production capacity is high and delivery lead time is short, the <b>cost</b> <b>benefits</b> of CPFR and VMI are significantly lower...|$|R

25|$|Many {{nourishment}} {{projects are}} advocated via economic impact studies {{that rely on}} additional tourist expenditure. This approach is however unsatisfactory. First, nothing proves that these expenditures are incremental (they could shift expenditures from other nearby areas). Second, economic impact {{does not account for}} costs and benefits for all economic agents, as <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> analysis does. Techniques for incorporating nourishment projects into flood insurance costs and disaster assistance remain controversial.|$|E

This imperfect mobility can produce competitive advantages for firms that acquire immobile resources. McWilliams and Siegel (2001) examined CSR activities and attributes as a differentiation strategy. They concluded that managers {{can determine the}} appropriate level of investment in CSR by conducting <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> analysis {{in the same way}} that they analyze other investments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>benefit</b> {{analysis}} (CBA), {{sometimes called}} benefit costs analysis (BCA), is a systematic approach to estimating {{the strengths and}} weaknesses of alternatives (for example in transactions, activities, functional business requirements or projects investments); it is used to determine options that provide the best approach to achieve benefits while preserving savings. The CBA is also defined as a systematic process for calculating and comparing benefits and costs of a decision, policy (with particular regard to government policy) or (in general) project.|$|E

25|$|Shares in Eurotunnel {{were issued}} at £3.50 per share on 9 December 1987. By mid-1989 the price {{had risen to}} £11.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during {{demonstration}} runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy. In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel's operating concession by 34years, to 2086. Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring, The Economist reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability. A <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy {{would have been better}} off if it had not been constructed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} to {{what extent}} credit ratings directly affect capital structure decisions. The paper outlines discrete <b>costs</b> (<b>benefits)</b> associated with firm credit rating level differences and tests whether concerns for these <b>costs</b> (<b>benefits)</b> directly affect {{debt and equity financing}} decisions. Firms near a credit rating upgrade or downgrade issue less debt relative to equity than firms not near a change in rating. This behavior is consistent with discrete <b>costs</b> (<b>benefits)</b> of rating changes but is not explained by traditional capital structure theories. The results persist within previous empirical tests of the pecking order and tradeoff capital structure theories. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association. ...|$|R

25|$|Evolutionary {{medicine}} identifies many {{symptoms such as}} fever, pain, and sickness {{behavior as}} evolved responses to protect or enhance the recovery from infection and injury. Fever, for example, is an evolved self-treatment that removes bacteria or viruses through raised body temperature. These evolved responses, however, also have a cost that depending upon circumstances can outweigh their benefit (due to this, for example, there is a reduction in fever during malnutrition or late pregnancy). According to the health management system theory proposed by Nicholas Humphrey, the brain has been selected to ensure that evolved responses are deployed only when the <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> is biologically advantageous. To do this, the brain factors {{in a variety of}} information sources, including the likelihood derived from beliefs that the body will get well without deploying its costly evolved responses. One such source of information is the knowledge the body is receiving care and treatment. The placebo effect in this perspective arises when false information about medications misleads the health management system about the likelihood of getting well so that it selects not to deploy an evolved self-treatment.|$|E

Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that those who are looking for <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> would be disappointed by lack of content, especially those who had already finished the main game, but he was interested in Enter the Dominatrix for its behind-the-scenes aspects, which he encouraged other developers to use more often.|$|E

500|$|Studies were {{completed}} {{for the remaining}} five mainline tunnels to determine the <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> of twinning of the tunnels, or complete bypass. [...] After the studies completed, {{the decision was made}} to go ahead with a US $100 million [...] construction project to work with the tunnels. Construction began on September 6, 1962, with the first subproject being a bypass of the Laurel Hill Tunnel. On October 30, 1964, just two years after construction began, the Laurel Hill Bypass was completed and opened. The Laurel Hill Tunnel was permanently closed on that day. However, this was not the last bypass to occur for tunnels along the turnpike. Two years after the closing of the Laurel Hill, the Allegheny Mountain became the first tunnel to be twinned, and opened on August 25, 1966. With the twinning of the Blue Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain and Tuscarora Mountain tunnels under construction, the Commission turned its focus to the remaining two mainline tunnels, the Rays Hill Tunnel (the shortest tunnel) and the Sideling Hill Tunnel (the longest tunnel).|$|E

An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project were greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> report was written.|$|E
