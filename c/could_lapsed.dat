Establishing such correspondence in the theological case is both an instance of this point and, as Descartes orders the situation, a prerequisite for establishing it in other instances...|$|R

The objectives of this study were to survey the current literature, to critically analyse published articles with home range analyses, and to compare home range size by species' trophic level. We predicted that animals residing in higher trophic levels would have significantly larger home ranges than animals occupying lower trophic levels. We found that terrestrial carnivores had larger home ranges than terrestrial herbivores, though terrestrial mesocarnivores had the largest home ranges. We also found that aquatic herbivores had larger home ranges than both aquatic carnivores and aquatic mesocarnivores. Our results are important to consider for planning and management sectors, to avoid the implementation of ineffective conservation policies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} methods {{to detect and}} recover from sensor failure in dense {{wireless}} sensor networks. In order to extend the lifetime of a sensor network while maintaining coverage, a minimal subset of the deployed sensors are kept active while the other sensors can enter a low power sleep state. Several distributed algorithms for coverage have been proposed in the literature. Faults are of particular concern in coverage algorithms since sensors go into a sleep state in order to conserve battery until woken up by active sensors. If these active sensors were to fail, this <b>could</b> lead to <b>lapses</b> in coverage that are unacceptable in critical applications. Also, most algorithms in the literature rely on an active sensor that is about {{to run out of}} battery waking up its neighbors to trigger a reshuffle in the network. However, this would not work in the case of unexpected failures since a sensor cannot predict the occurrence of such an event. We present detection and recovery from sensor failure in dense networks. Our algorithms exploit the density in the recovery scheme to improve coverage by 4 - 12 % in the event of random failures. This fault tolerance comes at a small cost to the network lifetime with observed lifetime being reduced by 6 - 10 % in our simulation studies. ...|$|R

2500|$|Octavian {{presented}} himself as restorer of Rome's traditional religion and social values, and as peacemaker between its hitherto warring factions. In 12 BC he became pontifex maximus, {{which gave him}} authority over Rome's religious affairs, and over the Vestals, whose presence and authority he conspicuously promoted. His wife Livia was a distant relative of the long-dead but still notorious Clodius; but also related to the unfortunate Vestal Licinia, whose attempted dedication of Bona Dea's Aventine Temple had been thwarted by the Senate. Livia restored the temple and revived its May 1 festival, perhaps drawing attention away from her disreputable kinsman and the scandalous events of 62 BC. Thereafter, Bona Dea's December festival may have continued quietly, or <b>could</b> simply have <b>lapsed,</b> its reputation irreparably damaged. There {{is no evidence of}} its abolition. Livia's name did not and could not appear in the official religious calendars, but Ovid's Fasti associates her with May 1, and presents her as the ideal wife and [...] "paragon of female Roman virtue". Most of Bona Dea's provincial and municipal sanctuaries were founded around this time, to propagate the new Imperial ideology. An Imperial cult centre in Aquileia honours an Augusta Bona Dea Cereria, probably in connection with the corn dole. Other state cults to the goddess are found at Ostia and Portus. As the Vestals seldom went beyond Rome's city boundary, these cults would have been led by leading women of local elites, whether virgin or matron.|$|R
40|$|The agency {{model is}} a form of {{government}} organization that is quickly gaining credibility throughout bureaucratic circles. The Government of Manitoba has subsequently embarked on its own agency model program; it has created 16 Special Operating Agencies (SOAs) and has granted these agencies certain managerial freedoms that allow them to function in a more “business-like” manner. In effect, the reforms have replaced direct ministerial control with operating charters, business plans, annual reports and performance measurement designed to keep ministers apprised of agency activities without intruding into the daily workings of the agency. Critics contend that this arrangement represents erosion of traditional principles of ministerial responsibility, and base their criticism on similar agency model programmes implemented by governments in Great Britain, New Zealand and Canada. This thesis reviews the Manitoba SOA initiative and pays specific attention to the measures implemented by the Government of Manitoba to secure ministerial responsibility. Drawing on interviews with relevant agency figures, the dynamics of the new reporting procedures will be considered with particular attention paid to ministers' ability to answer before the Legislative Assembly, agency officials compliance with roles and responsibilities outlined in operating charters, and perceptions of performance measurement as tools of prospective and retrospective control. The thesis will argue that the agency model has been cautiously applied in Manitoba thereby muting concerns associated with the loss of accountability. However, the thesis will argue that several critical components of the SOA model have not been implemented to the extent that creators of the SOA model had envisioned, and that such <b>lapses</b> <b>could</b> result in confusion should the SOA project be expanded in the future...|$|R
60|$|The genuineness of his psychic powers {{has never}} been seriously questioned, and was as well {{recognised}} in Rome and Paris as in London. One incident only darkened his career, and it, was {{one in which he}} was blameless, as anyone who carefully weighs the evidence must admit. I allude to the action taken against him by Mrs. Lyon, who, after adopting him as her son and settling a large sum of money upon him, endeavoured to regain, and did regain, this money by her unsupported assertion that he had persuaded her illicitly to make him the allowance. The facts of his life are, in my judgment, ample proof of the truth of the Spiritualist position, if no other proof at all had been available. It is to be remarked in the career of this entirely honest and unvenal medium that he had periods in his life when his powers deserted him completely, that he <b>could</b> foresee these <b>lapses,</b> and that, being honest and unvenal, he simply abstained from all attempts until the power returned. It is this intermittent character of the gift which is, in my opinion, responsible for cases when a medium who has passed the most rigid tests upon certain occasions is afterwards detected in simulating, very clumsily, the results which he had once successfully accomplished. The real power having failed, he has not the moral courage to admit it, nor the self-denial to forego his fee which he endeavours to earn by a travesty of what was once genuine. Such an explanation would cover some facts which otherwise are hard to reconcile. We must also admit that some mediums are extremely irresponsible and feather-headed people. A friend of mine, who sat with Eusapia Palladino, assured me that he saw her cheat in the most childish and bare-faced fashion, and yet immediately afterwards incidents occurred which were absolutely beyond any, normal powers to produce.|$|R

Our main aim, however, was to use a repeated measures analysis which required a time-intensive process of coding to convert the data sets 1 and 2 (See Sub-report 1) (Greyling, 2015 a) into a multivariate layout (Kinnear & Gray, 2011 : 22 - 23; Tredoux, 2002 : 317).

We argued that we could work with a proportion of a base period, and to this end, we selected two periods (scenario 1 = 4 years; and scenario 2 = 5 years) that fell within Reder’s (2012) claim of 5 - 6 years as a realistic period to record LN development; and another which was the optimum period suggested by Reder (2012), plus 1 year (scenario 3 = 7 years). These were the denominators in the fraction, with numerators representing the time lapse between assessments. Then, for each scenario, we modified the TEC (2012) algorithm to include the term (expressed as a proportion of gain score required to achieve statistically significant gain).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} places “Ostrogothic Italy,” conventionally {{seen as a}} “barbarian” {{successor state}} in the West, firmly within the continuum of Roman history. It investigates conceptions of Romanness {{and the impact of}} Rome’s imperial and cultural legacy during the late fifth and early sixth centuries, telling how a number of Italo-Roman elites were able to fit Theoderic and his Goths into an understanding of a revived and reinvigorated western Roman Empire. It demonstrates that for these individuals, men like Cassiodorus Senator and Magnus Felix Ennodius, Italy remained the western Roman Empire, despite the events of 476, and that Theoderic and his Goths, once qualifying as “barbarians,” played fundamental roles in the perpetuation of Italy’s Roman and imperial identity. These Italo-Romans believed that, until the arrival of the Ostrogoths, the western Empire had languished in a state of political and cultural decline, but that both Theoderic and his Goths had provided the necessary remedies. In the Goths Italo-Romans received valiant soldiers who once more defended the Empire against real “barbarians” and even reclaimed lost provinces in the name of Rome. By obeying and upholding Roman law, moreover, these Goths were imagined to have become tolerably Roman and, as such, <b>could</b> actually re-Romanize <b>lapsing</b> Italo-Romans and newly reclaimed provincials, such as the inhabitants of Gaul. In Theoderic Italo-Romans received the kind of emperor that they wanted, a princeps who lived up to the ideals of the Principate, looked and acted like an emperor, and restored Rome’s rightful place {{as the head of the}} world. Theoderic’s Roman upbringing in Constantinople, east-Roman career, and noble ancestry rendered him an acceptable and welcomed candidate to the imperial purple. More importantly, the positive alterations witnessed during his reign, such as the renovation of declining cities and reassertion of Roman dominance in the West, affirmed that he was a good Roman emperor. It was for these reasons, this dissertation suggests, that Italo-Romans were hailing the restoration of the western Roman Empire and declaring that a golden age had dawned...|$|R
6000|$|I sit {{again at}} London Assurance, with Mrs. Wallack--"Fanny" [...] Wallack, I think, not that I quite {{know who she}} was--as Lady Gay Spanker, flushed and vociferous, first in a riding-habit with a tail yards long and {{afterwards}} in yellow satin with scarce a tail at all; I am present also at Love in a Maze, in which the stage represented, with primitive art I fear, a supposedly intricate garden-labyrinth, and in which I admired {{for the first time}} Mrs. Russell, afterwards long before the public as Mrs. Hoey, even if opining that she wanted, especially for the low-necked ordeal, less osseous a structure. There are pieces of that general association, I admit, the clue to which slips from me; the drama of modern life and of French origin--though what was then not of French origin?--in which Miss Julia Bennett, fresh from triumphs at the Haymarket, made her first appearance, in a very becoming white bonnet, either as a brilliant adventuress or as the innocent victim of licentious design, I forget which, though with a sense somehow that the white bonnet, when of true elegance, was the note at that period of the adventuress; Miss Julia Bennett with whom at a later age one was to renew acquaintance as the artful and ample Mrs. Barrow, full of manner and presence and often Edwin Booth's Portia, Desdemona and Julie de Mortemer. I figure her as having in the dimmer phase succeeded to Miss Laura Keene at Wallack's on the secession thence of this original charmer of our parents, the flutter of whose prime advent is perfectly present to me, with the relish expressed for that [...] "English" [...] sweetness of her speech (I already wondered why it shouldn't be English) which was not as the speech mostly known to us. The Uncles, within my hearing, even imitated, for commendation, some of her choicer sounds, to which I strained my ear on seeing her afterwards as Mrs. Chillington in the refined comedietta of A Morning Call, where she made delightful game of Mr. Lester as Sir Edward Ardent, {{even to the point of}} causing him to crawl about on all fours and covered with her shawl after the fashion of a horse-blanket. That delightful impression was then unconscious of the blight to come--that of my apprehending, years after, that the brilliant comedietta was the tribute of our Anglo-Saxon taste to Alfred de Musset's elegant proverb of the Porte Ouverte ou Fermée, in which nothing could find itself less at home than the horseplay of the English version. Miss Laura Keene, with a native grace at the start, a fresh and delicate inspiration, I infer from the kind of pleasure she appears to have begun with giving, was to live to belie her promise and, becoming hard and raddled, forfeit (on the evidence) all claim to the higher distinction; a fact not surprising under the lurid light projected by such a sign of the atmosphere of ineptitude as an accepted and condoned perversion to vulgarity of Musset's perfect little work. How could quality of talent consort with so dire an absence of quality in the material offered it? where <b>could</b> such <b>lapses</b> lead but to dust and desolation and what happy instinct not be smothered in an air so dismally non-conducting? Is it a foolish fallacy that these matters may have been on occasion, at that time, worth speaking of? is it only presumable that everything was perfectly cheap and common and everyone perfectly bad and barbarous and that even the least corruptible of our typical spectators were too easily beguiled and too helplessly kind? The beauty of the main truth as to any remembered matter looked at in due detachment, or in other words through the haze of time, is that comprehension has then become one with criticism, compassion, as it may really be called, one with musing vision, and the whole company of the anciently restless, with their elations and mistakes, their sincerities and fallacies and vanities and triumphs, embalmed for us in the mild essence of their collective submission to fate. We needn't be strenuous about them unless we particularly want to, and are glad to remember in season all that this would imply of the strenuous about our own origines, our muddled initiations. If nothing is more certain for us than that many persons, within our recollection, couldn't help being rather generally unadmonished and unaware, so nothing is more in the note of peace than that such a perceived state, pushed to a point, makes our scales of judgment but ridiculously rattle. Our admonition, our superior awareness, is of many things--and, among these, of how infinitely, at the worst, they lived, the pale superseded, and how much it was by their virtue.|$|R
60|$|Every day, then, for the {{following}} three weeks, the minutely respectable figure of M. Nioche made its appearance, {{with a series of}} little inquiring and apologetic obeisances, among the aromatic fumes of Newman's morning beverage. I don't know how much French our friend learned, but, as he himself said, if the attempt did him no good, it could at any rate do him no harm. And it amused him; it gratified that irregularly sociable side of his nature which had always expressed itself in a relish for ungrammatical conversation, and which often, even in his busy and preoccupied days, had made him sit on rail fences in young Western towns, in the twilight, in gossip hardly less than fraternal with humorous loafers and obscure fortune-seekers. He had notions, wherever he went, about talking with the natives; he had been assured, and his judgment approved the advice, that in traveling abroad it was an excellent thing to look into the life of the country. M. Nioche was very much of a native and, though his life might not be particularly worth looking into, he was a palpable and smoothly-rounded unit in that picturesque Parisian civilization which offered our hero so much easy entertainment and propounded so many curious problems to his inquiring and practical mind. Newman was fond of statistics; he liked to know how things were done; it gratified him to learn what taxes were paid, what profits were gathered, what commercial habits prevailed, how the battle of life was fought. M. Nioche, as a reduced capitalist, was familiar with these considerations, and he formulated his information, which he was proud to be able to impart, in the neatest possible terms and with a pinch of snuff between finger and thumb. As a Frenchman--quite apart from Newman's napoleons--M. Nioche loved conversation, and even in his decay his urbanity had not grown rusty. As a Frenchman, too, he could give a clear account of things, and--still as a Frenchman--when his knowledge was at fault he <b>could</b> supply its <b>lapses</b> with the most convenient and ingenious hypotheses. The little shrunken financier was intensely delighted to have questions asked him, and he scraped together information, by frugal processes, and took notes, in his little greasy pocket-book, of incidents which might interest his munificent friend. He read old almanacs at the book-stalls on the quays, and he began to frequent another cafe, where more newspapers were taken and his postprandial demitasse cost him a penny extra, and where he used to con the tattered sheets for curious anecdotes, freaks of nature, and strange coincidences. He would relate with solemnity the next morning that a child of five years of age had lately died at Bordeaux, whose brain had been found to weigh sixty ounces--the brain of a Napoleon or a Washington! or that Madame P--, charcutiere in the Rue de Clichy, had found in the wadding of an old petticoat the sum of three hundred and sixty francs, which she had lost five years before. He pronounced his words with great distinctness and sonority, and Newman assured him that his way of dealing with the French tongue was very superior to the bewildering chatter that he heard in other mouths. Upon this M. Nioche's accent became more finely trenchant than ever, he offered to read extracts from Lamartine, and he protested that, although he did endeavor according to his feeble lights to cultivate refinement of diction, monsieur, if he wanted the real thing, should go to the Theatre Francais.|$|R
