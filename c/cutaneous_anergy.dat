40|$|SUMMARY The {{presence}} of anergy {{and its relationship}} to malnutrition was investigated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in controls.

It is therefore concluded that the <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> of rheumatoid arthritis is not a consequence of nutritional factors. Abnormalities of cell mediated immunity (CMI) are thought to be of fundamental importance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

40|$|Uremic {{patients}} {{are known to}} be particularly susceptible to infections and possibly cancer. They have a definite <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> to the various antigens used to test delayed-type hypersensitivity. However, in vitro investigations of the individual functions involved in the immune response have not disclosed a profound and reproducible defect of one of these functions. This could be due to the heterogeneity of the patients studied (uremia of differing etiology, variation in metabolic and nutritional conditions, and influence of multiple complications). It is also possible that the main defect lies in regulation and cooperation between the individual functions...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{of patients}} with Hodgkin's disease to mycotic and viral infections has long directed attention to an immunological defect in that condition (1). The early finding of tubercu-lin negativity in these patients (2, 3), even {{in the presence of}} active tuberculous infection, has been confirmed repeatedly. Subsequent investigations have indicated that this <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> extends to many other allergens mediated by the delayed or cellular type of hypersensitivity mechanism (4 - 11). Recently, the demonstration of tolerance to skin homografts in some patients with Hodg-kin's disease (12) has further emphasized the ex-tent of the immunological defect. The purpose of the present communication is to inquire how intimately, and with what con-sistency, loss of the delayed type of hypersensi-tivity is associated with Hodgkin's disease and to pose certain questions regarding the causal re-lationships. Dinitrochlorobenzene (13, 14), a compound which uniformly induces hypersensi-tivity in normal individuals, has been used in the present investigation to study <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> in 37 patients with Hodgkin's disease. Unlike the earlier methods of study, the use of dinitro-chlorobenzene permits the evaluation {{of the state of the}} delayed sensitivity mechanism in the indi-vidual Hodgkin's patient. Several previous in-vestigators (15 - 17) have studied small groups {{of patients with}} Hodgkin's disease and other lympho-mas by this method; the present study is the first extensive study of this disease with a technique of active sensitization and the first in which the results have been correlated with the activity of the disease.

40|$|Infection with Candida albicans {{develops}} in diverse clinical settings. It may be minimal or life-threatening in severity, {{depending on the}} site of infection and clinical circumstance. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is an uncommon superficial infection of the skin, nails, and oral and vaginal mucous membranes, and is often associated with defects in cellular immune function. Untreated, the course is usually unremitting. Intravenous amphotericin B often results in regression or clearing of infection, but relapse generally occurs after discontinuation of therapy. Twelve patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis have been studied at the National Institutes of Health. Specific defects in cellular immunity have been characterized in eight of these patients. <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> to Candida antigen...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> in pregnant and nonpregnant women who are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus. Methods and materials: The medical records of 159 women seropositive for human immunodeficienc virus were reviewed. Demographic characteristics and tuberculin skin test results were abstracted from the chart. Tuberculin skin testing was performed by the Mantoux method (5 tuberculin units of purified protein derivative injected intradermally). Anergy testing was performed using any {{two of the three}} following antigens; tetanus toxoid, mumps, or Candida skin test antigen. A positive tuberculin test was defined as induration of 5 mm or more, and a positive test for the other antigens was defined as any amount of induration over the skin test area. Anergy was defined as any amount of induration to the other antigens. A CD 4 +T lymphocyte count was obtained at the time of skin testing. Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann WhitneymU test. Categorical data were analyzed with the chi-square or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. A two-tailed P value < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: There were 102 nonpregnant and 57 pregnant women who returned to have their skin test results read. There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of positive, negative or anergic skin test results between groups. The CD 4 +T lymphocyte count (mean standard deviation) in patients with anergic results was similar between pregnant (375 256 /mm 3) and nonpregnant (358 + 305 /mm 3) women (P 0. 64).

40|$|A case of {{invasive}} aspergillosis {{complicated by the}} formation of an aspergilloma is described. The patient, a 48 -year-old man, was apparently healthy except for mild alcoholic steatosis of the liver. A review of the literature revealed that 5 of the 14 previously reported cases {{of invasive}} aspergillosis in seemingly immunocompetent hosts were associated with liver disease. Immunologic investigation in this case revealed transient <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> during the acute illness and normal lymphocyte function. Assessment of polymorphonuclear leukocyte function, however, showed abnormalities of phagocytosis as well as impairment of intracellular bactericidal activity. These abnormalities may have contributed to a relative immunodeficiency.

40|$|Tumor cell-membrane antigens did not elicit {{specific}} intradermal {{reactions in}} cows with lymphoma and were therefore not effective in identifying animals with tumor. Sixty-two percent (8 / 13) of cows with lymphoma in the advanced stages of disease responded poorly to the intradermal injection of a nonspecific mitogen (PHA-M) and normal lymphoid cell extracts. This finding {{may explain the}} lack of response to the tumor cell extracts that some cows with lymphoma and indicates the presence of immune deficits in animals with lymphoma. Six of eight animals with tumor and poor cutaneous sensitivity had sera that inhibited the blastogenesis of normal lymphocytes.

Staphylococcal carriage was frequent. Because of variation in the flora between this and other reported groups, ongoing bacteriologic surveillance could be a useful guide to initial antibiotic therapy. Differences in the pattern of immune reaction in this group when compared to different addict groups suggest a difference in antigenic stimulation, possibly as a result of differences in bacteriologic exposure...|$|E
40|$|T cells {{responsive}} to macrophages (M phi) in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR) contain those cells {{that can be}} induced to proliferate by soluble antigens. Negative solution (5 -bromo- 2 - deoxyuridine and light) of T cells activated by autologous M phi also removed those cells required for reactivity to Candida albicans and purified protein derivative. Positive selection of T cells {{responsive to}} autologous M phi yields a population that is simultaneously enriched in antigen reactivity. Some patients demonstrating <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> and diminished in vitro blast transformation in response to soluble antigen also lack T cells responsive to the AMLR to M phi. When considered in conjunction with previously reported data, these findings indicate the AMLR occurring between T cells and M phi {{in the absence of}} soluble antigen represents self recognition occurring between antigen-reactive T cells and antigen-presenting M phi...|$|E
40|$|A 30 -year-old {{man with}} {{recurrent}} sinopulmonary infections, eventually fatal, {{was found to}} have common variable immunodeficiency. In addition to low serum immunoglobulin concentrations he also had lymphopenia and cell-mediated immunodeficiency as shown by <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> and a poor lymphocyte response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in vitro. However, intradermal injection of PHA produced a vigorous cutaneous response, showing that some cell-mediated responsiveness remained. The responsiveness of his lymphocytes to PHA was restored towards normal (confirmed by chromosome studies) by the addition of a small number of normal leukocytes to cultures; thus a reversible functional defect in his T-lymphocytes was revealed. Experiments indicated that the defect was cellular and not due to serum factors and it was concluded that normal leukocytes restored a missing factor to the patient's T-lymphocytes. Although counts of macrophage precursor cells in the bloodstream were low, thus contributing to the immunodeficiency, this could not have caused the reduced PHA response.

40|$|Immunologic {{defects in}} {{patients}} with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis vary but generally include impaired cell-mediated immunity. Mononuclear leukocyte accumulation at cellular-immune inflammatory sites is important to host defense against microbial invasion. The mononuclear leukocytes of a patient with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> failed to migrate in vitro toward two chemotactic stimuli—lymphocyte-derived chemotactic factor and C 5 a. After treatment with transfer factor the patient's mononuclear leukocytes responded to both chemotactic factors. She also developed a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to Candida antigen, but even after treatment her lymphocytes failed to produce chemotactic factor in response to Candida antigen. These data suggest that defective mononuclear chemotactic function may result in hypersusceptibility to infection with Candida albicans and that transfer factor may enhance mononuclear leukocyte chemotactic responsiveness.

40|$|Patients with end stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) have defects in various host defense {{mechanisms}} including phagocytosis, complements, humoral mediated immune response (HMIR), and cell-mediated immune response (CMIR) (1, 2). Clinical evidence supporting defective CMIR in ESRD {{is a higher}} inci-dence of malignancy than normal, <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy,</b> decreased immune response to vaccine, and higher carrier state after hepatitis B viral infection(1). Quantitative as well as qualitative defect of CMIR has been demonstrated in ESRD patients(1 - 5). Data regarding the effect of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment on the quantita-tive defect of CMIR have not been established(6 - 8). Currently, there are scarce data regarding the immu-nologic tests of the qualitative defect in CAPD-treated patients. Indeed, {{on the basis of}} immunological test, the qualitative abnormalities of CMIR comprise three degrees of severity including abnormal response to delayed hypersensitivity skin test, impairment in mixed lymphocyte culture test, and defect in lymphocyte activation test(9). The present study was performed to exam-ine the status of CMIR in ESRD patients prior to and after 6 months of CAPD treatment...|$|E

The incidence of positive prick tests to common allergens was no different for subjects with extrinsic allergic alveolitis. EAA, caused by avian exposure than the whole group. Positive immediate weal and flare reactions following skin prick testing with avian antigen occurred in 22 subjects and was closely correlated with atopy. However, when the same antigen was administered intradermally, 69 subjects developed an immediate (15 min) weal and flare reaction which did not correlate with atopy, instead, the weal diameter correlated significantly with the serum IgG antibody titre against pigeon serum gamma-globulin antigen, and furthermore, the higher grades of reaction were highly selective for subjects with EAA. Ten subjects, all with strong early intradermal skin reactions, developed a late (4 - 6 h) skin reaction; this was again highly selective for EAA.

40|$|Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease characterized by telangiectasia, progressive ataxia, sinopulmonary infection, hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, and a combined immunodeficiency, usually consisting of selective IgA and IgG, deficiencies, <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy,</b> and often depressed but not absent in vitro lymphocyte responsiveness. Reviewing {{the medical records}} of 50 patients with AT during 1975 through 1998 admitted to our center, we have noted the following results: {{the mean age of}} the patients was 8. 3 (range 3 to 14) years, parents of 33 patients were consanguinous, and the sex ratio was 6 : 5, occuring more in boys than in girls. All 50 patients showed cerebellar ataxia and telangiectasia, 67 % were mentally retarded, and 75 % have had sinobronchitis and pulmonary infections. 36 patients were tested for ccj-fetoprotein, all of whom showed a positive test.

40|$|Immunological {{abnormalities}} in sarcoidosis {{have been}} previously described. <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> {{to a wide}} variety of antigens first prompted the suggestion that the underlying defect may be of importance in the aetiology or pathogenesis of the disorder. The thymus derived lymphocytes appear to be particularly affected, and both quantitative and qualitative in vitro defects have been described in these cells in sarcoidosis patients. We have quantitatively investigated T and B cells in a series of 52 sarcoidosis patients, and our results indicate that, as a group, sarcoidosis patients have lower mean total lymphocyte counts and lower T cell counts than the control series in agreement and with other reports. We found no difference between B cells in the sarcoidosis and control groups. The quantitative abnormalities detected did not correlate with any of the clinical parameters which were investigated [...] stage of disease, duration of the disease, treatment regime, and activity of disease [...] and there was a considerable overlap between the results obtained in sarcoidosis patients and the controls.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS) {{in central}} Africa a prospective study was done in Kigali, Rwanda, where Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is endemic. During a 4 week period, 26 patients (17 males and 9 females) were diagnosed. 16 patients had opportunistic infections, associated with KS in only 2; 1 had multifocal KS alone; and 9 had clinical conditions consistent with prodromes of AIDS. All patients had severe T-cell defects characterised by <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy,</b> a striking {{decrease in the number}} of helper T cells, and a decreased OKT 4 :OKT 8 ratio (mean 0. 27). 21 of the 22 adult patients were living in urban centres and many of them were in the middle to upper income bracket. Most of the men were promiscuous heterosexuals and 43 % of the females were prostitutes. No patient had a history of homosexuality, intravenous drug abuse, or transfusion in the previous 5 years. This study suggest that AIDS is present in central Africa as an entity probably unrelated to the well-known endemic African KS. An association of an urban environment, a relatively high income, and heterosexual promiscuity could be a risk factor for AIDS in Africa. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is {{the most}} common {{opportunistic}} infection in African patients who die from AIDS, yet the stage of immunodeficiency at which TB develops is uncertain. We studied the immune status of HIV-infected outpatients with pulmonary TB in relation to their clinical presentation in a cross-sectional study of 216 HIV-seropositive and 146 HIV-seronegative ambulatory incident cases of smear-positive and culture-positive pulmonary TB in Kinshasa, Zaire. HIV-seropositive and seronegative patients had median CD 4 lymphocyte counts of 316. 5 /muL and 830. 5 /muL, respectively. Of the HIV-seropositive patients, 32 9 % had less than 200 CD 4 lymphocytes/muL, 37 % between 200 and 499, and 30. 1 % 500 or more. Clinical AIDS, as defined by the WHO clinical case-definition ora modified version, was of similar limited use as a predictor of immunodeficiency. Among HIV-seropositive patients, oral candidosis, lymphopenia, a negative tuberculin purified protein derivative test, and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> were strongly associated with CD 4 counts of less than 200 /muL, and seemed to be better markers of immune dysfunction. We conclude that pulmonary TB develops across a broad spectrum of HIV-induced immunodeficiency and that a diagnosis of pulmonary TB is of limited use as a marker of stage of HIV disease in African HIV-infected outpatients...|$|E
40|$|Two {{patients}} with non-miliary pulmonary tuberculosis developed a syndrome resembling adult respiratory distress following initiation of drug treatment. They were studied clinically {{and with a}} representative range of in vitro and in vivo tests of Immune function. Both were alcoholic, malnourished and presented with radiologicaUy widespread, smear-positive disease and lym-phocytopenia. One had <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> in vivo and profound reduction on mononuclear cell proliferative and interferon responses to tuberculoproteln (PPD) in vitro; the other patient, who died two weeks after starting treatment, had relatively normal values for these measures of cell-mediated immunity. In both cases there was a progressive increase during treatment, in peri-pheral blood lymphocyte counts, skin reactions and in vitro cellular responses to PPD, and a sudden rise in ESR {{at the time of}} their deterioration. We propose that the reactions may represent local manifestations of heightened delayed hypersensttivity, mounted by increasing numbers of 'resuscitated ' lymphocytes against immunogenic cell wall substances released from dying tubercle bacilli in patients whose level of cellular immunity is being enhanced as a result of chemotherapy. The likelihood of an acute respiratory reaction during treatment may therefore depend on the bacillary load, the extent of lung disease present, and its severity may be related to the pre-treatment immune status of the patient...|$|E
40|$|When all {{residents}} of a 460 -bed nursing home were tuberculin tested after discovery of a fatal case of pulmonary tuberculosis, 34 % reacted, including 6 % who gave boosted reactions. Twenty-four of 262 (9. 2 %) nonreactors converted to tuberculin reactors 6 months after exposure. Six of the convertors were among the 21 % of the residents who were originally considered anergic {{on the basis of}} negative Candida and Trichophyton skin tests. These results confirm the observation that aged nursing home residents have lower rates of tuberculin reactivity than earlier in their lives, and that tuberculosis is a nosocomial infection in nursing homes. However, generalized immune senescence cannot be invoked as a reason for apparent susceptibility because the very marker of infection — the development of tuberculin reaction — is evidence of some degree of immune competence. Furthermore, the presence of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> as clinically determined does not predict inability to develop an immune response to the tubercle bacillus. THE prevalence of tuberculosis is increasing among el-derly persons in this country (1), particularly in the nursing home population. William Stead has provided dra-matic evidence of nosocomial spread of the disease among nursing home residents in Arkansas (2). Welty and col-leagues (3) have made similar observations in a chronic care population. The cause for the apparent increase is not clear...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the pathogenetic significance of impaired cellular immunity in {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD), we have measured the cutaneous responsiveness to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) among 58 patients with IBD, 33 with Crohn's disease and 25 with ulcerative colitis, 63 of their clinically normal relatives, 24 additional ileitis and colitis patients who had undergone resection of all visibly diseased bowel, and 23 control subjects. <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> to DNCB was demonstrated among 70 % of the patients with CD and 48 % of those with UC, as against only 9 % of the controls (p less than 0. 001). There was no increased incidence of anergy among either 44 first-degree relatives (7 %) or 19 spouses (3 %), nor was there any special proclivity toward anergy among six pairs of patients with familial inflammatory bowel disease. In Crohn's disease, anergy was still present after bowel resection in six of 10 patients (60 %), while in ulcerative colitis anergy was found after colectomy in only two of 14 patients (14 %). Our {{data suggest that the}} immune defect in patients with inflammatory bowel disease may be a secondary phenomenon. In ulcerative colitis, the defect appears to reverse after colectomy, but in Crohn's disease it persists despite resection.

40|$|Thymus-derived {{lymphocyte}} (T-cell) function, {{as determined}} in vivo by cutaneous reactivity to several antigens and in vitro by responsiveness to mitogens and antigens, was assessed in 14 patients infected {{with a variety}} of fungal organisms. While all patients manifested a normal frequency of peripheral blood T cells, only seven patients reacted to {{at least one of the}} antigens used for cutaneous testing and demonstrated normal in vitro T proliferative responses. Three patients exhibited <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> but normal in vitro T-cell reactivity while four patients demonstrated persistent anergy and marked in vitro T-cell hyporeactivity which was independent of activity of infection, concurrent medication, or any associated disorders. The marked diminution of in vitro T-cell reactivity noted for these later four patients was not due to a deletion of antigen- or mitogen-reactive cells. Thus, patients' cells which had been initially cultured for 7 days without any mitogenic or antigenic stimulus and which were subsequently washed and recultured with phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or histoplasmin demonstrated a marked increase in their responsiveness. Moreover, this reactivity noted for recultured cells could be suppressed by a nonphagocytic, nonadherent, nonimmunoglobulin-bearing, sheep red blood cell rosette-forming population of cells isolated from the fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the same patient. While these "regulator" T cells were capable of suppressing T-proliferative responses to antigens and mitogens, they did not diminish pokeweed mitogen-induced immunoglobulin synthesis by normal bone marrow-derived lymphocytes. Patients in whom suppressor "T" cells were found were at risk for relapsing, disseminated fungal infection...|$|E
40|$|While {{investigating}} {{the effect on}} B cells of repetitive in vivo immunization with tetanus toxoid (TT), we observed the subsequent development of specific anergy for T cell delayed hypersensitivity (DTH) to TT. This appeared approximately 35 d {{after a series of}} five booster immunizations. Concurrently, in vitro T cell blastogenic responses were preserved. Serum obtained when the skin tests were nonreactive demonstrated a profound inhibitory activity on T cell reactivity. This activity was shown to be anti-antibody activity that was both anti-F(ab) ' 2 and, specifically, anti-TT F(ab) ' 2. It blocked binding of TT to a pool of allogeneic antibodies and also inhibited allogeneic antigen-specific T cell blastogenesis. Thus, we could identify activity in the serum of hyperimmunized individuals that appeared auto-anti-idiotypic (anti-id) and represented a single or family of major crossreacting idiotypes (id) for TT. The expression of the auto-anti-id correlated with the loss of T cell reactivity in vivo and in vitro. Subsequent examinations revealed persistent, specific <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> beyond six months, which was then associated with a failure of T cells to react with antigen in vitro. Mixing experiments with cells from these later times and cryopreserved autologous cells obtained prior to hyperimmunization revealed there had been the development of antigen-specific T suppressor cells. Thus, in vivo DTH tolerance following hyperimmunization was associated with an inhibitory serum activity that appeared to be anti-id. Persistence of tolerance (greater than 6 mo) occurred with the development of T suppressor cells...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a lethal course of an {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in a young female patient. She had spent her vacancies six years before diagnosis in Haiti, where a sexual intercourse with a Haitian man had occurred. Leading clinical symptoms consisted of recurrent Herpes simplex infections of the genital and perianal region as well as unexplained high temperatures. There were some typical laboratory and immunologic features of this disease with leukopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy,</b> a reduction of peripheral T-lymphocytes (OKT 3) and an almost complete loss of OKT 4 (helper cells) positive lymphocytes. The mitogenic response upon stimulation with allogeneic cells (MLC) or with the mitogens PHA, Con A and PWM was significantly reduced. There was no measurable interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) secretion of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Several immunostimulators (thymopentin, inosiplex, bestatin) were tested in lymphocyte proliferation assays in vitro. The mitogenic response could not be enhanced by neither of these substances. A clinical trial with Delimmun (inosiplex) for 14 days did not show any clinical or immunologic improvement in this patient. The intravenous application of high dose immunoglobulin G was without any observable effect. The proliferation inducing capacity of a highly purified IL- 2 preparation on the AIDS cells in vitro led us to a clinical trial with this substance. We applied 100 Bödeker units of IL- 2 per kg body weight and day subcutaneously for 16 days. A therapeutical effect, however, could not be observed. Cell marker analyses did not show significant changes in lymphocyte subpopulation composition under IL- 2 therapy. There {{was an increase in}} the spontaneous cell proliferation 14 days after start of IL- 2 therapy. The PHA- and IL- 2 response of the AIDS cells, however, was unchanged. It cannot be excluded that an administration of IL- 2 in earlier stages of AIDS may have beneficial effects...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} indocyanine green (ICG) angiographic {{features and}} evaluate the extent of choroidal involvement in proven cases of posterior ocular sarcoidosis. DESIGN: Nonrandomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen patients (14 females, 5 males; average age, 56 +/- 4 years) with clinically typical posterior sarcoidosis (biopsy-proven in 6 cases and fulfilling the other diagnostic criteria in 13 cases) participated, with 10 control subjects (average age, 48 +/- 7 years). Criteria for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis were a positive biopsy result or the presence {{of at least three}} of the following four criteria: elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, elevated lysozyme, <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy,</b> and hilar lymph node enlargement. INTERVENTION: Indocyanine green angiography was performed according to a standard angiographic protocol used in inflammatory disorders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Indocyanine green angiographic features and proportion of choroidal inflammatory involvement were measured. RESULTS: Indocyanine green angiographic features could be classified into four main patterns. The first pattern is hypofluorescent choroidal lesions in the early and intermediate phases, irregularly distributed, invisible on funduscopy or fluorescein angiography, and localized in the midperiphery (63 % of patients), in the macula (11 %) or in both regions (26 %) with an average dot diameter of 0. 31 +/- 0. 03 disc diameters. These lesions either became isofluorescent in the late phase of the angiogram (Type 1, present in all patients) or remained hypofluorescent (Type 2, present in 84 % of patients). The second pattern is focal hyperfluorescent pinpoints visible in the intermediate and late phases (in 89 % of patients). The third pattern is fuzzy choroidal vessels with leakage in the intermediate phase of the angiogram, and the fourth pattern is diffuse late zonal choroidal hyperfluorescence with staining in the late phase of the angiogram, both features being present in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Indocyanine green angiography allowed the authors to assess and quantify the hitherto unknown extent of choroidal involvement in ocular sarcoidosis.

We investigated the mechanisms for acquired pure red cell aplasia and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy</b> in a patient with the chronic T gamma-lymphoproliferative disease (T gamma-LPD) syndrome. Patient marrow erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) were 17 +/- 9 % of control and were selectively increased to 88 - 102 % of control after marrow T cell depletion. Patient Leu 2 + suppressor T cells spontaneously produced high titers of human gamma-interferon and resulted in a concentration-dependent selective inhibition (74 - 91 %) of BFU-E when co-cultured with autologous or allogeneic marrow. Conditioned media (CM) derived from patient Leu 2 + T cells similarly inhibited growth of autologous or allogeneic marrow BFU-E. The inhibitory factor derived from patient CM was acid-labile (pH 2) and sensitive to trypsin; prior treatment of patient T cells with anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody plus complement abrogated the suppressive effect of T cell-derived CM. Patient {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) were unable to support growth of cultured interleukin 2 (IL 2) -dependent T cells, but responded to exogenous IL 2 in vitro with a 16 - 21 -fold augmentation, relative to control, in mitogen-induced proliferation. Antibodies to HTLV-I core proteins p 19 and p 24 but not to HTLV-III proteins were detected in patient serum by Western blotting; patient cultured PBMC stained (7 - 11 %) with antibodies to p 19 and p 24. Patient cultured PBMC demonstrated integrated HTLV-I genomic sequences by the Southern technique and expressed both specific HTLV-I genomic sequences by RNA dot blot plus reverse transcriptase activity. Utilizing a cloned DNA probe for the beta chain of the T cell receptor gene, patient PMBC demonstrated gene rearrangements providing presumptive evidence for clonality. The presence in serum of HTLV-I p 19 and p 24 antibodies, the expression of p 19 and p 24 core antigens on patient mononuclear cells, the evidence of HTLV-I proviral integration sequences and the expression of HTLV-I genomic sequences in patient cells, indicates infection with HTLV-I and raises the possibility of an etiologic link between human retrovirus infection and some instances of large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T gamma-LPD) ...|$|E
40|$|This report updates and {{supersedes}} previous recommendations (MMWR 1991; 40 [No. RR- 5]: 27 - 33) {{for the use}} of anergy {{skin testing}} in conjunction with purified protein derivative (PPD) -tuberculin skin testing of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In February 1997, CDC convened a meeting of consultants to discuss CURRENT information regarding anergy skin testing, PPD skin testing, and tuberculosis (TB) preventive therapy for HIV-infected persons. In formulating these recommendations, CDC considered the results of this meeting, as well as a review of published studies pertaining to PPD and anergy skin testing of persons who are infected with HIV. Isoniazid preventive therapy is effective in reducing the incidence of active TB among persons who have HIV infection and latent TB. Because of the complications associated with TB disease in HIV-infected persons, these persons must be screened for tuberculin infection. HIV-infected persons who have positive reactions to skin testing with PPD tuberculin should be evaluated to exclude active TB and offered preventive therapy with isoniazid if indicated. However, HIV-infected persons may have compromised ability to react to PPD-tuberculin skin testing, because HIV infection is associated with an elevated risk for <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anergy.</b> Anergy testing is a diagnostic procedure used to obtain information regarding the competence of the cellular immune system. When a clinician elects to use anergy testing as part of a multifactorial assessment of a person's risk for TB, the two Food and Drug Administration-approved Mantoux-method tests (mumps and Candida), used together, with cut-off diameters of 5 mm of induration, are recommended. Efforts to apply the results of anergy testing to preventive therapy decisions must be supplemented with information concerning the person's risk for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Factors limiting the usefulness of anergy skin testing include problems with standardization and reproducibility, the low risk for TB associated with a DIAGNOSIS of anergy, and the lack of apparent benefit of preventive therapy for groups of anergic HIV-infected persons. Therefore, the use of anergy testing in conjunction with PPD testing is no longer recommended routinely for screening programs for M. tuberculosis infection conducted among HIV-infected persons in the United States.
