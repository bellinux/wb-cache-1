5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city <b>could</b> <b>be</b> observed. While damage <b>could</b> <b>be</b> studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design <b>could</b> <b>be</b> determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E

5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} {{relatives}} of the Driscolls attempted to strike back at the Regulators. They obtained an indictment against many of the Regulators charging them with murder. The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses <b>could</b> <b>be</b> found, and no jury <b>could</b> <b>be</b> formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E

50|$|According to Frederick Howard Wines in {{his book}} Punishment and Reformation: A Study Of The Penitentiary System there were three main types of {{coercion}} employed in the torture chamber: Coercion by the cord, by water and by fire. There were five stages of torture that <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> applied to the accused: he <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> threatened with torture, he <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> taken to the torture chamber and been shown the instruments, he <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> undressed as if in preparation to be tied to the instrument, without actually being tied, he <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> tied to the instrument of torture but not actually getting tortured and finally he <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> tied to the instrument and tortured.|$|R

5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature <b>could</b> <b>be</b> detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search <b>could</b> <b>be</b> conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
