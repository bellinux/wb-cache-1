40|$|A {{process has}} been {{developed}} to manufacture biodegradable composite foams of poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and hydroxyapatite short fibers for use in bone regeneration. The processing technique allows the manufacture of three-dimensional foam scaffolds and involves {{the formation of a}} composite material consisting of a porogen material (either gelatin microspheres or salt particles) and hydroxyapatite short fibers embedded in a PLGA matrix. After the porogen is leached out, an open-cell composite foam remains which has a pore size and morphology defined by the porogen. By changing the weight fraction of the leachable component it was possible to produce composite foams with controlled porosities ranging from 0. 47 +/- 0. 02 to 0. 85 +/- 0. 01 (n = 3). Up to a polymer:fiber ratio of 7 : 6, short hydroxyapatite fibers served to reinforce low-porosity PLGA foams manufactured using gelatin microspheres as a porogen. Foams with a <b>compressive</b> <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> up to 2. 82 +/- 0. 63 MPa (n = 3) and a porosity of 0. 47 +/- 0. 02 (n = 3) were manufactured using a polymer:fiber weight ratio of 7 : 6. In contrast, high-porosity composite foams (up to 0. 81 +/- 0. 02, n = 3) suitable for cell seeding were not reinforced by the introduction of increasing quantities of hydroxyapatite short fibers.
