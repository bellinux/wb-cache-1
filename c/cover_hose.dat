50|$|The {{traditional}} {{solution is}} to use metal pipes to transfer water but these are costly to deliver and assemble. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) <b>covered</b> <b>hoses</b> and Nitrile rubber (NBR) <b>covered</b> <b>hoses</b> {{have a lot of}} advantages compared to metal pipes. It is easy to deliver, assemble and disassemble hoses and long sections of NBR- and TPU-covered hoses reduce the possibility of leakage in connecting parts. These large-diameter NBR- and TPU-covered hoses are called fracking hoses.|$|R
50|$|Fracking hoses are {{solutions}} {{derived from}} the fire hose industries. The fire hose manufacturers manufacture NBR or TPU <b>covered</b> <b>hoses</b> for fire fighting, water discharge, irrigation etc. The fracking industries borrowed the idea from the fire hose industries and use these hoses in fracking.|$|R
5000|$|Polybutadiene rubber {{may be used}} in {{the inner}} tube of hoses for sandblasting, along with natural rubber. The main idea is to {{increase}} resilience. This rubber can also be used in the <b>cover</b> of <b>hoses,</b> mainly pneumatic and water hoses.|$|R
5000|$|This product {{can be used}} {{to replace}} heavy metal power and data cables as well as make {{conductive}} fabrics and CNTs. Also used in improved lightweight EMI shielding and can be used as an elastomer <b>cover</b> for <b>hoses</b> and tubing.|$|R
2500|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} (CO2) {{extinguisher}} was invented (at {{least in the}} US) by the Walter Kidde Company in 1924 in response to Bell Telephone's request for an electrically non-conductive chemical for extinguishing the previously difficult-to-extinguish fires in telephone switchboards. It consisted of a tall metal cylinder containing [...] of CO2 with a wheel valve and a woven brass, cotton <b>covered</b> <b>hose,</b> with a composite funnel-like horn as a nozzle. CO2 is still popular today as it is an ozone-friendly clean agent and is used heavily in film and television production to extinguish burning stuntmen. [...] Carbon dioxide extinguishes fire mainly by displacing oxygen. It was once thought that it worked by cooling, although this effect on most fires is negligible. This characteristic is well known and {{has led to the}} widespread misuse of carbon dioxide extinguishers to rapidly cool beverages, especially beer.|$|R
50|$|Tie-up collar. Used for bulls {{and other}} cattle, {{these may be}} a chain (sometimes <b>covered</b> in plastic <b>hose),</b> or a collar of heavy leather or {{synthetic}} material fastened with a heavy duty buckle.|$|R
5000|$|A {{braiding}} machine is device, which interlaces {{at least three}} strands of yarns or wires to form a ropereinforced <b>hose,</b> <b>covered</b> power cords, and some types of lace. [...] Materials include natural and synthetic yarns, metal wires, leather tapes and others.|$|R
50|$|Sleeving {{provided}} on rolls is often {{cut to length}} and used to cover radioactive material {{to prevent the spread}} of contamination during handling. Typically made of PVC or Polyurethane film formed into a flexible tube, sleeving can <b>cover</b> pipes, <b>hoses,</b> and cables to provide a protective layer. To handle odd-sized objects, adequately sized sleeving is opened so an object can be inserted into the tube which is then twisted to enclose the item at both ends. Tape can be used to secure the twists in place, and then cut free for handling. This is commonly referred to as “horsetailing”.|$|R
30|$|Fashion {{accessories}} such as handbags {{could well}} be targeted as sustainable items. Handbags are in part determined by their constant functions. For instance, many global brands, i.e. Freitag (Swiss), Sourcedlife (UK), Frombin (Korea), Shutoko (Japan), Vaho (Spain), and Looptwork (USA), have dealt in sustainable concepts by using upcycling materials for their bag designs, such as signboards, tents, seat belts, car seats, truck <b>covers,</b> parachutes, fire <b>hoses,</b> and coffee sacks. In 2009, French luxury brand, Hermès, launched an upcycled brand, ‘Petit h’, made with one-of-a-kind pieces of jewellery, accessories, toys, and even furniture items crafted from the atelier’s cast-off scraps of leather, silk scarves, porcelain, enamel, and hardware (Hermes’ up-cycled Petit h concept pops up in Costa Mesa. Los Angeles Times, June 12, 2014).|$|R
