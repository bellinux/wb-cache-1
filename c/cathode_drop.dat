50|$|This {{very high}} power {{dissipation}} in the tube heats the glass walls to {{a temperature of}} several hundred degrees Celsius, and any dirt and impurities within are drawn off in the gasified form by the vacuum pump. The greatest impurities that are driven off this way are the gases that coat the inside wall of the tubing by adsorption, mainly oxygen, carbon dioxide, and especially water vapor. The current also heats the electrode metal to over 600oC, producing a bright orange incandescent color. The cathodes are prefabricated hollow metal shells with a small opening (sometimes a ceramic donut aperture) which contains in the interior surface of the shell a light dusting of a cold cathode low work function powder (usually a powder ceramic molar eutectic point mixture including BaCO2), combined with other alkaline earth oxides, which reduces to BaO2 when heated to about 500 degrees F, and reduces the work function of the electrode for cathodic emission. Barium Oxide has a work function of roughly 2 eV whereas tungsten at room temperature has a work function 100 times more, or 4.0 eV. This represents the <b>cathode</b> <b>drop</b> or electron energy required to remove electrons {{from the surface of}} the cathode. This avoids the necessity of using a hot wire thermoelectric cathode such as is used in conventional fluorescent lamps. And for that reason, neon tubes are extremely long lived when properly processed, in contrast to fluorescent tubing, because there is no wire filament as there is in a fluorsecent tube to burn out like a common light bulb. The principal purpose of doing this is to purify the interior of the tube before the tube is sealed off so that when it is operated, these gases and impurities are not driven off and released by the plasma and the heat generated into the sealed tube, which would quickly burn the metal cathodes and mercury droplets (if pumped with argon/mercury) and oxidize the interior gases and cause immediate tube failure. The more thorough the purification of the tube is, the longer lasting and stable the tube will be in actual operation. Once these gases and impurities are liberated under pre-filling bombardment into the tube interior they are quickly evacuated by the pump.|$|E

If the experimental values of 4000 amperes per square centimeter, and 10 volts are used for the current density at the cathode, and the <b>cathode</b> <b>drop</b> in a mercury arc, values for the electric field existing at the surface of the cathode can be determined for varying percentages of the current carried by positive ions. If 5 % of the current at the cathode is carried by positive ions, the field existing at the surface of the cathode exceeds 5 × 10 ^(5) volts per cm.

40|$|Reprinted from THE PHYSICAL REVIEW, Vol. 37, No. 5, pp. 634 - 637, March 1, 1931 STRAIN AND DIAMAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY [...] ABSTRACT [...] The {{magnetic}} susceptibility of copper and, silver wires has been {{measured by the}} Gouy method before and after various annealing processes. Also, the susceptibility has been measured before and after straining specimens beyond the elastic limit, the strains being either twists or stretches. The susceptibilities are found to he increased, {{by as much as}} 20 percent for copper and 3 percent for silver by annealing at red heat for 15 minutes in an atmosphere of CO 2. This increase is probably due to release of occluded gases or to oxidation or recombination of impurities. Straining the specimens beyond the elastic limit is found to produce no measurable change of susceptibility. Francis Bitter has observed a large effect due to straining these metals beyond the elastic limit. The reason for Bitter's results is not clear, but it is pointed out that no effect is to be expected in copper, at least, because crystals of this metal are isotropic magnetically and have no observable magnetostriction. THE MOBILITY OF POSITIVE IONS IN FLAMES [...] ABSTRACT [...] The mobility was calculated from measured values of the current density, <b>cathode</b> <b>drop</b> of potential, and the thickness of the layer at the cathode in which the potential varies rapidly. The excess of ionization over recombination in the layer was assumed to be proportional to (1 —x/x 0 m, where x is the distance from the cathode, xi the thickness of the layer at the cathode, and m is a constant. J. J. Thomson supposed that in = 0, and P. E. Boucher took in = 1. The value calculated for the mobility depends on the value assumed for m. The results give, with m 2, a value of 1. 8; with m = 3, a value of 1. 07 cm/sec. per volt/cm for the mobility. It is found that the mobility is the same for salts of Rb, Cs, and K, and that it does not depend on the concentration of the salt. A small increase of mobility with electric intensity is indicated by the results...|$|E

40|$|Ignitrons are {{electrical}} switching devices that operate at switching times {{that are on}} the order of microseconds, can conduct high currents of thousands of amps, and are capable of holding off tens of thousands of volts between pulses. They consist of a liquid metal pool within an evacuated tube that serves both the cathode and the source of atoms and electrons for an arc discharge. Facing the liquid metal pool is an anode suspended above the cathode, with a smaller ignitor electrode tip located just above the surface of the cathode. The ignitron can be charged to significant voltages, with a potential difference of thousands of volts between anode and cathode. When an ignition pulse is delivered from the ignitor electrode to the cathode, a small amount of the liquid metal is vaporized and subsequently ionized, with the high voltage between the anode and cathode causing the gas {{to bridge the gap between}} the two electrodes. The electrons and ions move rapidly towards the anode and cathode, respectively, with the ions liberating still more atoms from the liquid metal cathode surface as a high-current plasma arc discharge is rapidly established. This arc continues in a self-sustaining fashion until the potential difference between the anode and <b>cathode</b> <b>drops</b> below some critical value. Ignitrons have been used in a variety of pulsed power applications, including the railroad industry, industrial chemical processing, and high-power arc welding. In addition, they might prove useful in terrestrial power grid applications, serving as high-current fault switches, quickly shunting dangerous high-current or high-voltage spikes safely to ground. The motivation for this work stemmed from the fact that high-power, high-reliability, pulsed power devices like the ignitron have been used for ground testing in-space pulsed electric thruster technologies, and the continued use of ignitrons could prove advantageous to the future development and testing of such thrusters. Previous ignitron designs have used mercury as the liquid metal cathode, owing to its presence as a liquid at room temperatures and a vapor pressure of 10 Pa (75 mtorr) at room temperature. While these are favorable properties, there are obvious environmental and personal safety concerns with the storage, handling, and use of mercury and its compounds. The purpose of the present work was to fabricate and test an ignitron that used as its cathode an alternate liquid metal that was safe to handle and store. To that end, an ignitron test article that used liquid gallium as the cathode material was developed and tested. Gallium is a metal that has a melting temperature of 29. 76 C, which is slightly above room temperature, and a boiling point of over 2, 300 C at atmospheric pressure. This property makes gallium the element with the largest relative difference between melting and boiling points. Gallium has a limited role in biology, and when ingested, it will be subsequently processed by the body and expelled rather than accumulating to toxic levels. The next section of this Technical Memorandum (TM) provides background information on the development of mercury-based ignitrons, which serves as the starting point for the development of the gallium-based variant. Afterwards, the experimental hardware and setup used in proof-of-concept testing of a basic gallium ignitron are presented. Experimental data, consisting of discharge voltage and current waveforms as well as high-speed imaging of the gallium arc discharge in the gallium ignitron test article, are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the concept. Discussion of the data and suggestions on improvements for future iterations of the design are presented in the final two sections of this TM...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} finite-element method simulation results of current distribution in an aluminum electrolytic cell. The model uses {{one quarter of}} the cell as a computational domain assuming longitudinal (along the length of the cell) and transverse axes of symmetries. The purpose of this work is to closely examine the impact of steel and copper collector bars on the cell current distribution. The findings indicated that an inclined steel collector bar (φ = 1 °) can save up to 10 – 12 mV from the cathode lining in comparison to a horizontal 100 mm × 150 -mm steel collector bar. It is predicted that a copper collector bar has a much higher potential of saving <b>cathode</b> voltage <b>drop</b> (CVD) and has a greater impact on the overall current distribution in the cell. A copper collector bar with 72 % of cathode length and size of 100 mm × 150 mm is predicted to have more than 150 mV savings in cathode lining. In addition, a significant improvement in current distribution over the entire cathode surface is achieved when compared with a similar size of steel collector bar. There is a reduction of more than 70 % in peak current density value due to the higher conductivity of copper. Comparisons between steel and copper collector bars with different sizes are discussed in terms CVD and current density distribution. The most important aspect of the findings is to recognize the influence of copper collector bars on the current distribution in molten metal. Lorentz fields are evaluated at different sizes of steel and copper collector bars. The simulation predicts that there is 50 % decrease in Lorentz force due to the improvement in current distribution in the molten metal...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} theoretical and experimental studies on an argon-fed multichannel hollow cathode. In particular, it investigates the physical processes which take place inside the hollow cavity. These include the <b>cathode</b> voltage <b>drop,</b> the surface temperature and the plasma penetration depth. An {{insight into the}} ignition mechanisms is outlined as well. Moreover, the erosion process is studied by measuring the erosion rate of the cathode walls after continuous operations at fixed mass flow rate and discharge current. Thus, this research {{is divided into two}} main activities: the experimental campaign and the theoretical study. For the experimental study, a multichannel hollow cathode with a main tube inner diameter of 10 mm and 36 rods was designed. It was tested at discharge currents in the range 20 - 160 A and at mass flow rates between 1 and 5 mg/s. It was propelled with argon gas. In order to identify the nominal operative points, the cathode underwent a characterization test which was followed by an endurance test at continuous operations for 100 hours. This test aimed at understanding the erosion mechanism of the cathode. Then, a second characterization test was performed, which permitted to assess the effect of the erosion on the cathode performance. The cathode surface temperature was measured at different values of discharge current and mass flow rate. The measurements were gathered by using an optical pyrometer that was mounted outside the vacuum chamber. Temperature profiles with respect to the cathode axis are presented. It was found that the surface temperature of the multichannel hollow cathode is different from that in the single channel hollow cathode, since the maximum value is placed at the cathode exit cross section for all operative conditions. The ignition process of the cathode was investigated. The cathode was capable to sustain a discharge current of 20 A with a few channels ignited. In addition, it was noted that a specic discharge current value exists to ignite all channels. This value is considered as the transition point between the multi-step ionization process and the single-step ionization process. However, since a plasma diagnostic system was not available during the experimental campaign, this hypothesis cannot be proved in this study. In addition, an insight into the design and manufacture of the multichannel hollow cathode is given. The design procedure is outlined, as well as the method for scaling-down the cathode dimensions. The assembly process is described with a focus on the technical issues that were solved. The second part of this research deals with two theoretical models which were developed and validated with the experimental data. The first model {{is the product of a}} joint research programme between the RIAME-MAI and Alta. It can be adapted to multichannel hollow cathodes with an indefinite number of channels. Cathode operative parameters such as the <b>cathode</b> voltage <b>drop</b> and the surface temperature are calculated. In addition, the model is capable to predict the main plasma parameters: the electron and ion temperatures, the particles number density and the plasma potential. The results are provided as functions of the cathode axial coordinate. Furthermore, the erosion rate of the cathode is computed for each cross section, thus providing the effective channel erosion along its length. The second numerical model was developed during the experimental campaign and represents a valid basis for future improvements. It is a mono-dimensional code, therefore the multichannel hollow conguration is studied by adapting the plasma penetration length in case of many channels to a single channel hollow conguration. The model is capable to predict the discharge voltage and the surface temperature as functions of the cathode axis. However, it requires the discharge current profile as an input. Moreover, it calculates the electron temperature and particles number density for each cathode cross sections...|$|R

A lower efficiency of about 94 % is obtained in ethylene carbonate containing electrolytes. It is suggested that {{an increase in the}} thickness of the passive film formed on the Li electrode is responsible for the capacity decay {{at the end of the}} cycling life. The rate of self-discharge at room temperature for a fully charged cell is about 5 - 8 % per month.

40|$|The Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is a {{promising}} energy converting technology for powering automotives and electrical equipment using hydrogen gas as fuel and producing water {{as the only}} exhaust. The active carbon-supported platinum catalyst present in the electrodes limits the maximum power generation in state-of-the-art PEMFCs due to platinum’s poor activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) taking place at the <b>cathode.</b> Further, performance <b>drop</b> due to limited mass-transfer capacity of the electrode structure, as well as insufficient electrode life-time are other bottlenecks of the PEMFC technology. The aim of this thesis is to use and develop methods for preparation of active catalyst and catalyst support materials to be evaluated under lab-scale PEMFC conditions {{in order to find}} catalyst materials that improve the PEMFC performance. Nano-sized platinum particles have been synthesized using the water-in-oil microemulsion route and the phase transfer method (PTM). Platinum nanoparticles of different shape and diameter have been obtained through additions of stabilizing agents, such as alkylthiol and alkylamines, with different chain lengths. Either spherical or rod-shaped nanocrystals were obtained with the water-in-oil microemulsion whereas exclusively homogenous spherical nanoparticles were produced with the PTM. It was found that the size of the platinum nanoparticles prepared with the PTM decreased with increasing hydrocarbon chain length when stabilized with alkylamines. A non-ionic block-copolymer was employed for preparation of ordered mesoporous silica materials, which were used as templates for synthesis of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) materials using the nanocasting route with furfuryl alcohol as the carbon precursor. High structural long-range order and large pore volume of the OMC were obtained. Further, by using electron tomography it is shown that the water-in-oil microemulsion technique is applicable for in-situ preparation of platinum nanocrystals inside ordered mesoporous carbon. Electrode materials were prepared by deposition of platinum nanoparticles onto porous support materials of either porous carbon or titania powders. The electrochemical performance of the electrode materials was evaluated under lab-scale PEMFC conditions and compared with a commercial platinum/carbon reference material. Differences in ORR activity were observed and could be related to platinum nanoparticle size to some extent, but also to the choice and composition of the support material. The diameter of the nanoparticles increased considerably during PEMFC operation, which indicates that efforts to decrease the size of the active catalyst below 3 nm have limited benefits on the PEMFC operation. Electrode materials composed of titania-supported platinum mixed with carbon showed almost as high ORR activity as the conventional platinum/carbon materials combined with significantly improved life-time properties...|$|R
