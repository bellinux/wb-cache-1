50|$|<b>Cartazolate</b> (SQ-65,396) {{is a drug}} of the pyrazolopyridine class. It acts as a GABAA {{receptor}} positive allosteric modulator at the barbiturate {{binding site}} of the complex and has anxiolytic effects in animals. It is also known {{to act as an}} adenosine antagonist at the A1 and A2 subtypes and as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. <b>Cartazolate</b> was tested in human clinical trials and was found to be efficacious for anxiety but was never marketed. It was developed by a team at E.R. Squibb and Sons in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Condensation of aminopyrazole (1) with {{diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate}} (2) gives {{the product of}} the addition-elimination (3). The product tautomerizes spontaneously to the hydroxypyridine (4). The {{hydroxyl}} group is then converted to the chloro-derivative by means of phosphorus oxychloride (5). Displacement of halogen by n-butylamine gives the antidepressant compound <b>cartazolate.</b> Displacement of halogen by the basic nitrogen of acetone hydrazone affords the antidepressant etazolate.|$|E
