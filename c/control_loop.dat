25|$|Tuning a <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> is the {{adjustment}} of its control parameters (proportional band/gain, integral gain/reset, derivative gain/rate) to the optimum {{values for the}} desired control response. Stability (no unbounded oscillation) is a basic requirement, but beyond that, different systems have different behavior, different applications have different requirements, and requirements may conflict with one another.|$|E
40|$|The beam {{transfer}} function changes during the RHIC ramp. The {{response of the}} RF <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> changes as a result.

Zander and Christian Kothe introduces the term passive BCI. Next to active and reactive BCI that are used for directed control, passive BCIs allow for assessing and interpreting changes in the user state during Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In a secondary, implicit <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> the computer system adapts to its user improving its usability in general.|$|E
25|$|Let's {{take the}} example of a robotic arm, that can be moved and {{positioned}} by a <b>control</b> <b>loop.</b> An electric motor may lift or lower the arm, depending on forward or reverse power applied, but power cannot be a simple function of position because of the inertial mass of the arm, forces due to gravity, external forces on the arm such as a load to lift or work to be done on an external object.|$|E
25|$|For example, a PID loop is used {{to control}} the {{temperature}} of an electric resistance furnace where the system has stabilized. Now when the door is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate for error by introducing another error in the positive direction. This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after {{the opening of the}} door for the time the <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> typically needs to reheat the furnace.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentally, {{there are}} two types of <b>control</b> loops: open <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> and closed <b>loop</b> (feedback) <b>control.</b> Control theory is {{concerned}} only with closed <b>loop</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R

50|$|TCP {{transparent}} proxies involve {{breaking up}} of long end-to-end <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> to several smaller <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> by intercepting and relaying TCP connections within the network. By adopting this procedure, they {{allow for the}} TCP flows to have a shorter reaction time to packet losses which may occur within the network and thus guarantees a higher throughput.|$|R
25|$|Perceptual {{control theory}} (PCT) is a {{psychological}} theory of animal and human behavior originated by William T. Powers. In contrast with other theories {{of psychology and}} behavior, which assume that behavior {{is a function of}} perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT postulates that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions. In contrast with engineering control theory, the reference variable for each negative feedback <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by an external agent changing the setpoint of the controller. PCT also applies to nonliving autonomic systems.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, 1994, the DC-X rose {{once again}} for the first flight of second series after {{additional}} SDIO funding was received. Operating with a full propellent load, the flight tested the radar altimeter in <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> and reached an altitude of 870 m during a 136-second flight. Demonstrating an unplanned event on June 27, 1994, the DC-X became the first unmanned vehicle to save itself when an in-flight abort occurred after a gaseous hydrogen explosion. The vehicle demonstrated autoland its capabilities after reaching an altitude of 790 meters during a 78-second flight. After repairs were made, the DC-X continued expansion of the flight envelope on May 16, 1995, demonstrating constant angle of attack after reaching an altitude of 1330 m during a 124-second flight. Graham was elated and continued {{to work closely with}} the program. Graham would not live to see the full glory of the DC-X program. He died in December 1995.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Jacques Monod, Jean-Pierre Changeux and François Jacob {{discovered}} the lac operon in the bacterium Escherichia coli. It was {{a cluster of}} genes, arranged in a feedback <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> so that its products would only be made when [...] "switched on" [...] by an environmental stimulus. One of these products was an enzyme that splits a sugar, lactose; and lactose itself was the stimulus that switched the genes on. This was a revelation, as it showed {{for the first time}} that genes, even in an organism as small as a bacterium, were subject to fine-grained control. The implication was that many other genes were also elaborately regulated.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a {{computer}} program that in a simple way can calculate the performance of <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> at the refinery Preemraff Lysekil has been created. The computer program has been adapted to the environment at Preemraff Lysekil. Theories for evaluation has been studied in aspect of reliability and of automatic implementation. The evaluation {{has been carried out}} from data collected directly from <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> at the refinery and from simulated <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> with implemented errors. Among the studied methods are Harris index and Stattin´s oscillation index. According to the literature the Harris index is the most used for measure of control performance, but the results show that it does not work as a single measure at Preemraff Lysekil. However Stattin´s oscillation index works well and can be used for detection of oscillations. Statistic measures like variance, IAE, ISE and a method based on histogram are also studied. All the statistical measures are simple to implement and are rather accurate. Several tests on <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> has been carried out and {{it has been shown that}} it ís enough to use the method based on histograms and Stattins oscillation index to get a good picture of the performace of the <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> at Preemraff Lysekil. The work has resulted in a MATLAB tool that evaluates the <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> and can be run at any time. The tool first calculates Stattin´s oscillation index. The loops that are oscillating are marked. In the next step, the method based on histograms is used and a list with the worst performing loops at the top is created...|$|R

40|$|In {{traditional}} feedback control, {{a single}} sampling rate {{is used for}} all <b>control</b> <b>loops.</b> Consequently, achieving higher performance by increasing the sampling rate is generally costly. The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop a multi-rate control framework to create a breakthrough in the performance/cost trade-off in digital controller implementation. In the proposed approach one of the <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> is implemented at a lower rate of which the feedforward controller is designed through norm-based minimalization of the tracking error in this multi-rate framework. By designing and implementing one of the <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> at a lower rate, the cost is reduced and the multi-rate problem is addressed. Through simulation the adequate performance of the proposed multi-rate approach is demonstrated...|$|R
2500|$|If {{the signal}} is {{inverted}} {{on its way}} round the <b>control</b> <b>loop,</b> the system {{is said to have}} negative feedback; otherwise, the feedback is said to be positive. Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the stability and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted changes. [...] This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it. [...] When this happens, the lag in arrival of the correcting signal can result in overcorrection, causing the output to oscillate or [...] "hunt". While often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour, this effect is used deliberately in electronic oscillators.|$|E
2500|$|Enabling {{others to}} [...] "learn how to learn" [...] is often taken to mean instructing {{them how to}} submit to being taught.

It {{is seen as a}} lifelong process, not limited to specific learning environments (home, school, university) or under the control of authorities such as parents and professors. It needs to be tested, and intermittently revised, through the personal experience of the learner. It need not be restricted by either consciousness or language. Fritjof Capra argued that it is poorly recognised within psychology and education. It may be related to cybernetics as it involves a negative feedback <b>control</b> <b>loop,</b> or to systems theory.

QoS provisioning is, therefore, {{a major issue in}} both 3 G wireless networks and packet based multimedia systems such as H. 323 -based systems. Both 3 G wireless networks and H 323 -based multimedia applications provide <b>control</b> <b>loops.</b> The former use low level open and closed loops driven by measurements of transmission power and other internal system resources in order to maintain link quality, while the latter use out off band Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) and H. 245 signaling to cope with fluctuating network conditions and congestion. However, very much like signaling in TCP (Transport Control Protocol), H. 323 signaling was originally tailored for fixed networks.
