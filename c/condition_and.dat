5|$|At least 40% {{of people}} with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have a positive family history, suggesting {{that some people are}} genetically predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration. HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the <b>condition,</b> <b>and</b> also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of the <b>condition,</b> <b>and</b> at an earlier age than is typical.|$|E
