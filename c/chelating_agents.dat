5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is a molecule {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{typically}} treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware.

Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer, and kidney problems. A liver transplant {{may be helpful}} in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.|$|E

5|$|Boletus edulis {{is known}} to be able to {{tolerate}} and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal smelters. The mushroom's resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal. Phytochelatins are <b>chelating</b> <b>agents,</b> capable of forming multiple bonds with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is stored in a detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as <b>chelating</b> <b>agents,</b> and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E
25|$|Methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA) is {{produced}} from glycine. MGDA {{has a high}} rate of biodegradation >68%, but unlike many other <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> can degrade without the assistance of adapted bacteria. Additionally, unlike EDDS or IDS, MGDA can withstand higher temperatures while maintaining a high stability as well as the entire pH range. As a result, the chelating strength of MGDA is stronger than many commercial <b>chelating</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|E

25|$|When these <b>agents</b> <b>chelate</b> {{inorganic}} arsenic, it {{is converted}} into an organic form of arsenic {{because it is}} bound to the organic <b>chelating</b> <b>agent.</b> The sulfur atoms of the thiol groups are the site of interaction with arsenic. This is because the thiol groups are nucleophilic while the arsenic atoms are electrophilic. Once bound to the <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> the molecules can be excreted, and therefore free inorganic arsenic atoms are removed from the body.|$|R

Antioxidants such as vitamin E can be used simultaneously to prevent tissue damage to the liver and pancreas.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Along {{with the}} feature size {{reducing}} {{and the increase}} of integration level rapidly in ULSI，the request for metal impurities contamination on silicon substrate surface appears specially rigorous. In this paper the <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> was added in cleaning solution in order to removing copper ion. FA/O, {{a new kind of}} <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> was studied in RCA cleaning solutions, which has 13 chelating rings and is free of sodium, stable and easily soluble. The XPS and GFAAS measured results indicate that FA/O is more efficient than NH 4 OH as a ligand. Cu contaminations on silicon wafer can be removed remarkably when adding a little FA/O to the cleaning solution or polishing slurry. When the <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> concentration of cleaning solution is 0. 1 % the removal rate of Cu atom reaches 83 percent. The FA/O <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> substituting NH 4 OH in SC- 1 may simplify cleaning steps, and one cleaning step can remove Cu pollution on silicon wafer surface and meet the requirements of microelectronics technology...|$|R

500|$|... 225Ac {{is applied}} in {{medicine}} to produce 213 in a reusable generator {{or can be}} used alone as an agent for radiation therapy, in particular targeted alpha therapy (TAT). This isotope has a half-life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than 213Bi (half-life 46 minutes). Not only 225Ac itself, but also its daughters, emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body. The major difficulty with application of 225Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver {{for a period of}} tens of years. As a result, after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from 225Ac, the radiation from the actinium and its daughters might induce new mutations. To solve this problem, 225Ac was bound to a chelating agent, such as citrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones, but the excretion from the body remained slow. Much better results were obtained with such <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> as HEHA(1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaazacyclohexadecane-N,N',N'`,N'``,N'``',N'``'`-hexaacetic acid) or DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) coupled to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor.
