50|$|In July 1916, the DL&W {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new <b>concrete</b> <b>breaker,</b> and to fill in part of Toby's Creek so as to straighten the railroad bed leading to the breaker. By 1917, the new breaker was under construction. The foundation was built by Curtis Construction Co. of New York, and the steel frame built by the DL&W. The facade of the breaker was clad with special high-strength wire glass. The new colliery had its own power plant fueled by coal from the mine. In 1936, the Glen Alden Coal Co., successor to the DL&W, operated the Woodward and produced 858,711 tons of coal. In 1945, they produced 745,586 tons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{excavator}} {{is based}} on a 2008 Liebherr 984 that was heavily modified by Kocurek Excavators Ltd for the Birmingham-based demolition Coleman & Company. It was bought for around NZ$4m and imported to New Zealand by Auckland-based demolition firm Nikau Contractors, and arrived in the Port of Lyttelton in September 2011. [...] The tracked excavator weighs 208 t and has a maximum reach of 65 m. When the articulated arm is not extended, the reach is 25 m. The excavator is not suited for demolishing the bottom two storeys of a building. At full reach, a 2.5 t demolition attachment can be fitted to the hydraulic boom. At 40 m reach, the machine can handle a 6 t <b>concrete</b> <b>breaker.</b> The excavator got its nickname following a naming competition on Christchurch radio station More FM.|$|E
5000|$|On April 27, 1907, the No. 5 breaker {{burned to}} the ground, causing an [...] "awe inspiring spectacle." [...] At the time, the breaker had been {{abandoned}} by the D&H and was {{being used as a}} washery by the Rissinger Bros. By 1909, a second breaker was built, intended to process coal from several D & H mines. In 1914, The D&H was operating both the breaker and a washery and waste water from these was dumped into Shupp's Creek, not Brown's Creek, suggesting that the breaker may have been relocated from its original site to a new one farther south. In 1919, fire destroyed the second No. 5 breaker. That year, a new reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>breaker,</b> called the Loree No. 5 Breaker, was built to process coal from all of the D&H operations in Plymouth.|$|E
50|$|In November 1961 Reinhard Wirtgen {{founded a}} small {{contracting}} business in Windhagen, Germany, starting with small haulage jobs and later specializing in road construction machinery with <b>concrete</b> <b>breakers.</b> Eventually Wirtgen expanded his fleet to 100 milling machines and 150 workers operating all over Germany. Reinhard Wirtgen progressed the product portfolio from hot milling to cold milling machines {{by the end}} of the 70s, which significantly increased the economic efficiency of the milling process. The international development of the company began when Reinhard Wirtgen set up the first subsidiaries outside of Germany.|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} the extent of hand transmitted vibration exposure problems, particularly hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), among construction workers in Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on a construction site in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 243 workers were recruited. Questionnaire interviews and hand examinations were administered to 194 respondents. Vibration magnitudes for <b>concrete</b> <b>breakers,</b> drills and grinders were measured using a 3 -axis accelerometer. Clinical outcomes were compared and analysed according to vibration exposure status. Results Vibration total values for <b>concrete</b> <b>breakers,</b> impact drills and grinders were 10. 02 ms(- 2), 7. 72 ms(- 2) and 5. 29 ms(- 2), respectively. The mean 8 h time-weighted hand transmitted vibration exposure, A(8), among subjects on current and previous construction sites was 7. 52 (SD 2. 68) ms(- 2) and 9. 21 (SD 2. 48) ms(- 2), respectively. Finger tingling, finger numbness, musculoskeletal problems of the neck, finger coldness, abnormal Phalen's test and abnormal light touch sensation were significantly more common in the high vibration exposure group (n= 139) than the low-moderate vibration exposure group (n= 54). Mean total lifetime vibration dose among exposed subjects was 15. 2 (SD 3. 2) m(2) h(3) s(- 4) (In scale). HAVS prevalence was 18 and the prevalence ratio of stage 1 and higher disease in the high vibration exposure group versus the low-moderate vibration exposure group was 4. 86 (95 CI 1. 19 to 19. 80). Conclusions Hand transmitted vibration is a recognisable problem in tropical countries including Malaysia. The current study has identified clinical symptoms and signs suggesting HAVS among construction workers exposed to hand transmitted vibration in a warm environment...|$|R
5000|$|The coastal bar {{separating}} Humboldt Bay {{from the}} Pacific Ocean has been breached by a dredged channel to allow commercial shipping {{to enter the}} bay. The north jetty has unusual <b>concrete</b> <b>breakers</b> known as dolos, which resemble toy jacks. The breakers were built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to withstand the area's heavy seas, and were featured by Huell Howser On PBS's [...] "California's Gold" [...] (Episode #803). Samoa peninsula includes the Manila and Samoa Dunes, {{some of the most}} ecologically diverse areas in California, and stretches to the Arcata Bottoms. The peninsula is about 10 mi long by 1 mi. This area is vulnerable to tsunamis as its average height above sea level is only 3 ft. It also contains the unincorporated community of Manila and a United States Coast Guard station. Residential expansion is proposed that would double the size of Manila, which currently has neither fire or police services of its own. The ZIP Code is 95564. The community is inside area code 707.|$|R
40|$|Study evaluates and {{assesses the}} work done by {{vibrating}} equipments. It includes the assessment of influence of various independent variables associated with hand tools, operators, work & environmental factors on various dependent variables. Three tools selected for study include Rock drill (Dry type) (Tool- 1), <b>Concrete</b> <b>breaker</b> (Tool- 2), Hand grinder (Tool- 3). The impact of vibration exposure on health of operators is assessed by the help of survey. It is found that the human energy expenditure is more in the subjects having low grip strength whereas it is less in the subjects of more grip strength. The subjects having more grip strength show less change in touch sensation. The human energy expenditure of subjects of hand grinder is significantly less than the subjects of rock drill and <b>concrete</b> <b>breaker.</b> The presence of hand arm vibration Syndrome (HAVS) in the subjects under heavy work, like rock drill and <b>concrete</b> <b>breaker</b> found very high...|$|E

40|$|Percussive {{tools such}} as {{chipping}} hammers, riveting hammers and <b>concrete</b> <b>breakers</b> produce shock-type (impact) vibrations with large amount of vibration energy in the high frequency region (kHz). Reported injuries from shock-type and high frequency vibrations are higher  occurrence of vascular disorders, myelin disruption, edema and reduced motor performance. An Atlas Copco Tools customer has reported an increase of VWF (vibration induced white finger) {{during the last decade}} and the chipping hammers have been identified as the main cause. A mean of 1. 8 workers/year has been injured with VWF and the cost of one injured worker has been estimate to 0. 5 million SEK. One way to eliminate the injuries could be to replace the tools from Atlas Copco with better tools from another manufacturer. A protective handle was designed for the chipping hammers by Atlas Copco, to prevent operators from holding directly on the vibrating parts. However, the protective handle was not vibration isolated and a follow up project, this thesis, was started to redesign and vibration isolate the handle. An isolated protective handle with two rubber bushings was finally developed from theory of vibration isolation together with a subjective evaluation by experienced personnel and with low and high frequency vibration measurements. The final protective handle significantly reduced both the harmful low frequency vibrations (measured according to ISO 5349) and the potentially harmful high frequency vibrations (not measured according to any ISO standard), compared to the non-isolated original handle  developed by Atlas Copco...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although some {{occupational}} {{sources of}} hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) have been extensively investigated, {{the risks associated}} with others are poorly characterized. Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to a community sample of 12, 240 men aged 16 - 64 years and 906 men from the armed forces. Questions covered current occupation, sources of HTV, numbness or tingling in the fingers in the past week, and finger blanching. In the 5, 364 respondents who had been at work in the past week, associations between symptoms and exposures were examined by logistic regression, with odds ratios converted into prevalence ratios (PRs). Results: Altogether, 513 men (10 %) reported cold-induced finger blanching and 769 (14 %) sensory symptoms in the fingers. The risk of blanching was increased in builders (PR 2. 4, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 5. 2), carpenters and joiners (PR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 3. 4), motor mechanics (PR 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 4. 6), and laborers (PR 2. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 6. 0); while the risk of sensory symptoms was elevated in laborers (PR 4. 0, 95 % CI 2. 3 - 6. 6) and plant operatives (PR 3. 5, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 5. 9). Use of hand-guided mowers, <b>concrete</b> <b>breakers,</b> chain saws, and jig saws was significantly associated with symptoms. Conclusions: Little {{attention has been paid to}} the risks of vibration injury in construction workers, woodworkers, motor mechanics, and laborers, or to the risks from mowers, jig saws and several other common vibratory tools. These should be a focus for further investigation and preventive measures...|$|R
40|$|Recently, TxDOT {{has become}} {{increasingly}} aware of the rising cost {{associated with the use}} of asphalt <b>concrete</b> bond <b>breakers</b> to meet the FHWA requirement of using a permanently stabilized, nonerodable subbase layer below the concrete slab. The main issue associated with this research is if cheaper alternatives are available for subbase construction. Subbase layers have certain functions that need to be fulfilled (one of them being constructability) in order to assure adequate pavement performance. One key aspect is resistance to erosion, and assessment of each of these functions relative to different alternatives is key to understanding the capability of different alternatives to perform adequately. In this respect, this project is to examine the design assumptions associated with each alternative and provide recommendations accordingly to include test methods and material specifications. This report describes some of the work accomplished summarizing data on subbase performance and testing relative to concrete pavement subbase and subgrade erosion. Findings from investigations ar...|$|R
