40|$|Abstract. Seaside {{nuclear power}} plants {{have to face the}} ageing of nuclear reactor <b>cooling</b> <b>piping</b> systems. In order to {{minimize}} the duration of the production unit shutdown, maintenance operations have to be planned well in advance. In a context where owners of infrastructures tend to extend the life span of their goods while having to keep the safety level maximum, Oxand brings its expertise and know-how in management of infrastructures life cycle. A dedicated methodology relies on several modules that all participate in fixing network optimum replacement dates: expertise on ageing mechanisms (corrosion, cement degradation [...] .) and the associated kinetics, expertise on impacts of ageing on functional integrity of piping systems, predictive simulation based on experience feedback, development of monitoring techniques focused on actual threats. More precisely, Oxand has designed a patented monitoring technique based on optic fiber sensors, which aims at controlling the deterioration level of piping systems. This preventive maintenance enables the owner to determine criteria for network replacement based on degradation impacts. This approach helps the owner justify his maintenance strategy and allows him to demonstrate the management of safety level. More generally, all monitoring techniques used by the owners are developed and coupled to predictive simulation tools, notably thanks to processes based on Bayesian approaches. Methodologies to evaluate and optimize operation budgets, depending on predictions of future functional deterioration and available maintenance solutions are also developed and applied. Finally, all information related to infrastructure ageing and available maintenance options are put together to reach the right solution for safe and performing infrastructure management. 1...|$|E

40|$|Bi-metallic piping welds are {{frequently}} used in light water nuclear reactors to connect ferritic steel pressure vessel nozzles to {{austenitic stainless steel}} primary <b>cooling</b> <b>piping</b> systems. An important aspect for the integrity of such welds {{is the presence of}} residual stresses. Measurement of these residual stresses presents a considerable challenge because of the component size and because of the material heterogeneity in the weld regions. The specimen investigated here was a thin slice cut from a full-scale bi-metallic piping weld mock- up. A similar mock-up had previously been investigated by neutron diffraction within a European research project called ADIMEW. However, at that time, due to the wall thickness of the pipe, stress and spatial resolution of the measurements were severely restricted. One aim of the present investigations by high energy synchrotron radiation and neutrons used on this thin slice was to determine whether such measurements would render a valid representation of the axial strains and stresses in the uncut large-scale structure. The advantage of the small specimen was, apart from the easier manipulation, the fact that measurement times facilitated a high density of measurements across large parts of the test piece in a reasonable time. Furthermore, the recording of complete diffraction patterns within the accessible diffraction angle range by synchrotron X-ray diffraction permitted mapping the texture variations. The strain and stress results obtained are presented and compared for the neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. A strong variation of the texture pole orientations is observed in the weld regions which could be attributed to individual weld torch passes. The effect of specimen rocking on the scatter of the diffraction data in the butt weld region is assessed during the neutron diffraction measurements. JRC.

The quake considered in this analysis is the earthquake that occurred due to the Lembang fault, since it has the Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) in the Bandung TRIGA 2000 reactor site. The analysis results showed that in the static condition for sustain and expansion loads, the stress fraction in all piping lines does not exceed the allowable limit. However, during operation moment, in dynamic condition, the primary cooling system is less flexible at sustain load, ekspansi load, and combination load and the stress fraction have reached 95, 5 %. Therefore a pipeline modification (rerouting) is needed to make pipe stress does not exceed the allowable stress. The pipeline modification was carried out by applied a gap of 3 mm in the X direction of the support at node 25 and eliminate the support at the node 30, also a gap of 3 mm was applied in X and Z directions of the support at the node 155. The axial force (FY) that occurred in the pump outlet nozzle (dia. 4 in.) of PriPump line have also exceeded the allowable limit that lead to the pump nozzle failure during an earthquake of Lembang fault. The modifications is necessary to be applied on the cooling system for PriPump line so the nozzle would not receive the force that exceed the allowable limits.

40|$|M. Tech. (Mechanical Engineering Technology) This project {{researched}} {{the feasibility of}} using an existing mitre bend on the main condenser crossover ducting as an on-line flow measuring system. This flow measurement {{is based on the}} principle of an elbow type of flow meter. There are no detailed published standards or specifications available for Elbow flow meters. The knowledge of the cooling water flow rate through the individual condensers would allow turbine heat rate calculations to be performed. In addition condenser, cooling tower and cooling water pump performance can be evaluated. An on-line system would also highlight potential problems sooner, thus eliminating costly unplanned shutdowns. The majority of the straight length of condenser <b>cooling</b> water <b>piping</b> is under concrete, thus making access very difficult. The exposed condenser piping geometry is not ideal, with very distorted flow profiles expected, due to bends, valves, reducers, etc. Conventional flow measuring systems can therefore not be used, as ideal flow conditions (profiles) before and after the measuring instrument are required to er. sure the specified accuracy. The mitre bend being part of the piping geometry does not introduce additional head loss to the system and coupled to the low cost factor of an elbow type meter was the principal reason for the choice of this type of measuring system. Part of the innovative aspect of this research is that a conventional elbow is not used but an existing mitre bend is utilised as the fundamental flow measuring device. The Elbow/Bend differential pressure method to measure the condenser cooling water flow rate was investigated in the Flow laboratory at Eskom (Technology Research and Investigations). A geometrically similar mitre bend was purchased and installed onto the 700 mm NB pipeline at the laboratory. The diametrical differential pressure was measured at the 22. 5 ° and 45 °axes of the 0. 8 D mitre bend. The differential pressure was related to the fluid flow rate, and a calibration constant C was determined. The velocity profiles under the test conditions were verified. A Computational Fluid Dynamics model of the laboratory mitre bend was also produced. The model provided a clearer understanding of the internal flow patterns and the exact pressures on the inside and outside of the bend. The tests that were conducted in the laboratory confirmed the suitability of converting the main condenser crossover ducting mitre bends into an on-line cooling water flow measuring systems...|$|R

This 'Allowable Displacement Stress Range' value was calculated using equation (1 a) found on page 16 of the above mentioned reference.

All actual Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion plants (OTEC) that have been built or designed to date have been at sea level or above. While the concept of OTEC is more than 100 years old, the application has been very limited {{primarily because of the}} cost of the plant and the power it produces in comparison to other sources of power. Since OTEC plants are very inefficient (around 3 %), huge amounts of low-grade heat must be supplied and rejected. Some authorities estimate that the cost of <b>piping</b> <b>cooling</b> water from some 1000 meters below the ocean surface represents nearly half of the plant cost. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of siting an OTEC plant deep in the ocean and using it to drive a colocated Sea Water Reverse Osmosis Plant (SWRO). A thermodynamic analysis of this system is made to indicate the potential improvement in performance. as compared to conventional designs. Data on the performance and cost of conventional plants are used in conjunction with the thermodynamic analysis to give insight into potential advantages of the proposed scheme for the case where it is desired to produce desalinated water. Several advantages are shown to result from employment of this system as compared to conventional technologies including higher efficiency, lower cost, resistance to environmental damage, and improved aesthetics. It is concluded that the potential improvements from submerging an OTEC/SWRO plant, could lead to significant penetration of the technology for this niche situation. am 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{probabilistic}} {{safety assessment}} of engineering systems involving high-consequence low-probability events is stochastic in nature due to uncertainties inherent in time to an event. The event could be a failure, repair, maintenance or degradation associated with system ageing. Accurate reliability prediction accounting for these uncertainties is a precursor to considerably good risk assessment model. Stochastic Markov reliability models have been constructed to quantify basic events in a static fault tree analysis {{as part of the}} safety assessment process. The models assume that a system transits through various states and that the time spent in a state is statistically random. The system failure probability estimates of these models assuming constant transition rate are extensively utilized in the industry to obtain failure frequency of catastrophic events. An example is core damage frequency in a nuclear power plant where the initiating event is loss of cooling system. However, the assumption of constant state transition rates for analysis of safety critical systems is debatable {{due to the fact that}} these rates do not properly account for variability in the time to an event. An ill-consequence of such an assumption is conservative reliability prediction leading to addition of unnecessary redundancies in modified versions of prototype designs, excess spare inventory and an expensive maintenance policy with shorter maintenance intervals. The reason for this discrepancy is that a constant transition rate is always associated with an exponential distribution for the time spent in a state. The subject matter of this thesis is to develop sophisticated mathematical models to improve predictive capabilities that accurately represent reliability of an engineering system. The generalization of the Markov process called the semi-Markov process is a well known stochastic process, yet it is not well explored in the reliability analysis of nuclear power plant systems. The continuous-time, discrete-state semi-Markov process model is a stochastic process model that describes the state transitions through a system of integral equations which can be solved using the trapezoidal rule. The primary objective is to determine the probability of being in each state. This process model ensures that time spent in the states can be represented by a suitable non-exponential distribution thus capturing the variability in the time to event. When exponential distribution is assumed for all the state transitions, the model reduces to the standard Markov model. This thesis illustrates the proposed concepts using basic examples and then develops advanced case studies for nuclear <b>cooling</b> systems, <b>piping</b> systems, digital instrumentation and control (I&C) systems, fire modelling and system maintenance. The first case study on nuclear component cooling water system (NCCW) shows that the proposed technique can be used to solve a fault tree involving redundant repairable components to yield initiating event probability quantifying the loss of cooling system. The time-to-failure of the pump train is assumed to be a Weibull distribution and the resulting system failure probability is validated using a Monte Carlo simulation of the corresponding reliability block diagram. Nuclear piping systems develop flaws, leaks and ruptures due to various underlying damage mechanisms. This thesis presents a general model for evaluating rupture frequencies of such repairable piping systems. The proposed model is able to incorporate the effect of aging related degradation of piping systems. Time dependent rupture frequencies are computed and the influence of inspection intervals on the piping rupture probability is investigated. There is an increasing interest worldwide in the installation of digital instrumentation and control systems in nuclear power plants. The main feedwater valve (MFV) controller system is used for regulating the water level in a steam generator. An existing Markov model in the literature is extended to a semi-Markov model to accurately predict the controller system reliability. The proposed model considers variability in the time to output from the computer to the controller with intrinsic software and mechanical failures. State-of-the-art time-to-flashover fire models used in the nuclear industry are either based on conservative analytical equations or computationally intensive simulation models. The proposed semi-Markov based case study describes an innovative fire growth model that allows prediction of fire development and containment including time to flashover. The model considers variability in time when transiting from one stage of the fire to the other. The proposed model is a reusable framework that can be of importance to product design engineers and fire safety regulators. Operational unavailability is at risk of being over-estimated because of assuming a constant degradation rate in a slowly ageing system. In the last case study, it is justified that variability in time to degradation has a remarkable effect on the choice of an effective maintenance policy. The proposed model is able to accurately predict the optimal maintenance interval assuming a non-exponential time to degradation. Further, the model reduces to a binary state Markov model equivalent to a classic probabilistic risk assessment model if the degradation and maintenance states are eliminated. In summary, variability in time to an event is not properly captured in existing Markov type reliability models though they are stochastic and account for uncertainties. The proposed semi-Markov process models are easy to implement, faster than intensive simulations and accurately model the reliability of engineering systems...|$|R
