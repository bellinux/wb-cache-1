[...] Follow-up legislation on immigration matters was contained in the Nationality Law of 1952. The Law of Return was modified in 1970 to extend the right of return to people who do not have Jewish status under Orthodox interpretations of Halacha, but who have a Jewish grandparent, and their spouses.|$|E

60|$|THE WOMAN [going {{nearer to}} him and scrutinizing him with some concern] I am afraid you are not well.

Intercourse with us puts too great a strain on them.|$|E

6000|$|This disgusted Juanna somewhat, but the {{allusion to}} a [...] "big kraal" [...] excited the curiosity, {{of which she}} had a certain share, and very adroitly she {{questioned}} the dwarf concerning it. He rose to the fly without hesitation, {{and told her that}} his master {{had been one of the}} greatest men in the world, and one of the richest, but that he lost his possessions through the wicked arts of foemen, and was <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> to seek new ones.|$|E
6000|$|... "I find {{it rather}} {{hard to know}} exactly what to say to you," [...] he began. [...] "I am glad to be here and I have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> to work for you, if I may. But, you know, I have views of my own, and it isn't a very auspicious {{occasion}} for me to stand for the first time upon an English platform. I came as one of the audience to-night and I have listened to all that has been said. I don't think that I am in favour of your strike." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is surely}} queer!" [...] {{admitted}} Miss Doyle, impressed and thoughtful. [...] "Uncle John and Arthur were saying this noon, at lunch, that Ajo was a helpless sort {{of individual and}} easily influenced by others--as witness his caving in to me when I opposed his doctor's treatment. Arthur thinks he has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> to squander what little money his father left him and that his public career outside the limits of his little island will be brief. Yet according to your story the boy is no weakling but has power and knows how to use it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall surely {{try some}} small deed upon each other, so that either I shall see the Lady Beatrice, or you the Lady Mary. Nay, thank me not, for like yourself, I have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> {{in search of}} honor, and I know not where I may better find it than {{at the end of}} your sword-point.

6000|$|... "You will observe, Leduc," [...] said Mr. Caryll, [...] "that we {{have not}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> in vain. We are {{undergoing}} experiences that would be interesting {{if they were not}} quite so dull, amusing if they entailed less discomfort to ourselves. Assuredly, it was worth while to cross to England to study manners. And there are sights for you that you will never see in France. You would not, for instance, had you not come hither, have had an opportunity of observing a member of the noblesse seconding and assisting a tipstaff in the discharge of his duty. And doing it just as a hog wallows in foulness--for the love of it.|$|E

6000|$|Sigmund {{shook his}} head. [...] "You can't make me mad, Hitchcock, nor do mad things {{because of your}} madness. It's a cold {{business}} proposition and a question of facts.

They've done the same for a thousand-thousand years, and they're {{going to do it}} now, and they'll go on doing it for all time to come. Besides, they're not our kind. Nor's the girl.

60|$|The new-comer was Adolf. Adolf {{was one of}} that {{numerous}} band of Swiss and German {{youths who}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> prepared to give their services ridiculously cheap {{in exchange for the}} opportunity of learning the English language. Mr Blatherwick held the view that for a private school a male front-door opener was superior to a female, arguing that the parents of prospective pupils would be impressed by the sight of a man in livery. He would have liked something a bit more imposing than Adolf, but the latter was the showiest thing that could be got for the money, so he made the best of it, and engaged him. After all, an astigmatic parent, seeing Adolf in a dim light, might be impressed by him. You never could tell.|$|E
60|$|HENRY DAVID THOREAU was {{the last}} male {{descendant}} of a French ancestor who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> from the Isle of Guernsey. His character exhibited occasional traits drawn from this blood in singular combination with a very strong Saxon genius.|$|R

6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} of that?" [...] he shouted derisively. [...] "The Gaekwar of Baroda rides in an {{elephant}} in a howdah! And there's old Bikram Shamsher Jang scorching up and down the pig-paths of Khatmandu on a motor-cycle. Wouldn't that maharajah you? And the Shah of Persia, that ought to have been Muley-on-the-spot for at least three, he's got the palanquin habit. And that funny-hat prince from Korea--wouldn't you think he could afford to amble around on a milk-white palfrey once in a dynasty or two? Nothing doing! His idea of a Balaklava charge is to tuck his skirts under him and do his mile in six days over the hog- wallows of Seoul in a bull-cart. That's the kind of visiting potentates that <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> now. It's a hard deal, friend." ...|$|E

Mr. Delora has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> on a mission of peculiar danger. He has a secret in his possession which is of immense value, and there are others who are not our friends who know of it. Mr. Delora had a signal at Charing Cross that there was danger in taking up his residence here. That is why he slipped away quietly and is lying now in hiding. If monsieur indeed desires an adventure, I could propose one to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|As regards Great Britain, {{the giant}} trader who has so long overshadowed Asiatic commerce, Lord Charles Beresford says: [...] "But {{competition}} is telling adversely; {{the energy of}} the British merchant is being equalled by other nationals. [...] . The competition of the Chinese and the introduction of steam into the country are also combining to produce changed conditions in China." [...] But far more ominous is the plaintive note he sounds when he says: [...] "New industries must be opened up, and I would especially direct the attention of the Chambers of Commerce (British) to [...] . the fact that the more the native competes with the British manufacturer in certain classes of trade, the more machinery he will need, and the orders for such machinery will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> if our machinery manufacturers are enterprising enough." ...|$|E
50|$|The Coalition Government's tough {{stance on}} people {{smuggling}} {{stems from the}} core belief that Australia has the right <b>to</b> decide who <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and {{the circumstances in which}} they come.

6000|$|I didn't {{care about}} the Radicalism. All I wanted {{was to get the}} two married, and then it would not make the least {{difference}} to me what their politics might be; if they lived properly and was sober and industrious and kept on loving each other, I didn't believe it would make much difference to them. It was a long letter that the clergyman wrote, but the point of it was, that he had concluded to tell the young woman that she might marry the fellow if she liked, and that she must do her best to make him a good Conservative, which, of course, she promised to do. When I read this I clapped my hands, for who could have suspected that I should have the good luck to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> to spend the summer and make two matches before I left it! ...|$|E
60|$|If Nancy Durrett symbolized aristocracy, {{established}} {{order and}} prestige, what did Mrs. Scherer represent? Not democracy, mob rule--certainly. The stocky German peasant {{woman with her}} tightly drawn hair and heavy jewels seemed grotesquely to embody something that ultimately would have its way, a lusty and terrible force {{in the interests of}} which my own services were enlisted; to which the old American element in business and industry, the male counterpart of Nancy Willett, had already succumbed. And now it was about to storm the feminine fastnesses! I beheld a woman who had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> with a shawl aver her head transformed into a new species of duchess, sure of herself, scorning the delicate euphemisms in which Fancy's kind were wont to refer to asocial realm, that was no less real because its boundaries had not definitely been defined. She held her stick firmly, and gave Nancy an indomitable look.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're no fool, my dear, and it {{goes without}} saying that you-do realize it--in the most {{innocent}} way, of course. But you have had no experience in life. Mind you, I don't say that the Vicomte de Toqueville isn't very much of a gentleman, but the French ideas about the relations of young men and young women are quite different and, I regret to say, less innocent than ours. I have no reason to believe that the Vicomte has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> to--to mend his fortunes. I know nothing about his property. But my sense of responsibility towards you has led me to tell him that you have no dot, for you somehow manage to give the impression of a young woman of fortune. Not purposely, my dear--I did not mean that." [...] Mrs. Holt tapped gently Honora's flaming cheek. [...] "I merely felt it my duty to drop you a word of warning against Monsieur de Toqueville--because he is a Frenchman." ...|$|E
50|$|Following the {{adoption}} of the Hart-Celler Immigration Reform, 1965, the number of Grenadians who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> increased. <b>This</b> law replaced the mass emigration from Europe, to the US, by the Caribbean.

60|$|Besides {{visitors}} from abroad, many distinguished Americans visited the ex-king. Among these were Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John Quincy Adams.
