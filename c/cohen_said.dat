5|$|God of War: Betrayal was {{announced}} by Sony Online Entertainment {{at a press}} conference in Los Angeles in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' three dimensional (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by WayForward Technologies. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke of the difficulties in developing a God of War game for a mobile device. <b>Cohen</b> <b>said</b> that although enjoyable, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes, and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks.|$|E

25|$|On 22 July, Mossad Director Tamir Pardo and Shin Bet (Internal Security Agency) Director Yoram Cohen briefed the Israeli Cabinet on the {{intelligence}} agencies' actions against terrorism perpetrated by or planned by Iran and Hezbollah around {{the world according to}} {{the intelligence}} agencies' assessment. Pardo and <b>Cohen</b> <b>said</b> that Iran and Hezbollah have attempted to perpetrate terrorist attacks in over 20 countries in the two years prior to the attack.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{participants}} at the conference were six members of the anti-Zionist Jewish organisation Neturei Karta, including Aharon <b>Cohen</b> who <b>said</b> {{he had come to}} the conference to put the Orthodox Jewish viewpoint across. <b>Cohen</b> also <b>said</b> that while the Holocaust indisputably happened, [...] "in no way can it be used as a justification for perpetrating unjust acts against the Palestinians." ...|$|R

500|$|At other times, {{the camera}} was {{positioned}} {{very close to the}} actors to catch the emotion in their faces: [...] "If you put a lens 6 inches from somebody's face, you get more emotion than if you're on a long lens 20 feet away," [...] <b>Cohen</b> <b>said</b> in an interview. Hooper sought a second subtlety while filming the first consultation room scene between the two men, having placed the camera 18inches from Colin Firth's face: [...] "I wanted the nervousness of the first day to percolate into his performances." ...|$|E
500|$|The final script of {{the episode}} was [...] "very close" [...] to Cohen's first draft. [...] "I {{was looking at the}} old drafts and this episode {{probably}} changed as little as any script I've written from the original inception to the final aired version", <b>Cohen</b> <b>said.</b> Oakley commented that some writer's scripts get rewritten many times but Cohen's [...] "usually do not get rewritten that much because they are so good". Oakley added that Cohen has a very distinctive comedy style so there are certain jokes in the episode that [...] "just really sound like Cohen".|$|E
500|$|... "Much Apu About Nothing" [...] {{was written}} by David S. Cohen and {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. Joe Mantegna guest stars in the episode as Fat Tony. Much of {{the inspiration for the}} episode came from news reports of bears roaming streets in Southern California around the time when the episode was in production. <b>Cohen</b> <b>said</b> that when a bear swims in somebody's pool or goes in somebody's garbage can, it becomes a popular news item in California. The show runner of The Simpsons at the time, Bill Oakley, commented that the news reports often create an anti-bear hysteria, {{and that is one of}} the inspirations for the episode.|$|E

500|$|Baywatch and Knight Rider actor David Hasselhoff made a cameo in the live-action scenes, {{offering}} SpongeBob and Patrick {{a ride to}} Bikini Bottom. The {{scene was}} originally written before consulting Hasselhoff. Hillenburg {{was pleased with the}} storyboards; Lead storyboard artist Sherm <b>Cohen</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "He had been wrestling with the ending for quite a while, and finally he was ready to pitch his ideas to some of the other board artists." [...] Hillenburg was counting on casting Hasselhoff, and the first question he asked him was [...] "So, do we have Hasselhoff?" [...] He replied [...] "No", with a grin. Hasselhoff eventually agreed, before seeing the script. Hillenburg said about the actor, [...] "He's a great guy He was great at making fun of himself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Jon Cohen, who also produced Faryl and has previously worked with artists including the Opera Babes and Vanessa-Mae. <b>Cohen</b> <b>said</b> that Smith has [...] "matured as an artist since the first album" [...] {{and that he had}} [...] "no doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances". Smith's father, Tony, said that the bosses at universal were hoping for the album to be more commercially successful than Faryl, but noted that the market around Christmas time is tough, due to the high volume of releases. Brian Roberts, writing for the Daily Mirror, claimed that Wonderland was [...] "tipped to go head to head" [...] for the number one classical album position with releases from Il Divo and Rhydian Roberts.|$|E
500|$|Of all American wars, the Korean War is {{believed}} to have been the deadliest for civilians as a proportion of those killed, including North and South Korean non-combatants killed in extensive U.S. Air Force bombing throughout Korea, and South Korean civilians summarily executed by the invading North Korean military. The commission also recommended that the Seoul government negotiate with the United States for reparations for large-scale civilian killings by the U.S. military. [...] This did not occur. At the outset of the No Gun Ri investigation in 1999, Defense Secretary <b>Cohen</b> <b>said</b> in Washington and Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Stanley Roth was quoted as saying in Seoul that the United States would consider investigating any similar Korean War killings that came to light. [...] The 1999–2001 investigation was the last conducted by the United States.|$|E

500|$|The {{journalist}} Chuck Klosterman {{has argued}} that in 300 years Berry will still {{be remembered as the}} rock musician who most closely captured the essence of rock and roll. Time magazine stated, [...] "There was no one like Elvis. But there was 'definitely' no one like Chuck Berry." [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] magazine called him [...] "the father of rock & roll" [...] who [...] "gave the music its sound and its attitude, even as he battled racism - and his own misdeeds - all the way," [...] reporting that Leonard <b>Cohen</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "All of us are footnotes to the words of Chuck Berry." [...] (Mikal Gilmore, [...] "Chuck Berry 1926-2017," [...] "Rolling Stone," [...] pp. 23–24, April 20, 2017) [...] Kevin Strait, curator of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC, said that Berry is [...] "one of the primary sonic architects of rock and roll."

500|$|... "Bart the Mother" [...] was {{the last}} {{full-length}} episode David X. Cohen wrote for The Simpsons. Shortly after the episode aired, Cohen teamed up with The Simpsons creator Matt Groening to develop Futurama, where he served as executive producer and head writer for the series' entire run. Cohen's idea for the episode {{started out as a}} B story for Homer. In the original concept, pigeons nest outside Homer's window at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Mr. Burns exterminates the pigeons and Homer climbs out onto the ledge of the window, {{in the middle of a}} blizzard, to nest the eggs. <b>Cohen</b> <b>said</b> the idea [...] " [...] fit in anywhere", so he decided to pitch it as an A story instead, with Bart nesting the eggs instead of Homer. The Simpsons writer George Meyer thought the idea of Bart shooting the bird and simply nesting the eggs was too straightforward, and he did not think it had [...] "enough of a twist" [...] to be a good episode. Cohen and Meyer eventually decided the eggs should be lizard eggs. Cohen thought the twist was what ultimately made the episode both [...] "touching" [...] and [...] "interesting".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cohen</b> has <b>said,</b> [...] "If {{someone wants}} to live a gay life, {{that needs to be}} respected. If {{someone wants to}} change and come out straight, that too needs to be respected. Let us {{practice}} true tolerance, real diversity, and equality for all." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{book has}} won praise {{from a wide}} and {{bipartisan}} assortment of politicians, journalists, and academics, including former Republican Senator from Maine William <b>Cohen,</b> who <b>said</b> of the book, said, “what Strunk & White’s The Elements of Style is to the written word, Bob Lehrman’s book is to the spoken one.” ...|$|R

500|$|After {{the success}} at Montreux, ITV {{scheduled}} {{a repeat of}} Cold Feet for 25 May, this time at 9pm The repeat brought in 5.60 million viewers, making it the 66th most-watched programme on British television that week. A. A. Gill, who {{had not seen the}} original broadcast, wrote that [...] "it was lifted from being merely whimsical by some bow-tight comic acting and a great script", though he did not see the Golden Rose win as a particularly glorious achievement, citing the saturation of the Montreux Festival by British programmes in the 1990s. Further recognition came {{at the end of the}} year at the British Comedy Awards when Cold Feet won the Best Comedy Drama (ITV) award and at the Royal Television Society Programme Awards, where it was nominated for Best Situation Comedy & Comedy Drama. Helen Baxendale was nominated for the British Comedy Award for Top Television Comedy Actress but lost to Dawn French. At the RTS North West Awards, Cold Feet won the award for Best Network Entertainment Programme. The programme has retained the interest of reviewers several years after its original broadcast; writing for The Jerusalem Post, Aryeh Dean <b>Cohen</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The cast sparkles all around, as does the script, and the characters are endearing and believable." ...|$|E
500|$|On his approach, <b>Cohen</b> <b>said</b> that {{he refused}} to {{consider}} making the film PG-13: [...] "The first thing I said was, 'If you want me, I'm making an R-rated movie. I don't {{want to deal with}} sex and make it, like, for 13-year-olds.' The film took 23 days to shoot. Discussing its micro-budget, Lopez stated: [...] "You know what, we put all four million dollars in front of the camera! We all shared one trailer, we had no craft service, it wasn't that type of luxury movie set, let's say." [...] She also found that the limited budget and filming period was [...] "super intense", saying: [...] "I never had done a film like that in my career. That {{was the first time we}} did that, but it was very liberating as an artist because it made me realize I can make whatever movie I want like this." [...] On filming sex scenes, Guzman said [...] "that was the time in the film when I was the most uncomfortable. We had to choreograph every piece... It was the most unsexy-really-sexy scene that you'll see on screen." [...] Filming took place throughout fall 2013 in Los Angeles. In December 2013, the film received permit to shoot in Placerita Canyon, Newhall. Some of the remaining scenes were also filmed in April 2014.|$|E
500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. <b>Cohen</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cohen</b> has <b>said</b> that he {{believes}} that adequate {{health care is a}} [...] "fundamental right" [...] of all citizens. Cohen supports gender equality, progressive taxation, medicinal use of marijuana, decriminalization of Marijuana, gun rights and capital punishment. Cohen was the headline speaker at the Marijuana Policy Project's January 2010 annual gala in Washington.|$|R

500|$|The {{stage was}} {{designed}} by production designer Steven Cohen and production manager Rob Brenner for the HBO special. This {{was the first time}} Spears used an entire new stage design after having used a typical end-stage with a ramp and stairs at the center as on her first 3 tours (the ...Baby One More Time Tour, the (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour, and the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour). Cohen designed the main stage with an oval shape so that Spears could perform around the stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles. He said {{that the rest of the}} stage was created with three main components in mind: a runway, a B-stage, and a flying device over the crowd. The last was developed, as explained by Cohen, [...] "around this Cleopatra's barge concept I got into my head while designing when the movie Cleopatra was playing in the background. It needed to be elegant and stylized but also high tech, because it was going to have to be traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms. Plus, it had to have a big enough performance area for her and the dancers." [...] Brenner continued, [...] "I wanted to try to give the kid in the back of the house the same experience as the one in the first 10 rows." [...] The runway uniting the main stage and the B-stage was suggested by one of Spears's managers, Johnny Wright. The entire stage was built by Michael Tait from Tait Towers. <b>Cohen</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We took a more expanded role in preparing the drawings for Michael. We wanted to retain the essence of the look of the show, both in its overall footprint and in the execution of these various pieces. [...] did a great job on executing the fine details like the hand railings and the floor lights and the MR-16 covers. When you're doing something for TV, all of those pieces are foreground pieces. The mirrors on the platforms and the floor painting made the show look better on TV." ...|$|E

5000|$|The former BBC presenter, Jeremy Clarkson, {{has been}} highly {{critical}} of Mr Cohen, stating: “Everybody thinks that the BBC was a bloody nightmare. It wasn’t. <b>Cohen</b> was,” <b>said</b> Clarkson. “The BBC was brilliant to work for until the arrival of Mr Cohen. They never really interfered at all. But he was a bloody nuisance and caused me {{an enormous amount of}} stress.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, it's a {{good many}} yore-zeit since I had to manage for her and myself," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Cohen</b> quickly. [...] "I went early to it. It's that makes you a sharp knife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} {{you know all}} about it better than we do, sir," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Cohen,</b> repeatedly, by way of preface to full information; and the {{interesting}} statements were kept up in a trio.|$|R
