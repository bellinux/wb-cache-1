5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact that, in the United States, the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between <b>contemporary</b> <b>slavery</b> and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E

500|$|Not My Life is a 2011 American {{independent}} {{documentary film}} about human trafficking and <b>contemporary</b> <b>slavery.</b> The film was written, produced, {{and directed by}} Robert Bilheimer, who {{had been asked to}} make the film by Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Bilheimer planned Not My Life as the second installment in a trilogy, the first being A Closer Walk and the third being the unproduced Take Me Home. The title Not My Life came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching, founder of Tostan, who said that many people deny the reality of <b>contemporary</b> <b>slavery</b> because it is an uncomfortable truth, saying, [...] "No, this is not my life." ...|$|E

500|$|One Canadian critic {{said that}} the play's Bangkok setting allows Canadians to easily dissociate from the issue. Liz Nicholls of the Edmonton Journal wrote that the pimp {{character}} [...] "represents the ruthless spirit of pure human greed." [...] Stephen Pederson of The Chronicle Herald called the play a combination of idealism, realism, and lyricism. Dustin Wiebe of the Mennonite Brethren Herald wrote that the play shows [...] "the darker side of man's desire for control" [...] by presenting Number 18 as having been stripped of her humanity. The disaster that concludes the play is foreshadowed throughout. The play both starts and ends with a depiction {{of the reality of}} <b>contemporary</b> <b>slavery.</b>|$|E
500|$|Bilheimer {{said that}} the level of cruelty he saw in {{shooting}} Not My Life was greater than anything he had seen when documenting apartheid in South Africa for The Cry of Reason. Bilheimer attested to becoming more aware of the global extent of human trafficking as he went about making Not My Life. The film's title came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching, founder of Tostan, an organization dedicated to human rights education operating in ten African countries. As Bilheimer and Melching spoke in Thiès, Senegal, discussing how people often deny the reality of <b>contemporary</b> <b>slavery</b> because it is an uncomfortable truth, Melching said, [...] "People can say, 'No, this is not my life.' But my life can change. Let's change together." ...|$|E
500|$|Not My Life was {{screened}} at the 2012 UNIS-UN Conference in New York City, {{the theme}} of which was human exploitation. Segments from the film were included in [...] "Can You Walk Away?", a 2012 exhibition on <b>contemporary</b> <b>slavery</b> at President Lincoln's Cottage at the Soldiers' Home in Washington, DC. A hotel chain presented the film to its staff in London {{in preparation for the}} 2012 Summer Olympics to raise awareness about the types of human trafficking that might take place in conjunction with the events. Bilheimer initiated an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in 2012 to allow local organizations opposing human trafficking to screen the film. That same year, he expressed a willingness to release fifteen-minute excerpts from the film to help its message reach more people.|$|E

500|$|According to Nancy Keefe Rhodes of Stone Canoe, a U.S. {{literary}} journal, the film's {{audiences are}} likely to have the preconception that human trafficking is not slavery in the same sense that the Atlantic slave trade was, and many people believe that slavery was abolished a long time ago with such instruments as the U.S. Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. Rhodes writes that society now uses the word [...] "slavery" [...] in modern contexts only as a metaphor, so that references to actual <b>contemporary</b> <b>slavery</b> can be dismissed as hyperbole, and she describes the film's goal as to [...] "reclaim the original term [...] and convince us that what is happening now is what happened then: highly organized and pervasive, intentional, highly profitable and... fully as coercive and wantonly cruel." [...] Rhodes says that the word [...] "slavery" [...] has started to be used in its original sense again in recent years, but that audiences' views on <b>contemporary</b> <b>slavery</b> are nonetheless influenced by the slave-like imagery in such films as Hustle & Flow (2005) and Black Snake Moan (2007). The Academy Award-winning Hustle & Flow portrays a pimp as the hero, while Black Snake Moan features Christina Ricci as a young nymphomaniac; the marketing for Black Snake Moan centered on evocative, sexualized slave imagery, including a scantily-clad Ricci in chains. According to Rhodes, Bilheimer [...] "rescue modern slaves from representation as exotic creatures, to restore their humanity" [...] and allow audiences to relate to them. For this purpose, Bilheimer tells stories of individuals {{in the context of their}} communities and families. While Bilheimer had previously done extensive social justice work with religious organizations, he did not proselytize in the film, despite the many opportunities the film afforded him to do so.|$|E
500|$|Not My Life is a {{documentary}} film about human trafficking and <b>contemporary</b> <b>slavery.</b> It addresses {{many forms of}} slavery, including the military use of children in Uganda, involuntary servitude in the United States, unfree labor in Ghana, forced begging and garbage picking in India, sex trafficking in Europe and Southeast Asia, {{and other kinds of}} child abuse.
