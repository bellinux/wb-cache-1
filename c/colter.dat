5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the forest was visited by {{mountain}} men and explorers such as John <b>Colter</b> and Jim Bridger. <b>Colter</b> {{is the first}} white man known to have visited both the Yellowstone region and the forest, which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, <b>Colter</b> requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the Rocky Mountains during their return journey from the Pacific Ocean. <b>Colter</b> teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, <b>Colter</b> then explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole. <b>Colter</b> survived a grizzly bear attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who had taken his horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.|$|E

5|$|The Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center {{adjacent}} to the park headquarters at Moose, Wyoming, is open year-round. Opened in 2007 to replace an old, inadequate visitor center, the facility is named for the late U.S. Senator Craig Thomas and designed by acclaimed architect, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.

To the north at <b>Colter</b> Bay Village on Jackson Lake, the <b>Colter</b> Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum is open from the beginning of May to the early October. The <b>Colter</b> Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum has housed the David T. Vernon Indian Arts Exhibit since 1972. The <b>Colter</b> Bay Visitor Center was built in 1956 and was determined in 2005 to be substandard for the proper care and display of the Indian arts collection.

5|$|The Sole Survivor investigates a pre-War {{amusement}} park, Nuka-World, when radio advertisements are broadcast {{into the}} Commonwealth. Porter Gage, a veteran raider, contacts the Sole Survivor after boarding a monorail and tells {{them that they}} are walking into a death trap. Upon arrival, the Sole Survivor must navigate an increasingly-deadly obstacle course called the Gauntlet, which culminates in a fight with the raider leader, Overboss <b>Colter.</b> Gage reveals that the fight is rigged as <b>Colter</b> is wearing invulnerable electrically-charged armor, and that no-one survives the Gauntlet. Gage aids the Sole Survivor by helping them exploit the Achilles heel in Colter's armor, becoming the first person to survive the Gauntlet. Following the death of <b>Colter,</b> Gage explains the leaders of the three raider gangs conspired to usurp him, using the broadcast and the Gauntlet to find possible replacements. The Sole Survivor is offered to become the Overboss, but must balance the competing needs of each gang of raiders while conquering the outlying areas of the park. Once the entire park is under raider control, the Sole Survivor sets about expanding raider influence in the Commonwealth by conquering settlements, restoring power to Nuka-World to make the park self-sufficient, and thwarting attempts by the Gunnersa band of amoral mercenariesto seize control of Nuka-World for themselves.|$|E

5|$|As Jennings {{was also}} {{achieving}} success in country {{music in the}} early 1970s, the pair were combined into a genre called outlaw country, since it did not conform to Nashville standards.
