500|$|In February 2010, Bernd Schuster {{was asked}} if Raúl did not favour Villa moving to Real Madrid, to which he responded, [...] "I have a cough," [...] which caused many {{to believe that he}} was {{implying}} the rumour to be true. Villa firmly ridiculed that idea by saying, [...] "It is impossible that a player with as much class on and off the pitch as Raúl would speak poorly of me. I have always had a good relationship with Raúl, even though we have hardly met on international duty." [...] Speaking about Raúl's record with the Spanish national team as the nation's leading top scorer, Villa said, [...] "I've got 25 goals but he's got 44 and is still playing. I'd be delighted to reach that tally as I'd help the national team achieve great victories and, in many years' time, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> name on a [...] that another young lad was trying to beat. That would be great." [...] On 25 March 2011, two years after making that remark, Villa surpassed Raúl as Spain's all-time top scorer.|$|E
60|$|He made {{no further}} remark. We entered the drawing-room. I inquired if I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> aunt.|$|E
60|$|MALISE. Your {{tobacco is}} too good, Mr. Haywood. I wish I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way to smoking another.|$|E
60|$|At this, I {{began to}} feel uneasy, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>my</b> wife shared my trouble.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat for a}} {{while in}} silence. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>my</b> words had made an impression.|$|R
6000|$|She bit her coral lips [...] . but {{she also}} smiled. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>my</b> {{personality}} and my manners had greatly impressed her.|$|R
60|$|Adieu, ma chere, I must {{dress for}} church. I only wish you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> new hat {{and go with}} me, for Lord Rockingham promised to be there.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{those women}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> Californian blankets!" [...] {{she said to}} herself, but to Willy she said, [...] "They are very nice, and you may put them away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{he thought}} you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> head {{as soon as}} he did. The closeter you be to the turf the more you see things. You look warm-like,'said Mr Dudeney.|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{shuddered and}} cast a sorrowful glance toward Bradley. [...] "Ah," [...] she sighed, [...] "if I <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> <b>my</b> beloved country once again!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{occurred}} to him that it was unnecessary to explain. He assisted me into a sitting position, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> with <b>my</b> own eyes.|$|R
6000|$|I {{stared at}} him blankly. It was not much good, as he <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>my</b> face, but it {{relieved}} me. [...] "Rather a pretty girl!" [...] What a description! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'A {{can hold}} his tongue very clever--very clever truly," [...] echoed Leaf. [...] "'A do {{look at me}} as if 'a <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> {{thoughts}} running round like the works of a clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beautiful!" [...] cried Skene with emotion. [...] "Beautiful! There ain't but {{me and my}} boy in {{the world}} can give the upper cut like that! I wish I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> old missis's face now! This is nuts to her." ...|$|E
60|$|If you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> roses, and my aloes, and my fig-marigolds, and my olives, and my view over a plain, and my view {{of certain}} {{mountains}} as graceful as Apollo, as severe as Zeus, you would not think the phrase exaggerated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! you do {{not know}} me!' sighed the sentimental Mrs. Montgomery Floyd. 'If you only knew how I love flowers! I wish you <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> <b>my</b> {{conservatory}} in Park-lane!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, that manner, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in <b>my</b> visitor's face, and not {{a little}} else besides! [...] "She asks me every three minutes if I think you're coming in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite. I had it {{from his}} own lips. At least he told me he's fond of her, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> with <b>my</b> own eyes she's fond of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I did," [...] Bartley assented. [...] "And I haven't {{given up}} the notion yet. I've read {{a good deal of}} law already; but when I came up to Boston, I had to go into {{newspaper}} work till I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way out of the woods." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not certain}} but that I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> mother again {{before we went}} up river, {{therefore}} our parting was not as sorrowful {{as it would have}} been had I known all the perils which were to be encountered ere I looked upon her dear face again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] {{said the}} girl with another laugh, [...] "he might save me a trip to New York, if he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> drawings." [...] Something, {{she did not know}} what, in Mrs. Burton's manner, made her ask: [...] "Have you heard from him lately? Perhaps he's given it up, too!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "If You <b>could</b> <b>See</b> Her Through <b>My</b> Eyes" [...] {{received}} positive reviews.|$|R
60|$|Hearing these words, and {{watching}} him attentively while he spoke, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>my</b> silence {{would be a}} mercy, not a crime. I hastened to speak of other things.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I'm umbly {{thankful to}} you, sir,' said Mrs. Heep, in {{acknowledgement}} of my inquiries concerning her health, 'but I'm only pretty well. I haven't much to boast of. If I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> Uriah well settled in life, I couldn't expect much more I think. How {{do you think}} my Ury looking, sir?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That no {{one ever}} ventured,' said Felix. 'He was as much {{respected}} at Bexley--yes, and is still--as ever he could be here. I wish you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> brother Edgar, he is more like him than either of us. Ah, here's the old garden gate, I wish we could go into the shrubbery.|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} the two girls looked at me very sharply, but I stood {{at the back of}} an arm-chair so that no one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> feet. But that little imp Tizzy walked round deliberately, looked at my heels, and then walked back again. It was clear that she was in the secret.|$|E

60|$|So far, no doubt, {{this was}} quite in Mrs. Finch's character. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that--but <b>my</b> mind {{was too much}} pre-occupied to draw the {{inference}} that followed. Oscar's next words enlightened me.|$|R
60|$|He {{made the}} {{announcement}} as if the name alone would explain both his visit and its manner, but I <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> by <b>my</b> companion's unresponsive face, that it meant no more to him than to me.|$|R
60|$|This {{information}} was communicated {{to me by}} Joseph, on my return from an early visit {{to one of our}} warehouses at the riverside. When I asked if I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> aunt, I was informed that she had already retired to rest in her room, after the fatigue of a seven hours' journey by night.|$|E
6000|$|I {{seem to see}} him yet--his {{raised face}} with a {{friendly}} smile under the thick moustaches, and his kind, fatigued eyes. As the train began to move, he addressed me in two languages: first in French, saying, [...] "Bon voyage"; then, in his very good, somewhat emphatic English, encouragingly, because he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> concern: [...] "All will--be--well--yet!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{think you}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>MY</b> rock people. I'm {{the only person}} who can see them. But you could see rock people of your own. You're one of the kind that can. We're both that kind. YOU know, teacher," [...] he added, {{squeezing}} her hand chummily. [...] "Isn't it splendid to be that kind, teacher?" ...|$|E
60|$|I made no {{movement}} towards opening the gate. The newcomer advanced {{to within a}} few feet of me, and then paused. He leaned a little forward. He was doubtful, as I <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> of <b>my</b> identity.|$|R
60|$|Charley's {{last report}} {{was that the}} boy was quiet. I <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> from <b>my</b> window, the lantern they had left him burning quietly; and I went to bed very happy {{to think that he}} was sheltered.|$|R
