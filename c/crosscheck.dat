500|$|Four {{years after}} his first Olympic {{appearance}} as an amateur, the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, were set {{to become the first}} Games in which NHL players could compete in ice hockey. While Kariya was involved in a contract dispute with the Mighty Ducks, causing him to miss the start of the 1997–98 NHL season, Hockey Canada contacted Kariya, asking him to provide a training regimen by December 1, 1997, ensuring that he would be physically ready to play in the Olympics, given his inactivity in the NHL. Before agreeing to a contract with the Ducks in December, he joined the Canadian national team in training. On November 29, 1997, Canadian General Manager Bobby Clarke announced his roster for the Games, which included Kariya. He was the youngest player named to the team, behind defenceman Chris Pronger, who was born six days earlier. Less than a month to go {{before the start of the}} tournament, held in February 1998, however, he suffered a concussion, resulting from an on-ice <b>crosscheck</b> to the head from Chicago Blackhawks defenceman Gary Suter. The hit received much publicity as Suter, a member of the United States' national team, was accused by many in the media, as well as Bobby Clarke for targeting Kariya specifically in order to sideline him for the Olympics. He again described the missed opportunity as the [...] "biggest disappointment of [...] career," [...] adding that he was looking forward to playing in Japan, having family there.|$|E
2500|$|Kobach has {{championed the}} Interstate Voter Registration <b>Crosscheck</b> Program, which compares state records {{to find people}} {{registered}} to vote {{in more than one}} place. The New York Times credits him with rapidly expanding the reach of the program, referred to as the [...] "Kansas Project," [...] which by 2017 included more than 30 states. According to the New York Times, [...] "The program searches for double registrations using only voters’ first and last names and date of birth, and it generates thousands of false matches — John Smith in Kansas can easily be confused with John Smith in Iowa." [...] Due to its tendency to produce false matches, the program could be implemented to suppress the vote and wrongly remove legitimate voters from voter rolls. The program has led to sensational and misleading headlines: for example, 35,750 voters in the 2012 North Carolina general election matched with voters with supposedly identical voters in other states, but upon close investigation only [...] "eight cases of potential double voting were referred to prosecutors and two people were convicted." [...] Doubts over the accuracy of <b>Crosscheck</b> has led some states to withdraw from the program. A 2016 paper by researchers at Stanford, Harvard, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania found that if the program were fully implemented “200 legitimate voters may be impeded from voting for every double vote stopped.” ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{cataract}} surgical rate (CSR) in 2001 {{with that in}} 2008 in all Argentinean provinces using current reporting methods and verify the accuracy of CSRs by <b>crosschecking</b> these methods {{with the number of}} sold intraocular lenses (IOLs) within the country. Methods: A longitudinal study including public and private setups was conducted, and it included 40 ophthalmologists from 22 provinces who provided cataract surgery data for 2001 and 2008. Other data were obtained from the Ministry of Health. Estimates were <b>crosschecked</b> against the market data for sold intraocular lens (IOLs) in 2008 and 2010. Results: The number of cataract surgeries increased 2. 7 -fold, from 62, 739 in 2001 to 169, 762 in 2008, with increases in every province except Mendoza. Although the population also increased by 9. 4 % during the same time period, the apparent CSR jumped from 1, 744 to 4, 313 per million population. The number of IOLs sold in Argentina in 2008 was 186, 652, suggesting that the number of cataract surgeries performed was slightly greater than anticipated. <b>Crosschecks</b> with other countries using IOL sales data did not show discrepancies when compared with previously reported CSRs. Conclusions: Although the CSR in Argentina increased considerably from 2001 to 2008 for several reasons, the main reason was that thorough <b>crosschecking</b> between the number of surgeries reported and the number of IOLs sold revealed that the number of surgeries performed annually were being underestimated as a result of incomplete reporting by private practitioners. Furthermore, the presence of multiple societies of ophthalmology in the country complicated the process of obtaining accurate data...|$|R
