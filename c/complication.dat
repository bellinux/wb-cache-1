5|$|Several {{complications}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious <b>complication</b> of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in the brain is severely decreased. This <b>complication</b> leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.|$|E
5|$|A further, albeit rare, <b>complication</b> of CSF leak is {{transient}} quadriplegia due to {{a sudden}} and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine. An extremely rare <b>complication</b> of SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where {{the ability to move}} one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve.|$|E
5|$|Another {{common and}} {{potentially}} fatal <b>complication</b> of doxorubicin is typhlitis, an acute life-threatening {{infection of the}} bowel.|$|E
30|$|<b>Complications</b> were graded {{according}} to the Clavien–Dindo classification system as follows: I, minor <b>complications</b> not requiring medical or surgical intervention; II, <b>complications</b> requiring pharmacological treatment or blood transfusion; III, <b>complications</b> requiring re-intervention; IV, life-threatening <b>complications,</b> and V, death [27].|$|R
40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} age and preoperative <b>complications</b> on occurrence of postoperative <b>complications</b> in elderly patients with oral cancer. Methods　The clinical data of 106 patients with oral cancer who had undergone surgical treatment in the General Hospital of PLA from Jan. to Jul. 2014 were retrospcetively analysed. Among them, 66 patients were over 60 years old, and 40 patients were under 60 years old. The relationship between age, preoperative <b>complications</b> and postoperative <b>complications</b> was analyzed. Results　<b>Complications</b> including hypertension, heart disease, lung disease, anemia, etc. were significantly higher in patients of elderly group than in non-elderly group (P< 0. 05), but no {{significant difference was found}} in incidence of postoperative <b>complications</b> between two groups. Of 27 cases with more than 2 kinds of <b>complications</b> in elderly group, 14 (51. 9 %) suffered from postoperative <b>complications,</b> showing a significant difference (P= 0. 0244) compared with the overall incidence of postoperative <b>complications</b> in elderly group (17 / 66, 25. 8 %). Of 15 patients with preoperative <b>complications</b> in non-elderly group, 6 (40. 0 %) suffered from postoperative <b>complications,</b> but no significant difference (P= 0. 4462) was found when compared with that of postoperative <b>complications</b> in elderly group. In elderly patients, the incidence of postoperative <b>complications</b> was significantly different between those with preoperative <b>complications</b> (diabetes, lung disease, hypoalbuminemia or anemia) and those without preoperative <b>complications</b> (P< 0. 05). Conclusion　Age is not the independent risk factor for occurrence of postoperative <b>complications,</b> while some preoperative <b>complications</b> (such as diabetes mellitus, lung disease, hypoproteinemia and anemia) are the risk factors related to postoperative <b>complications.</b> 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2015. 01. 1...|$|R
40|$|Femoral {{vascular}} access-site <b>complications</b> in {{the cardiac}} catheterization laboratory: diagnosis and management REVIEW Vascular access-site <b>complications</b> remain {{a major cause}} of morbidity and mortality with cardiac catheterization and percutaneous intervention using the femoral approach. <b>Complications</b> may be divided into major and minor. Major <b>complications</b> include bleeding that requires transfusion, retroperitoneal hemorrhage and nonhemorrhagic <b>complications</b> such as pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, arterial dissection, thrombosis and limb ischemia. Minor <b>complications</b> include minor bleeding, ecchymosis and hematomas. The incidence of access <b>complications</b> varies by the population studied. Numerous patient-related and procedure-related risk factors have been associated with vascular access-site <b>complications.</b> Alternate access sites, the use of fluoroscopic guidance, focus on anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, and arterial closure devices are all methods being investigated to prevent and reduce <b>complications.</b> History and physical examination are important in identifying vascular access-site <b>complications</b> and imaging is helpful to confirm the diagnosis...|$|R
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening <b>complication,</b> is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another <b>complication,</b> significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and blood vessels, {{in the same}} fascial compartment—leading {{to the loss of}} blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this <b>complication</b> include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized <b>complication</b> is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) -DNA levels below which {{the development of}} cirrhosis-related <b>complications</b> became unlikely in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Seventy-nine Chinese CHB patients with cirrhosis-related <b>complications</b> and 158 age-, sex- and HBeAg status-matched patients without <b>complications</b> were enrolled. The precore and core promoter mutations were detected by the Line Probe assay (LiPA). HBVDNA levels were determined by Digene assay and Cobas Amplicor Monitor test. Patients with <b>complications</b> had higher HBVDNA levels than those without <b>complications</b> (P = 0. 02). HBeAg-positive patients with <b>complications</b> had similar alanine transferase (ALT) and HBVDNA levels and frequency of precore mutations, but higher frequency of core promoter mutations (P = 0. 003), compared with those without <b>complications.</b> Anti-HBe-positive patients with <b>complications</b> had higher ALT and HBVDNA levels (P < 0. 01) but similar frequency of precore and core promoter mutations, compared with those without <b>complications.</b> Anti-HBe patients (24. 5 %) with <b>complications</b> had HBVDNA levels < 104 copies/mL.

40|$|Background: Inadequate data is {{available}} regarding the patients’ perspective of <b>complications</b> following total knee arthroplasty. A recent physiotherapy feasibility trial provided {{opportunity to explore}} patients’ perspective of <b>complications</b> following total knee arthroplasty, and to reflect upon {{the extent to which}} these concur with the Knee Society’s new Standardized List and Definitions of <b>complications.</b> Purposes: 1. To explore if self report patient data collected post-operatively would provide a different picture of <b>complications</b> than is usually reported using data from medical notes. 2. To develop and describe an approach for a classification system to measure and report post-operative <b>complications</b> that is relevant for physiotherapists, surgeons and patients. Methods: Prospective survey of patients’ self reported <b>complications</b> and retrospective comparison of patient and medical record accounts of <b>complications</b> was performed during a prospective single blind randomised clinical trial (n= 107). Patients were asked to self report <b>complications</b> at 3 and 12 months follow ups. Medical notes of patients reporting major specific <b>complications</b> were examined. Descriptive statistics were used. Self report data was classified into major and minor surgical and non-surgical <b>complications.</b> Results: 12 % (n= 11 / 96) of participants self reported a total of 17 major <b>complications</b> at 3 months and 23 % (n= 22 / 96) reported 24 major <b>complications</b> at 12 months. 58 % (n= 56 / 96) reported 83 further <b>complications.</b> 38 % (n= 36 / 96) participants reported no further <b>complications.</b> Self reported data described greater variety regarding <b>complications</b> than previously seen. Data varied according to source (self report versus medical notes) and differed widely from the Knee Society’s list. A possible classification system is presented and discussed. Conclusions: Data are presented to stimulate debate regarding how <b>complications</b> should be defined and reported following interventions. <b>Complications</b> following arthroplasty are still being defined and measured by expert opinion. Discussion is needed regarding the collection, interpretation and relevance of <b>complications</b> data to both patients and all healthcare professional...|$|R
30|$|<b>Complications</b> were {{classified}} in short-term and long-term <b>complications.</b> Short-term <b>complications</b> {{were defined as}} blood loss, urinary tract infection, vaginal vault haematoma, ureter lesions, fever > 38.5  C. Long-term <b>complications</b> were defined as: tubal prolapse, persistent vaginal bleeding abdominal wall problems, dyspareunia, postoperative pelvic pain and pelvic organ prolapse. Conversions (laparoscopy to laparotomy) were not regarded as <b>complications</b> but were described separately as a standard of prudent surgery.|$|R
5|$|Another rare <b>complication</b> {{that may}} occur early during {{warfarin}} treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in {{blood vessels in the}} skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are the {{preferred}} {{choice in the}} management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, in particular, for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous <b>complication</b> of seizures and in subduing severe delirium.

5|$|Complicated UTIs {{are more}} {{difficult}} to treat and usually requires more aggressive evaluation, treatment and follow-up. It may require identifying and addressing the underlying <b>complication.</b> Increasing antibiotic resistance is causing concern about the future of treating those with complicated and recurrent UTI.|$|E
30|$|<b>Complications</b> were {{registered}} as early (occurring within 3  months postoperative) or late, {{as well as}} pouch-related or non-pouch-related. The validated Clavien–Dindo classification score (CCS) was used to grade <b>complications</b> (Dindo et al. 2004). CCS I and II were considered to indicate minor <b>complications</b> and CCS III to V major <b>complications.</b> In addition, the treatment for these <b>complications</b> was noted, in particular conservative, endoscopic, or open surgical therapy.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} number and nature of <b>complications</b> during the acute phase {{following}} traumatic spinal cord injury and to explore the relationship between number of <b>complications</b> and length of hospital stay. DESIGN: Multi-centre prospective cohort study. PATIENTS: A total of 54 patients with traumatic spinal cord injury, referred to 3 level 1 trauma centres in The Netherlands. METHODS: The number and nature of <b>complications</b> were registered weekly from September 2009 to December 2011. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients (59 %) had 1 or more medical <b>complications.</b> The most common <b>complications</b> were pressure ulcers (17 patients, 31 %) and pulmonary <b>complications</b> (15 patients, 28 %). PATIENTS with 3 or 4 <b>complications</b> had significantly (p < 0. 01) longer hospital stays (58. 5 [32. 5] days) compared with those with 1 or 2 <b>complications</b> (33. 1 [14. 8] days) or no <b>complications</b> (21. 5 [15. 6] days). CONCLUSION: <b>Complications,</b> particularly pressure ulcers and pulmonary <b>complications,</b> occurred frequently during the acute phase following traumatic spinal cord injury. More <b>complications</b> were associated with longer hospital stays. Despite the existence of protocols, more attention is needed to prevent pressure ulcers during the acute phase following traumatic spinal cord injury for patients in The Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To {{assess the}} early <b>complications</b> in the {{orthopedic}} treatment of metastatic bone lesions and the {{factors associated with}} these <b>complications.</b> Method: There were assessed, retrospectively, 64 patients that underwent surgical treatment for bone metastases, analyzing the <b>complications</b> {{that occurred in the}} pre-operative and early post- operative period and associating them with the tumor origin, type of procedure done, the need of blood reposition before the surgery, the need of new surgical procedures and the mortality due to the <b>complications.</b> Results: Early <b>complications</b> in the treatment were observed in 17 (26. 6 %) patients, of which six (35. 2 %) ended up dying due to these <b>complications.</b> Regarding the type, 15 (23. 8 %) cases were due to surgical <b>complications,</b> four (6. 3 %) clinical and three (4. 7 %) patients showed clinical and surgical <b>complications.</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} the frequency of <b>complications</b> or mortality when assessed the type of reconstruction or affected region. The tumors with a renal origin needed more blood reposition and showed a bigger frequency of <b>complications.</b> Conclusion: The <b>complications</b> occurred in 26. 6 %.

40|$|A laparoscopic or retroperitoneoscopic {{access to}} the adrenal gland is the {{standard}} of care for adrenalectomy in most cases. Although in laparoscopic adrenalectomy the approach is minimally invasive, the procedure is challenging. This {{is reflected in the}} scope of possible <b>complications.</b> The surgeon must consider <b>complications</b> related to the anatomical topography of the adrenal gland, which typically encompasses the <b>complications</b> known from open surgery and <b>complications</b> related to the minimal invasive access. In this topic paper we will address the most frequently encountered <b>complications</b> of adrenalectomy: vascular injuries, injuries of the bowel, pleural tears, and injuries to the liver, spleen and pancreas. Fortunately, these <b>complications</b> occur rarely. However, many of these <b>complications</b> can have devastating consequences. Therefore, it's the surgeon's obligation {{to be aware of the}} possible <b>complications</b> he might encounter during laparoscopic adrenalectomy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The urological <b>complications</b> of 210 {{patients}} who underwent simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation over a 7 -year period were reviewed. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Worldwide, bladder drainage {{has become the}} accepted method of exocrine drainage after pancreas transplantation. With {{the increasing use of}} bladder drainage, the surgical post-transplant <b>complications</b> have shifted from intra-abdominal <b>complications</b> to urological <b>complications.</b> METHODS: Two hundred ten diabetic patients received SPK transplants with bladder drainage. A retrospective review was conducted to analyze the incidence, type, and management of urological <b>complications.</b> RESULTS: The most frequent urological <b>complications</b> were hematuria, leak from the duodenal segment, recurrent urinary tract infections, urethritis, and ureteral stricture and disruption. <b>Complications</b> related to the renal transplant included ureteral stricture and leaks, as well as lymphoceles. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high incidence of urological <b>complications,</b> 5 -year actuarial patient and graft survival are excellent.

40|$|Background Postoperative {{adverse events}} {{are known to}} {{increase}} length of stay and cost. However, research on how adverse events affect patient flow and operational performance has been relatively limited to date. Moreover, there is paucity of studies {{on the use of}} simulation in understanding the effect of <b>complications</b> on care processes and resources. In hospitals with scarcity of resources, postoperative <b>complications</b> can exert a substantial influence on hospital throughputs. Methods: This paper describes an evaluation method for assessing the effect of <b>complications</b> on patient flow within a cardiac surgical department. The method is illustrated by a case study where actual patient-level data are incorporated into a discrete event simulation (DES) model. The DES model uses patient data obtained from a large hospital in Oman to quantify the effect of <b>complications</b> on patient flow, costs and surgical throughputs. We evaluated the incremental increase in resources due to treatment of <b>complications</b> using Poisson regression. Several types of <b>complications</b> were examined such as cardiac <b>complications,</b> pulmonary <b>complications,</b> infection <b>complications</b> and neurological <b>complications.</b> Results: 48 % of the patients in our dataset experienced one or more <b>complications.</b> The most common types of <b>complications</b> were ventricular arrhythmia (16 %) followed by new atrial arrhythmia (15. 5 %) and prolonged ventilation longer than 24 hours (12. 5 %). The total number of additional days associated with infections was the highest, while cardiac <b>complications</b> have resulted in the lowest number of incremental days of hospital stay. <b>Complications</b> had a significant effect on perioperative operational performance such as surgery cancellations and waiting time.
