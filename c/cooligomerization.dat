40|$|Summary: The C 9 fraction, {{which is}} one of the {{by-products}} from pyrolysis of gasoline or diesel oil, was used as raw material for producing petroleum resins with hydroxyl end-groups (PRHs). <b>Cooligomerization</b> of unsaturated products present in C 9 fraction was initiated by 2, 2 ’-azo-bis-(5 -hydroxy- 2 -methylpentanonitrile). The amount of the initiator was 0. 50 – 15. 0 mass % relative to raw material. The influence of temperature, process time and the initiator amount on yield and main characteristics of PRHs was examined. The characteristics of synthesized PRHs were verified with chemical and IR-spectroscopic methods. The hydrocarbon composition of wastes from PRHs production was examined and some ways of utilization of the wastes were suggested...|$|E
40|$|A new nonsymmetric bis(aryl-imino) {{acenaphthene}} ligand (Ar-BIAN), featured by {{a subtle}} steric and electronic unbalance of the N-donor atoms, is reported. With the new ligand {{and the corresponding}} symmetrically substituted derivatives both neutral and monocationic Pd-CH 3 compounds have been synthesized and characterized. In particular, the series of the monocationic complexes [Pd(CH 3) (L) (Ar-BIAN) ][PF 6] (L = CH 3 CN, dmso) has been now extended to dimethyl sulfoxide derivatives. The monocationic complexes were tested as precatalysts for the ethylene/methyl acrylate <b>cooligomerization</b> under mild conditions of temperature and ethylene pressure. The catalytic product {{is a mixture of}} ethylene/acrylate cooligomers and higher alkenes. The catalysts containing the new nonsymmetric ligand are found to be more productive than those with the symmetric Ar-BIANs. The Pd-dmso catalysts are more productive and show a longer lifetime than their Pd-NCCH 3 counterparts...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} process parameters of chemical reactions with involvement of gaseous substrates is the pressure. In the range of high pressures (> 5000 bar) the physical-chemical principles have not been broadly investigated yet. In particular, the influence of high pressure on homogeneously catalyzed reactions is still widely unknown. In this work the influence of high pressure on selectivities and yields is studied for two homogeneously rhodium catalyzed reactions. In both reactions, the hydroformylation of olefins and the <b>cooligomerization</b> of 1, 3 -butadiene and CO_ 2 significant changes in the product distribution are observed. The experiments have been performed in a newly constructed equipment, that enables to carry out experiments reproducibly under inert gas conditions in two different reactors at pressures up to 150 bar and up to 7000 bar, respectively.

40|$|Palladium(II) {{complexes}} with a nonsymmetric bis(aryl-imino) diazabutadiene ligand (ArDAB) {{have been}} synthesized and characterized. The new ligand is featured by one aryl ring substituted in ortho positions with methyl {{groups and the}} other ring bearing a trifluoromethyl group on the meta positions, leading to a subtle steric and electronic difference on the two nitrogen-donor atoms. This peculiar substitution makes the direct synthesis of the ligand not feasible, and the relevant Pd(II) complex, [Pd(CH 3) Cl(ArDAB) ], is directly obtained through a template reaction. The corresponding cationic complexes with either acetonitrile or dimethyl sulfoxide have been synthesized and characterized. The X-ray crystal structure of a palladium complex with an -diimine and dimethyl sulfoxide is reported. The monocationic complexes have been tested as precatalysts in the ethylene/methyl acrylate <b>cooligomerization</b> under mild reaction conditions of temperature and pressure. The comparison with the catalytic behavior of the precatalysts with the corresponding nonsymmetric ArBIAN ligand indicated that the active species with the currently investigated ligand is more productive, leading {{to the formation of}} ethylene oligomers and ethylene/methyl acrylate cooligomers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Density {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations with B 3 LYP and M 06 functionals elucidated the reactivities of alkynes and Z/E selectivity of cyclodecatriene {{products in}} the Ni-catalyzed [4 + 4 + 2] cycloadditions of dienes and alkynes. The Ni-mediated oxidative cyclization of butadienes deter-mines the Z/E selectivity. Only the oxidative cyclization of one s-cis to one s-trans butadiene is facile and exergonic, leading to the observed 1 Z, 4 Z, 8 E-cyclodecatriene product. The same step with two s-cis or s-trans butadienes is either kinetically or thermodynamically unfavorable, and the 1 Z, 4 E, 8 E- and 1 Z, 4 Z, 8 Z-cyclodecatriene isomers are not observed in experiments. In addition, the competition between the desired <b>cooligomerization</b> and [2 + 2 + 2] cycloadditions of alkynes depends on the coordination of alkynes. With either electron-deficient alkynes or alkynes with free hydroxyl groups, the coordination of alkynes is stronger than that of dienes, and alkyne trimerization prevails. With alkyl-substituted alkynes, the generation of alkyne-coordinated nickel complex is much less favorable, and the [4 + 4 + 2] cycloaddition occurs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Dengue {{virus is}} a major human {{pathogen}} responsible for 400 million infections yearly. As with other RNA viruses, daunting challenges to antiviral design exist due to the high error rates of RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Indeed, treatment of dengue virus infection with a nucleoside analog resulted in the expected genetic selection of resistant viruses in tissue culture and in mice. However, when {{the function of the}} oligomeric core protein was inhibited, no detectable selection of drug resistance in tissue culture or in mice was detected, despite the presence of drug-resistant variants in the population. Suppressed selection of drug-resistant virus correlated with <b>cooligomerization</b> of the targeted drug-susceptible and drug-resistant core proteins. The concept of “dominant drug targets, ” in which inhibition of oligomeric viral assemblages leads to the formation of drug-susceptible chimeras, can therefore be used to prevent the outgrowth of drug resistance during dengue virus infection. IMPORTANCE Drug resistance {{is a major}} hurdle in the development of effective antivirals, especially those directed at RNA vi-ruses. We have found that one can use the concept of the genetic dominance of defective subunits to “turn cousins into enemies,” i. e., to thwart the outgrowth of drug-resistant viral genomes as soon as they are generated. This requires deliberate targeting of larger assemblages, which would otherwise rarely be considered by antiviral researchers...|$|E
