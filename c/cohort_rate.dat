40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{incidence}} and mortality impact of {{upper and lower}} gastrointestinal (GI) events in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to non-RA subjects. Methods: We identified incident upper and lower GI events and estimated their incidence rates using person-year methods in a population-based incident RA cohort of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA (1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria first fulfilled between January 1, 1980, and January 1, 2008) and non-RA subjects from the same population. Results: The study included 813 patients with RA and 813 non-RA subjects (mean followup 10. 3 and 10. 8 yrs, respectively); 68 % women; mean age 55. 9 yrs in both cohorts. The rate of upper GI events/ 100 person-years was 2. 9 in RA versus 1. 7 in the non-RA <b>cohort</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 4, 2. 2); for lower GI events, the rates were 2. 1 in RA versus 1. 4 in the non-RA <b>cohort</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio 1. 5, 95 % CI 1. 1, 1. 9). The incidence of upper GI bleed, perforation, ulcer, obstruction, and any upper GI event in RA declined over calendar time; the incidence of lower GI events remained unchanged. Exposure to glucocorticoids, prior upper GI disease, abdominal surgery, and smoking were associated with lower GI events in RA. Both upper and lower GI events were associated with increased mortality risk in RA. Conclusion: There is increased risk of serious upper and lower GI events in RA compared to non-RA subjects, and increased GI-related mortality in RA. Prominent declines in incidence of upper, but not lower GI events in RA highlight the need for studies investigating lower GI disease in patients with RA...|$|E

Design: Analysis of database of linked abstracts of records of hospital admission and death. Setting: Health region in central southern England. Main outcome measure: Ratio of rate of MS in a cohort of people admitted to hospital with infectious mononucleosis to the rate in a comparison cohort. Results: Considering all time intervals from admission with infection to admission with MS, there was a non-significant increase of risk of MS in the infectious mononucleosis <b>cohort</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio 2. 17, 95 % confidence intervals 0. 79 to 4. 77).

The mean time from infectious mononucleosis to first admission with MS was 14 years. Conclusion: This study adds support to the evidence that Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of infectious mononucleosis, is associated with MS. Its role is probably as an initiator of the disease process of MS, or as a contributor to its early development, rather than as an activator of latent, existing disease. ...|$|E

Our aim was to determine whether they are. We analysed an epidemiological database of hospital admission and day-case statistics, constructing cohorts of people admitted for care for varicose veins or haemorrhoids, and comparing their experience of subsequent circulatory diseases with a control cohort. Compared with the control cohort, there was an elevated risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the varicose veins <b>cohort</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio 1. 20; 95 % confidence interval 1. 08 - 1. 33) but not in the haemorrhoids cohort (0. 90; 0. 78 - 1. 03).

This work is derived from 2 prospective cohorts of early RA: ESPOIR (n = 439) and RMP (n = 180). The proportions of patients with erosions at baseline and 1 year according to the genotypes of IL 2 RA (rs 2104286) or the haplotypes constructed with the 2 SNPs of IL 2 RB were compared in the whole population and in ACPA positive patients. A meta-analysis assessing the risk of erosion depending on the haplotypes of the 2 SNPs of IL- 2 RB was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method. A multivariate model was used to assess the independent effect of the haplotypes of IL- 2 RB on the risk of erosions. The AC haplotype of IL- 2 RB carriage was significantly associated with the rate of erosions in ACPA positive patients in ESPOIR <b>cohort</b> (<b>rate</b> of erosions: AC/AC: 78 % versus GC or GT/GC or GT: 44 %, p = 0. 001).

To this effect, we compared the rate of nephrotoxicity for selected orthopedic surgeries where gentamicin was included (Gentamicin Group) to those where it was not included (Control Group) for perioperative prophylaxis and evaluated risk factors for nephrotoxicity. Methods: Spine, hip and knee surgeries performed between April 2011 and December 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. Gentamicin was given to eligible patients based on age, weight and Creatinine Clearance. Nephrotoxicity was assessed using Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) criteria. Results: Among selected surgeries (N[*]=[*] 1590 in Gentamicin Group: hip[*]=[*] 926, spine[*]=[*] 600, knee[*]=[*] 64; N[*]=[*] 2587 in Control Group: hip[*]=[*] 980, spine[*]=[*] 902, knee[*]=[*] 705), patients’ body weight, serum creatinine, comorbidities and surgery duration were similar in Gentamicin Group and Control Group. Gentamicin median dose was 4. 5 [*]mg/kg of dosing weight. Nephrotoxicity rate was 2. 5 % in Gentamicin Group and 1. 8 % in Control Group, p[*]=[*] 0. 17. Most cases of nephrotoxicity were Risk category by RIFLE criteria (67 % in Gentamicin Group and 72 % in Control Group, p[*]=[*] 0. 49). In logistic regression, risk factors for nephrotoxicity were hospital stay > 1 [*]day prior to surgery (odds ratio[*]=[*] 8. 1; 95 % confidence interval[*]=[*] 2. 25 – 28. 97, p[*]=[*] 0. 001), knee or hip surgery (odds ratio[*]=[*] 4. 7; 95 % confidence interval[*]=[*] 2. 9 – 9. 48, p[*]=[*] 0. 0005) and diabetes (odds ratio[*]=[*] 1. 95; 95 % confidence interval[*]=[*] 1. 13 – 3. 35, p[*]=[*] 0. 016).

40|$|Because its benefit formula replaces {{a greater}} {{fraction}} of the lifetime earnings of lower earners than of higher earnings, Social Security is generally thought to be progressive, providing a “better deal” to low earners in a cohort than to high earners. However, much of the intra-cohort redistribution in the U. S. Social Security system is related to factors other than lifetime income. Social Security transfers income from people with low life expectancies to people with high life expectancies, from single workers and from married couples with substantial earnings by the secondary earner to married one-earner couples, and from {{people who work for}} more than 35 years to those who concentrate their earnings in 35 or fewer years. This paper studies the redistribution accomplished in the retirement portion of the current U. S. Social Security system using a microsimulation model built around a match of the 1990 and 1991 Surveys of Income and Program Participation to Social Security administrative earnings and benefit records. The model simulates the distribution of internal rates of returns, net transfers, and lifetime net tax rates from Social Security that would have been received by members of the 1925 to 1929 birth cohorts if they had lived under current Social Security rules for their entire lives. The paper finds that annual income-related transfers from Social Security are only 5 to 9 percent of Social Security benefits paid, or $ 19 to $ 34 billion, at 2001 aggregate benefits levels, when taxes and benefits are discounted at the <b>cohort</b> <b>rate</b> of return of 1. 29 percent. At higher discount rates, Social Security appears to be more redistributive by some measures, and less redistributive by others. Because much of the redistribution that occurs through Social Security is not related to income, the range of transfers received at a given level of lifetime income is quite wide. For example, 19 percent of individuals in the top lifetime income quintile receive net transfers that are greater than the average transfer for people in the lowest lifetime income quintile.

40|$|Essay 1 (with Juha Alho and Edward Palmer) :  All {{around the}} world, public pension schemes {{are moving in}} the {{direction}} of non-financial (NDC) and financial defined contribution (DC) schemes.   Both rely on accurate projections of life expectancy in the creation of annuities. Accurate projections are critical for system stability, individual utility and inter-generational welfare. This paper suggests a path-breaking innovation that changes the perspective from the Lee-carter (LC) family of trend models which assume a constant rate of change in mortality over time. Our approach is to project the cohort life expectancy on basis of the specific <b>cohort</b> <b>rate</b> of change in mortality. This relaxes the strong trend assumption underlying the LC model, which is the reason why LC model does not work well in the phase of accelerating or decelerating mortality. We use unisex mortality data for $ 8 $ countries to test the performance of our approach both ex-post and ex-ante. The ex-post experiment shows that our approach generally performs better when the rate of change in mortality is accelerating and performs as well as LC model when the rate of change is time-invariant. The ex-ante experiment, on the other hand, shows that our model almost always delivers higher projection of remaining life expectancy than the LC model for the more recent cohorts, which is consistent with the ex-post experimental results.  Essay 2 :  Due to the systematic underestimation of cohort life expectancy, NDC pension schemes face a financial risk that can leads to inter-generational unfairness, given the current practice. This paper proposes an alternative method of computing annuity to address this problem. The proposal is to adjust the annuity based on re-estimations of the remaining life expectancy at intervals after retirement, but only up to a ceiling age. The scheme is assessed using 208 cohort annuity pools from eight sample countries. This experiment shows that the proposed scheme succeeds in reducing the inter-generational unfairness for 60 - 80 % of the cohort annuity pools, compared to current practice of fixing the annuity at age 65. Because the adjustment is borne by the relatively large group of younger persons, the per capita change in utility is rather small assuming risk neutrality.  Essay 3 :  This paper studies how the incentive to retire in a DC (NDC) scheme is influenced by engaging private information on life expectancy. This is an important question since the decisions made under the two scenarios, optimizing using the private life expectancy or the cohort average made available by the pension provider, create different welfare and financial outcomes. The analytical framework is a standard life-cycle model, accounting for monetary gain from work and non-monetary gain from leisure. The unique feature here is that the individual life expectancy is an explicit driver of disutility of work. The theoretical result is that prevailing private information of a longer-than-average life expectancy can lead to both advancing and delaying retirement, depending on other factors determining utility. The numerical example using Swedish data proves the theoretical results and suggests a rather small average impact on the choice of retirement by engaging private information of life expectancy.  Essay 4 :   Pensions in the increasingly popular Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) Pay-as-You-Go Schemes are granted based on cohort-specific life expectancy, regardless socioeconomic differences. This risks perverse intra-generational and unintended inter-generational transfers. This paper introduces an alternative with separate annuity pools for different socioeconomic classes. Using unique Swedish data and the Swedish NDC pension system as an example, the analysis shows a significant gap in life expectancy between socioeconomic classes defined by occupation. In the Swedish context, this implies a perverse transfer of 5 % of the pension capital from the manual workers to the non-manual workers, which can be abolished by using the group plan. In addition, the group plan also lessens the risk of inter-generational transfers resulting from the gap in life expectancy. ...|$|E
