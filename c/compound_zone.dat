40|$|The present work {{is devoted}} to {{research}} the influence of micro-structural evolution of the <b>compound</b> <b>zone</b> (iron (carbo) nitrides zone) upon development of hardness profiles in diffusion zone. A different phase structure of iron (carbo) nitrides zone on steel as compared to iron, further changing with the process, may result in upsetting the quasi-equilibrium of nitrogen concentration in the iron (carbo) nitrides zone/diffusion zone interface and may as a result have impact on the kinetics of this layer’s growth. Aimed at solving this problem there was a research carried out to evaluate influence of (carbo) nitrides zone, with intentionally created diametrically different phase composition, on hardness profiles in the diffusion zone. Based on the research conducted, it was shown that the evolution of phase structure of the <b>compound</b> <b>zone</b> contributes significantly, regardless of nitrogen potential and temperature, {{to the formation of}} the diffusion zone and in particular to its effective thickness.

By examining the effects of crude plant extracts on Staphylococcus aureus, a fast-growing, ubiquitous, gram-positive bacterium, biologically active extracts can be identified. Further separation of these by column chromatography may yield pure compounds with antibacterial activity. Most plant species produce at least moderately active antimicrobial compounds {{as part of their}} specific and non-specific defense systems. It is possible that some of these defenses hold the keys to treating or curing human diseases caused by bacteria. It is of interest to determine if crude plant extracts and pure compounds have antimicrobial activity or, alternatively, can potentiate the activity of known antibiotics. To explore this, a disk-diffusion based research method is employed to facilitate comparison between effects of the test materials on the growth of S. aureus. Small changes can be made for this method to work with other species based on normal growth rate of the organism used, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the antibiotic drugs needed for each organism used in different assays.

Hybrid compounds of different scaffolds are expected to enhance the bioactivity by improved affinity to target proteins while retaining the biological efficacy of each of the components. In view of this, a series of pyrazolines with aryloxy acid in the side chain are synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial potential. Pyrazoline-substituted aryloxy acids were synthesized in very good yields, starting from chalcones. Synthetic method is adopted {{in such a way that}} the use of any solvents is avoided. The structures of these compounds were confirmed using FTIR, NMR, and Mass spectrometry. The potential of these molecules as antimicrobial agents was predicted using molecular docking studies.

40|$|The {{effect of}} plasma {{nitriding}} on hydrogen permeation through AISI 4340 was studied both experimentally and theoretically. Effective hydrogen diffusion coefficients were measured for three different AISI 4340 membrane specimens: as-received, nitrided, and nitrided specimens with the compound layer removed by mechanical abrasion. The as-received specimen {{had a higher}} diffusion coefficient (2. 8 × 10 − 6 cm 2 /sec) than the nitrided specimens. The nitrided specimen with the compound layer intact had a much lower hydrogen diffusion coefficient (0. 65 × 10 − 6 cm 2 /sec) than the specimen without the compound layer (1. 9 × 10 − 6 cm 2 /sec). These results demonstrate that the γ′-Fe 4 N rich compound surface layer and the N that diffuses more deeply into AISI 4340 during plasma nitriding both reduce the effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient.

Thermal gradient inside the sample kept on substrate holder during cooling process was measured by three inserted thermocouples at different depths.

40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} it is {{proposed}} to find methods of structural reinforcement of a side frame of a bogie {{in areas of}} stress concentration (the <b>compound</b> <b>zone,</b> {{the corners of the}} pedestal jaw opening, etc.), where, as the experience of operation shows, it is possible the emergence of fatigue cracks. It should avoid a significant increase in weight of the structure and does not cause «overflow» areas with a lot of stress from one portion of the structure to another. Methodology. The stresses in the side frame are determined by finite element modeling. Firstly parts of structure that is subject to be strengthened are detected. At the next stage the possible ways of enhancement are developed (wall thickness increase, change of fillet radii, introduction of additional truss plate, etc.). After which according to the results of simulation the effectiveness of each method is evaluated. Amplification of individual sections of the side frame does not always lead to its hardening as a whole (stress decrease in one place often leads to stress increase in the other one). The further procedure is iterative in nature: best-case changes are entered {{in the design of the}} frame; weakened areas of construction again are revealed and so on, till to the achievement an acceptable level of safety. Findings. Directional iterative search allows finding a combination of local amplification that increasing significantly the strength of structure. Namely, radius of the transition from the column to the support surface and in the openings between the column and the inclined belt up to 40 and 50 mm are increased respectively; truss plate are added between the upper and lower shelf of Triangel guide and on the inner guide of jaw aperture; technological area of the aperture in the column is reduced by one-third. Due to the proposed stresses combination, voltages in construction were reduced by 41 %. Originality. The efficiency of the iterative search procedure of local amplifications combinations in design of the side frame that let significantly increase its strength without a significant increase in weight is presented by scientists. Practical value. Obtained results give the possibility to increase significantly the strength of the side frame in the three-piece truck without any noticeable change in its geometrical and mass characteristics...|$|E

In terms of the general structure, the study area {{is located in a}} <b>compound</b> transfer <b>zone</b> with major bounding faults to the west (Ying 1 fault) and east (Ying - 8 and - 31 faults). Using three-dimensional seismic data, wireline log and checkshot data, the geometries and kinematics of faults in the transfer zone were studied, and fault displacements were calculated. The results show that when activity on the Ying 1 fault diminished, displacement was transferred to the Ying - 8, Ying - 31 and secondary faults so that total displacement increased. Dynamic analysis shows that the stress fields in the transfer zone were complex: the northern portion was a left-lateral extensional shear zone, and the southern portion was a right-lateral extensional shear zone. A model of potential hydrocarbon traps in the Dongying transfer zone was constructed based on the above data combined with the observed reservoir rock distribution and the sealing characteristics of the faults. The hydrocarbons were mainly expulsed from Minfeng Sag during deposition periods of Neogene Guantao and Minghuazhen Formations, and migrated along major faults from source kitchens to reservoirs. The secondary faults acted as barriers, resulting in the formation of fault-bound compartments. The high points of the anticline and well-sealed traps near secondary faults are potential targets.

This paper describes an ongoing effort to develop a “Controller’s Assistant ” to enhance the apparent capabilities of existing CGFs by introducing a speech-enabled, intelligent user interface (IUI) between a human controller and a set of CGFs. This Controller’s Assistant allows for a human controller to use doctrinal airspace control commands to interact with a diverse set of CGFs in a distributed HLA simulation federation. The IUI translates spoken user commands into HLA commands that direct the CGFs, and also monitors CGF progress to provide spoken feedback to the controller when doctrinally appropriate. 1...|$|R
40|$|Species of {{the genus}} Carpobrotus are similar in {{appearance}} and {{have been used for}} medicinal purposes over many generations. Carpobrotus mellei is endemic to the south-Western Cape of South Africa, and also used for various ailments. To date no scientific validation and information has been reported on C. mellei. This study investigated the antimicrobial potential of C. mellei against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Mycobacterium smegmatis, and determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) by two-fold serial dilution. C. mellei showed antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and M. smegmatis in the disc diffusion method. Eight chemical <b>compounds</b> showed clear <b>zones</b> of inhibition in the bioautograms, seven against S. aureus and three compounds were active against M. smegmatis. The ethyl acetate extracts have MIC values of 7. 5 mg/ml and 15 mg/ml against S. aureus and M. smegmatis, respectively. Phytochemical tests indicated the presence of flavonoids, hydrolysable tannins, phytosterols and aromatic acids. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed a species-specific spectrum at a wavelength of 280 nm. The results confirm that C. mellei has scientific merit, and can substitute one of the other Carpobrotus species for antimicrobial usage within the south-Western Cape of South Africa...|$|R
40|$|The cuprates {{contain a}} range of {{nanoscale}} phenomena that consist of both LDOS(E) features and spatial excitations. Many of these phenomena can only be observed {{through the use of}} a SI-STM and their disorder can be mapped out through the fitting of a phenomenological model to the LDOS(E). We present a study of the nanometer scale disorder of single crystal cryogenically cleaved samples of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +x whose dopings range from p = 0. 19 to 0. 06. The phenomenological model used is the Tripartite model that has been successfully applied to the average LDOS(E) previously. The resulting energy scale maps show a structured patchwork disorder of three energy scales, which can be described by a single underlying disordered parameter. This spatial disorder structure is universal for all dopings and energy scales. It is independent of the oxygen dopant negative energy resonances and the interface between the different patches takes the form of a shortened lifetime pseudogap/superconducting gap state. The relationship between the energy scales and the spatial modulations of the dispersive QPI, static q 1 * modulation and the pseudogap shows that the energy scales signatures in the LDOS(E) are tied to the onset and termination of the spatial excitations. The static q 1 * modulations local energy range is measured and its signature in the LDOS(E) is the kink, whose number of states are modulated with a wave vector of q 1 *. This analysis of both the LDOS(r,E) and the spatial modulations in q-space show a picture of a single underlying disordered parameter that determines both the LDOS(E) structure as well as the energy ranges of the QPI, q 1 * modulation and the pseudogap states. This parameter for a single patch can be defined by the Fermi surface crossing of the parent <b>compound</b> anti-ferromagnetic <b>zone</b> boundary for a model homogeneous superconductor with the same electronic properties as the patch...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of retapamulin against 106 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 109 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was {{evaluated by the}} agar dilution, broth microdilution, E-test, and disk diffusion methodologies. Where possible, the tests were performed by using the CLSI methodology. The results of agar dilution, broth microdilution, and E-test (all with incubation in ambient air) for S. aureus yielded similar MICs, {{in the range of}} 0. 03 to 0. 25 μg/ml. These values corresponded to zone diameters between 25 and 33 mm by the use of a 2 -μg retapamulin disk. Overall, 99 % of the agar dilution results and 95 % of E-test results for S. aureus were within ± 1 dilution of the microdilution results. For S. pyogenes, the MICs obtained by the agar and broth microdilution methods (both after incubation in ambient air) were in the range of 0. 008 to 0. 03 μg/ml, and E-test MICs (with incubation in ambient air) were 0. 016 to 0. 06 μg/ml. For S. pyogenes, 100 % of the agar dilution MIC results were within ± 1 dilution of the broth microdilution results. E-test MICs (after incubation in ambient air) were within ± 1 and ± 2 dilutions of the broth microdilution results for 76 % and 99 % of the isolates, respectively. E-test MICs for S. pyogenes strains in CO 2 were up to 4 dilutions higher than those in ambient air. Therefore, it is recommended that when retapamulin MICs are determined by E-test, incubation be done in ambient air and not in CO 2, due to the adverse effect of CO 2 on the activity of this <b>compound.</b> Diffusion <b>zones</b> (with incubation in CO 2) for S. pyogenes were 18 to 24 mm. Retapamulin MICs for all strains by all methods (with incubation in ambient air) were ≤ 0. 25 μg/ml. These results demonstrate that S. pyogenes (including macrolide-resistant strains) and S. aureus (including methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-nonsusceptible strains) are inhibited by very low concentrations of retapamulin and that all four testing methods are satisfactory for use for susceptibility testing...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} effect of endplate-targeted {{injections}} of a low Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) dose with that of injections at defined distances from the motor endplate zone. METHODS: In eight healthy volunteers, the main endplate zones of {{the right and left}} extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) muscles were localized using high-density surface EMG. On the study side BoNT-A was injected at fixed distances from the endplate zone. On the control side, BoNT-A was administered into the endplate <b>zone.</b> <b>Compound</b> muscle action potential (CMAP) prior to the injection and 2, 12, and 24 weeks later were recorded. RESULTS: On the control side, the mean CMAP reduction 2 weeks after BoNT-A injection was 79. 3 %. The difference in CMAP reduction between both EDB muscles was significantly related to the injection distance from the endplate zone. Increasing the injection distance by 1 cm reduced {{the effect of}} BoNT-A by 46 %. CONCLUSIONS: Guided injection of a reduced BoNT-A dose into the muscle's endplate zone(s) is a promising strategy for optimizing the therapeutic effectiveness of BoNT-A and for minimizing side-effects such as unwanted weakness of adjacent muscles. SIGNIFICANCE: Precise endplate-targeted injections increase the effect of BoNT-A and may thus prove to reduce required dosage and treatment costs...|$|R
40|$|Actin is an {{abundant}} component of nerve terminals {{that has been}} implicated at multiple steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle, including reversible anchoring, exocytosis, and recycling of synaptic vesicles. In the present study we used the lamprey reticulospinal synapse to examine the role of actin {{at the site of}} synaptic vesicle recycling, the endocytic <b>zone.</b> <b>Compounds</b> interfering with actin function, including phalloidin, the catalytic subunit of Clostridium botulinum C 2 toxin, and N-ethylmaleimide-treated myosin S 1 fragments were microinjected into the axon. In unstimulated, phalloidin-injected axons actin filaments formed a thin cytomatrix adjacent to the plasma membrane around the synaptic vesicle cluster. The filaments proliferated after stimulation and extended toward the vesicle cluster. Synaptic vesicles were tethered along the filaments. Injection of N-ethylmaleimide-treated myosin S 1 fragments caused accumulation of aggregates of synaptic vesicles between the endocytic zone and the vesicle cluster, suggesting that vesicle transport was inhibited. Phalloidin, as well as C 2 toxin, also caused changes in the structure of clathrin-coated pits in stimulated synapses. Our data provide evidence for a critical role of actin in recycling of synaptic vesicles, which seems to involve functions both in endocytosis and in the transport of recycled vesicles to the synaptic vesicle cluster...|$|R
40|$|Fault {{zones are}} {{ubiquitous}} structures throughout the Earth’s crust {{and as a}} fault evolves it can significantly influence the rheological and hydrological properties of the crust. Fluid flow through fault zones is typically associated with fault-fluid-rock interactions and these interactions can affect the mineralogy, strength and evolution of a fault zone. In this study, field mapping is combined with petro-physical and stable isotopic analyses of the fault rock to evaluate the fault-fluid-rock interactions that occur within different fault zones, {{and the effects of}} these reactions on fault zone and fault population evolution. At Passo Moro in the NW Itilian Alps, there are three sets of joints cross-cutting the granite gneiss and numerous faults have formed by reactivation of pre-existing joints. The distribution of faults at Passo Moro is ultimately controlled by the variability of joint density within the host rock and the pre-existing joint distribution also affects the likelihood of whether a fault will grow into a mature fault zone or not. Where the joint density is high, strain is unable to accumulate to significant levels to enable joint reactivation into faults, whereas where joint density is low, fault zones are isolated and thus there are no structures nearby to facilitate fault linkage. At Passo Moro the fault population has evolved in a similar way as that described by Martel (1990) whereby small faults link to form simple faults which connect to form <b>compound</b> fault <b>zones.</b> The Virgin Fault and Spaghetti Fault would be considered as small fault zones and The Ciao Ciao Fault is equivalent to a <b>compound</b> fault <b>zone.</b> All three fault zones have different fault architectures and the small faults have been affected by different fluid-rock reactions compared to the larger fault. The small faults have experienced fault zone strengthening by K-feldspar precipitation, whereas the large fault has been weakened by muscovite precipitation. The different reactions between the fault zones are primarily controlled by the water-rock ratio which in turn is governed by permeability and the volume of fluid that infiltrates the fault zone. The Virgin Fault is considered as a rock-dominated system (K-feldspar-rich) whereas The Ciao Ciao fault is a fluid-dominated system (muscovite-rich). However, stable isotopes from both fault zones record a low water-rock ratio signifying rock-dominated conditions. Therefore the mineralogy of the fault rock is not solely controlled by the permeability defined water-rock ratio. The fluid dominated conditions promoting muscovitization in the Ciao Ciao Fault were probably enabled by an open fluid system and large volumes of fluid flowing through the fault during its lifetime. Stable isotopes indicate that water-rock ratios got lower with time in the Virgin Fault implying a limited open system, whereas muscovitization and stable water-rock ratios in the Ciao Ciao Fault point towards open system behaviour. In the Ciao Ciao Fault quartz precipitation only occurs in the foliated cataclasite within the fault core. Quartz precipitation is typically associated with closed system behaviour and suggests that the foliated cataclasite periodically ceased to be open to fluids and hence experienced cycles of higher and lower permeability. Stable isotopes show that the Virgin Fault records mineral precipitation from a metamorphic-like fluid, but after fault deactivation, the fault periodically transmitted progressively more meteoric-like fluids via a micro-fracture network. The Ciao Ciao Fault records mineral precipitation from a more meteoric-like fluid compared to the Virgin Fault, and flow through micro-fracture networks is dominated by an essentially meteoric fluid. The Ciao Ciao Fault therefore does not preserve evidence of fluids from its early history. This study indicates that the geochemical reactions that occur within a fault are controlled in part by the evolutionary stage of the fault, the fault rock permeability and the volume of fluids that pass through the fault. These results have been used to propose models for how the hydraulic properties and strength of a fault (population) evolve with time. The models produced from this study help advance our understanding of the processes that occur during the timescale of the seismic cycle, and how a population of faults will evolve in terms of mineralogy, strength and fluid flow. Such information will be of use to those involved in mineralization and mining studies, the storage of nuclear waste in crystalline rock, and earthquake prediction studies...|$|R
