5000|$|Physically smaller {{systems that}} are built many times may use a <b>cable</b> <b>harness.</b> A {{full-sized}} to-scale wiring diagram can be made of a <b>cable</b> <b>harness.</b> This wiring diagram can then be laid on a peg board and used to guide the construction of more cable harnesses. Harnesses can be inserted into to their equipment as an assembly. Cable harnesses that are reused many times, like automobile wiring harnesses, are created with automated machinery.|$|E

40|$|The {{simulation}} of <b>cable</b> <b>harnesses</b> is challenging {{due to the}} complex structure and the large deformation during the assembly operations. In this paper an improved mass-spring model is approached to simulate the shape of <b>cable</b> <b>harnesses</b> and to calculate the deformation of <b>cable</b> <b>harnesses.</b> Based on a virtual software platform Open Cascade and using Newmark-β algorithm which could reduce the instabilities of equation, the simulation is completed. Then, a cable geometry measurement bench with the 3 D laser scan technology is construed to verify {{the accuracy of the}} algorithm. The result shows the model could simulate the deformation very well...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to automate these processes, with suppliers like 1X Technologies, Belden Inc., and Alpha Wire leading the <b>Cable</b> <b>Harness</b> industry in quality manual production, automating only portions of the process.

50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>harness,</b> {{also known}} as a wire harness, cable {{assembly}}, wiring assembly or wiring loom, is an assembly of electrical cables or wires which transmit signals or electrical power. The cables are bound together by straps, cable ties, cable lacing, sleeves, electrical tape, conduit, a weave of extruded string, or a combination thereof.|$|E
50|$|Renningen is {{economically}} {{dependent on}} the wider community, {{a large percentage of}} the workforce work outside the district, for example at DaimlerChrysler in Sindelfingen or in Stuttgart. Nevertheless, there are employment opportunities, for example through Pininfarina, who are involved in Formula 1 and in manufacture of sports cars. Kromberg & Schubert, the major <b>cable</b> <b>harness</b> supplier to the German car industry also have a presence in the town.|$|E
50|$|The wires {{are first}} {{cut to the}} desired length, usually using a special wire-cutting machine. The wires may also be printed on by a special machine during the cutting process or on a {{separate}} machine. After this, {{the ends of the}} wires are stripped to expose the metal (or core) of the wires, which are fitted with any required terminals or connector housings. The cables are assembled and clamped together on a special workbench, or onto a pin board (assembly board), according to the design specification, to form the <b>cable</b> <b>harness.</b> After fitting any protective sleeves, conduit, or extruded yarn, the harness is either fitted directly in the vehicle or shipped.|$|E

50|$|Commonly used in automobiles, {{as well as}} {{construction}} machinery, cable harnesses provide {{several advantages}} over loose wires and cables. For example, many aircraft, automobiles and spacecraft contain many masses of wires which would stretch over several kilometres if fully extended. By binding the many wires and cables into a <b>cable</b> <b>harness,</b> the wires and cables can be better secured against the adverse effects of vibrations, abrasions, and moisture. By constricting the wires into a non-flexing bundle, usage of space is optimized, {{and the risk of}} a short is decreased. Since the installer has only one harness to install (as opposed to multiple wires), installation time is decreased and the process can be easily standardized. Binding the wires into a flame-retardant sleeve also lowers the risk of electrical fires.|$|E
50|$|Launch was {{originally}} scheduled for 9 March, but during processing work at Pad A, significant cracks {{were found on}} all four lug hinges on the two external tank umbilical door drive mechanisms. NASA managers opted to roll back the vehicle to the VAB on 7 March, and then to OPF for repair. The faulty hinges were replaced with units taken from orbiter Columbia, and reinforced. Discovery was returned to the pad on 1 April, and the launch was rescheduled for 23 April. The mission was again postponed when, during prelaunch external tank loading, a transducer on high-pressure oxidizer turbopump for main engine number three showed readings out of specification. The transducer and its <b>cable</b> <b>harness</b> were replaced and tested. The launch was rescheduled for 28 April. Actual launch occurred at 28 April 1991, 7:33:14 am EDT.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{electrical}} loads and {{the complexity of}} the electric system in a vehicle is increasing {{at the same time as}} the allowed development time is getting shorter. Possibilities to predict the electromagnetic behaviour is therefore of great importance. In this paper, a method for determining the parasitic components affecting crosstalk in a <b>cable</b> <b>harness</b> is proposed. The method suggests that a more complex ground structure should for calculation purposes be replaced by equivalent ground planes. Calculated parameter values are compared to values gained from simulation in a circuit model for investigation of crosstalk. It is shown that also an approximation of the parasitic components will give a good comprehension of the crosstalk effects in the <b>cable</b> <b>harness...</b>|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{research}} work using immersive virtual reality (VR) {{in the domain}} of <b>cable</b> <b>harness</b> design has shown conclusively that this technology had provided substantial productivity gains over traditional computer aided design (CAD) systems. The follow-on work in this paper was aimed at understanding the degree to which various aspects of the immersive VR system were contributing to these benefits and how engineering design and planning processes could be analysed in detail as they are being carried out; the nature of this technology being such that the user’s activities can be non-intrusively monitored and logged without interrupting a creative design process or manufacturing planning task. This current research involved the creation of a more robust and CAD-equivalent VR system for <b>cable</b> <b>harness</b> routing design, harness assembly and installation planning which could be functionally evaluated using a set of creative design-task experiments to provide detail about the system and users ’ performance. A design task categorisation scheme was developed which allowed both a general and detailed breakdown of the design engineer’s <b>cable</b> <b>harness</b> design process and associated activities.

40|$|The team {{of authors}} at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has been {{investigating}} estimating techniques for the vibration response of launch vehicle panels excited by acoustics and/or aero-fluctuating pressures. Validation of the approaches used to estimate these environments based on ground tests of flight like hardware is of major importance to new vehicle programs. The team at MSFC has recently expanded upon the first series of ground test cases completed in December 2010. The follow on tests recently completed are intended to illustrate differences in damping that might be expected when <b>cable</b> <b>harnesses</b> {{are added to the}} configurations under test. This validation study examines the effect on vibroacoustic response resulting from the installation of cable bundles on a curved orthogrid panel. Of interest is the level of damping provided by the installation of the cable bundles and whether this damping could be potentially leveraged in launch vehicle design. The results of this test are compared with baseline acoustic response tests without cables. Damping estimates from the measured response data are made using a new software tool that employs a finite element model (FEM) of the panel in conjunction with advanced optimization techniques. This paper will report on the trend differences. observed from response measurements for several different configurations of <b>cable</b> <b>harnesses.</b> The data should assist vibroacoustics engineers to make more informed damping assumptions when calculating vibration response estimates when using model based analysis approach. Achieving conservative estimates that have more flight like accuracy is desired. The paper may also assist analysts in determining how ground test data may relate to expected flight response levels. Empirical response estimates may also need to be adjusted if the measured response used as an input to the study came from a test article without flight like <b>cable</b> <b>harnesses...</b>|$|R
