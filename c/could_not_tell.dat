5|$|Scull appealed his {{conviction}} to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a unanimous ruling in May 1959, {{the high court}} held in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Comm. on Law Reform and Racial Activities that the conviction violated Scull's 14th Amendment rights to due process because the committee's inquiry was so vague and so confusing that Scull <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> what he was being asked.|$|E
5|$|Roder was not replaced, with punter Dave Green {{taking over}} his duties. Rick Jennings spent the {{shortest}} {{amount of time}} with the club of all players that season; picked up on waivers from the Raiders on a Tuesday, he was released the same Thursday. New uniforms had to be ordered for the team when it was discovered that the fans <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> the players apart because the numerals on the white uniforms could not be seen from the stands. Many local Miami Dolphins fans were angered when the NFL upheld the Buccaneers’ demand that Dolphin games not be broadcast in the Tampa Bay area on days that the Buccaneers play at home. The timing of the decision led to the firing of Director of Administration Curt Mosher after the season.|$|E
5|$|Henry Walter Bates: (1825–1892) was an English explorer-naturalist who {{surveyed}} the Amazon rainforest with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848. While Wallace returned in 1852, Bates remained {{for over a}} decade. His field research included collecting almost a hundred species of butterflies from the families Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, as well as thousands of other insects specimens. In sorting these butterflies into similar groups based on appearance, inconsistencies began to arise. Some appeared superficially similar to others, even {{so much so that}} Bates <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> some species apart based only on wing appearance. However, closer examination of less obvious morphological characters seemed to show that they were not even closely related. Shortly after his return to England he read a paper on his theory of mimicry {{at a meeting of the}} Linnean Society of London on 21 November 1861, which was then published in 1862 as 'Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley' in the society's Transactions. He elaborated on his experiences further in The Naturalist on the River Amazons.|$|E

5|$|On May 30, the General Staff {{ordered the}} {{creation}} of a new battalion in Givati, the 57th, that would consist of about 200 Irgunists. A hundred rifles for the battalion were provided by Givati, with 50–80 more provided by the General Staff. The brigade commander Avidan also created two new companies, one in the 54th Battalion, and one in the 55th, consisting of 80 persons each. These combined forces were tasked with the mission of capturing the Arab Yibna (May 31), although the attack never materialized because the battalion took off completely unprepared, lost its way, and returned to its starting position. Also on May 30, four light planes set out from Sde Dov Airport to bomb the area of Isdud, although only one Rapide pilot spotted his target. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> if any of the bombs actually exploded.|$|E
5|$|Schmitt {{arrived at}} dusk, {{and the action}} {{continued}} well after dark; in mid-November night falls at close to 17:00 in the upper Danube climes. Despite the darkness, Schmitt descended out of the defiles and deployed his troops to assail Dupont's flank. As his Russians entered the fray, they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians. With the additional force, the French were overwhelmed, {{but most of the}} shooting subsided when the combatants <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> apart friend from foe in the dark. Under the cover of darkness, aided by a waning moon, Mortier used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank. The French and Russians continued to skirmish fitfully into the night as sentries encountered one another in the dark. Portions of Gazan's force provided any necessary rear guard action, and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the Danube, while they maintained possession of only Spitz and Weissenkirchen on the north bank.|$|E
5|$|Only two Fortresses {{had left}} Bedek's storage {{facility}} {{by the time}} hostilities commenced on October 29, 1956. The squadron had not flown a single training sortie before fighting began and had only two full crews ready for battle. Israeli piston-engined aircraft flew few missions {{in the first two}} days of the war, but on October 31, 69 Squadron received an order to bomb Rafah in support of IDF Brigade 27 operations. Arriving over the target early on November 1, the aircraft <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> the location of friendly troops and without being able to communicate with the forces on the ground, were forced to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean. The B-17s were back in action the following night, to attack retreating Egyptian forces. A repeat of the previous night's lack of communications with Israeli forces operating in the same area once again prevented the strike, and the bombers dropped their loads on the outskirts of Gaza. With the threat of Egyptian air power curtailed by Anglo-French strikes against Egyptian air bases, the B-17s began flying daylight operations. On November 2 the squadron supported the Israeli push towards Sharm el Sheikh, on the southern tip of the Sinai. Two aircraft bombed the local barracks but were met with effective anti-aircraft fire which damaged the lead aircraft. The damaged aircraft managed to return to Ramat David, just as the third B-17 returned from storage at Bedek. Two aircraft were therefore available for the B-17s' final combat sorties with the IAF, another failed strike on Sharm el Sheikh on November 4.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the two books dealing with Gaia, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, Galaxia is {{conceived}} as a living organism which contains all the lifeforms and other non-living material in the galaxy. It is a utopia; the successor of Gaia. R. Daneel Olivaw founded Gaia with the purpose of Galaxia in mind, {{in order to be able}} to alter humanity for the better. However, since he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> whether this move would eventually hurt humanity, itself of almost unpredictable nature, and he therefore <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> whether the Zeroth Law permitted it, he could not by himself make the decision to implement Galaxia. Hari Seldon's Psychohistory Project was a 'backup' initiated by R. Daneel Olivaw in the event that Galaxia was not determined to be the ideal course of action.|$|E

25|$|The Department of Defense {{returned}} the dead men's bodies {{to their families}} in mid-June, after al-Utaybi's family openly questioned the claims he'd committed suicide and requested his body for a second autopsy. Utaybi's family reported that the Saudi post-mortem had found that the DOD had retained his brain, heart, liver and kidneys. Each of the families had second autopsies done, but these were inconclusive. In each case, the US had kept organs of the throat, so pathology teams <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> if the men had died by hanging or not.|$|E

25|$|Just as Daredevil's other senses are stronger, {{they are}} also sensitive; his main {{weakness}} is his vulnerability to powerful sounds or odors that can temporarily weaken his radar sense. This weakness {{is often used to}} immobilize Daredevil. Alternately, the lack of taste or smell of certain substances can be used against him, as in one instance of a hallucinogenic drug designed so that Daredevil <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> he was drugged. His senses are highly acute, capable of sensing the minor atmospheric disturbance created moments before a teleporting character appears.|$|E
25|$|An astrologer {{claimed that}} he was able to {{ascertain}} a person's astrological sign after talking with them for a few minutes. He was presented with twelve people, one at a time, each with a different astrological sign. They <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> the astrologer their astrological sign or birth date, nor could they wear anything that would indicate it. After the astrologer talked to them, he had them go and sit in front of the astrological sign that the astrologer thought was theirs. By agreement, the astrologer needed to get ten of the 12 correct, to win. He got none correct.|$|E
25|$|A Member of the Legislative Assembly from 1900 onwards, {{he served}} as Premier Lomer Gouin's Minister of Public Works from 1907 to 1919. Elected Premier in 1920, {{at a time when}} the North American economy began {{experiencing}} difficulties that ultimately led to the Great Depression, he opposed U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal social democratic policies, saying he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> if it was fascism or communism. Instead, he vigorously encouraged the development by private enterprise of the massive forests and the mineral resources of what had been the Ungava Region and Nunavik that the Parliament of Canada had added to the Province of Quebec.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Leland Chapman—a {{colleague}} of Fishbaugh—was {{called in to}} give a second opinion; he recognized {{that she was not}} suffering from an inflamed gallbladder, but was in the end stages of kidney failure. On June 6, Harlow said that she could not see Powell properly and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> how many fingers he was holding up. That evening, Harlow was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, where she slipped into a coma. The next day at 11:37am, Harlow died in the hospital at the age of 26. In the doctor's press releases, {{the cause of death was}} given as cerebral edema, a complication of kidney failure. Hospital records mention uremia.|$|E
25|$|The two {{wings of}} the army {{attempted}} to confuse and deceive the enemy about their destinations; the Confederates <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> from the initial movements whether Sherman would march on Macon, Augusta, or Savannah. Howard's wing, led by Kilpatrick's cavalry, marched south along the railroad to Lovejoy's Station, which caused the defenders there to conduct a fighting retreat to Macon. The cavalry captured two Confederate guns at Lovejoy's Station, and then two more and 50 prisoners at Bear Creek Station. Howard's infantry marched through Jonesboro to Gordon, southwest of the state capital, Milledgeville. Slocum's wing, accompanied by Sherman, moved to the east, {{in the direction of}} Augusta. They destroyed the bridge across the Oconee River and then turned south.|$|E
25|$|In American Dog Owners Ass'n v. City of Yakima, 777 P.2d 1046 (Wash.1989, en banc), the Washington Supreme Court {{reviewed}} a {{pit bull}} ban in Yakima, Washington. The dog owners asked a state court to prevent Yakima from enforcing its ban on pit bull dogs. The trial court issued a temporary injunction against the city and accepted motions for summary judgment from both the dog owners and the city. The court decided {{in favor of the}} city and lifted the injunction, whereupon the dog owners appealed to the Washington Supreme Court {{on the grounds that the}} ordinance was vague because a person of ordinary intelligence <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> what was prohibited, and that the trial court had improperly decided the summary judgment in favor of the city.|$|E

25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much more frightening if you <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> {{they were looking at}} you. Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there was}} 35 minutes for England to bat until stumps they survived with 10/0 as a stormcloud loomed over the ground. Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson were sending down three short balls an over and Umpire Bailhache {{told them they}} should bowl fuller, but the next ball was a Thommo bouncer and the umpire gave the English batsmen {{the benefit of the}} bad light. Ian Chappell complained about the umpire's {{interference}} as strictly speaking he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> the bowlers what to bowl and the ABC commentator Frank Tyson agreed. Brian Luckhurst edged Lillee (2/25) to Ian Chappell early the next morning leaving Dennis Amiss and John Edrich to bat, both of whom had broken bones in their hands from the first innings. Edrich took pain-killing injections in the drinks break, but was plainly out of sorts and was bowled by Thomson (6/46). Amiss received a brute of a ball from Thomson that he sent to Doug Walters at third slip. This brought Mike Denness and Keith Fletcher together at 40/3 and they resisted for an hour when the captain was taken by Walters off another Thommo thunderbolt, soon followed by Fletcher, caught by Greg Chappell off Terry Jenner (2/45) and Tony Greig bowled by Thomson yorker at 94/6. There was little hope of England lasting the day, but Alan Knott held out for two hours making 19, adding 29 with Peter Lever and 47 with the top-scorer Derek Underwood (30). When Underwood fell at 162/8, Knott and Hendrick soon followed and England were all out for 166 to lose by 166 runs, 84 minutes short of saving the game. Thomson took 6/46, which remained the best Test figures of his career.|$|E
