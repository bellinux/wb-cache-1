The different detection operators are compared and the sobel operator is used for edge detection. The actual space position of the hole on barrel is computed by circle detecting method. Gradient hough transform is used for detecting <b>circle</b> <b>position</b> information, including circle radius and two dimension coordinates. The stepping motor drive system is consists of a control card, stepping motor drive units and two two-phase hybrid stepping motors. Automatic positioning is achieved through stepping motor drive system...|$|E

In {{the family of the}} squeezed states, the quantum uncertainty in the Larmor <b>circle</b> <b>position</b> is minimal. The wave functions of the squeezed states in the coordinate representation are found and their properties are discussed. Also, for arbitrary gauge of the vector potential we derive the symmetry operators of translations and rotations.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig. 5 that there is a regular raster ripple (period 10  mm) {{consistent}} with the path spacing (10  mm) due to the effect of the convolution effect in the raster path simulation process, and the PSD curve produces a significant peak (shown in the red <b>circle</b> <b>position</b> in Fig. 6 (a)), whose frequency is 0.1  mm−[*] 1. This paper defines the frequency at a significant peak in the PSD curve as the characteristic frequency, whose amplitude is the PSD value of characteristic frequency (PSDc). Figure 6 (b) shows the residual ripples in the middle region (50  mm[*]×[*] 50  mm) of the residual error. In this paper, the root-mean-square of residual ripple in the 50  mm[*]×[*] 50  mm region is defined as the RMS value of residual ripple (RMSr). In the following orthogonal simulation and experiment, the PSDc and the RMSr are used to evaluate the effect of restraining the MSF errors.|$|E

40|$|International audienceEye {{features}} {{are one of}} the most important clues for many computer vision applications. In this paper, an efficient method to automatically extract eye features is presented. The extraction is highly based on the usage of the common knowledge about face and eye structure. With the assumption of frontal face images, firstly coarse eye regions are extracted by removing skin pixels in the upper part of the face. Then, iris <b>circle</b> <b>position</b> and radius are detected by using Hough transform in a coarse-to-fine fashion. In the final step, edges created by upper and lower eyelids are detected and polynomials are fitted to those edges so that their intersection points are labeled as eye corners. The algorithm is experimented on the Bosphorus database and the obtained results demonstrate that it can locate eye features very accurately. The strength of the proposed method stems from its reproducibility due to the utilization of simple and efficient image processing methods while achieving remarkable results without any need of training...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{validate}} {{the use of}} fluoroscopic roentgenographic stereophotogrammetric analysis (FRSA) for its feasibility and accuracy for measuring the three-dimensional dynamic motion of stent grafts. MethodsA digital biplane fluoroscopy setup was calibrated (Siemens Axiom Artis dBc). Stereo images were acquired of a static aortic model with a stent graft in different axial positions, imposed by a micromanipulator. The three-dimensional measurement error of FRSA was determined by comparing FRSA measurements with the micromanipulator. An aortic model with a stent graft was constructed and connected to an artificial circulation with a physiological flow and pressure profile. Markers {{were added to the}} spine (tantalum spherical markers; diameter 1 mm) and stent (welding tin; diameter 1 mm). The three-dimensional measurement precision was determined by measuring the position of a single (stable) spine marker during two pulsatile cycles. Finally, three-dimensional stent marker motion was analyzed with a frame rate of 30 images per second, including three-dimensional marker position (change), diameter change, and center of <b>circle</b> <b>position</b> change. ResultsThe mean error of FRSA measurement of displacement was 0. 003 mm (SD, 0. 019 mm; maximum error, 0. 058 mm). A very high precision of position measurement was found (SD, 0. 009 - 0. 015 mm). During pulsatile motion, the position (changes) of the markers could be assessed in the x, y, and z directions, as well as the stent diameter change and center of <b>circle</b> <b>position</b> change. ConclusionsFRSA {{has proven to be a}} method with very high accuracy and temporal resolution to measure three-dimensional stent-graft motion in a pulsatile environment. This technique has the potential to contribute significantly to the knowledge of stent-graft behavior after endovascular aneurysm repair and improvements in stent-graft design. The technique is ready for clinical testing. Clinical RelevanceUntil now, three-dimensional stent-graft motion due to the cardiac cycle could not be quantified in vivo. Fluoroscopic roentgenographic stereophotogrammetric analysis (FRSA) uses a new combination of two techniques: digital biplane fluoroscopy and roentgenographic stereo photogrammetric analysis. This in vitro study describes the validation and feasibility of FRSA. With FRSA it becomes possible to measure three-dimensional motion of stent-graft markers with a very high accuracy and precision. Using this technique, clinical studies can be performed to better understand stent-graft motion and the repetitive forces acting on the graft. Knowledge of three-dimensional motion can have a significant effect on stent-graft design and outcome...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: The Circle of Willis is {{the most}} {{important}} route for cerebral perfusion and for collateral blood flow in severe occlusive diseases of the internal carotid artery. The knowledge of ideal configuration is required while determining the adequacy of brain circulation in operations of cerebral aneurysms and ligation of carotid artery. The present study was undertaken to study the arteries forming the Circle of Willis and to note variations in configuration or branching pattern. Materials and methods: During routine dissection, 30 brains were removed from cadavers by a method according to standard procedure. The detailed study of the Circle of Willis with reference to the shape of the arterial <b>circle,</b> <b>position</b> and course of all the arteries, variations such as the presence, absence or hypoplasia of each arterial segment was carried out. Results: Out of 30 brain specimens, the Circle of Willis was complete in 80 % cases, incomplete in 20 %. Anomalies were more common in posterior part (43. 33 %) than in the anterior part (16. 66 %). Posterior part anomaly includes variations due to either absence or hypoplasia of one or more segment. The anterior part anomaly includes azygous anterior cerebral artery or median trunk formation, duplicity, fenestration. Conclusion: Knowledge of the Circle of Willis and its variations is essential in clinico-pathological conditions and in surgical interventions as {{it is one of the}} major collateral circulations ensuring the complete perfusion of the brain...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{contribute}} to the scientific understanding of the performance demands of One Day International (ODI) fielding and wicket-keeping, and to provide recommendations for improving athlete performance, assessment and coach education. Two comprehensive literature reviews of the physical, technical, physiological and tactical components of fielding and wicket-keeping were conducted. Given the gaps identified in the literature reviews, an online mixed method survey of cricket players, coaches and trainers was designed to investigate the performance requirements of the wicket-keeper, close, inner and outer circle fielders. Players and coaches rated agility the most important physical attribute for the wicket-keeper (4. 7 / 5), close fielders (4. 6 / 5), and inner circle fielders (4. 8 / 5). Speed (4. 8 / 5) and agility (4. 6 / 5) were rated most important for outer circle fielders. Coaches raised the issue of the lack of a cricket specific agility test. An emerging theme for all categories was the importance of the mental aspects of the game such as positive attitude and concentration, particularly for the wicket-keeper. To validate the use of video footage for performance analysis a comparison was made between televised and purposefully collected video for event coding. The variables of interest were derived from the literature reviews and corroborated by the survey. The ICC for intra-coder reliability for all but two variables was between 0. 88 and 1. 00 the exceptions were lateral footwork (step 0. 83 and shuffle 0. 55) likely due to the subjectivity of defining footwork patterns. The televised footage under-reported the frequency of wicket-keeping activity (≈ 4. 5 %), except for lateral footwork, which was under-reported by the purposefully collected video (≈ 13. 5 %) due to the movement being perpendicular to the camera view. Even though fielding activity was under-reported (≈ 4. 25) by televised footage, this footage was deemed to be most appropriate, as the collected footage resulted in a field of view that made the finer details of fielding difficult to distinguish. Performance analysis studies on fielding and wicket-keeping were carried out using televised footage from the 2011 ODI World Cup. The majority of the wicket-keepers movements were lateral (75 %); primarily repetitive low intensity movements interspersed with explosive movements such as diving and jumping. Wicket-keeping glove-work skills (69 %) were the most performed skill activity, the quality of which was quantified using a catching efficiency measure (93 %). Close, inner and outer circle fielders had variable involvement in fielding activities. Close fielders were involved in 20 % of the fielding activity, the bowler the most (58 %) involved. The inner circle fielders were involved in 50 % of fielding contacts; of whom cover was the position most involved (21 %) Inner circle fielders had to display the greatest range of skills within the field, such as catching from different heights, varied throwing and ground fielding techniques. Outer circle fielders were involved with 30 % of the fielding contacts; the outer <b>circle</b> <b>position</b> most involved was long on (14 %). Long sprints were the hallmark of outer circle fielding, following the sprint, they often had to perform explosive movements such as a dive or a jump to field the ball; they rarely had the opportunity to stop and position themselves to perform their skill. Additionally, catching (75 %, 89 %, 85 %) throwing (0 %, 12 %, 33 %) and overall fielding performance (89 %, 98 %, 99 %) were quantified using efficiency calculations for close, inner and outer circle fielders respectively. The findings of the literature reviews and studies expanded upon the only previous study to quantify fielding performance, and informed the development of performance profiles of fielding and wicket-keeping. Subsequently recommendations for assessment, training and coaching have been made, which will be integrated into New Zealand Cricket resources. Most notable are suggestions for improving the existing skill and physical testing batterie...|$|E
