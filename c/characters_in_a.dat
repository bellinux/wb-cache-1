5|$|Cinematographer Matthew Libatique enlisted his cousin, Eric Alba, {{and a team}} {{of graphic}} artists known as House of Pain to design the 30-second {{animated}} sequence. Lee asked for the sequence to show two black <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ghetto environment dressed in gangster attire. He also gave the artists mockups of two scenarios that ended in homicide—one being a robbery at an ATM, and the other a drive-by shooting.|$|E
5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game engine) and repurposes it to tell a story, but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E

5|$|A {{multiple}} sequence alignment (MSA) is {{a sequence}} alignment {{of three or}} more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. In many cases, the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a lineage and are descended from a common ancestor. From the resulting MSA, sequence homology can be inferred and phylogenetic analysis can be conducted to assess the sequences' shared evolutionary origins. Visual depictions of the alignment as in the image at right illustrate mutation events such as point mutations (single amino acid or nucleotide changes) that appear as differing <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single alignment column, and insertion or deletion mutations (indels or gaps) that appear as hyphens {{in one or more}} of the sequences in the alignment. Multiple sequence alignment is often used to assess sequence conservation of protein domains, tertiary and secondary structures, and even individual amino acids or nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|Although The Covent-Garden Tragedy {{appeared}} with The Old Debauchees, {{it was not}} a success like the other play and quickly dropped. The Covent Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its first night because, according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting. After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> brothel. Even though the first night fell apart, the play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with Don Quixote in England, once on its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} on Why Don't You?, Davies oversaw the {{production}} of a story that took place in Loch Ness. The story was the precursor for his first freelance children's project: Dark Season. The show, originally called The Adventuresome Three, would feature the Why Don't You? <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> purely dramatic setting that was influenced by his childhood. He submitted the script {{to the head of the}} BBC's Children's department, Anna Home, and Granada Television. Both companies were interested in producing the show with minor changes: Granada wished to produce it as one six-part serial, as opposed to Davies' plan of two three-part serials; and Home was interested in accepting the show on the condition it included a new cast of characters. He accepted Home's offer, and the show was allocated the budget and timeslot of Maid Marian and her Merry Men, which had been put on hiatus the year before.|$|E

5|$|Libby {{is still}} in the mental {{institution}} in the alternate timeline. One day she sees a Mr. Cluck's commercial with Hurley in it, and memories of her past life on the Island come flooding back to her. Later at a Mexican restaurant, Libby sees Hurley, and tells him she thinks they may be connected and be soul mates. Hurley later tracks her down, and she tells him of her visions and the fact in those visions Hurley was also in the mental institution. Hurley then invites her on a date. On the date they kiss and Hurley's memories of the Island come flooding back to him, and he assures Libby she isn't crazy. When the alternate time line is revealed to be a meeting place before the afterlife Libby reunites with many of the other <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> church. She sits beside Hurley as they move on together into the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessors, Super Smash Bros. Brawl {{includes}} various {{modes of}} play {{from the previous}} game designed for a single player. Classic mode, as the name implies, is a classical approach to the game, in which players fight individual <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> selected order. Each match features an arena or opponent from a particular series, such as The Legend of Zelda or Pokémon. Several matches have a unique battle condition, such as a metal opponent, large opponent or a two-on-two team battle. Similar to Classic mode are All Star mode and Boss Battles, where the player has only one life to defeat all of the playable characters and bosses, respectively.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Official Magazine - UK {{praised the}} story's {{blurring}} of Gallia's moral standing, art style, and most points about its gameplay, positively noting the latter for both its continued {{quality and the}} tweaks to balance and content. Its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes, something that had affected the previous games. Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non-linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games. He also positively noted the story's serious tone. Points criticized in the review were recycled elements, awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> scene for no good reason, pacing issues, and occasional problems with the game's AI.|$|E

5|$|The Matty Johns Show {{has also}} been {{compared}} to The Bounce, which was a show based on the Australian Football League (AFL) and targeted at those states in which AFL predominates. Johns plays a range of recurring Australian <b>characters,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> style that has drawn comparisons to comic Paul Hogan, star of The Paul Hogan Show. The variety elements of the show have inspired comparisons with Hey Hey It's Saturday. The set {{has been compared to}} that of Rove Live, a variety show formerly produced at Global Television.|$|E
5|$|The {{drama is}} based on Ovid's tale of the {{abduction}} of Proserpine by Pluto, which itself {{was based on the}} Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone. Mary Shelley's version focuses on the female <b>characters.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> largely feminist retelling from Ceres's point of view, Shelley emphasises the separation of mother and daughter and the strength offered by a community of women. Ceres represents life and love, and Pluto represents death and violence. The genres of the text also reflect gender debates of the time. Percy contributed in the lyric verse form traditionally dominated by men; Mary created a drama with elements common to early nineteenth-century women's writing: details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The major {{characters}} of Ra.One were played by protagonists Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor, and primary antagonist Arjun Rampal. Supporting roles were played by Tom Wu, Shahana Goswami and child artist Armaan Verma. The film featured cameo appearances by Rajinikanth playing the Enthiran character Chitti, Sanjay Dutt and Priyanka Chopra, {{the latter two}} being <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dream sequence. Additional minor roles were played by Dalip Tahil and Satish Shah, and an important voice-over was provided by Amitabh Bachchan. Khan performed both as Shekhar and G.One. The titular character Ra.One was enacted by three actors – Rampal, Wu and Kapoor, signifying the character's shape-shifting ability.|$|E

5|$|The {{participants}} in a LARP physically portray <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fictional setting, improvising their characters' speech and movements somewhat like actors in improvisational theatre. This is distinct from tabletop role-playing games, where character actions are described verbally. LARPs may be played in a public or private area and may last for hours or days. There is usually no audience. Players may dress as their character and carry appropriate equipment, and the environment is sometimes decorated to resemble the setting. LARPs can be one-off events or {{a series of events}} in the same setting, and events can vary in size from a handful of players to several thousand.|$|E
5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly {{programmatic}} in nature—in other words, the musical content {{and how it is}} handled in the piece is determined by the plot or <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} {{directed}} by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antúnez, and produced by César Markus González. Most of the filming occurred {{at the headquarters of}} Pol-ka in the Colegiales neighborhood. The telenovela took several risks in the creative and production fields, which were mostly successful. The choice of Martín Quesada's background as a Formula 1 driver required an area with a large infrastructure to represent realistic races. For realism, plot scenes set outside Buenos Aires were actually filmed outside the city. There was significant press coverage during the location shooting in Germany, which took place during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro played their characters in the Veltins-Arena stadium during the Argentina-Serbia and Montenegro match. The result of the matcha 6–0 Argentine victorybenefited the filming, and the episode received 31.5 rating points. Location shooting also occurred in the tourist ski resort Las Leñas in the Andes. A simulated aircraft crash that left the <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> jungle was filmed at the Pereyra Iraola park and an Argentine Air Force park in Morón.|$|E
