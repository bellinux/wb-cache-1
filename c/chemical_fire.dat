25|$|Condensed aerosol fire {{suppression}} is a particle-based form of fire extinction similar to gaseous {{fire suppression}} or dry <b>chemical</b> <b>fire</b> extinction. As with gaseous fire suppressants, condensed aerosol suppressants use clean agents {{to suppress the}} fire. The agent can be delivered by means of mechanical operation, electric operation, or combined electro-mechanical operation. To the difference of gaseous suppressants, which emit only gas, and dry chemical extinguishers, which release powder-like particles of a large size (25–150µm) condensed aerosols are defined by the National Fire Protection Association as releasing finely divided solid particles (generally <10nbsp&µm), usually in addition to gas.|$|E
25|$|The Al-Qaeda-funded Bojinka plot {{planned to}} kill John Paul II {{during a visit}} to the Philippines during World Youth Day 1995 celebrations. On 15 January 1995 a suicide bomber was {{planning}} to dress as a priest and detonate a bomb when the pope passed in his motorcade {{on his way to the}} San Carlos Seminary in Makati City. The assassination was supposed to divert attention from the next phase of the operation. However, a <b>chemical</b> <b>fire</b> inadvertently started by the cell alerted police to their whereabouts, and all were arrested a week before the pope's visit, and confessed to the plot.|$|E

A request was sent to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency and troops were dispatched from the Tokyo division. There was a danger of the fire spreading to an attached oxygen tank, but the troops from Tokyo managed to stop it from spreading to the tank, after a 20 h battle.|$|R

25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause the grease to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry <b>chemical</b> <b>fire</b> extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive diammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E
500|$|During 1893, {{the company}} {{considered}} adding a third tank, which would add another 60 pots of capacity. The expansion cost estimate was $150,000 (over $3.8 million in 2012 dollars), and {{was said to}} [...] "give employment to 350 men." [...] Two major concerns voiced by management to community leaders were adequate fire protection and housing for the workers. [...] Community leaders did not respond soon enough, and the expansion was postponed. [...] However, {{it is no coincidence}} that Hartford City's waterworks began operations in 1894, and the plant was built on the city's south side.

40|$|Fire {{is often}} {{considered}} {{as the most}} hazardous accidental event which may affect safety in the <b>chemical</b> industries. The <b>fire</b> damage may be thermal or non thermal. As examples, the fire plume may transport a variety of toxic effluents, which may injure {{the staff of the}} industrial premises and the fire fighters, as well as the inhabitants in the neighbourhood. Intense radiation produced by big fires may cause serious burn injuries and generate "domino effects" to previously non affected equipment in the vicinity and result in related phenomena such as jetfires, fireballs, BLEVEs 1. Moreover, polluted extinction waters while unconfined may greatly affect the aquatic environment.

2500|$|The Tenney Fire Hall, {{listed on}} the National Register of Historic Places, was a small wood-frame {{building}} with a bell tower and flag mast, built in 1904.

5000|$|Smoke burns are burns {{that tend}} to be caused {{as a result of}} flash fires, both in house fires and in small <b>chemical</b> <b>fires.</b> These can be made to be more severe by a large {{presence}} of atmospheric humidity. These burns tend to occur at a temperature of about 121 °C / 250 °F. The heat is almost instantaneous and it is just hot enough to singe or burn off the tips of stray hairs, but mostly damage is mild. The heat produced by the burning substance is rarely hot enough to burn the skin. Normally, in situations where smoke burns are possible, the heat and quantity of smoke needed are rarely produced.|$|R

40|$|This study investigates control {{methods and}} {{technologies}} {{used in the}} drycleaning industry for reducing occupational exposures to tetrachloroethylene(perchloroethylene-PERC). It also examines drycleaning machines that use petroleum-based solvents. It addresses methods for controlling exposures to spotting <b>chemicals,</b> <b>fire,</b> and ergonomic hazards in commercial drycleaning shops across the U. S. and through a World Health Organization fellowship in Europe. The study looks at the various categories of drycleaning equipment, full-shift exposures to PERC, the use of another cleaning media, local and general ventilation, inhalation of spotting chemicals, ergonomic hazards, workstation design, fire hazards and explosions. Information gathered through the study was supplemented by a literature review. The report provides a reference for anyone interested in protecting drycleaning workers from occupational hazards associated with this industry.
