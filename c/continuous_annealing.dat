This work deals with the study of deformation mechanisms during {{the process and the}} effect of lattice defects created during the process on the final magnetic properties of GOES. A heat transfer model of the <b>continuous</b> flattening <b>anneal</b> furnace was developed to calculate the temperature profile of the strip throughout the process. The heat transfer model showed the stability of peak strip temperature at 850 oC when the line speed was varied from 60 - 90 m/min. A deformation mechanism map was constructed for two varieties of GOES. The main implication of this model is the knowledge of the effect of process parameters like stress, temperature and strain rate on the formation of dislocation structure in GOES during <b>continuous</b> flattening <b>anneal</b> process. LAFFAS (Lab Annealing Furnace for Flattening Anneal Simulation) was constructed to simulate the <b>continuous</b> flattening <b>anneal</b> process and produce samples for dislocation study and magnetic testing. The high temperature mechanical behaviour of Conventional Grain Oriented+ ® (CGO+ - new GOES product) and its effect on magnetic properties were also analysed. Polygonization in GOES and the factors affecting polygonization were studied in detail. Initial orientation of the grains was determined to be a rate controlling factor for degree of polygonization along with temperature and annealing time. The degree of polygonization was shown to be an important parameter affecting the change in domain width. A localised decrease in specific total loss was observed at 1. 5 T and 50 Hz in grains where polygonization was complete. An increase in specific total loss of about 10 - 35...|$|R

It is concluded that <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> of the cells in space at 150 C can effectively reduce the proton radiation damage to the GaAs solar cells. Periodic annealing is most effective {{if it can be}} initiated at relatively low fluences (approximating <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing),</b> especially if low temperatures of less than 200 C are to be used. If annealing is started only after the fluence of the damaging protons has accumulated to a high value 10 to the 11 th power sq/pcm), effective annealing is still possible at relatively high temperatures. Finally, since electron radiation damage anneals even more easily than proton radiation damage, substantial improvements in GaAs solar cell life can be achieved by incorporating the proper annealing capabilities in solar panels for practical space missions where both electron and proton radiation damage have to be minimized...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of electron flux and temperature on radiation damage in GaAs solar cells. The defect levels and the power ratio of the GaAs solar cells under various irradiation conditions are compared. In a 200 C <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> experiment, the GaAs solar cells which were irradiated at a flux of 2 x 10 to the 9 th e/sq cm s suffered less power degradation than the cells which were irradiated at the same temperature at a higher flux of 4 x 10 to the 10 th e/sq cm s. After the <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> experiment, a single-step post annealing at 200 C was performed for 40 hr on these irradiated cells. An additional improvement in power recovery was observed only on those cells irradiated at the high flux of 4 x 10 to the 10 th e/sq cm s.
