50|$|Bilateral {{trade was}} highly popular within Finnish {{business}} circles, as it allowed {{the commission of}} very large orders, additionally with less stringent requirements for sophistication or quality, if compared to Western markets. The Soviet side was motivated to participate in clearing trade because the arrangement essentially provided cheap credit. The option was to sell obligations to the international market, and pay interest in hard currency. Capital, such as icebreakers, train carriages or consumer goods, could be obtained from Finland, and the cost would simply become <b>clearing</b> <b>account</b> deficit, eventually to be paid back as e.g. crude oil, or as orders such as nuclear power plants (Loviisa I and II).|$|E

If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IESO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant market rules. The IESO has identified the need to amend chapter 9, section 6. 11, to allow for use of the IESO Settlement <b>Clearing</b> <b>Account</b> in the collection of the ’Smart Metering Administration Charge ’ (SMAC) by the IESO from local distribution companies (LDCs). BACKGROUND The Smart Metering Initiative (SMI) is the Government of Ontario’s initiative to create a conservation culture and a toolset for demand management based upon the province-wide deployment of smart meters. The smart meter will record electricity use for each hour and apply time-of-use pricing for Ontario consumers. This will, in effect, allow the consumer to manage their electricity use and take advantage of lower pricing periods. The IESO entered into an agreement in July 2006 with the Ministry of Energy to support the SMI and was recently designated as the Smart Metering Entity (SME) by regulation under the Electricity Act, 1998 1. As the SME, the IESO is responsible for the administration and operation of the mete...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model {{based on the}} theory of {{incomplete}} contracts for how ownership structure of interorganizational systems (IOS) can affect information exploitation and information technology adoption. Our model yields several propositions that suggest the appropriate strategic actions that a firm may take when there is potential for IOS adopters to question whether adopting the IOS will be value-maximizing. We analyze and illustrate the related strategic thinking in a real-world context involving a financial risk management IOS. We present {{a case study of}} the ownership and spin-off of RiskMetrics, developed by New York City [...] based investment bank, J. P. Morgan, in the late 1980 s. The firm first gave RiskMetrics to its correspondent banking, treasury, and investment clients for free, in the context of its <b>clearing</b> <b>account</b> relationship services. Later, the bank spun off the product to an independent company that offered fee-based services. We model the bank 2 ̆ 7 s clients in terms of their heterogeneous portfolio risks, and their effects on the value a client can gain from adopting the technology. We also examine the value they may lose if their private portfolio risk information is exploited. A key roadblock to the adoption of the free service may have been the potential for strategic information exploitation by the service provider. When Morgan spun off RiskMetrics with multiparty ownership, wider adoption occurred. Our theory interprets this strategic move as an appropriate means to maximize long-term profits when information exploitation may occur...|$|E
40|$|The Brazilian Amazon {{is one of}} {{the most}} rapidly {{developing}} agricultural areas in the world and represents a potentially large future source of greenhouse gases from land clearing and subsequent agricultural management. In an integrated approach, we estimate the greenhouse gas dynamics of natural ecosystems and agricultural ecosystems after clearing in the context of a future climate. We examine scenarios of deforestation and postclearing land use to estimate the future (2006 – 2050) impacts on carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from the agricultural frontier state of Mato Grosso, using a process-based biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystems Model (TEM). We estimate a net emission of greenhouse gases from Mato Grosso, ranging from 2. 8 to 15. 9 Pg CO 2 -equivalents (CO 2 -e) from 2006 to 2050. Deforestation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions over this period, but land uses following <b>clearing</b> <b>account</b> for a substantial portion (24 – 49 %) of the net greenhouse gas budget. Due to land-cover and land-use change, there is a small foregone carbon sequestration of 0. 2 – 0. 4 Pg CO 2 -e by natural forests and cerrado between 2006 and 2050. Both deforestation and future land-use management play important roles in the net greenhouse gas emissions of this frontier, suggesting that both should be considered in emissions policies. We find that avoided deforestation remains the best strategy for minimizing future greenhouse gas emissions from Mato Grosso...|$|E
