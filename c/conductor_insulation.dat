50|$|Small {{dry-type}} and liquid-immersed transformers {{are often}} self-cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these. Large transformers {{are filled with}} transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings. Transformer oil is a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that {{the average age of}} failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures. Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure. With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information. This underlines the need to monitor, model, forecast and manage oil and winding <b>conductor</b> <b>insulation</b> temperature conditions under varying, possibly difficult, power loading conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Subsea {{power cables}} are a {{critical}} component of a voltage-source converter–high-voltage direct current (VSC–HVDC) transmission system in any offshore electrical power scheme. Subsea cables have complicated structures con-sisting of many different layers: <b>conductor,</b> <b>insulation,</b> sheath, and armor. Harmonic performance of the system depends upon the interactions between the subsea cable, the power converters, and other system components, such as smoothing capacitors. In this paper, a mathematical model of an HVDC-VSC transmission system is developed and its harmonic performance is investigated for steady-state operating conditions. The results suggest that the design of the subsea transmission cable has important effects on harmonic levels in the voltage and current waveforms in the cable and upon power loss within the transmission system. This paper demonstrates that it is always important to consider interactions between all of the system components when predicting harmonic performance in a VSC-HVDC transmission system.

In a switchyard, live tank current transformers have {{a substantial part of}} their enclosure energized at the line voltage and must be mounted on insulators. Dead tank current transformers isolate the measured circuit from the enclosure. Live tank CTs are useful because the primary conductor is short, which gives better stability and a higher short-circuit current rating.

40|$|Cable {{manufacturing}} in {{a developing country}} like Nigeria today is faced {{with a number of}} problems that affect the quality of cables produced from extrusion to insulation of conductors. The main cause of the problems is the low and variable output rate from extruder causing non-uniform conductor diameter which results in insulation surface appearance defects. These defects manifest in form of pimples, dimples, cracking, air cavity, voids and porosity within the plastics which are insulation. The <b>conductor</b> <b>insulation</b> normally used is the Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which is normally sourced locally or imported. The locally produced PVC is cheaper in cost than the imported one but at the expense of quality due to inconsistency in the percentage combination of plasticizers, fillers, stabilizers, lubricants, and other additives required for producing quality PVC resin for cable applications. If the local manufacturers of PVC are not patronized, it will lead to employees losing their jobs and most likely their family income with other attending societal ills.

Losses in the spark It is surprising {{how difficult it is}} to calculate these various losses. Making meaningful measurements can also be challenging. If we operate at low input voltage so we are below spark breakout, then we can ignore the last term for the moment. I will ramble through some considerations for the other losses. 1 Temperature Effects Almost all coils are wound with copper wire. It is moderately priced and widely available. There might be an occasional aluminum coil, usually from some ‘bargain ’ at a surplus auction. Aluminum has higher resistivity than copper, so to get a given resistance the wire must be physically larger. We saw earlier that to get a high toroid voltage we needed a coil with large L and/or small R. If we use larger wire to keep the resistance the same, the coil must be physically larger and the inductance will decrease. We would expect therefore that aluminum coils would always be inferior to copper coils. Example You are given a choice between two spools of magnet wire, each 1000 feet in length. The copper is 24 gauge, with nominal resistance 25. 67 Ω, while the aluminum is 22 gauge, with nominal resistance 26. 46 Ω. You have a piece of 5 inch diameter PVC pipe and are considering using the entire 1000 ft to wind a coil. You wish to compare the inductances of the two prospective coils. You assume a build (thickness of dielectric) of 1. 65 mils. The diameter of the 22 gauge wire is then 23. 35 + 2 (1. 65) = 28. 65 mils and the diameter of the 24 gauge wire is 20. 1 + 2 (1. 65) = 23. 4 mils. The nominal number of turns would be N...|$|E
