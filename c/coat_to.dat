5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying for the prosecution, {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown {{up their hands}} and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his <b>coat</b> <b>to</b> {{show that he was}} not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{immediate}} {{impact on the}} pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar. The Boar's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the <b>coat</b> <b>to</b> reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.|$|E

Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman that is secretly in love with Jack, feels that their efforts will end in disaster, but Jack dismisses her and assigns her the task of sewing him a red <b>coat</b> <b>to</b> wear. He also tasks Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous trick-or-treating children, to abduct Santa Claus and {{bring him back to}} Halloween Town. Jack tells Santa he will be bringing Christmas to the world in his place this year. Jack orders the trio to keep Santa safe, but the children instead deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict bogeyman, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Sally attempts to rescue Santa so he can stop Jack, but Oogie captures her as well.|$|E

5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer {{than that of the}} Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's <b>coat</b> <b>to</b> appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} his appearance for Soulcalibur, different designs were considered, including {{one with a}} heavily bandaged eye and scarred appearance intended to imply his fate {{at the end of}} Soul Edge, and another modeled after his appearance in Soul Edges opening sequence, featuring a wide-brimmed hat, though both designs were rejected as the developers felt they made the character appear too thin. Elements from both were reused for Soulcalibur III, retaining the hat while giving his left eye a damaged appearance. Elements of his previous design were retained, {{with the addition of a}} green vest and bracers, and the lengthening of the tail of his <b>coat</b> <b>to</b> his mid-thighs. His alternate character model from Soul Edge was added as his alternate in the game, featuring minimal changes save for opening the vest to have his chest be bare.|$|E
5|$|Later {{she goes}} on a night out to The Loft nightclub and threatens Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki). She says that she will kill Lau if she ever goes near Jake again, making viewers realise that Loretta had changed her {{personality}} and her behaviour since her absence. Loretta pretends she had Leukaemia but Jake finds out the truth and ends their relationship. She later convinces Steph that Jake lied when he told Steph that Loretta had said she was ill and she makes Frankie and Steph believe Jake is losing his mind again. She send messages from Jake's mobile phone and plants defaced pictures of her and Jake in his <b>coat</b> <b>to</b> make it look real. Loretta reveals to Steph that she was sexually abused as a child. Jake gets back together with Loretta to stop her from getting him put back into a mental health clinic. Nancy finds out the truth about Loretta from Adam, she confronts Loretta who pushes her over and Nancy is badly hurt. Jake saves Nancy and she agrees {{not to go to}} the police. Loretta reveals she did not lie when she was sexually abused and Jake asks her to get help and will stand by her. Loretta is last seen admitting herself into the hospital.|$|E

But Master Gracey favored Mr. Davis' work more than Mr. Coats' work, causing Mr. <b>Coats</b> <b>to</b> lead Mr. Davis astray in the mansion then trapping him tightly in a casket.

25|$|Like all fish, {{goldfish}} do {{not like}} to be petted. In fact, touching a goldfish can endanger its health, because it can cause the protective slime <b>coat</b> <b>to</b> be damaged or removed, exposing the fish’s skin to infection from bacteria or water-born parasites. However, goldfish respond to people by surfacing at feeding time, and can be trained or acclimated to taking pellets or flakes from human fingers. The reputation of goldfish dying quickly is often due to poor care. The lifespan of goldfish in captivity can extend beyond 10 years.|$|E

The occupants betrayed him by calling the Germans, but when Bryks heard their motorised patrol coming he fled the house and hid in a garden. The patrol caught him, beat him up and took him to St Omer.|$|E
25|$|Merozoites use the apicomplexan {{invasion}} organelles (apical complex, pellicle {{and surface}} <b>coat)</b> <b>to</b> recognize {{and enter the}} host erythrocyte (red blood cell). The parasite first binds to the erythrocyte in a random orientation. It then reorients such that the apical complex is in proximity to the erythrocyte membrane. The parasite forms a parasitophorous vesicle, to allow for its development inside the erythrocyte. This infection cycle occurs in a highly synchronous fashion, with roughly all of the parasites throughout the blood in the same stage of development. This precise clocking mechanism {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the human host's own circadian rhythm.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} the seed <b>coat</b> <b>to</b> split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, {{splitting}} the seed coat. However, {{the nature of the}} seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate germination. The rate of imbibition is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.|$|E
