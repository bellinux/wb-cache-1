40|$|Three {{different}} sprue {{designs were}} investigated visually and radiographically {{to determine the}} influence of spruing arrangement on the soundness of RPD castings. The first sprue design was a tree sprue design consisted of four wax formers, 3 mm in diameter each, going directly to four different spots on the major connector. The second sprue design was a circular sprue design. The <b>circular</b> <b>feeder</b> was made from a 3 mm diameter wax. The auxiliary sprues emanating from the <b>circular</b> <b>feeder</b> were six in number, 2 mm in diameter each, and were attached directly to the major connector. The <b>circular</b> <b>feeder</b> was attached to the sprue button by four formers, 3 mm in diameter each. The third sprue design was designated as the bali sprue design. The ball design consisted of four feeders, 3 mm in diameter each, as with the tree design except that a 5 mm ball reservoir was placed on each feeder, 5 mm away from the wax pattern. Five frameworks of the same dental cast were prepared using each sprue design. The results showed that the three sprue designs used in this study are suitabie for producing sound RPD frame castings. When the circular sprue design is used, allowances should be made to assure adequate meshwork thickness. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} {{designed}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of different feeding systems {{on the behavior of}} local Rohilkhandi kids. Materials and Methods: A total of 21 growing goats (local goat of Rohilkhand region), weighing around 7 - 11 kg and aging 4 - 5 months, were used. These animals were kept in three groups. Group I was fed un-chopped green fodder in <b>circular</b> <b>feeder</b> (newly designed). Group II was fed un-chopped green fodder in linear feeder that was similar to the existing farm practice. Group III was fed chopped green fodder in linear feeder (modified version). Amount of concentrate and dry fodder fed was kept constant for all the three groups subject to equal increment in accordance with their increasing age. Adlibitum green fodder was made available to the animals. The experiment was conducted for 3 months. On-going behavior was recorded each day 4 h (2 h in the morning from 9 : 00 am to 11 : 00 am, after offering the feed, and same was repeated for 2 h in the afternoon, i. e., from 2 : 00 pm to 4 : 00 pm) was made between 9 am and 5 pm. The individual behaviors, viz., feeding, drinking, lying down, ruminating, idling, butting, pressing, pushing, frontal clashing, and physical displacement at feed barrier (active and passive: Without physical contact) of the goat were recorded using time-sampling method. Further, incidental activities such as defecation and urination were also recorded. Results: Among all the groups, butting, head to head, and pushing were the common agonistic behavior found but values did not differ significantly. The pushing while feeding was relatively less in Group II (0. 22 ± 0. 04 min) which differed significantly (p< 0. 05) from the other two groups. The idling time was found significantly (p< 0. 05) lower in Group II (1. 68 ± 0. 21) as compared to Group I (4. 67 ± 0. 52) and Group III (4. 27 ± 0. 56). Time spent in rumination near the feeding trough as well as away from the feeding trough was also significantly higher in Group I (p< 0. 05) than the other two groups. Other minor activities, viz., defecation and urination were negligible. No stereotypic activities were observed. Conclusion: It was concluded that provision of un-chopped fodder in <b>circular</b> <b>feeder</b> could only simulate natural feeding behavior of goat but did not give any added advantage. Further, feeding chopped fodder in linear feeding trough lead to increased consumption and more time is spent on feeding than on agonistic behavior as compared to the other two groups...|$|E
50|$|In the Knightfall story arc (1993-1994), the {{character}} Jean-Paul Valley redesigned the Batsuit {{during his tenure}} as Batman. Rather than appearing as a new costume, Jean-Paul developed it over time. Valley created an armored suit that contained more gadgets, including a shuriken launcher, flamethrower and other, more lethal weapons. This version of the suit did away with the traditional cape and cowl. It featured armored and bladed wings and was highly bulletproof, capable of sustaining direct machine gun barrages as well as enduring the explosions from grenades and high intensity fire. The suit also featured an underwater rebreather. A <b>circular</b> ammo <b>feeder</b> affixed {{to the back of}} the suit provided Valley with continuous bat-shaped shuriken. It was then made to be more high tech, with the eyes appearing more as goggles, different color scheme, and more armor. After being caught in an explosion during his fight with the former Batman at the time, Bruce Wayne, the main color scheme turns into orange-and-yellow. While the suit bears immense power, it also slows its user's speed and limits movement capacity.|$|R
