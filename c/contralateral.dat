5|$|Stage 2A: Unilateral tumor with {{incomplete}} gross resection; identifiable ipsilateral and <b>contralateral</b> {{lymph node}} negative for tumor.|$|E
5|$|Stage 2B: Unilateral tumor with {{complete}} or incomplete gross resection; with ipsilateral lymph node positive for tumor; identifiable <b>contralateral</b> lymph node negative for tumor.|$|E
5|$|Stage 3: Tumor infiltrating across midline with {{or without}} {{regional}} lymph node involvement; or unilateral tumor with <b>contralateral</b> lymph node involvement; or midline tumor with bilateral lymph node involvement.|$|E
5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus {{near the bottom of}} the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the <b>contralateral</b> input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Compression of the {{ipsilateral}} posterior {{cerebral artery}} will result in ischemia of the ipsilateral primary visual cortex and <b>contralateral</b> visual field deficits in both eyes (<b>contralateral</b> homonymous hemianopsia).|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{finding is}} a false localizing sign, the so-called Kernohan's notch, which results from compression of the <b>contralateral</b> cerebral crus containing descending corticospinal and some corticobulbar tract fibers. This leads to Ipsilateral hemiparesis {{in reference to the}} herniation and <b>contralateral</b> hemiparesis with reference to the cerebral crus.|$|E
25|$|With a <b>contralateral</b> (opposite side) {{autogenous}} patellar tendon graft, the graft {{includes the}} middle {{section of the}} patellar tendon along with two attached bone plugs one on each end. The <b>contralateral</b> autogenous patellar tendon graft is rarely used as primary revision due to the concern of donor site morbidity. Instead it is primarily considered when a patient is opposed to using an allograft but has already undergone an ACL revision using the ipsilateral patellar tendon. In addition, there are many health care settings around the nation where readily available, safe, and cost effective allograft tissues are not obtainable. In this situation the <b>contralateral</b> autogenous Patellar tendon graft {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
25|$|Hemispatial neglect, {{also called}} hemiagnosia, hemineglect, {{unilateral}} neglect, spatial neglect, <b>contralateral</b> neglect, unilateral visual inattention, hemi-inattention, neglect syndrome or <b>contralateral</b> hemispatialagnosia, is a neuropsychological condition in which, after damage to one hemisphere {{of the brain}} is sustained, a deficit in attention to and awareness of {{one side of the}} field of vision is observed. It is defined by the inability of a person to process and perceive stimuli {{on one side of the}} body or environment, where that inability is not due to a lack of sensation. Hemispatial neglect is very commonly <b>contralateral</b> to the damaged hemisphere, but instances of ipsilesional neglect (on the same side as the lesion) have been reported.|$|E
25|$|Five {{percent of}} <b>contralateral</b> testes in {{men with a}} history of prior {{testicular}} germ cell tumour.|$|E
25|$|The lateral lemniscus {{is located}} where the {{cochlear}} nuclei and the pontine reticular formation (PRF) crossover. The PRF descends the reticulospinal tract where it innervates motor neurons and spinal interneurons. It {{is the main}} auditory tract in the brainstem that connects the superior olivary complex (SOC) with the inferior colliculus (IC). The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) has input from the LL and output to the <b>contralateral</b> LL via the ipsilateral and <b>contralateral</b> Dorsal Acoustic Stria.|$|E
25|$|In all cases, {{the facial}} pit is innervated by the trigeminal nerve. In crotalines, {{information}} from the pit organ is relayed to the nucleus reticularus caloris in the medulla via the lateral descending trigeminal tract. From there, it is relayed to the <b>contralateral</b> optic tectum. In boas and pythons, {{information from the}} labial pit is sent directly to the <b>contralateral</b> optic tectum via the lateral descending trigeminal tract, bypassing the nucleus reticularus caloris.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} due to focal seizures differ {{depending on}} {{the region of the}} brain where the seizure occurs. For example, visual hallucinations during occipital lobe seizures are typically visions of brightly colored, geometric shapes that may move across the visual field, multiply, or form concentric rings and generally persist from a few seconds to a few minutes. They are usually unilateral and localized to one part of the visual field on the <b>contralateral</b> side of the seizure focus, typically the temporal field. However, unilateral visions moving horizontally across the visual field begin on the <b>contralateral</b> side and move toward the ipsilateral side.|$|E
25|$|Sound in the <b>contralateral</b> ear {{leads to}} the strongest {{responses}} in the VNLL, which deals with some temporary processing. The VNLL may also be essential to the IC’s decoding of amplitude modulated sounds.|$|E
25|$|From the {{principal}} nucleus, secondary fibers cross the midline and ascend in the ventral trigeminothalamic tract to the <b>contralateral</b> thalamus. The ventral trigeminothalamic tract runs {{parallel to the}} medial lemniscus, which carries touch-position information {{from the rest of}} the body to the thalamus.|$|E
25|$|Using an elevator, {{the flap}} is {{dissected}} in a sub-mucoperichondrial plane. The (far) distal {{edge of the}} flap is cut with a right-angle Beaver blade, and then is transposed into the wound. The exposed cartilages will reepithelialise (regenerate the epithelium), provided the opposite (<b>contralateral)</b> side of the septal mucosa is undisturbed.|$|E
25|$|The lateral lemniscus is a {{tract of}} axons in the {{brainstem}} that carries information about {{sound from the}} cochlear nucleus to various brainstem nuclei and ultimately the <b>contralateral</b> inferior colliculus of the midbrain. Three distinct, primarily inhibitory, cellular groups are located interspersed within these fibers, and are thus named the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus.|$|E
25|$|The orbital implant is {{inserted}} {{at the time}} of enucleation. An appropriately sized implant should replace the volume of the globe and leave sufficient room for the ocular prosthesis. Enucleation implants are available in a variety of sizes that may be determined by using sizing implants or calculated by measuring globe volume or axial length of the <b>contralateral</b> eye.|$|E
25|$|The spinal trigeminal nucleus {{contains}} a pain-temperature sensory {{map of the}} face and mouth. From the spinal trigeminal nucleus, secondary fibers cross the midline and ascend in the trigeminothalamic (quintothalamic) tract to the <b>contralateral</b> thalamus. Pain-temperature fibers are sent to multiple thalamic nuclei. The central processing of pain-temperature information differs from the processing of touch-position information.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{representation}} {{is the way}} space is represented in the brain. In this theory {{it is believed that}} the underlying cause of neglect is the inability to form <b>contralateral</b> representations of space. In this theory neglect patients demonstrate a failure to describe the contralesional side of a familiar scene, from a given point, from memory.|$|E
25|$|File:Center of {{rotation}} of hip prosthesis.jpg|Center {{of rotation}}: The horizontal center of rotation is calculated as {{the distance between}} the acetabular teardrop and the center of the head (or caput) of the prosthesis and/or the native femoral head on the <b>contralateral</b> side. The vertical center of rotation instead uses the transischial line for reference. The parameter should be equal on both sides.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{information}} is {{then sent to}} the brain from retinal ganglion cells via the optic nerve to the optic chiasma: {{a point where the}} two optic nerves meet and information from the temporal (<b>contralateral)</b> visual field crosses {{to the other side of}} the brain. After the optic chiasma the visual tracts are referred to as the optic tracts, which enter the thalamus to synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} neurons in each pathway decussate (cross {{the spinal}} cord or brainstem), because {{the spinal cord}} develops in segments. Decussated fibers later reach and connect these segments with the higher centers. The optic chiasm is {{the primary cause of}} decussation; nasal fibers of the optic nerve cross (so each cerebral hemisphere receives contralateral—opposite—vision) to keep the interneuronal connections responsible for processing information short. All sensory and motor pathways converge and diverge to the <b>contralateral</b> hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen is {{currently}} {{used for the}} treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (ER+) breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women. Additionally, it is the most common hormone treatment for male breast cancer. It is also approved by the FDA for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. It has been further approved for the reduction of <b>contralateral</b> (in the opposite breast) cancer. The use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years.|$|E
25|$|There is {{disagreement}} in surgical textbooks regarding {{which side}} of the recipient’s pelvis to use in receiving the transplant. Campbell's Urology (2002) recommends placing the donor kidney in the recipient’s <b>contralateral</b> side (i.e. a left sided kidney would be transplanted in the recipient's right side) to ensure the renal pelvis and ureter are anterior in the event that future surgeries are required. In an instance where there is doubt over whether there is enough space in the recipient’s pelvis for the donor's kidney, the textbook recommends using the right side because the right side has a wider choice of arteries and veins for reconstruction. Smith's Urology (2004) states that either side of the recipient's pelvis is acceptable; however the right vessels are 'more horizontal' with respect to each other and therefore easier to use in the anastomoses. It is unclear what is meant by the words 'more horizontal'. Glen's Urological Surgery (2004) recommends putting the kidney in the <b>contralateral</b> side in all circumstances. No reason is explicitly put forth; however, one can assume the rationale {{is similar to that of}} Campbell, i.e. to ensure that the renal pelvis and ureter are most anterior in the event that future surgical correction becomes necessary.|$|E
25|$|Ptosis, chemosis, {{cranial nerve}} palsies (III, IV, V, VI). Sixth nerve palsy {{is the most}} common. Sensory deficits of the {{ophthalmic}} and maxillary branch of the fifth nerve are common. Periorbital sensory loss and impaired corneal reflex may be noted. Papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, and decreased visual acuity and blindness may occur from venous congestion within the retina. Fever, tachycardia and sepsis may be present. Headache with nuchal rigidity may occur. Pupil may be dilated and sluggishly reactive. Infection can spread to <b>contralateral</b> cavernous sinus within 24–48 hours of initial presentation.|$|E
25|$|In rat, the DNLL has a {{prominent}} columnar organization. Nearly all neurons are stained for GABA, {{especially in the}} central part of the nucleus, and the remaining GABA negative cells are interspersed with the positive, and often stain for glycine. Two populations of GABA+ cells are visible: larger, lightly stained cells that project to the <b>contralateral</b> IC, and smaller, darker stained cells that project ipsilaterally. GABAergic axon terminals form dense groups surrounded by GABA-lemniscal fibers throughout the nucleus, and synapse on both somata and in the neuropil. Glycinergic axon terminals, on the other hand, are more finely localized, with the majority of recipient neurons located laterally in the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} of xerostomia at one year increases by 5% for every 1Gy increase in dose to the parotid gland. Doses above 25–30Gy {{are associated with}} moderate to severe xerostomia. Similar considerations apply to the submandibular gland, but xerostomia is less common if only one parotid gland {{is included in the}} radiated field and the <b>contralateral</b> submandibular gland is spared (less than 39Gy) In the same manner, radiation dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, larynx, and cricopharyngeal inlet determine the risk of dysphagia (and hence dependence on gastrostomy tube feeds). The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended dose to the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy. Dose-toxicity relationships for the superior and middle constrictors are steep, with a 20% increase in the {{probability of}} dysphagia for each 10Gy. Doses above 30Gy to the thyroid are associated with moderate to severe hypothyroidism. Subjective, patient-reported outcomes of quality of life also correlate with radiation dose received.|$|E
25|$|Birds do not {{necessarily}} exhibit sleep debt, but a peculiarity that birds share with aquatic mammals, and possibly also with certain species of lizards (opinions differ about that last point), is the ability for unihemispheric sleep. That {{is the ability to}} sleep with one cerebral hemisphere at a time, while the other hemisphere is awake (Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep). When only one hemisphere is sleeping, only the <b>contralateral</b> eye will be shut; that is, when the right hemisphere is asleep the left eye will be shut, and vice versa. The distribution of sleep between the two hemispheres and the amount of unihemispheric sleep are determined both by which part of the brain has been the most active during the previous period of wake—that part will sleep the deepest—and it is also determined by the risk of attacks from predators. Ducks near the perimeter of the flock are likely to be the ones that first will detect predator attacks. These ducks have significantly more unihemispheric sleep than those who sleep {{in the middle of the}} flock, and they react to threatening stimuli seen by the open eye.|$|E
25|$|Some {{advantages}} of the graft include less trauma to the leg that has undergone the ACL revision. Patients regain their range of motion and leg strength on the newly repaired ACL leg much quicker. The graft also allows for a bone-to-bone fixation which allows for more aggressive rehabilitation. The patient also eliminates the chance of any potential complications such as disease transmission that would be present if an allograph was chosen. The dis{{advantages of}} the graft include infection at this site, anterior knee pain, quadriceps muscle weakness, loss of motion, patella fracture, patellofemoral crepitus, patellar tendonitis, and patellofemoral joint pain. Also, {{it is not uncommon}} in certain patient populations to rupture the <b>contralateral</b> ACL following return to their sport. By harvesting the patellar tendon from the opposite knee, the orthopedic surgeon no longer has the option of using that patellar tendon for the reconstruction. It has been noted that a low percentage of patients have suffered a patellar tendon rupture in the first few weeks after surgery due to the increased stress to the area. In addition to a longer operating time the patient will have two scars instead of one.|$|E
500|$|One-sided {{weakness}} of the trapezius may indicate injury to the nerve {{on the same side}} of an injury to the spinal accessory nerve on the same side (...) of the body being assessed. Weakness in head-turning suggests injury to the <b>contralateral</b> spinal accessory nerve: a weak leftward turn is indicative of a weak right sternocleidomastoid muscle (and thus right spinal accessory nerve injury), while a weak rightward turn is indicative of a weak left sternocleidomastoid muscle (and thus left spinal accessory nerve).|$|E
500|$|Brown-Séquard {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} the spinal cord is injured on one side {{much more than the}} other. It is rare for the spinal cord to be truly hemisected (severed on one side), but partial lesions due to penetrating wounds (such as gunshot or knife wounds) or fractured vertebrae or tumors are [...] common. On the ipsilateral side of the injury (same side), the body loses motor function, proprioception, and senses of vibration and touch. On the <b>contralateral</b> (opposite side) of the injury, there is a loss of pain and temperature sensations.|$|E
500|$|Cranial nerves have paths {{within and}} outside of the skull. [...] The paths within the skull are called [...] "intracranial" [...] and the paths outside the skull are called [...] "extracranial". [...] There are many holes in the skull called [...] "foramina" [...] by which the nerves can exit the skull. All cranial nerves are paired, which means that they occur on both the right and left sides of the body. The muscle, skin, or {{additional}} function supplied by a nerve {{on the same side of}} the body as the side it originates from, is referred to an ipsilateral function. If the function is on the opposite side to the origin of the nerve, this is known as a <b>contralateral</b> function.|$|E
500|$|Purkinje cells {{also receive}} {{input from the}} {{inferior}} olivary nucleus on the <b>contralateral</b> side of the brainstem via climbing fibers. Although the inferior olive lies in the medulla oblongata and receives input from the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral cortex, its output goes entirely to the cerebellum. A climbing fiber gives off collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei before entering the cerebellar cortex, where it splits into about 10 terminal branches, each of which gives input to a single Purkinje cell. In striking contrast to the 100,000-plus inputs from parallel fibers, each Purkinje cell receives input from exactly one climbing fiber; but this single fiber [...] "climbs" [...] the dendrites of the Purkinje cell, winding around them and making a total of up to 300 synapses as it goes. The net input {{is so strong that}} a single action potential from a climbing fiber is capable of producing an extended complex spike in the Purkinje cell: a burst of several spikes in a row, with diminishing amplitude, followed by a pause during which activity is suppressed. The climbing fiber synapses cover the cell body and proximal dendrites; this zone is devoid of parallel fiber inputs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Contralateral</b> (...) : on {{the side}} {{opposite}} to another structure. For example, the right arm and leg are represented by the left, i.e., <b>contralateral</b> side of the forebrain.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007-2009 279 {{patients}} underwent primary ACL reconstruction surgery {{with the}} use of the <b>contralateral</b> autogenous patellar tendon graft while 58 control patients had the same surgery but with an ipsilateral patellar tendon. [...] When it came comparing the quadriceps muscles to the pre-operative baseline test those who used the <b>contralateral</b> patellar tendon graft had significantly more strength in the ACL reconstruction leg and this held true in the 2 year follow up measurements as well. The study concluded that the use of the <b>contralateral</b> patellar tendon graft does not leave the patient with unresolved donor-site strength loss.|$|E
