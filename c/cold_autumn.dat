25|$|Winemaking in the Loire is characterised by {{a general}} {{avoidance}} of barrel ageing and malolactic fermentation. However some winemakers have begun experimenting with both. Chaptalization is permitted here {{and can help}} wine makers compensate for the under ripeness of the grapes in some years. For red wines there has been more emphasis on extending the maceration time of skin contact {{in order to bring}} out more color and tannins into the wine. Temperature control is also an important consideration with the <b>cold</b> <b>autumn</b> weather sometimes requiring that the must be heated in order to complete fermentation fully.|$|E
2500|$|The Vienna Award {{escalated}} in Slovakia {{into the}} first deportations of Jews. Tiso and his collaborators looked for a scapegoat which was found in Jews, because of their demonstration in favour of the annexation of Bratislava into Hungary in the evening before the arbitration. Between November 4 and 5, 1938, Slovakia's autonomous government deported 7,500 Jews into the annexed territory (Tiso justified this step as [...] "letting them go where they wanted"). Hungary refused to accept these people, which included some who were elderly or children, and the deported Jews found themselves imprisoned in no man's land in the <b>cold</b> <b>autumn</b> weather. Hundreds of Jews stayed in a camp in Veľký Kýr and Miloslavov, where {{they were unable to}} move to residences in either Slovakia or Hungary.|$|E
2500|$|The Mosel wine of the Roman {{period was}} {{described}} as light bodied and [...] "austere". It {{was said to be}} an easier drinking wine than that of other Roman areas. In the winter time, the wine was heated in a kettle and drunk like a tea (a practice that still has some tradition among modern vineyard workers who drink it like coffee often with a little sugar added). In warmer vintages the wine was noticeably more fruity and sweet. This was because the warmth allowed the grapes to more fully ripen and develop more sugars. During the <b>cold</b> <b>autumn</b> the fermentation process would not be fully complete because of the low temperature, thus leaving the wine with high levels of residual sugars.|$|E

2500|$|The 33rd Alabama dug in on {{the west}} end of Missionary Ridge on November 22, behind a {{vineyard}} at its base. Rifle pits were built, and guards rotated there every 24hours; those not on guard duty set to work clearing all the vegetation from the west slope of the ridge, chopping the trees so that the tops fell toward Chattanooga, creating a natural barrier of tangled tree limbs. Matthews reports that the removal of these trees allowed the <b>cold</b> <b>autumn</b> breezes to chill the troops on the ridge, since the Southerners had nothing but small tents to break the wind. He reports gazing in wonder at the valley below him, where the campfires of thousands of Federal soldiers [...] " [...] picturesquely at night." [...] A large siege gun was hauled up Lookout Mountain to shell the Union camps and Chattanooga; Matthews recalled that [...] "...at the flash of the gun at night, some soldiers attracted out attention by yelling and watching the long flight and bursting of the shells, [...] were especially attractive to us while standing, squatting or sitting around our camp fires."

5000|$|... === Seasonal leaf loss=== Leaves in temperate, boreal, and {{seasonally}} dry zones may be seasonally deciduous (falling off {{or dying}} for the inclement season). This mechanism to shed leaves is called abscission. When the leaf is shed, it leaves a leaf scar on the twig. In <b>cold</b> <b>autumns,</b> they sometimes change color, and turn yellow, bright-orange, or red, as various accessory pigments (carotenoids and xanthophylls) are revealed when the tree responds to cold and reduced sunlight by curtailing chlorophyll production. Red anthocyanin pigments are now {{thought to be}} produced in the leaf as it dies, possibly to mask the yellow hue left when the chlorophyll is lost—yellow leaves appear to attract herbivores such as aphids. Optical masking of chlorophyll by anthocyanins reduces risk of photo-oxidative damage to leaf cells as they senesce, which otherwise may lower the efficiency of nutrient retrieval from senescing autumn leaves.|$|R

30|$|Rice {{flowering}} time (heading date), {{which is}} affected by both endogenous and exogenous factors, is an important agronomic trait for regional and seasonal adaption. Heading on a proper time is the most critical step for grain production. Precocious flowering reduces the vegetative phase and leads to reduction of biological yield. On the other hand, delayed flowering could cause low seed setting percentage in <b>cold</b> late <b>autumn</b> or delay next planting season, which both results in production loss.|$|R
40|$|Wulan area {{of northeastern}} Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. Response {{function}} and corre-lation analyses showed that spring precipitation (May–June) {{is the critical}} limiting factor for tree-ring growth, and temperature in prior November may {{also play a role}} in affecting tree-ring growth. Excessive spring precipitation occurred during AD 1380 s– 1390 s, 1410 s– 1420 s, 1520 s– 1560 s and 1938 to present. Dry springs occurred during AD 1430 s– 1510 s, 1640 s– 1730 s and 1780 s– 1890 s most of which generally coincided with cold intervals of the Little Ice Age (LIA) on the plateau, suggesting that the LIA climate on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau might be characterized by three episodes of dry spring and cold au-tumn. The relatively driest spring and probably <b>coldest</b> <b>autumn</b> occurred in AD 1710 s– 1720 s, 1787 – 1797, 1815 – 1824, 1869 – 1879 and 1891 – 1895. The extreme drought in AD 1787 – 1797 might result from little monsoon precipitation due to the failure of Asian monsoon in this period. The tree-ring data produced in this study contribute to the spatial expansion of proxy climate records for the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. ...|$|R

40|$|Boreal {{coniferous}} species with wide geographic distributions show substantial variation in <b>autumn</b> <b>cold</b> acclimation among populations. To determine how this variation is inherited across generations, {{we conducted a}} progeny test and examined the development of cold hardening in open-pollinated second-generation (F 2) progeny of Abies sachalinensis. The F 1 parents had different genetic backgrounds resulting from reciprocal interpopulational crosses between low-elevation (L) and high-elevation (H) populations: L × L, L × H, H × L, and H × H. Paternity analysis of the F 2 progeny using molecular genetic markers showed that 91. 3 % of the fathers were located in surrounding stands of the F 1 planting site (i. e., not in the F 1 test population). The remaining fathers were assigned to F 1 parents of the L × L cross-type. This indicates that the high-elevation genome in the F 1 parents was not inherited by the F 2 population via pollen flow. The timing of <b>autumn</b> <b>cold</b> acclimation in the F 2 progeny depended on the cross-type of the F 1 mother. The progeny of H × H mothers showed less damage in freezing tests than the progeny of other cross-types. Statistical modeling supported a linear effect of genome origin. In the best model, variation in freezing damage was explained by the proportion of maternally inherited high-elevation genome. These results suggest that <b>autumn</b> <b>cold</b> acclimation was partly explained by the additive effect of the responsible maternal genome. Thus, the offspring that inherited {{a greater proportion of}} the high-elevation genome developed cold hardiness earlier. Genome-based variation in the regulation of <b>autumn</b> <b>cold</b> acclimation matched the local climatic conditions, which may be a key factor in elevation-dependent adaptation...|$|R
