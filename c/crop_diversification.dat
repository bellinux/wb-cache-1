2500|$|The government's {{response}} and relief packages {{have generally been}} ineffective, misdirected and flawed, states Surinder Sud. It has focused on credit and loan, rather than income, productivity and farmer prosperity. Assistance in paying off outstanding principal and interest helps the money lenders, but has failed to create reliable and good sources of income for the farmer going forward. The usurious moneylenders continue to offer loans at interest rates between 24 and 50 percent, while income generating potential of the land the farmer works on has remained low and subject to weather conditions. Sud states {{that the government has}} failed to understand that debt relief just postpones the problem and a more lasting answer to farmer distress can only come from reliable income sources, higher crop yields per hectare, irrigation and other infrastructure security. Golait, in a Reserve Bank of India paper, acknowledged the positive role of <b>crop</b> <b>diversification</b> initiative announced in government's response to reports of farmer suicides. Golait added, [...] "Indian agriculture still suffers from: i) poor productivity, ii) falling water levels, iii) expensive credit, iv) a distorted market, v) many middlemen and intermediaries who increase cost but do not add much value, vi) laws that stifle private investment, vii) controlled prices, viii) poor infrastructure, and ix) inappropriate research. Thus the approach with mere emphasis on credit in isolation from the above factors will not help agriculture". Furthermore, recommended Golait, a more pro-active role in creating and maintaining reliable irrigation and other agriculture infrastructure is necessary to address farmer distress in India.|$|E

Paddy, sweet potatoes, and cassava were the highest comparative advantages of food crops because of their productivity and index diversification among other food crops. Those three crops were the biggest activator of agricultural transformation in agriculture development in Indonesia. As long as agricultural development occurred in Indonesia, agricultural growth rate was determined dominantly by productivity of land.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{equilibrium}} acreage allocation decisions {{at the farm}} and regional levels under risk aversion, yield uncertainty, and endogenous crop prices is undertaken in a two-crop, two-region setting. The main insight is that a partial specialization in one crop at a regional level may be an equilibrium dominant strategy relative to the more diversified crop mix produced on farm. This {{is due to the}} trade-offs among the effects of the "natural hedge" based on the negative price-yield correlation on the probability distributions of crop revenues and whole-farm revenue risk reduction through <b>crop</b> enterprise <b>diversification.</b> Another finding is that equilibrium in which each region grows only one crop is unlikely unless there are comparative advantages in production (or marketing) across regions. Other circumstances under which complete regional specialization is possible include a high level of producer risk aversion along with limited benefits derived through <b>crop</b> enterprise <b>diversification</b> due to high correlation of farm-level yields for different crops, and a low crop price elasticity. This applies to situations in which one can identify growing regions that are possessed of two features. The first feature is that growing conditions are relatively homogenous and farm-level yield co-variability is higher within each region as compared with that across the regions. The second feature is that the sizes of the regions are large enough to have a substantial impact on output prices. land allocation, spatial yield dependence, supermodular order. ...|$|R
