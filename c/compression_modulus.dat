5000|$|Bending modulus {{is defined}} as the energy {{required}} to deform a membrane from its natural curvature to some other curvature. For an ideal bilayer the intrinsic curvature is zero, so this expression is somewhat simplified. The bending modulus, <b>compression</b> <b>modulus</b> and bilayer thickness are related by [...] such that if two of these parameters are known the other can be calculated. This relationship derives from the fact that to bend the inner face must be compressed and the outer face must be stretched. The thicker the membrane, the more each face must deform to accommodate a given curvature (see bending moment). Many of the values for Ka in literature have actually been calculated from experimentally measured values of Kb and t. This relation holds only for small deformations, but this is generally a good approximation as most lipid bilayers can support only a few percent strain before rupturing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{crystallization}} on the mechanical stability of geopolymers, a particularly important aspect for concrete applications with a view towards durability. Three typical geopolymers are synthesized with Class F fly ash (one blended with 20 % slag), and cured under 80 oC hydrothermal or ambient (25 °C) conditions, for 90 days. The hardened geopolymers are assessed for compressive strength and modulus at different ages, and analysed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Under hydrothermal conditions, the fly ash-based geopolymers activated with a sodium silicate solution exhibit crystallisation trend after 28 days of curing. The phase change (or local microstructural modification) leads to a 10 - 20 % loss of compressive strength {{at the age of}} 90 d compared with the maximum values achieved at 7 d or 14 d. However, a 30 - 40 % loss in <b>compression</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> is observed. The geopolymers activated with NaOH solution exhibit continuous strength increase during the hydrothermal curing period, but also show a 20 - 30 % loss in <b>compression</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> at the age of 90 d. In comparison, under ambient conditions, geopolymers exhibit a continuous strength increase in the period observed, either for specimens activated with sodium silicate or for those activated with NaOH solution. The <b>compression</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> decreases by 30 % only at the age of 90 d, when more ordered and/or zeolitic phases are formed. Addition of 20 % slag does not alter the trend in variation of compressive strength and elastic modulus under the two curing conditions. The loss in strength and modulus shows a close relationship with the zeolite formation observed by XRD and FTIR in these samples, which may be further attributed to the change of the local pore structure in geopolymers. These findings suggest that geopolymers at ambient temperature possess high stability. However, the crystallization potential, if it is assumed that a zeolite is the final structure of geopolymer gel, may cause a loss in compressive strength and modulus to a certain extent, which should be considered in a long-term view of the performance of the materials. ...|$|R

When the content of TiO 2 is less than 1. 5 wt% (mass fraction), the density, bending strength, compressive strength and <b>compression</b> <b>modulus</b> increase with the increasing of TiO 2 content, and the optical band gap decreases with the TiO 2 content increasing. As the content of TiO 2 is more than 1. 5 wt%, the density, bending strength, compressive strength and <b>compression</b> <b>modulus</b> decrease with the increasing of TiO 2 content, and the optical band gap increases with the increasing of TiO 2 content. When the content of TiO 2 is 1. 5 wt%, the mechanical properties of the TiO 2 /SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgO system is excellent, and the bending strength, compressive strength, <b>compression</b> <b>modulus</b> and optical band gap of the glasses is 110. 36 MPa, 240. 18 MPa, 115. 03 GPa and 3. 75 eV, respectively. The addition of TiO 2 reduces the numbers of the non-bridging oxygen in the glass network structure, increasing the structural stability of the investigated glasses. So the network structure of the isolated island is rejoined, which significantly improve the mechanical properties of the glass. However, excessive TiO 2 force its structure of the bridge oxygen bond to generate non-bridging oxygen, which significantly reduces the structural stability and mechanical properties of the investigated glasses. © 2017, Chinese Society for Composite Materials.
