40|$|Burns {{can leave}} {{a patient with}} a {{severely}} debilitating disability even after treatment. The objectives of burn rehabilitation are to minimize the adverse effects caused by the injury while rehabilitating the patient′s physical and psychological well-being, maximizing social integration. Long-term success of maxillofacial prostheses mainly depends on the retention. Extra oral implant retained prostheses {{have proved to be}} a predictable treatment option for maxillofacial rehabilitation. Replacement of a severely deformed external ear with burned tissues may be satisfactorily accomplished by a cosmetic prosthesis anchored by implants integrated in the skull. The use of such implants is now a well-recognized method for creating a stable result in maxillofacial rehabilitation. This case report describes a safe, simple and economical method for the rehabilitation of a patient with missing right auricle using an implant supported silicone prosthesis. The implant was placed in the mastoid region of the temporal bone. Reconstruction of the ear was done with auricular silicone prosthesis, retained using magnets incorporated in an autopolymerizing resin shim to decrease the weight of the prosthesis on a single implant. This method eliminates the need of tedious laboratory procedures and exact <b>casting</b> and <b>fitting</b> requirements of a metal substructure while minimizing the overall weight and cost of the prosthesis while maintaining adequate support, esthetics and retention of the prosthesis...|$|R
50|$|The {{class were}} troubled by several {{reliability}} problems, notably with the engines which {{were found to}} require excessive maintenance. A series of modifications to the pistons, piston rings and maintenance schedules, and <b>fitting</b> <b>cast</b> iron cylinder heads improved the engine reliability considerably, but a complex V16 for only 800 bhp and a small class size doomed them with a contracting rail network. The layout, with a single cab positioned part-way down the body like a North American road-switcher, gave the crew poor forward visibility in both directions of travel, although this was initially tolerated as it was no worse than the visibility from a steam locomotive cab. Despite these problems the class were more successful than the contemporary Type 1 locomotives of Class 16 and the later Class 17.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effect of recasting Ti- 6 Al- 4 V on the marginal accuracy and internal fit of complete cast crowns. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V was used to cast 18 single crowns, six of each group. Three groups of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V ingots were tested. The first group was as received from manufacturer, second group was a mixture (1 : 1 ratio) of as received and the alloy that was once used and the last group was an alloy used once (recast). A travelling microscope was used to measure the marginal and internal gaps between the metal die and the <b>casting.</b> The <b>fitting</b> discrepancies were analyzed with a 1 -way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple range (α=. 05). The lowest mean marginal gap was recorded for the as-received (36. 87 im) and the highest was for the 100 % reused (39. 24 im). However, these differences were not statistically significant (P= 0. 192). For the internal fitting, no significant difference was shown between as-received and 50 % reused groups (P> 0. 91). Yet, the alloys in both the groups showed gaps that were significantly smaller than the 100 % reused alloy (P< 0. 002). Used Ti- 6 Al- 4 V metals could be melted and utilized again for casting single crowns. As-received and 50 % reused metals demonstrated better internal fit than the 100 % reused metals.

30|$|Based on our data, we {{concluded}} {{the temperature of}} the dip water was the most important variable in generating heat in composite casts. At no time was a peak temperature greater than 48  °C recorded when 24  °C dip water was used. When applying composite casts, it may be prudent to delay the addition of the outer synthetic layers for several minutes to minimize the peak temperature generated. There appears to be no increased risk of thermal injury with composite casts compared with equally thick plaster casts. Because there is a wide range of susceptibility to thermal injury, it is advisable to take steps to minimize the exothermic reaction at all times. Using cool dip water and applying the minimum necessary amount of plaster casting material should help avoid the problem of exothermic burns. It is possible that increased thickness of padding under the cast may be protective, with the trade-off of a less well <b>fitting</b> <b>cast.</b>|$|R
5|$|Having, in his view, perfected many of {{his ideas}} and designs for steam engines, Evans turned his {{attention}} once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions. His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad-hoc basis, often with improvised tools and workers, and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal-working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal-work required to build steam engines. In particular, Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills, precision tools and a large foundry {{in order to build}} steam machines on a commercial basis. Thus, Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia. The choice of name, after the Roman god of war, is thought to have been aspirational and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom, famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines. Indeed, the completed Mars Works was {{one of the largest and}} best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States—by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry, moldmaker's shop, blacksmith's shops, millstone maker, a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron. With over thirty-five staff, the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to <b>cast</b> iron <b>fittings,</b> as well as milling and farming machines for Evans's now well-established agricultural clientele. Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of heavy machinery, contributing to Philadelphia's emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century. Indeed, the works even received military orders, casting naval cannons during the War of 1812. Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients. In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for wool processing factories in Middletown, Connecticut, Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators to heat the factory with engine exhaust.|$|R
40|$|An {{orthopedic}} plaster or fiberglass cast {{is often}} applied after a bone fracture {{to hold the}} broken bone in place and allow the fracture to heal and the bone to set. If this cast becomes loose, due {{to a reduction in}} swelling for example, the bone may not heal properly and a misalignment of the bone may occur. If this problem goes unnoticed, surgery may need to be performed to re-break and reset the bone. This is particularly a problem with patients who are unable to accurately express what they are feeling, e. g. children, and who {{may not be able to}} identify that their cast is loose. The SmartCast system has been designed to avoid this complication and to identify early if a <b>cast</b> is not <b>fitting</b> well. SmartCast consists of a sleeve with novel textile sensors capable of measuring the pressure the cast is applying to an appendage as well as electronics to sample and log the sensor data. Several types of textile piezoresistive sensor sleeves have been designed and tested to determine which type would best be able to measure the cast pressure. A full prototype system, including firmware, sensor sleeve, and printed circuit board, has been designed, implemented and tested. The SmartCast system will allow doctors and orthopedic professionals to obtain a better understanding of how well a cast fits over time and to avoid the painful procedure of resetting a bone...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{accuracy}} of reproducing maximal intercuspal position (IP) on dental casts without using a wax-index as compared with the IP determined by the wax index on the same models. The material consisted of dental casts, which were taken from 15 -year old adolescents as part of oral examinations during the ”Fit Futures – part of The Tromsø Study”. All dental casts having wax bites were included in this study (N= 80). Two examiners assessed Angle’s classification and overjet on all dental <b>casts</b> twice, first <b>fitting</b> the dental <b>casts</b> together by hand articulation without using the wax index and second time using the wax index. Differences between the first and second assessment were measured and the agreement was analyzed using Cohen’s kappa. In 49 % of the models, there was no difference in overjet measurements with or without using an occlusal index, while 21 % of the casts showed a difference of more than 0. 5 mm, out of which 2 casts differed more than 1 mm. Agreement on Angle’s classification was 93 % on the right side and 91 % on the left between the two measurements. In molar millimeter measurements 16 - 20 % of the cases showed more than 0. 5 mm difference between the assessments. An agreement on treatment need between the first and second measurement, based on overjet values, was found in 84 % of the cases. The results suggest that in the majority of dental casts with permanent dentition and no extreme malocclusions, the maximal intercuspal position may be reproduced acceptably by hand articulation without a wax index. However, this method may not be reliable enough for research purposes or for planning of orthodontic treatment in some individual patients with severe occlusal deviations...|$|R
