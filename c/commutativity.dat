5|$|<b>Commutativity</b> is a {{property}} of some logical connectives of truth functional propositional logic. The following logical equivalences demonstrate that <b>commutativity</b> is {{a property}} of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional tautologies.|$|E
5|$|The <b>commutativity</b> and {{associativity}} {{of rational}} addition {{is an easy}} consequence {{of the laws of}} integer arithmetic. For a more rigorous and general discussion, see field of fractions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>commutativity</b> and {{associativity}} of real addition are immediate; {{defining the}} real number 0 {{to be the}} set of negative rationals, it is easily seen to be the additive identity. Probably the trickiest part of this construction pertaining to addition {{is the definition of}} additive inverses.|$|E
5|$|In a {{paper from}} 1998, Alain Connes, Michael R. Douglas, and Albert Schwarz showed that {{some aspects of}} matrix models and M-theory are {{described}} by a noncommutative quantum field theory, {{a special kind of}} physical theory in which the coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy the <b>commutativity</b> property. This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as <b>commutativity,</b> associativity and distributivity.|$|E
5|$|A finite {{field is}} a set of numbers with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as <b>commutativity,</b> associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E
25|$|Venn {{diagrams}} {{are helpful}} in visualizing laws. The <b>commutativity</b> laws for ∧ and ∨ {{can be seen}} from the symmetry of the diagrams: a binary operation that was not commutative would not have a symmetric diagram because interchanging x and y would have the effect of reflecting the diagram horizontally and any failure of <b>commutativity</b> would then appear as a failure of symmetry.|$|E
25|$|Note that we {{need the}} <b>commutativity</b> of A and N for the last step to work.|$|E
25|$|Finally, when p and q are equal, the two {{right-hand}} {{sides are}} equal, and the <b>commutativity</b> of Tor follows.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{definition}} is as a residuated lattice whose monoid operation is ∧. The monoid unit must then {{be the top}} element 1. <b>Commutativity</b> of this monoid implies that the two residuals coincide as a→b.|$|E
25|$|Any {{projective}} group variety, i.e., a projective variety, whose points form {{an abstract}} group, is necessarily an abelian variety. Elliptic curves are examples for abelian varieties. The <b>commutativity</b> fails for non-projective group varieties, as the example GLn(k) (the general linear group) shows.|$|E
25|$|It {{turns out}} that {{requiring}} the cancellative property in a monoid {{is not required to}} perform the Grothendieck construction – <b>commutativity</b> is sufficient. However, if the original monoid has an absorbing element then its Grothendieck group is the trivial group. Hence the homomorphism is, in general, not injective.|$|E
25|$|If e and f are {{orthogonal}} idempotents, {{the spectral}} theorem shows that e and f are polynomials in a = e − f, so that L(e) and L(f) commute. This {{can be seen}} directly from the polarized Jordan identity which implies L(e)L(f) = 2 L(e)L(f)L(e). <b>Commutativity</b> follows by taking adjoints.|$|E
25|$|Being a {{consequence}} of just algebraic expression manipulation, these relations are valid for matrices with entries in any commutative ring (<b>commutativity</b> must be assumed for determinants to be defined in the first place). This {{is important to note}} here, because these relations will be applied below for matrices with non-numeric entries such as polynomials.|$|E
25|$|The {{quaternion}} involved abandoning <b>commutativity,</b> {{a radical}} step for the time. Not only this, but Hamilton {{had in a}} sense invented the cross and dot products of vector algebra. Hamilton also described a quaternion as an ordered four-element multiple of real numbers, and described the first element as the 'scalar' part, and the remaining three as the 'vector' part.|$|E
25|$|All the {{properties}} of complex numbers {{can be derived from}} bivectors, but two are of particular interest. First as with complex numbers products of bivectors and so the even subalgebra are commutative. This is only true in two dimensions, so properties of the bivector in two dimensions that depend on <b>commutativity</b> do not usually generalise to higher dimensions.|$|E
25|$|A {{polynomial}} is {{an expression}} that can be built from constants and symbols called indeterminates or variables by means of addition, multiplication and exponentiation to a non-negative integer power. Two such expressions that may be transformed, one to the other, by applying the usual properties of <b>commutativity,</b> associativity and distributivity of addition and multiplication are considered as defining the same polynomial.|$|E
25|$|By <b>commutativity</b> and {{associativity}} one {{can think}} of join and meet as binary operations that are defined on non-empty finite sets, rather than on elements. In a bounded lattice the empty join and the empty meet can also be defined (as 0 and 1, respectively). This makes bounded lattices somewhat more natural than general lattices, and many authors require all lattices to be bounded.|$|E
25|$|In {{abstract}} algebra, an abelian group, {{also called}} a commutative group, {{is a group}} in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements {{does not depend on}} the order in which they are written. That is, these are the groups that obey the axiom of <b>commutativity.</b> Abelian groups generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers. They are named after Niels Henrik Abel.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sometimes}} desirable {{to prove a}} statement involving two natural numbers, n and m, by iterating the induction process. That is, one performs a basis step and an inductive step for n, and {{in each of those}} performs a basis step and an inductive step for m. See, for example, the proof of <b>commutativity</b> accompanying addition of natural numbers. More complicated arguments involving three or more counters are also possible.|$|E
25|$|Can {{this list}} be made shorter yet? Again {{the answer is}} yes. To begin with, some of the above laws are implied {{by some of the}} others. A {{sufficient}} subset of the above laws consists of the pairs of associativity, <b>commutativity,</b> and absorption laws, distributivity of ∧ over ∨ (or the other distributivity law—one suffices), and the two complement laws. In fact this is the traditional axiomatization of Boolean algebra as a complemented distributive lattice.|$|E
25|$|These derivations also {{emphasize}} the strictly formal {{structure of the}} sequent calculus. For example, the logical rules as defined above always act on a formula immediately adjacent to the turnstile, such that the permutation rules are necessary. Note, however, that this is in part an artifact of the presentation, in the original style of Gentzen. A common simplification {{involves the use of}} multisets of formulas in the interpretation of the sequent, rather than sequences, eliminating the need for an explicit permutation rule. This corresponds to shifting <b>commutativity</b> of assumptions and derivations outside the sequent calculus, whereas LK embeds it within the system itself.|$|E
25|$|A {{polynomial}} is {{an expression}} that {{is the sum of}} a finite number of non-zero terms, each term consisting of the product of a constant and a finite number of variables raised to whole number powers. For example, x2 + 2x − 3 is a polynomial in the single variable x. A polynomial expression {{is an expression}} that may be rewritten as a polynomial, by using <b>commutativity,</b> associativity and distributivity of addition and multiplication. For example, (x − 1)(x + 3) is a polynomial expression, that, properly speaking, is not a polynomial. A polynomial function is a function that is defined by a polynomial, or, equivalently, by a polynomial expression. The two preceding examples define the same polynomial function.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of a noncommutative ring {{is more complicated than}} that of a commutative ring. For example, there exist simple rings, containing no non-trivial proper (two-sided) ideals, which contain non-trivial proper left or right ideals. Various invariants exist for commutative rings, whereas invariants of noncommutative rings are difficult to find. As an example, the nilradical of a ring, the set of all nilpotent elements, need not be an ideal unless the ring is commutative. Specifically, the set of all nilpotent elements in the ring of all n x n matrices over a division ring never forms an ideal, irrespective of the division ring chosen. There are, however, analogues of the nilradical defined for noncommutative rings, that coincide with the nilradical when <b>commutativity</b> is assumed.|$|E
