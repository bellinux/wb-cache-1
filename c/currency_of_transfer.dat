40|$|There are {{a number}} of agents which are {{believed}} to impact on metabolic functions which may ultimately impact on neuronal cell survival and cognitive function. Aging is characterized by a progressive deterioration in physiological functions and metabolic processes. Regimes that buffer intracellular energy levels may impede the progression of the neurodegenerative process. This chapter focuses on some of the metabolic agents that may prove to be effective in combating neurodegeneration and lead to better cognitive aging through the life span. The metabolic agents specifically focused on in this chapter are glucose and oxygen, pyruvate, creatine, and L-carnitine. Each of these agents is directly responsible for generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecular unit <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> intracellular energy <b>transfer.</b> Their roles as cognitive agents are explored...|$|R

50|$|Legal {{restrictions}} on structuring {{are concerned with}} limiting the size of domestic transactions for individuals, and somewhat limiting the outbound foreign <b>currency</b> <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> firms or company entities. This {{should not be confused}} with Capital controls, which are regulatory limits on the money that one can take out of a nation and generally regulate how much money can leave a country at any given time. Both can have some of the same economic effects in some economies, as structuring controls effectively limit the flow of capital by magnitude and duration, and can apply equally to taking money out of a nation as well as putting money into its finance system.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} virtual worlds have {{incorporated}} systems for {{sale of goods}} through virtual interfaces and using virtual <b>currencies.</b> <b>Transfers</b> <b>of</b> in-world credits typically are not bound by laws governing commerce. Such transactions may lack the oversight and protections associated with real-world commerce, and there is potential for fraudulent transactions. One example is that of Ginko Financial, a bank system featured in Second Life where avatars could deposit their real life currency after converted to Linden Dollars for a profit. In July 2007, residents of Second Life crowded around the ATM's in an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw their money. After a few days the ATM's along with the banks disappeared altogether. Around $700,000 in real world money was reported missing from residents in Second Life. An investigation was launched but nothing substantial ever came of finding and punishing the avatar known as Nicholas Portocarrero who {{was the head of}} Ginko Financial.|$|R

40|$|Comparisons are {{powerful}} tools for {{making sense of}} worlds. But comparisons do not merely identify inherent or pre-existing similarities and differences; instead, they participate in making the very worlds they aim to describe. This dissertation probes how comparative practices shape the formation of multispecies landscapes. I show that the specificities of how people make comparisons {{and what kinds of}} comparisons they make are a powerful but often overlooked part of the production of human-nonhuman arrangements, as well as knowledges about them. By focusing on salmon in Hokkaido, Japan, I demonstrate that neither the island's watershed ecologies nor its fish population structures can be understood without attention to practices of comparison-making. Since the mid- 19 th century, natural resources management in northern Japan has been profoundly shaped by how people both within and beyond Japan have compared Hokkaido's landscapes and fish to those {{in other parts of the}} world. After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Japanese officials sought to "develop" Hokkaido's lands and waters and make them legibly "modern" to Euro-American audiences. They did so by importing "Western" crops and livestock, promoting large-scale commercial agriculture, and constructing salmon hatcheries. Since that time, the ways that Japanese fishermen, scientists, government officials, and indigenous peoples have compared Hokkaido's salmon and salmon-bearing watersheds to others around the globe have dramatically affected the region's approaches to fisheries management, as well as its salmon. Drawing on ethnographic, archival, and fisheries science research in Hokkaido, the U. S. Pacific Northwest, and Chile, my dissertation demonstrates how particular practices of comparison have created cross-border movements - such as transplants of salmon eggs, exchanges <b>of</b> <b>currency,</b> <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> scientific technology, and exports of processed fish products - that have shaped the course of Hokkaido's development, the genes of its fish, and the identities of its people. Comparison, I show, is not just a "meta" act of analysis, but also an everyday practice that alters both human and nonhuman bodies and relations. When a Japanese consumer compares kinds of salmon at a supermarket and decides to purchase the fish labeled "wild," or when a Chilean biologist compares the temperature of a Patagonian river to one in Hokkaido, determining that it might be possible to transplant fish from one side of the Pacific to the other, such decisions fundamentally reconfigure human and salmon lives. By tracing such far-reaching comparisons, this dissertation attempts to open up the practices and geographies through which we know landscapes...|$|R
