However, {{it is difficult to}} quantitatively monitor the state of truss structures because of the connection diversity and complexity of truss structures. In this paper, electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique was proposed to measure impedance spectra by using PZT elements and backpropagation (BP) neural network was used as an effective nonlinear conversion tool to quantify the health state of truss structures. Firstly, frequency band of the spectrum was experimentally determined by the trial-and-error approach. Then four <b>connection</b> <b>rods</b> of this truss structure were selected for experimental research. These <b>connection</b> <b>rods</b> were loosened gradually with a small angle increment and the impedance spectra were recorded. Then, the measured data were compressed through dividing the frequency range into multiple subbands. And RMSD values of these bands showed that data points were reduced while damage features remained. Finally, one four-layered BP neural network model was constructed based on these compressed data. The research results showed that compressed impedance data could retain their damage features. After the training, the developed neural network model could not only determine the location of loosened rod, but also quantify the loosening levels...|$|R

Well-integrated focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror, pentaprism and auto-diaphragm {{design with}} excellent lenses and good accessory system. Stopping down (closing) the lens aperture (iris) {{to prepare for}} exposure transmits less light to the mirror and the viewfinder may become very dim - perhaps even {{too dark to see}} the image. Auto-diaphragms coupled to the shutter release that automatically stop down when the mirror swings up and reopen when the mirror comes down provides almost continuous fully open aperture viewing. Auto-diaphragm lenses and instant return mirror, focal-plane shutter SLRs require precise camera-to-lens linkage, but can choreograph the entire shutter-button release, close lens, raise mirror, open shutter, close shutter, lower mirror, open lens exposure sequence in as little as ⅛th second. Originally, these were mechanical spring/gear/lever systems energized concurrent with manually winding the film, but modern systems are electronically timed and operated by an electromagnet. The financially weak Zunow company was unable to capitalize on its design; few examples of the camera (and much fewer of the wide and tele lenses for it) were produced before the company switched back to lenses for other companies' cameras. Zunow went bankrupt in 1961.

40|$|Massive {{low-alloy}} {{high-strength steel}} components often exhibit microstructure variations from surface to core due to decreasing cooling rates when moving towards the interior. Since different steel constituents exhibit different fatigue crack growth (FCG) behaviors, both the overall and local FCG rates {{are expected to}} be influenced by the microstructural change that in turn affects the crack shape. The case of slack-quenched components with simple geometries, having a surface flaw, and subjected to constant-force-amplitude tensile fatigue, is first examined theoretically. The microstructural variations are hypothesized by considering low-alloy steel hardenabilities and medium quench severities; thereafter, the FCG is computed by considering (during each integration step) the stress intensity factor amplitude and the FCG behavior of different points of the crack front, the pointwise FCG properties being determined by the local steel constituents fractions.

Based on this framework, we dynamically formulate an intelligent controller designed to store dynamical correspondence from initial states to final states of the CIP model, to receive state vectors of the model, and to output impulsive control forces to produce desired final states of the model. Developing a quantized and reduced order design of this controller, we have a practical control procedure based on an off-line learning method. We then conduct numerical simulations to investigate individual performance of the intelligent controller, showing that the performance can be improved by adding a delay element into the intelligent controller. The result shows that the performance depends not only on quantization resolutions of learning data but also on delay time of the delay element. Finally, we install the intelligent controllers into both pendulums in the proposed framework to demonstrate autonomous competitive behavior between inverted pendulums.

40|$|Piston {{telemetry}} research involves {{monitoring the}} temperatures at specific internal location points within a combustion engine piston. The temperatures are detected with type K thermocouples as voltages and processed to convert them into temperatures using cold junction compensation methods. The present system uses a specific sensor designed {{to operate in}} the high temperature environment within the piston, reading multiple thermocouples. Because of the reciprocating motion of the piston, power generation is intermittent and available only when the piston reaches near bottom dead centre, using inductive coupling to power the sensors and transmit data to an evaluation unit for data processing. The planned system involves designing and building a prototype telemetry unit using ¿off the shelf¿ components that integrate the reading of thermocouple outputs, signal processing and cold junction compensation. Wireless telemetry is adopted for data transmission with an integrated Bluetooth and microcontroller module. The data acquisition module can be adapted for other sensors by adapting the firmware uploaded to the microcontroller. The hardware electronics are envisaged to be encased in thermal insulation to enable operation in high temperature environments. The considered system requires a power supply for the integrated components {{in the form of a}} power generator and that it should meet two criteria: to be located within confined spaces and to be permanently available, without having to dismantle systems to change batteries. The selected method is an induction generator constructed from a coil stator connected to the piston <b>connection</b> <b>rod</b> big end and a permanent magnet rotor connected to the crankshaft. The suggested mechatronic system is validated against the present system by comparing both systems to determine whether wireless telemetry can perform within acceptable tolerances and limits for the specified task. Then, for acceptable performances, reduce costs and include flexibility to operate in multiple environments. Bench testing shows that the power generator is capable of driving the sensors and the Bluetooth integrated DAQ system. EPSRC and University of Bradfor...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{to reduce}} energy {{consumption}} is increasing. The problem of vehicle fuel consumption and emissions is approached by exploring various vehicle propulsion options, assessing their net eff�ectiveness on a energy conversion basis {{and on a}} usability (consumer appeal) basis. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of various options indicates that internal combustion engine powered vehicles compare favourably because of low production cost in spite of only achieving modest energy conversion efficiency in operation. Spark ignition (SI) homogeneous charge engines have dominated as passenger vehicle power plants, {{and are likely to}} maintain their prevalence for passenger vehicle propulsion into the future, but efficiency improvements are required and achievable. Throttling losses are a signifi�cant contributor to reduced efficiency at low load for SI engines which is the load range most employed in standard driving behaviour. An Induction Air Motor (IAM) was conceived, designed, simulated and prototyped to evaluate the potential to recover some of the work the engine does to reduce its intake air pressure for low load operation. The prototyped IAM produced work which potentially could contribute to the engine output while reducing the intake pressure resulting in improved efficiency. However, further eff�ort is required to reduce the friction in the IAM and optimise the work produced by the IAM. An alternative strategy for efficiency improvement involves high Compression Ratio (CR) in conjunction with a reduced compression stroke volume achieved by Late Valve Closing (LVC). Such an arrangement of the Atkinson cycle is shown by simulation to produce improved brake efficiency in SI engines. In this cofin�guration, the maximum power produced by the engine is considerably lower than the maximum power that is achieved by the same displacement for a full compression stroke. To achieve both the improved efficiency at low load using the Atkinson confi�guration and the power achievable from a full induction stroke, the engine requires Variable Compression Ratio (VCR). Assessment of VCR concepts from literature and patents identifi�ed that the complexity of continuously variable compression ratio designs prevented their development to production-ready con�figurations. A simulation of fuel consumption over a standard driving cycle showed that a two-position VCR arrangement produces the same bene�t as a continuously variable CR for physically achievable piston-rod-crank cofin�gurations. Experiments with supporting simulations were performed for a previously patented two-position VCR device, an eccentric link in the big-end of the connecting rod. This work concludes that the eccentric link is not a viable VCR mechanism. An alternative VCR device involving a hydraulic connecting rod was prompted by further experiments and simulations which identifi�ed the behaviour of oil when compressed at high rates in a hydraulic cylinder impacted by a falling mass. The oil impact work suggested that oil chambers of cross-sectional area that could be arranged in a conventional connecting rod could readily support the loads experienced by the rod in a conventionally con�figured engine, so the design and prototyping of a hydraulic connecting rod proceeded. Experiments and simulation confi�rmed that a relatively easily manufactured hydraulic <b>connection</b> <b>rod</b> can be successfully operated in an engine, achieving controllable two-position VCR. Further development of the hydraulic connecting rod control device and improved production techniques are recommended for this new two-position hydraulic VCR device. ...|$|E
