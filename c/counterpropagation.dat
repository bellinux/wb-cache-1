In this paper, a <b>counterpropagation</b> neural network (CPNN) is proposed to solve power flow problem under different loading/contingency conditions for computing bus voltage magnitudes and angles of the power system. The <b>counterpropagation</b> network uses a different mapping strategy namely <b>counterpropagation</b> and provides a practical approach for implementing a pattern mapping task, since learning is fast in this network. The composition of the input variables for the proposed neural network has been selected to emulate the solution process of a conventional power flow program. The effectiveness of the proposed CPNN based approach for solving power flow is demonstrated by computation of bus voltage magnitudes and voltage angles for different loading conditions and single line-outage contingencies in IEEE 14 -bus system.

40|$|Human speech {{signals are}} {{inherently}} multi-component non-stationary signals. Recognition schemes for classification of non-stationary signals generally require {{some kind of}} temporal alignment to be performed. Examples of techniques used for temporal alignment include hidden Markov models and dynamic time warping. Attempts to incorporate temporal alignment into artificial neural networks {{have resulted in the}} construction of time-delay neural networks. The nonstationary nature of speech requires a signal representation that is dependent on time. Time-frequency signal analysis is an extension of conventional time-domain and frequency-domain analysis methods. Researchers have reported on the effectiveness of time-frequency representations to reveal the time-varying nature of speech. In this thesis, a recognition scheme is developed for temporal-spectral alignment of nonstationary signals by performing preprocessing on the time-frequency distributions of the speech phonemes. The resulting representation is independent of any amount of time-frequency shift and is time-frequency shift-tolerant (TFST). The proposed scheme does not require time alignment of the signals and has the additional merit of providing spectral alignment, which may have importance in recognition of speech from different speakers. A modification to the <b>counterpropagation</b> network is proposed that is suitable for phoneme recognition. The modified network maintains the simplicity and competitive mechanism of the <b>counterpropagation</b> network and has additional benefits of fast learning and good modelling accuracy. The temporal-spectral alignment recognition scheme and modified <b>counterpropagation</b> network are applied to the recognition task of speech phonemes. Simulations show that the proposed scheme has potential in the classification of speech phonemes which have not been aligned in time. To facilitate the research, an environment to perform time-frequency signal analysis and recognition using artificial neural networks was developed.

40|$|In {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy (TLE), the variation of chemical receptor expression underlies {{the basis of}} neural network activity shifts, resulting in neuronal hyperexcitability and epileptiform discharges. However, dynamical mechanisms involved in the transitions of TLE are not fully understood, because of the neuronal diversity and the indeterminacy of network connection. Hence, based on Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) type neurons and Pinsky–Rinzel (PR) type neurons coupling with glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic connections respectively, we propose a computational framework which contains dentate gyrus (DG) region and CA 3 region. By regulating the concentration range of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR), we demonstrate the pyramidal neuron can generate transitions from interictal to seizure discharges. This suggests that enhanced endogenous activity of NMDAR contributes to excitability in pyramidal neuron. Moreover, we conclude that excitatory discharges in CA 3 region vary considerably {{on account of the}} excitatory currents produced by the excitatory pyramidal neuron. Interestingly, by changing the backprojection connection, we find that glutamatergic type backprojection can promote the dominant frequency of firings and further motivate excitatory <b>counterpropagation</b> from CA 3 region to DG region. However, GABAergic type backprojection can reduce firing rate and block morbid <b>counterpropagation,</b> which may be factored into the terminations of TLE.

The Temporal Hypermap introduces flexibility in the recall of temporal patterns - a stored temporal pattern can be retrieved by prompting the network with the temporal pattern's identity vector, whilst the incorporation of short term memory allows the recall of a temporal pattern, starting from the pattern item specified by contextual information up to the last item in the pattern sequence. Finally, we extend the connectionist modelling of child language acquisition in two important respects. First, we introduce the concept of multimodal representation of speech utterances at the one-word and two-word stage. This allows us to model child language at the one-word utterance stage with a single modified <b>counterpropagation</b> network, which is an improvement on previous models in which multiple networks are required to simulate the different aspects of speech at the one-word utterance stage.

The FARCNN architecture {{is derived from the}} methodology of fuzzy inductive reasoning and a basic form of <b>counterpropagation</b> neural networks (CNNs) for efficient implementation of finite state machines. Analog signals are converted to fuzzy signals by use of a new type of fuzzy A/D converter, thereby keeping the size of the Kohonen layer of the CNN manageably small. Fuzzy inferencing is accomplished by an application-independent feedforward network trained by means of backpropagation. Global feedback is used to represent full system dynamics. The FARCNN architecture combines the advantages of the quantitative approach (neural network) with that of the qualitative approach (fuzzy logic) as an efficient autonomous system modeling methodology. It also makes the simulation of mixed quantitative and qualitative models more feasible. In simulation experiments, we shall show that FARCNNs can be applied directly and easily to different types of systems, including static continuous nonlinear systems, discrete sequential systems, and as part of large dynamic continuous nonlinear control systems, embedding the FARCNN into much larger industry-sized quantitative models, even permitting a feedback structure to be placed around the FARCNN...|$|E
