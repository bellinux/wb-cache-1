40|$|The special {{position}} of the rotating Council Presidency has raised a long-standing debate {{on the extent to}} which this function allows a Member State to exert additional influence on European Union decision-making, in particular in external policy. This article argues that a broader and more differentiated study of Presidency influence could further this debate. In doing so, the article analyses the Polish Council Presidency (during the second half of 2011) and its influence on the European Union’s Eastern Partnership policies across three dimensions: (i) differences between influence on the agenda and influence on the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions,</b> (ii) the forums (different levels in the Council and international forums) where the Presidency can exert influence, and (iii) different types of external policies, an area that has received relatively little scholarly attention thus far in the literature on the Presidency. The analysis shows that (i) the Presidency can determine the agenda to a certain extent, but the {{position of}} the chair does not allow the incumbent to exert additional influence on the contents of decisions; (ii) most Presidency influence of external policies is observed in the preparatory bodies of the Council, while at the ministerial or international level this influence is much smaller; and (iii) although the Presidency can play a rather prominent role in organizing multilateral events, this rarely amounts to real political influence. In turn, the Presidency’s influence is most tangible in specific bilateral dossiers...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although {{real option}} {{valuation}} techniques {{are well known}} and widely researched by academics, there are certain thresholds that discourage practising managers from using them in investment planning. These thresholds deal with both the quantitative and qualitative features of real options {{as well as the}} way real option models and logic is pre-sented to the managers. From the point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> support, especially the application and <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> support, a model-centred approach with normative mathematical formulation gives some starting points for design <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> support systems (DSS). To capitalise on the potential of real options in investment planning the conditions of managerial applicability must be assessed. To build good DSS certain aspects of knowledge presentation, model con-struction and pragmatic implementation should be considered.

40|$|Decision-making is a {{fundamental}} aspect of human cognition and behaviour. Every day, we make a multitude <b>of</b> <b>decisions,</b> ranging from rather simple perceptual choices to complex financial decisions. The underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms appear to directly deploy external information, gathered by our senses, as well as internal information, such as preferences and beliefs. Ideally, this results in well-informed decisions and successful goal-directed behaviour. In reality, however, we are often faced with decision situations in which {{we do not have}} clear preferences, or access to all information. In these situations, contextual factors appear to have a strong influence on decision-makers. This work highlights recent research supporting the hypothesis that contextual information can exert significant biases on a variety <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> processes outside decision-makers’ awareness. These studies further exemplify a content-based cognitive neuroscience approach to human decision-making research, building on multivariate analysis techniques for brain imaging data to directly predict the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> outcomes and other decision-related variables from brain activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} document the prevalence of site-based management (SBM) {{as a form of}} decentralized governance in public schools. United States Government school census documents were used for the population from which 770 school districts were drawn for the sample. Superintendents from 187 school districts responded to Phase I of this investigation. Superintendents were asked if their school district used SBM, composition of site councils, selection processes of council membership, authority granted, <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions,</b> and impact on student achievement;Phase II compared different models of SBM and their impact on student achievement. Three school districts were selected with different models of SBM: superintendent-initiated SBM, school board-initiated SBM, and state-mandated SBM. Comparisons were made between the school districts in the following areas: granted authority, <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions,</b> time spent on issues, elements of functioning councils, and impact on student achievement. Comparisons were also made between parents {{and other members of the}} councils regarding the perceived impact of the different SBM models on student achievement;Statistical procedures used for this investigation were ANOVA, Scheffe, Bonferroni, and chi-tests;Fifty-four percent of the superintendents responding to this survey indicated their school district did use SBM. The superintendent-initiated SBM was the most frequent form of SBM. Authority granted to SBM councils was most frequently curriculum, followed by budget and personnel. The findings from the more detailed examination of SBM councils showed that state-mandated SBM councils spent more tune on curriculum and had a larger impact on student achievement than councils from superintendent-initiated or school board-initiated SBM;Seventy-seven percent of the superintendents of SBM governance reported SBM to have 2 ̆ 2 some 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 moderate 2 ̆ 2 impact on student achievement.

This paper explores the challenges raised for political opposition, notably challenges of a temporal kind. With its deviations from policy and procedural norms, discretionary politics tends towards a politics without rhythm, leading to major asymmetries between decisionmakers and voices of opposition. These centre on issues of timing and the ability to identify authorship and <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions.</b> Such asymmetries arguably correspond to an underlying one between the temporality of political decision-making and of contemporary finance capitalism, with agents of the former increasingly inclined to pursue ‘fast policy’ as a means to keep pace.

The main {{goal of this}} paper is to answer the question when and how it may affect <b>content</b> <b>of</b> a <b>decisions</b> based on administrative discretion. Administrative discretion is understood as a possibility of choosing legal consequences of an administrative act. Generally speaking, an analysis of the influence of fairness allows to point out two basic decisional situations. In the first situation the legal norm, which is the normative basis for discretional decision also refers to fairness as criterion that should be or must be taken into account. The scope of discretion of administrative body will depend on the type (direct or indirect) of this reference. In the second situation there is no such type of reference in the legal norm and it depends on administrative body whether it will take fairness into consideration. However, in a specific case there may be some informal recommendations of a body placed higher in the administrative hierarchy to include this criterion in decision-making process. In addition, the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> a <b>decision</b> based on administrative discretion is also affected by some other factors. Adam Szo...|$|R

Specialized courts exist, however, and commentators regularly claim that further judicial specialization is desirable or inevitable. Yet recent years have witnessed the beginning of a backlash against the increasing division of intellectual labor, such that it is appropriate to question the merits of judicial specialization. This article engages the existing literature on judicial specialization in two ways. First, by demonstrating that the question of judicial specialization is considerably more complex and contingent than is typically depicted.

Second, by drawing on research into the psychology of expertise to investigate the claim that specialized courts and judges will, by virtue of their expertise, generate better decisions than generalists. That research suggests that claims for judicial expertise are overstated, and that expertise is likely instead to result in more modest, though still potentially significant, gains in decisional efficiency. In all, the article works away from, rather than toward, confident conclusions about the wisdom of judicial specialization...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} identify factors of physicians' communication skills with patients, as related to their legal liability, and differences in doctors' communication skills with patients by the type of medical facility. Methods <b>Decisions</b> <b>of</b> {{medical malpractice}} litigation cases between 1988 and 2005 in Japan, the pivotal issue of which was a physician's explanation, were analyzed in the study. The <b>content</b> <b>of</b> each <b>decision</b> was summarized using the study variables (information about the patient, doctor, manner of the doctor's explanation, and subsequent litigation), and a database comprising the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> each <b>decision</b> (N = 100) was constructed. In order to evaluate an association between doctors' communication skills with patients and the outcome of the litigation, the analysis was performed based on the outcome of litigation or the type of medical facility. Results The ratio of acknowledged physician liability by court decision was lower in cases in which the doctor's explanation occurred before treatment or surgery (p = 0. 013). The ratio of acknowledged physician liability by court decision was higher in cases of elective or non-urgent treatment (p = 0. 046). The ratio of acknowledged physician liability by court decision was higher in clinics than in hospital groups (p = 0. 036).
