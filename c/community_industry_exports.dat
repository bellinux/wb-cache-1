40|$|The defense <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> of Korea {{has been}} {{steadily}} risen since 2006. It is attained $ 340 million, the highest export amounts ever, in 2013. As the defense <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> increase, Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) built defense <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> and import management system to assist export and to protect defense technologies. In this paper, we study factors to activate the defense <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> and import management system using Technology Acceptance Model(TAM) in compulsive usage environment. The significance {{of this study is}} as follows: First, we prove the reliability and feasibility of measurement variables in defense industry of compulsive usage environment.

40|$|Using a Melitz-type {{theoretical}} model of firm heterogeneity, {{we show that}} (i) the presence of foreign firms within an industry affects the <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> quality and (ii) the <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> quality {{is directly related to}} the <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> price. As the <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> price can be approximated by the <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> unit value, our work provides a rigorous theoretical justification for several empirical studies that use export unit value as a proxy for export quality. We then convert our {{theoretical model}}-based structural relationships into a system of equations. Using industry level panel data from China's manufacturing sector, and measuring the <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> quality by the <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> unit value, we find that an increase in foreign presence in China's manufacturing sector contributes to a significant increase in China's export quality. We also distinguish between foreign presence in China originating from the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan (HMT) and non-HMT regions. We find that foreign presence in China's manufacturing sector that originates from the HMT region leads to a much larger increase in China's export quality. The main empirical result is found to be robust with respect to alternative measures of foreign presence and aggregate demand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how environmental stringency affects pollution intensive manufacturing <b>industry</b> <b>exports.</b> Further, this study aimed to find how exports of these polluting industries take place when the exporting country belongs to a certain trading group. An augmented gravity model was estimated separately for six pollution intensive manufacturing industries using panel data of 100 countries, during the period 2000 - 2004. The estimated gravity model showed a negative relationship with environmental stringency for three polluting industries which are Industrial Chemicals, Refined Petroleum Products and Non-metallic Mineral Products, during the period and also showed that these exports are high for the countries belong to some of the trading groups. The innovative feature of this study was its focus on bilateral polluting <b>industry</b> <b>exports</b> of 100 countries, in industry wise, which has not been covered by existing studies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{correlation}} between growth in export and economic growth, {{which is called}} “Export-led Growth Hypothesis ” in the literature, is still a current issue in both the theoretical and empirical literature. In the present study, the effect of different classifications of export and import on economic growth in 22 developing countries in the 1998 – 2006 period was tested based on two models, via panel data analysis. According {{to the results of}} the first model, the analysis of which included variables such as high and low-tech manufacturing <b>industry</b> <b>exports,</b> investment and population, it was found that only two variables, high-tech manufacturing <b>industry</b> <b>export</b> and investment, have a positive and significant effect on growth. In addition to the first model which included the analysis of all variables, the second model investigated the effect of high and low-tech manufacturing industry imports on growth. The findings revealed that only high-tech manufacturing <b>industry</b> <b>export,</b> investment and low-tech manufacturing industry import have a positive and significant effect on growth...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores how credit {{distribution}} among firms {{within an}} industry affects the <b>industry’s</b> <b>export</b> intensity (export-to-sales ratio) and export propensity (the ratio between number of exporters and {{total number of}} firms). Based on heterogeneous-firm trade model, we derive two opposing hypotheses: for industries with relatively small foreign market penetration costs, more dispersed credit distribution decreases the <b>industry’s</b> <b>export</b> intensity and number of exporters; conversely, for industries with relatively high foreign market penetration costs, the dispersion of credit supply increases export intensity and number of exporters. We test the two hypotheses with Chinese firm-level data and Chinese bank loan data. The empirical results support both hypotheses and confirm significant heterogeneous impacts of credit distribution on <b>exports</b> across different <b>industries...</b>|$|R
