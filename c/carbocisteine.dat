40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the effects of a {{mucolytic}} drug, <b>carbocisteine,</b> on rhinovirus (RV) infection in the airways. Human tracheal epithelial cells were infected with a major-group RV, RV 14. RV 14 infection increased virus titres and the cytokine content of supernatants. <b>Carbocisteine</b> reduced supernatant virus titres, the amount of RV 14 RNA in cells, cell susceptibility to RV infection and supernatant cytokine concentrations, including interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 8, after RV 14 infection. <b>Carbocisteine</b> reduced the expression of mRNA encoding intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1, the receptor for the major group of RVs. It also reduced the supernatant concentration of a soluble form of ICAM- 1, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes in the cells before RV infection, and nuclear factor-kB activation by RV 14. <b>Carbocisteine</b> also reduced the supernatant virus titres of the minor group RV, RV 2, although <b>carbocisteine</b> did not reduce the expression of mRNA encoding a low density lipoprotein receptor, the receptor for RV 2. These results suggest that <b>carbocisteine</b> inhibits rhinovirus 2 infection by blocking rhinovirus RNA entry into the endosomes, and inhibits rhinovirus 14 infection by the same mechanism as well as by reducing intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 levels. <b>Carbocisteine</b> may modulate airway inflammation by reducing the production of cytokines in rhinovirus infection...|$|E
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and specific fluorimetric method {{was developed for}} the determination of <b>carbocisteine</b> and ethionamide in their dosage forms. The proposed method based on the reaction of <b>carbocisteine</b> and ethionamide with roth's reagent (o-phthaldehyde) to get a highly fluorescent isoindole product emits strong fluorescence at 431 nm and 424 nm after excitation at 329 nm and 339 nm for <b>carbocisteine</b> and ethionamide, respectively. The thiol group present in these compounds {{is responsible for the}} formation of highly fluorescent complexes of improved stability and enhanced fluorescence. The different experimental parameters affecting the intensity of the fluorescence were carefully studied and incorporated into the procedure. Under the described conditions, the method was applicable over the concentration range of 0. 05 - 0. 9 µg/mL and 0. 25 - 2. 5 µg/mL with detection limits of 5 ng/mL and 26 ng/mL for <b>carbocisteine</b> and ethionamide, respectively.

It is a common, progressive, treatable and {{preventable}} disease. The exacerbation of COPD is associated with the peripheral muscle force, forced expiratory volume in 1  second (FEV 1), the quality of life and mortality. Many studies indicated that the mucoactive medicines could reduce the exacerbations of COPD. This study summarized the efficacy of <b>carbocisteine</b> as a treatment for COPD. Methods: We searched the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) following electronic bibliographic databases: MedLine, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. We additionally searched gray literature database: OpenSIGLE. We also additionally searched the clinical trial registers: ClinicalTrials. gov register and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal. We used RCTs to assess the efficacy of the treatments. We included studies of adults (older than 18  years) with COPD. We excluded studies that were published as protocol or written in non-English language (Number 42016047078). Findings: Our findings included data from four studies involving 1, 357 patients. There was a decrease in the risk of the rate of total number of exacerbations with <b>carbocisteine</b> compared with placebo (- 0. 43; 95 % confidence interval [CI] - 0. 57, - 0. 29, P< 0. 01). <b>Carbocisteine</b> could also {{improve the quality of life}} (- 6. 29; 95 % CI - 9. 30, - 3. 27) and reduce the number of patients with at least one exacerbation (0. 86; 95 % CI 0. 78, 0. 95) compared with placebo. There was no significant difference in the FEV 1 and adverse effects and the rate of hospitalization. Interpretation: Long-term use of <b>carbocisteine</b> (500  mg TID) may be associated with lower exacerbation rates, the smaller number of patients with at least one exacerbation and higher quality of life of patients with COPD.

40|$|Introduction Oscillatory {{positive}} pressure devices {{can be used}} as adjuncts {{to improve}} sputum clearance in COPD, though the evidence base is incomplete. The attitudes of physiotherapists towards the place of these devices in the care of COPD patients is not known. In addition, their actual use in practice compared to the prescription of medications has not been studied. Methods We analysed English prescribing data, obtained from OpenPrescribing. net, for a three year period from 2013. In addition we conducted an online survey of members of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care (ACPRC) asking about awareness of devices, thresholds for treatment and device preference. Results Out of a potential 3. 2 million COPD patient years of treatment between 2013 - 2015, 422, 744 patient years of treatment with <b>carbocisteine,</b> at a cost of £ 73 million were prescribed, as well as 1. 1 million years treatment with tiotropium. In the same period only 4, 989 OPEP devices were prescribed. Given overlapping indications for OPEP devices and <b>carbocisteine</b> this disparity requires explanation. There were 116 responses to the survey (12 % response rate), 72 % in hospital practice, 28 % based in the community. There were variations in respondents’ threshold for treatment with sputum adjuncts in COPD. Asked to choose between the Acapella®, Flutter® and Positive Expiratory Pressure mask (PEP), if only one were available, preferences were 69 %, 24 % and 6 % respectively. Conclusions There is a one-hundred fold difference between use of <b>carbocisteine</b> and OPEP devices in COPD, with far fewer devices being prescribed than are included in the phenotypes that clinicians believe they are effective in. Variation in physiotherapist attitudes to treatment thresholds highlights the need for research into the effectiveness of OPEP devise in specific patient phenotypes...|$|E

40|$|Sialorrhoea is {{a common}} and {{problematic}} symptom that arises {{from a range of}} neurological conditions associated with bulbar or facial muscle dysfunction. Drooling can significantly affect quality of life due to both physical complications such as oral chapping, and psychological complications such as embarrassment and social isolation. Thicker, tenacious oral and pharyngeal secretions may result from the drying management approach to sialorrhoea. The management of sialorrhoea in neurological diseases depends on the underlying pathology and severity of symptoms. Interventions include anticholinergic drugs, salivary gland-targeted radiotherapy, salivary gland botulinum toxin and surgical approaches. The management of thick secretions involves mainly conservative measures such as pineapple juice as a lytic agent, cough assist, saline nebulisers and suctioning or mucolytic drugs like <b>carbocisteine.</b> Despite a current lack of evidence and variable practice, management of sialorrhoea should form a part of the multidisciplinary approach needed for long-term neurological conditions...|$|E
30|$|There is an unmet medical {{need for}} dealing with mucus hypersecretion, {{impaired}} mucociliary clearance and secretion retention in COPD, with a paucity of treatments that have demonstrated efficacy for these disorders. Currently available mucolytics and expectorants are of unproven efficacy in COPD, and the beneficial effects of agents such as n-acetylcysteine and <b>carbocisteine</b> are more likely related to their antioxidant effects rather than their mucolytic effects [13],[14]. Mechanical means to improve mucus clearance in hypersecretory lung conditions include Oscillatory PEP devices such as the Acapella and Flutter, chest vibration and percussion and breathing techniques. However, these have not been tested systematically in stable COPD. This post-marketing study confirms the previous regulatory study that the Lung Flute is efficacious in COPD with chronic bronchitis in improving respiratory symptoms and health status. The largest improvements were seen in symptom domains of the CCQ and SGRQ. Furthermore, it confirms the safety of this device in COPD with related adverse effects being seldom seen.|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to better understand UK-wide practice in managing sialorrhoea in motor neuron disease among specialist clinicians. We used a survey of neurologists in the UK with {{a special interest in}} motor neuron disease designed to establish clinicians' attitudes towards treatment options and resources for sialorrhoea management. Twenty-three clinicians replied, representing 21 centres. Sixteen centres were specialist MND Care Centres. Clinicians estimated seeing a total of 1391 newly diagnosed patients with MND in 2011. One hundred and ninety-three patients were described. Forty-two percent of patients reviewed in clinicians' last clinic had sialorrhoea and 46 % of those with sialorrhoea had uncontrolled symptoms. Clinicians' preferred drugs were hyoscine patches, amitriptyline, <b>carbocisteine</b> and botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin was used in 14 centres. Risk of dysphagia and staff skills were identified as the main barriers to botulinum toxin use. This survey suggests that there may be as many as 1700 patients with MND in the UK who have symptoms of sialorrhoea and that symptoms may be poorly controlled in nearly half. Treatment strategies varied, reflecting the lack of evidence based guidelines. The use of specialist treatments was influenced by local infrastructure. This study highlights the need for further work to develop evidence based guidance...|$|E
40|$|Failure {{to clear}} oral {{secretions}} can be debilitating {{for patients with}} amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the treatment of this symptom is poorly defined {{and there is no}} consensus on best practice. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the treatments that are commonly prescribed, and to describe how experienced clinicians manage a patient with treatment resistant symptoms. Twenty-three clinicians were approached, of which 19 from 16 centres across the UK provided case report forms for a total of 119 ALS patients identified as having problematic oral secretions. The use of five anticholinergics, salivary gland botulinum toxin injections, conservative management approaches and <b>carbocisteine</b> were reported. Of the 72 patients who were evaluated following the initiation of a first anticholinergic, 61 % had symptomatic improvement. Only 19 % of patients achieved symptomatic improvement with the use of an alternative anticholinergic when an initial anticholinergic achieved no symptomatic improvement. Problems with thick and thin secretions often coexisted, with 37 % of patients receiving treatment for both types of problem. In conclusion, a variety of treatment options are employed by expert clinicians for problematic oral secretions in ALS patients. The variation in management highlights the need for further prospective research in this area...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} regarding {{the quality of}} prescribing for children in primary care. Several prescribing criteria (indicators) {{have been developed to}} assess the appropriateness of prescribing in older and middle aged adults but few are relevant to children. This thesis outlines the development of a set of prescribing indicators to be applied to be applied to the Primary Care Reimbursement Database (PCRS) to determine the prevalence of potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) in children in primary care settings. Methods: Two round Delphi consensus method: A literature search was conducted to identify published indicators for children (3 ̆c 16 years). A Project Steering Group reviewed the suitability of the indicators. These criteria underwent a two round Delphi process using an expert panel consisting of general practitioners, pharmacists, paediatricians and clinical pharmacologists from the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. Using a web based questionnaire, 15 panellists were asked to indicate their level of agreement with each indicator via a five point Likert scale to assess applicability to children in the absence of clinical information. Criteria were accepted or rejected or revised based on the panel’s level of agreement using the median response/interquartile range and additional comments. The final set of indicators was applied to the PCRS database for 2014 to determine the prevalence of PIP in children. The association of PIPc and gender were examined. Costs of PIP were calculated Results: The final list consisted of 12 indicators categorized by respiratory system (n= 6), gastrointestinal system (n= 2), neurological system (n= 2) and dermatological system (n= 2). The most common commission of PIPc was the prescribing of <b>carbocisteine</b> to children (32. 7 / 1000 GMS children). The most common omission of appropriate prescribing was the failure to prescribe a spacer device at least annually for children 3 ̆c 12 years who used a pressurised metered dose inhaler (70...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A simple, {{sensitive}} and validated kinetic spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} certain mucolytic drugs namely acetylcysteine (Ac) and <b>carbocisteine</b> (Cc) is described. This method {{is based on the}} kinetic investigation of the reaction between the two cited drugs and 4 -chloro- 7 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa 1, 3 -diazole (NBD-Cl) in an alkaline medium. Spectrophotometric measurements were achieved by recording the absorbance at 424 nm at ambient temperature (250 C ± 5) for a fixed time of 30 minutes for Ac, and at 468 nm for a fixed time of 15 minutes at 70 0 C for Cc. All variables affecting the development of the reaction were investigated and optimized. The method was found to be linear over the range of 2 - 22 μg ml- 1 for Ac, and 5 - 35 μg ml- 1 for Cc with mean percentage recoveries of 99. 59 ± 0. 41 and 99. 50 ± 0. 65, respectively. Molar absorpitivity and sensitivity index were determined and found to be (1. 094 x 103 and 1. 49 x 10 - 2, respectively, for Ac, and 2. 547 x 103 and 3. 05 x 10 - 2, respectively for Cc. The validity of the method was assessed according to USP guidelines. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of the two cited drugs in bulk powder, in pharmaceutical formulations {{as well as in the}} presence of their related substances.
