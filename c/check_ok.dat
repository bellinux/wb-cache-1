As long as the pharmacist got those questions right, the patient would receive the drug therapy ordered by the patient’s practitioner. Now, though, the pharmacist and her or his patient have an additional question—one that nei-ther she or he nor the patient nor {{anybody else in the}} drug’s supply chain can really answer—namely, “Is this drug genuine? ” Now, even when the phar-macist does everything right, she or he could still dispense a counterfeit, mislabeled, foreign-made, adulterated, stolen, diverted, or otherwise haz-ardous drug because our drug supply chain is unsafe. It is unsafe because we all have allowed it t...|$|E

50|$|Not all {{calibration}} is {{an affair}} for metrology labs. A micrometer can be calibrated on-site anytime, {{at least in}} the most basic and important way (if not comprehensively), by measuring a high-grade gauge block and adjusting to match. Even gauges that are calibrated annually and within their expiration timeframe should be checked this way every month or two, if they are used daily. They usually will <b>check</b> out <b>OK</b> as needing no adjustment.|$|R
50|$|Jordan {{started to}} self medicate. On 4 April {{he took a}} double dose of medication. This made him dizzy and sick {{throughout}} the day. He was understanding when dealing with a pregnant woman who was in denial that her baby had died before her accident because he could relate. However, {{he was forced to}} abandon resus when he was unable to handle the scissors for an operation. He explained this away by pretending he was tired but lost his temper with a hypochondriac and rushed off to throw up. Zoe thought it was due to excessive drinking the previous night but Ruth was not so sure. Concerned, she visited Jordan in his office to <b>check</b> he was <b>ok.</b> He admitted there was a problem but as clinical lead he knew how to deal with it. Later, in his flat, he finally faced up to his problem and made an appointment with a neurosurgeon.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1990, the States News Service {{published}} {{a study by}} journalist Kathy Kadane which highlighted significant U.S. involvement in the killings. Kadane quoted Robert J. Martens (who worked for the U.S. embassy) as saying that senior U.S. diplomats and CIA officials provided a list of approximately 5,000 names of Communist operatives to the Indonesian Army while it was hunting down and killing members the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) and alleged sympathisers. Martens told Kadane that [...] "It really was a big help to the army. They probably killed a lot of people, and I probably {{have a lot of}} blood on my hands, but that's not all bad. There's a time when you have to strike hard at a decisive moment." [...] Kadane wrote that approval for the release of names put on the lists came from top U.S. embassy officials; Ambassador Marshall Green, deputy chief of mission Jack Lydman and political section chief Edward Masters. The accuracy of Kadane's report was challenged by those officials in a July 1990 article in The New York Times. Martens asserted that he alone compiled the list from the Indonesian communist press, that the names were [...] "available to everyone," [...] and that [...] "no one, absolutely no one, helped me compile the lists in question." [...] He admitted to providing the list of [...] "a few thousand" [...] names of PKI leaders and senior cadre (but not the party rank and file) to Indonesian [...] "non-Communist forces" [...] during the [...] "six months of chaos," [...] but denied any CIA or embassy involvement. Green called Kadane's account [...] "garbage," [...] adding that [...] "there are instances {{in the history of our}} country....where our hands are not as clean, and where we have been involved....But in this case we certainly were not". Lydman, Masters, and two other CIA officers quoted by Kadane also denied that her account had any validity. Masters stated:I certainly would not disagree with the fact that we had these lists, that we were using them to <b>check</b> off, <b>O.K.,</b> what was happening to the party. But the thing that is giving me trouble, and that is absolutely not correct, is that we gave these lists to the Indonesians and that they went out and picked up and killed them. I don't believe it. And I was in a position to know.|$|R
5000|$|A {{month later}} Robert and Aaron return from their break {{and move into}} the Mill. However, Aaron is heartbroken when Robert breaks down and confesses that he slept with Rebecca, she got {{pregnant}} as a result {{and he told her}} to have an abortion. Devastated by the betrayal Aaron removes his ring and orders Robert to leave. Alone, Aaron contemplates hurting himself again but he comes to his senses and goes to see his counsellor instead. Later that evening Aaron asks Robert {{to come back to the}} house so they can talk. They have a heartfelt discussion about everything and Aaron tells Robert he wants to forgive him. They agree to start again and Aaron assures Robert he still loves him. However, the next day Aaron and Robert are dismayed to learn that Rebecca is still pregnant.

After thinking things through, Aaron surprises Robert by saying he will support him if he wants to be a part of the baby's life though Robert is adamant he doesn't want any involvement. However, when Rebecca is rushed to the hospital with sudden stomach pains, Aaron convinces him to go to the hospital to <b>check</b> everything is <b>ok.</b> The next day, Aaron and Robert learn that Rebecca has left and Robert believes it's for the best.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} selected {{findings from}} a preliminary study {{that sought to}} assess the impacts of a radiological or nuclear emergency event on an Australian population, and their anticipated responses to such an event. The questionnaire was wide-ranging and included sections on threat perception, preparedness, use of media sources and trusted organisations, as well as socio-demographic, personal resilience and health-related data. Survey {{data were collected from}} samples of the general public living in Sydney, Australia during the period May-June 2008 using a mixed convenience sample approach (n= 324). In general, data suggest that the public is not highly concerned about terrorism involving radiological or nuclear materials and is unprepared for such an event. First Responders (Fire, Police, Ambulance) and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) were the authorities the public had most confidence in to respond to such incidents and these were also the agencies the public was most likely to trust for credible information. When respondents were prompted with a series of possible behaviours they might elicit {{in the event of a}} radiological or nuclear emergency incident, their immediate most likely responses included calling family members to <b>check</b> they are <b>OK,</b> washing off radioactive material, seeking shelter indoors, calling emergency services, covering their mouth to prevent inhalation of dust, and trying to get back home. Longer-term behaviours included having more frequent health checks. These findings suggest that there would be high demand on telecommunication services soon after such an event, and the general lack of preparedness of the public suggests that there would be a high degree of confusion and uncertainty in their responses. This emphasises the importance of timely communication and direction following such an event, preferably delivered by one of the authorities most trusted by the public. 9 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2012, Mitzeee {{starts to}} receive {{disturbing}} gifts {{due to her}} celebrity status. Neil Cooper (Tosin Cole) eventually admits to being her admirer but the strange gifts continue, leaving Mitzeee worried and paranoid. Mitzeee makes a live television debut and she accuses {{one of the guests}} of being her stalker, leading to her being dismissed. Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) is later revealed to be Mitzeee's stalker and she continues to terrorize Mitzeee. Mercedes begins to grow bored and begins to stop but when she discovers that Mitzeee and ex-boyfriend Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) are in a relationship, Mercedes targets Mitzeee once again. A frantic Mitzeee accuses everyone of laghing at her but she is told she is mad. Mitzeee returns to her flat and Mercedes arrives to <b>check</b> she is <b>ok</b> when an extremely unstable Mitzeee brandishes a large kitchen knife, accusing Mercedes of being the stalker. Shenton said of this: [...] "Mitzeee definitely has no idea that it's Mercedes - in fact, Mercedes is probably the last person that she'd suspect. She actually thinks that it's Lynsey and accuses her, because it seems to make sense." [...] Mercedes overpowers Mitzeee and knocks her unconscious before she stabs herself, making it seem that Mitzeee has stabbed her. Of the aftermath of the stabbing, Shenton said [...] "Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The next thing you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious due to the tablets and the wine. The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it." [...] Mitzeee is later arrested and held in custody.|$|R
