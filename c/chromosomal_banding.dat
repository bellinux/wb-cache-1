50|$|Centromere {{function}} {{has been}} the focus of many laboratory analyses, involving techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>banding</b> (C-banding). FISH involves the use of fluorescent probes to detect and localize specific DNA sequences on chromosomes, and centromere-specific probes can be used to measure dicentric chromosome frequencies. This technique allows for the testing of human blood samples and tissue samples, which have been historically adopted by radiation laboratories. C-banding is a staining technique that can be used to visualize dicentric chromosomes. It specifically stains constitutive heterochromatin, which are regions of the chromosome at or near the centromere.|$|E
50|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{has long}} been thought to self-pollinate {{based on the fact}} that pollinators had rarely been {{observed}} visiting the plants and because there is low variation in <b>chromosomal</b> <b>banding</b> patterns. This has been strongly challenged, as other studies have shown high pollination rates by bumblebees and very low success of self-pollination in controlled experiments, implying that they are in fact self-incompatible. Several ovules of a given individual often fail to produce seeds. One contributing factor is pollen limitation, and one study showed that open pollinated plants had 56% of their ovules produce seeds, while in hand pollinated individuals the figure was 66%. Plants with reduced exposure to pollinators were 33% to 50% less likely to produce fruits than those that were, while hand pollinated individuals showed a 100% fruit set (though these fruits did not contain a 100% seed set). Plant resources were shown to be a limiting factor in seed production: when pollen was in abundance, larger plants had a significantly greater seed to ovule ratio than smaller ones. The overall suboptimal seed to ovule ratios suggest that Trillium grandiflorum has evolved to maximize reproductive success in the face of highly stochastic pollination, where some plants may only be visited by a single pollinator in a season.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} useful {{refinement}} of the molecular karyotype of clone CL Brener, the reference clone of the Trypanosoma cruzi Genome Project. {{the assignment of}} 210 genetic markers (142 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), seven cDNAs, 32 protein-coding genes, eight sequence tagged sites (STSs), 21 repetitive sequences) to the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bands</b> separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) identified 61 chromosome-specific markers, two size-polymorphic chromosomes and seven linkage groups. Fourteen new repetitive elements were isolated in this work and mapped to the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bands.</b> We found that at least ten repetitive elements can be mapped to each <b>chromosomal</b> <b>band,</b> which may render the whole genome sequence assembly a difficult task. To construct the integrated map of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>band</b> XX, we used yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) overlapping clones {{and a variety of}} probes (i. e. known gene sequences, ESTs, STSs generated from the YAC ends). the total length covered by the YAC contig was approximately 1. 3 Mb, coveting 37 % of the entire chromosome. We found some degree of polymorphism among YACs derived from band XX These results are in agreement with data from phylogenetic analysis of T. cruzi which suggest that clone CL Brener is a hybrid genotype [Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 92 (1998) 253; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

40|$|Children with {{associated}} Wilms' tumor, aniridia, genitourinary malformations, {{and mental}} retardation (WAGR syndrome) frequently have a cytogenetically visible germ line deletion of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>band</b> 11 p 13.

We report here that in samples from five sporadic Wilms' tumors, allelic loss occurred distal to the WAGR locus on 11 p 13. In cells from one tumor, mitotic recombination occurred distal to the gamma-globin gene on 11 p 15. 5. Thus, allelic loss in sporadic Wilms' tumor cells may involve a second locus on 11 p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Chromosome banding {{is widely}} used in cytogenetics. However, the {{biological}} nature of hierarchically organized splitting of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bands</b> of human chromosomes is an enigma and has not been, as yet, studied. Results Here we present {{for the first time}} the hierarchically organized splitting of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>bands</b> in their sub-bands for all human chromosomes. To do this, array-proved multicolor banding (aMCB) probe-sets for all human chromosomes were applied to normal metaphase spreads of three different G-band levels. We confirmed for all chromosomes to be a general principle that only Giemsa-dark bands split into dark and light sub-bands, as we demonstrated previously by chromosome stretching. Thus, the biological band splitting is in > 50 % of the sub-bands different than implemented by the ISCN nomenclature suggesting also a splitting of G-light bands. Locus-specific probes exemplary confirmed the results of MCB. Conclusion Overall, the present study enables a better understanding of chromosome architecture. The observed difference of biological and ISCN band-splitting may be an explanation why mapping data from human genome project do not always fit the cytogenetic mapping. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chromosomal</b> <b>band</b> 1 p 36 {{probably}} harbours several neuroblastoma suppressor genes. A neuroblastoma {{patient has}} been described with a constitutional balanced translocation, t(1; 17) (p 36;q 12 - 21). Cytogenetically, no loss of chromosomal material was visible. The 1 p 36 translocation breakpoint could therefore have inactivated one allele of a tumour suppressor gene, thus predisposing the patient to develop neuroblastoma. We localized this breakpoint by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, analysis of yeast artificial chromosomes, and fluorescence in situ hybridization.
