50|$|I-80 enters Illinois on the Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge {{over the}} Mississippi River, {{southwest}} of Rapids City. After leaving the bridge the interstate has a folded diamond interchange with IL 84. The highway heads south, as a four-lane interstate, {{passing on the}} east side of Quad Cities. Eastbound I-80 traffic has access to an Illinois Welcome Center. The road has a <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>interchange</b> with the western terminus of I-88. After the interchange with I-88 the highway crosses over Rock River. The interstate has a diamond interchange with U.S. Route 6 (US 6), before having an interchange with I-74 in East Moline. At this interchange I-80 turns easterly paralleling US 6 and leaving the Quad Cities area. East of Quad Cities the interstate passes through rural farmland as a four-lane interstate. The road passes south of Geneseo, with the city having one interchange at IL 82. The road passes south of Atkinson, before passing over US 6 and a railroad track.|$|E
50|$|With the {{completion}} of the Toronto- Barrie Highway 400 in 1952, a new multi-lane highway emerged that would transform Barrie and Northern Ontario forever. A series of bridges and interchanges were built along the highway and every side road with an even number (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) was cut off in West Gwillimbury at Highway 400. The remaining side roads, with odd numbers, were given access either over or under the highway. Highway 88 was given a <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>interchange</b> where 8 ramps were constructed, {{which was one of the}} most expensive types of interchanges that could be built at the time. The ramps were seen as very dangerous to merge onto and off the highway as they had not been maintained or upgraded properly. As well, many accidents had occurred as the average speed on these highways has increased since the time of construction. It was one of the few cloverleaf low-standard interchanges left on Ontario's 400 series highways. As well, it was the only interchange on the original section of Highway 400 between Barrie and Toronto where there were no traffic lights servicing traffic coming off or going on the highway (with the exception of the Canal Road exit, which is an even lower-standard interchange). The government of Ontario in 2009 designated the need to rehabilitate the bridge and interchange as soon as possible due to crumbling of the bridge onto Highway 400. In 2011 the bridge was rehabilitated patching crumbling concrete and reinforcing the core structure of the bridge. The interchange was upgraded in 2011 to accommodate the growing population of Bradford West Gwillimbury. The on and off ramps were reduced from eight to four ramps to improve traffic safety. The remaining ramps were realigned to allow vehicles to travel at higher speeds when entering and exiting the highway. Traffic lights were installed on both sides of Highway 400 to help traffic safely merge on and off the highway. The removed on and off ramps were degraded and are currently overgrown and barely noticeable to passing vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The GC1 begins {{south of}} the {{downtown}} area of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the superhighway runs within the beach of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and 2 km south intersects with the GC2 and later runs with a few <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>interchanges</b> and later forms a junction with GC5 and south, the GC31. The highway runs east of Telde and has a Parclo (A8)? interchanges and an extra interchange, it passes into an area {{where most of the}} island's farmlands are located and into the subdivision and the industrial area and has another Parclo (A2/A8?) interchange, the superhighway has some interchanges to the southeast for the tourist resorts and passes through a number of tunnels before ending at the GC-200 road to the North of Puerto de Mogán.|$|R
50|$|The GC-1 {{links the}} capital with Puerto de Mogán in the south. It {{is the fastest}} route {{from the top of}} the island to the bottom and vice versa with a speed limit of 120 km/h. It is {{approximately}} 75 km in length and runs along the eastern and the southern coasts, and is also the second longest superhighway in the Canary Islands. The road provides easy access from the Airport to the major cities and resorts, which include Maspalomas and Playa del Inglés. The increase in tourism over the years has necessitated the route's upgrading and widening to cope with traffic growth. The GC-1 begins south of the downtown area of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the highway runs within the beach of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and 2 km south intersects with the GC-2 and later runs with a few <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>interchanges</b> and later forms a junction with GC-5 and south, the GC-31.|$|R
25|$|As the Interstate {{continues}} through the rural area between Wilson and Goldsboro {{it has an}} interchange with County Road 1643 (Alton Road) near mile marker 13. The highway continues north for about eight more miles before having another interchange with US301. Shortly after the US 301 interchange I-795 and US264 merge onto one highway heading west. The four lane highway runs along the southern parts of Wilson which is very rural. The joint highway has an interchange with Downing Street (exit 42) west of the Downing Village neighborhood. As it continues west it crosses over Mill branch before having an interchange with NC 42 (exit 40) south of the Planters Trail neighborhood in the very rural south west area of Wilson. The road turns to the northwest to meet I-95 just a mile to the west. Interstate 795 ends at Interstate 95 at a four <b>leaf</b> <b>clover</b> <b>interchange.</b>|$|R

40|$|In 1991, {{there has}} been a lot of concern about the <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevil in alfalfa in eastern Nebraska. Many farmers in the eastern one-third of the state {{experienced}} problems with the regrowth of alfalfa after the first cutting in 1990, caused by the feeding of the adult of this insect. This NebFact discusses the difference between the alfalfa weevil and the <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevil and to control them in the field(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} from 1990 through 1992 to determine consumption rates and feeding duration of adult <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevils, Hypera punctata (F.), {{to characterize the}} injury potential of this species during alfalfa regrowth. Adults were fed for 29 d in 1990 and 18 d in both 1991 and 1992. The mean cumulative consumption per adult was 27. 2 ± 1. 6 cm 2 and 92. 7 ± 3. 5 mg dry weight in 1991 and 24. 6 ± 0. 9 cm 2 and 87. 5 ± 2. 9 mg dry weight in 1992. The mean cumulative consumption pattern was curvilinear for both dry weight and leaf area consumption. Most consumption was within 11 d of adult eclosion. The peak consumption rate occurred ~ 5 d after adult emergence. Because the highest consumption rates and the greatest percentage of defoliation were within the first 11 d of emergence, adult <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevils potentially can delay regrowth of alfalfa stubble when adult emergence coincides with the 1 st harvest. Further, because adult consumption patterns between <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevils and alfalfa weevils are similar, alfalfa stubble defoliation thresholds developed for alfalfa weevils and cutworms {{also can be used}} for <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevils. Injury equivalents (injury by 1 species in terms of another species) are determined for adult <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevils, larval variegated cutworm, Peridroma saucia (Hubner), and larval and adult alfalfa weevils, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) ...|$|R
