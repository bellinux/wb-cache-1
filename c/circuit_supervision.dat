At the same time, there are some safe problems in coal mine production. This paper discusses the development of gas inspector supervising system based on the research of gas inspector supervising work and the management information system principle. It benefits from the call center technology, uses voice cards to develop interactive software, developed the gas inspector supervising system for coal mine. The system realized reminding of gas inspector detecting point, detecting <b>circuit</b> <b>supervision</b> and automatic recording of the report on the time and place and other functions. Practice has proved that the system improves the supervision efficiency of gas inspector, and provides effective means for safety production management of coal mine. ...|$|E

Power conditioning systems like active filters, universal power flow controllers, static compensators, and dynamic voltage restorers, among other ones, need accurate synchronization circuits capable of dealing with very different grid voltage perturbations. Voltage sags and swells, harmonics, spikes and notches, frequency variation, phase steps, DC components and noise, are phenomena that can cause severe malfunction in the control or <b>supervision</b> <b>circuits</b> of such power systems. Additionally, some protection systems are sensitive {{to some of these}} parameters and can give wrong actions when they are not expected to. The DFT algorithm is one of best performers in phasor estimation, but is not perfect. The paper accurately describes the DFT errors under frequency variation, decaying DC components and harmonics, and analyzes the instantaneous phasor estimation, with absolute and recursive algorithms. Strong grid voltage perturbations, occurring in weak grids, especially in the grid connection of renewable energies, demand for a DFT-based robust estimation method. The proposed method, as demonstrated by extensive simulations, is capable of handling general grid voltage perturbations, imposing a compromise between dynamic response and accuracy...|$|R
