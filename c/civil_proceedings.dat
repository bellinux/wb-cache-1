The Stockholm program is prepared for 5 years (the period from year 2010 until year 2015) and includes the plan of action on the unification in the sphere of <b>civil</b> legal <b>proceedings.</b> Within the Stockholm program from 2010 to 2013 in the European Union 8 regulations were adopted that regulate legal <b>proceedings</b> on <b>civil,</b> trade, family and hereditary cases. Whereas from 2000 to 2009 only 12 regulations in this field were adopted. In recent years it is possible to observe a rapid increase in the <b>civil</b> legal <b>proceedings</b> activity regulations within the EU unification. In total now in the European Union 20 regulations in the field of civil, family and trade disputes resolution were adopted, among which two are invalid.
