5|$|Climate {{change is}} the {{variation}} in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These <b>changes</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> caused by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.|$|E
5|$|NAD and NADH {{also differ}} in their fluorescence. NADH in {{solution}} has an emission peak at 460nm and a fluorescence lifetime of 0.4nanoseconds, while the oxidized form of the coenzyme does not fluoresce. The properties of the fluorescence signal changes when NADH binds to proteins, so these <b>changes</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to measure dissociation constants, which are useful {{in the study of}} enzyme kinetics. These changes in fluorescence are also used to measure changes in the redox state of living cells, through fluorescence microscopy.|$|E

5|$|The {{geomagnetic}} field changes on time scales from milliseconds {{to millions of}} years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some <b>changes</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of {{a year or more}} mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.|$|E
5|$|Styracosaurus {{is known}} from a higher {{position}} in the formation (relating specifically to its own genus) than the closely related Centrosaurus, suggesting that Styracosaurus displaced Centrosaurus as the environment changed over time and/or dimension. It {{has been suggested that}} Styracosaurus albertensis is a direct descendant of Centrosaurus (C. apertus or C. nasicornis), and that it in turn evolved directly into the slightly later species Rubeosaurus ovatus. Subtle <b>changes</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> traced in the arrangement of the horns through this lineage, leading from Rubeosaurus to Einiosaurus, to Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. However, the lineage may not be a simple, straight line, as a pachyrhinosaur-like species has been reported from the same time and place as Styracosaurus albertensis.|$|E
5|$|The favoured {{model for}} the enzymeâ€“substrate {{interaction}} is the induced fit model. This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce conformational changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding. These conformational changes also bring catalytic residues in the active site close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction. Conformational <b>changes</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> measured using circular dichroism or dual polarisation interferometry. After binding takes place, one or more mechanisms of catalysis lower {{the energy of the}} reaction's transition state by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction. Mechanisms of catalysis include catalysis by bond strain; by proximity and orientation; by active-site proton donors or acceptors; covalent catalysis and quantum tunnelling.|$|E

5|$|The first {{remodeling}} {{work on the}} Ellwood Mansion {{took place}} as the 19th century drew to a close. The changes, commissioned by Isaac Ellwood, were meant to reflect more popular architectural styles including the Georgian and Colonial Revival. Many of the building's original Gothic features were replaced with more Classical elements. On the home's exterior, some of these <b>changes</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> observed in {{the addition of the}} portico and porte-cochere. Inside the home, the dining room was enlarged with the addition of the semicircular bay on the mansion's north facade.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Rogue led developers {{to create their}} own versions of the game, though their efforts were originally limited by the lack of access to Rogues source, which was not released until BSD v4.3 in 1986. These developers resorted to building games from scratch similar to Rogue but with features that they wanted to see. These versions would be distributed with source code, and along with the original Rogue source, other developers were able to create software forks of the games, adding in new monsters, items, and gameplay features, creating several dozen variants. This process was aided by switching code to languages with better data typing, including object-oriented and scripting languages, and cleaning up and modularizing the code so that contributors can better follow where <b>changes</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> made.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These <b>changes</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E

5|$|Changes {{may affect}} {{specific}} sounds or the entire phonological system. Sound change can consist of {{the replacement of}} one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, {{the complete loss of}} the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound <b>changes</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant * became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous * in turn became /p/, and the previous * became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.|$|E
