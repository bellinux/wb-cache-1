40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{establishing}} quantification methods for binary mixtures containing a new polypropylene/polyamide 6 - based bicomponent fibre, for which a new generic fibre name has been requested to the European Commission. Application of such methods is requested by EU legislation (Directive 96 / 73 /EC) to enable market surveillance regarding the textile composition data on labels that are compulsory. The methodology for quantification of fibre mixtures is usually based either on manual separation or on chemical dissolution methods. In both cases, a sample pre-treatment, able to remove non-fibrous material, is needed. The key experimental parameters {{that need to be}} established for the novel fibre are: its moisture regain in standard atmosphere (agreed allowance), its mass loss due to pre-treatment (b coefficient) and its mass losses in the methods where it is insoluble (d correction factors). Results of this study showed that the b coefficient for the new fibre, using the normal pre-treatment, is equal to 0 %. As expected from the chemical composition and synthetic character of the novel fibre, the experimental value for the agreed allowance was low and equal to 0. 54 %. The new fibre was insoluble in ten out of the 14 dissolution methods tested and the correspondent ten d correction factors were evaluated. Three of them were also validated through a collaborative trial organised at European level following the internationally accepted guideline ISO 5725 - 2 : 1994. The d correction factors obtained throughout the study were in the range of 1. 00 - 1. 01, meaning that the fibre was completely insoluble or at maximum 1 % soluble in the dissolution reagent. Based on the results of this study, laboratories across the EU and beyond have now at their disposal methods to quantify the new fibre in binary mixtures with polyester, elastomultiester, polyamide, chlorofibres, certain acrylic and modacrylic fibres, acetate, triacetate, polylactide, certain cellulose fibres and <b>certain</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fibres.</b> JRC.

Wool, along with human hair, has a unique morphology whereby the outer layer, the cuticle, is heavily cross linked with disulphide bonds, whereas silk does not have this outer layer.

40|$|Politicians and {{planners}} in Europe and America in the 1930 s and 1940 s {{were increasingly}} {{anxious about the}} availability of wool for military requirements and actively encouraged research into substitute fibres. Innovation energised by the needs of war informed the development of processes to transform proteins normally used for food (milk, soya, corn, and fish) or perceived as waste (egg whites, chicken feathers and slaughter-house products) into fibres. This paper explores both innovative technology and conceptual models of innovation as applied to substitute fibres which were intended to result in both technical and cultural shifts. Substitute innovation was used to modify existing technology used to produce regenerated cellulosic fibres was modified to make regenerated <b>protein</b> <b>fibres.</b> Moderately successful in the unusual economic conditions of war and marketed as modernistic, patriotic and utopian <b>fibres,</b> regenerated <b>protein</b> <b>fibres</b> lost their price advantage to competing petrochemical fibres. Their physical disadvantages outweighed their benefits and they rapidly faded from popular memory and are only scantily represented in museum collections. The brief trajectory of these fibres prompted a revision of the traditional conceptualisation of innovation as developed by Usher and Schumpeter. Innovation is influenced by producers’ technological and tacit knowledge and skills and public policies. A new model of substitute innovation is proposed here to aid understanding of attitudes to the acceptability of new fibres which is relevant for the development, marketing and popular acceptance of today’s regenerated <b>protein</b> <b>fibres.</b> This paper will be illustrated with case studies of American and English fibres including Aralac, made from milk, Henry Ford’s soyabean fibre, Ardil made from peanuts and today’s milk and soyabean fibres, promoted as innovative, environmentally sensitive and health-giving...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{increased}} interest for natural dyes, started several years ago, {{on the part}} of the consumers, is just beginning to be felt. This paper concerns with the development of process for the purification of natural dyestuff extracted from an abundantly occurring plant namely Mangifera Indica Linn (Mango Tree), available almost everywhere in Myanmar. The objectives of this work are to produce the purified natural dyestuff extracted from mango bark, to study the colour of the dyed <b>protein</b> <b>fibres</b> (wool and silk yarns) by using various dyeing methods, and to study the fastness properties of the dyed sample materials. The compounds present in the mango bark and dyestuff are determined by Phytochemical tests. Optimization of dye purification condition is done by varying solvent types, solid to liquid ratio, time and temperature. Purified natural dye powder extract is then applied on <b>protein</b> <b>fibres</b> (wool and silk yarn) by using mordant with various dyeing conditions. Fastness tests on dyed samples for light, rubbing and washing fastness are carried out. The range of colour developed on dyed materials are evaluated in terms of (L*a*b*) CIELAB Coordinates and the dye absorption concentration on the textile materials is studied by using K/S values...|$|R
