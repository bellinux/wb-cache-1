30|$|Clinicians {{reported}} logistical, technical, {{and aesthetic}} considerations {{in relation to}} the QPSS as a technology. Overall, clinicians identified that the QPSS was easy to use, and most preferred it to paper-based assessments. In the hospital setting, clinicians expressed some concern regarding possible theft of tablets. However, clinicians chose to focus on ease of access and therefore tablets were not physically secured, and none were stolen during the project. For home health clinicians, portability issues (battery life, <b>charger</b> <b>cord,</b> ensuring they remembered to bring and remove the prototype from the home setting) were also a significant consideration.|$|R

30|$|Stratified {{sampling}} weights {{provided with}} the NIS database were used to calculate national estimates. The t-test {{was used to assess}} the differences in patient age, duration of hospital stay, and total hospital charges by fracture location. The t-test was also used to assess the differences in duration of hospital stay and total hospital changes by patient sex and the differences in patient age by mortality. Analysis of variation was used to assess the variance in patient age, duration of hospital stay, and total hospital <b>charges</b> by <b>cord</b> syndrome. The Chi-square test was used to assess (1) the differences in fracture location by patient sex; (2) the relationship between cord syndrome and patient sex; and (3) the differences in mortality rate by patient sex, fracture location, and cord syndrome. Simple linear regression models were used to assess the relationships among patient age, duration of hospital stay, and total hospital charges. Statistical significance was set at p <  0.05 for all analyses.|$|R

40|$|The gravity {{anomalies}} in {{the vicinity}} of the Widmerpool Gulf display a strong negative trend, which is best fitted by a third degree surface. This trend is attributed to the development of thick conglomeratic and quartzitic materials, probably of O. R. S and/or Lower Palaeozoic age. The "residual" anomaly is strongly related to variations in depth to the upper surface of the Carboniferous Limestone. Due to partial continuity of sediments along the northern boundary of the gulf, the definition of the gulf in this region is not reflected in the gravity field as strongly as that at the southern boundary. A N - S seismic reflection survey shows little relief in the reflectors and a sudden thinning of sediments towards the southern boundary. At seismic stations where depth penetration was sufficient, a strong unconformity between the "basement" rocks and the younger formations is observed on the time cross section. The seismic reflection survey combined with the gravity and magnetic data, suggests that the southern limit of the gulf is faulted probably against intrusive Caledonian rocks. Theoretical and field studies of linear <b>charges,</b> in <b>cord</b> form (Geoflex) indicate that such seismic sources have definite advantages over the single point charges. This is due to their directional properties and their superior power spectral content. The interactive technique provided by computer graphical devices facilitates the exertion of complete control on the running of programmes. Seismic and gravity programmes using this technique were developed and used in this study...|$|R
40|$|The method {{comprises}} identifying {{regions of}} component or product with higher content of fibers and/or reinforcements and {{regions of the}} component with a lower content of fibers and/or reinforcements, decomposing the component or product {{in accordance with the}} identified regions to form two fractions of the product or component having high and lower content of fibers and/or reinforcement, and recovering the fibers and/or reinforcements from the fragments having high content of fibers and/or reinforcements by selective removal of the plastic matrix of the fibers and/or reinforcements. The method comprises identifying regions of component or product with a higher content of fibers and/or reinforcements and regions of the component with a lower content of fibers and/or reinforcements, decomposing the component or product in accordance with the identified regions to form two fractions of the product or component having high and lower content of fibers and/or reinforcement, and recovering the fibers and/or reinforcements from the fragments having high content of fibers and/or reinforcements by selective removal of the plastic matrix of the fibers and/or reinforcements. The components and products comprise long and/or continuous filament in the form of fiber bundles and two and/or three-dimensional fibrous structures containing plastic-fiber composite materials. The identification step is performed by acoustic, spectroscopic, thermo graphic or inductive method. The decomposition step is carried out by a water jet cutting process, line shaped explosive <b>charges,</b> and detonating <b>cords,</b> and includes arranging the explosive charges in cavities in the product or component and activating the explosive charges. The lower content of fibers and/or reinforcements are present in an amount of 30 - 60 wt. %. The selective removal of the polymer matrix of the fibers and/or reinforcements is performed by pyrolysis, thermolysis or solvolysis. The fraction having the lower content of fiber and/or reinforcement is used as a filler or reinforcing material. The method further comprises crushing the plastic matrix of the fibers and/or reinforcements to obtain powder or granules. USE: The method is useful for recovering fibers from large-shaped, components or products of plastic composite materials, where the components or products are rotor blades and nacelles for wind turbines, ship hulls and aircraft hulls or tanks (all claimed). ADVANTAGE: The method allows economic and precise recovery of the fibers from the components or products without any health hazards using line shaped explosive <b>charges</b> and detonating <b>cords.</b> Preferred Components: The fibers includes glass fibers, carbon fibers, metal fibers, and/or aramid fibers...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogels are {{biomaterials}} used in {{the treatment}} of experimental spinal cord injury (SCI). In a model of acute SCI, we implanted hydrogels based on 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) and hydroxypropylmethacryla-mide (HPMA). One month after implantation the hydrogels bridged the cavity, adhered well to the spinal cord and created permissive environment, infiltrated with blood vessels, axons and Schwann cells. Physical modifications (e. g. surface charge) of hydrogels may improve bridging of acute SCI. We implanted hydrogels based on HEMA with a surface <b>charge</b> in spinal <b>cord</b> hemisection and compared with a hydrogel without charge. Hydrogels with surface charge improved connective tissue adhesion and growth of axons compared to a hydrogel without charge. Biodegradable hydrogels may bridge a lesion followed by complete re-sorption. In a model of acute SCI we implanted hydrogels based on the copolymer of HPMA and etoxyethylmethacrylate (EOMA) degraded from the periphery, which was substituted with new tissue after 1 month, to the center, comprising amorphous residuals of the hydrogel. Delayed hydrogel implantation may improve bridging of spinal cord le-sion. We implanted hydrogels based on HEMA acutely or in a delayed fashion (after 7 days) in spinal cord transection.

5000|$|Roeder {{had been}} a member of the anti-government Montana Freemen group. He was stopped in Topeka, Kansas, in April 1996 while {{displaying}} a placard reading [...] "Sovereign Citizen" [...] in lieu of a license plate. He had no driver's license, vehicle registration or proof of insurance. Police officers searching his car discovered explosives <b>charges,</b> a fuse <b>cord,</b> a pound of gunpowder and nine-volt batteries in the trunk. He was charged, represented by a public defender, convicted in June of all four counts and sentenced to 24 months probation. In July 1997 his probation was revoked for failure to pay taxes and provide his social security number to his employer as well as other probation violations. He was sentenced to 16 months in prison to be followed by 24 months parole supervision. He filed notice of appeal and was represented by a state-funded appellate attorney who challenged the basis of the original search that found the bomb components. The Kansas Court of Appeals overturned this conviction in March 1998, ruling that the search of Roeder's car had been illegal and remanded the case to the trial court. Roeder was released after serving eight months.|$|R
40|$|A {{prerequisite}} of a fast increasing {{market of}} the electrical vehicles is {{the access to}} charging and reliability/accessibility of the charging systems. Wireless charging i. e. <b>charging</b> without a <b>cord,</b> is an interesting alternative that has been put forward during recent years. In this work a system study of topologies for inductively coupled power transfer over an air gap oftens of centimetres has been investigated. In order to obtain an effective power transfer compensation capacitors are used to achieve resonance circuits. In the thesis four different compensation topologies for inductively coupled power transfer are examined. Expressions for the compensation capacitances and the output voltage or current are derived. An example design {{for each of the}} four topologies capable of handling a transfer of 3 kW of power over an air gap of 20 cm with an efficiency of at least 96 % is examined. These designs use an outer radius for both coils of 30 cm, and an operating frequency of 20 kHz. The efficiency only encompasses the windings, and does not take into account the efficiency of any power electronics before or after the coils. Prototype housing for the primary coil has been designed and built using basalt fibre reinforced high performance concrete, and magnetic measurements on the materials used are included in the report...|$|R
