40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{establishes}} a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> European Community <b>actions</b> {{in the field}} of water and introduces new principles of modern water manage-ment based on long-term protection of water resources. It requires from all EU Member States to protect and enhance the status of water quality of all types of waters, including coastal zone of the sea. For the purpose of the WFD implementation all water bodies must be classified into types of similar characteristics based on the physical factors. This classification scheme is called typology and forms a universal basis for all other activities within the WFD implementation such as: man-agement or monitoring. The implementation of the WFD as well as the development of a national typology are a responsibility of national authorities and are due to be operational in a few years time. As a result, every country develops or has already developed an independent typology. The WFD defines the Baltic Sea as one Ecoregion. The coastal waters have an international character but national typologies will cause interceptions at country borders and different national typolo-gies will complicate large scale comparisons across the Baltic Sea. Further, the definition of coastal waters (1 nm off the baseline) is artificial. The division between coastal waters and ope...|$|R
40|$|For {{nearly all}} infants, {{breastfeeding}} {{is the best}} source of infant nutrition and immunologic protection, and it provides remarkable health benefits to mothers as well. Babies who are breastfed {{are less likely to}} become overweight and obese. Many mothers in the United States want to breastfeed, and most try. And yet within only three months after giving birth, more than two-thirds of breastfeeding mothers have already begun using formula. By six months postpartum, more than half of mothers have given up on breastfeeding, and mothers who breastfeed one-yearolds or toddlers are a rarity in our society. October 2010 marked the 10 th anniversary of the release of the HHS Blueprint <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> on Breastfeeding, in which former Surgeon General David Satcher, M. D., Ph. D., reiterated the commitment of previous Surgeons General to support breastfeeding as a public health goal. This was the first <b>comprehensive</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> national <b>action</b> on breastfeeding. It was created through collaboration among representatives from medical, business, women's health, and advocacy groups as well as academic communities. The Blueprint provided specific <b>action</b> steps <b>for</b> the health care system, researchers, employers, and communities to better protect, promote, and support breastfeeding. I have issued this Call to Action because {{the time has come to}} set forth the important roles and responsibilities of clinicians, employers, communities, researchers, and government leaders and to urge us all to take on a commitment to enable mothers to meet their personal goals for breastfeeding. Mothers are acutely aware of and devoted to their responsibilities when it comes to feeding their children, but the responsibilities of others must be identified so that all mothers can obtain the information, help, and support they deserve when they breastfeed their infants. Identifying the support systems that are needed to help mothers meet their personal breastfeeding goals will allow them to stop feeling guilty and alone when problems with breastfeeding arise. All too often, mothers who wish to breastfeed encounter daunting challenges in moving through the health care system. Furthermore, there is often an incompatibility between employment and breastfeeding, but with help this is not impossible to overcome. Even so, because the barriers can seem insurmountable at times, many mothers stop breastfeeding. In addition, families are often unable to find the support they need in their communities to make breastfeeding work for them. From a societal perspective, many research questions related to breastfeeding remain unanswered, and for too long, breastfeeding has received insufficient national attention as a public health issue. This Call to Action describes in detail how different people and organizations can contribute to the health of mothers and their children. Rarely are we given the chance to make such a profound and lasting difference in the lives of so many. I am confident that this Call to Action will spark countless imaginative, effective, and mutually supportive endeavors that improve support for breastfeeding mothers and children in our nation.

40|$|The High-Level Meeting on Food Security for All was convened by Prime Minister Zapatero and the United Nations Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, {{in order}} to follow upon the {{commitments}} made at the High-Level Conference on World Food Security held in Rome on 3 - 5 June 2008. The purpose of the Madrid meeting was {{to take stock of}} the achievements so far and to provide a forum for discussing a new Global Partnership for Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition, which may further improve coordination of all relevant actors. The UN executive agencies, the international financial institutions, and the World Trade Organisation are already coordinating their responses within the High-Level Task Force (HLTF) on Food Security, chaired by the UN Secretary-General and coordinated by UN Under-Secretary-General Mr. David Nabarro. The purpose of the Global Partnership would be to widen and improve this coordination, by creating a platform in which governments, international agencies, civil society and the private sector could join their efforts; to strengthen and support existing initiatives; and to improve the ability for policy makers to rely on all available expertise. The HLTF is to be commended for having managed to set up a plan of action, as presented in the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> (CFA), representing the consensus view of agencies and organisations approaching the global food crisis from very different perspectives.

40|$|The drastic rise in {{food prices}} {{over the past}} couple of years has raised serious {{concerns}} about food and nutrition security across the world. While a coordinated response is urgently needed at international and regional levels, the effectiveness of country level response is critical for responding to the crisis. Coherent action is needed to help vulnerable populations cope with the hikes in their food bills, to assist developing-country farmers to swiftly respond to the opportunity posed by the rising demand for their products, and to provide information for evidence based related macro-economic policies. Since the implications of high and volatile food prices have been radically different across countries and population groups, the appropriate policy responses, as well as their scale, prioritization, and sequencing, must be developed and adapted to country-specific needs and conditions. The goal of the International Food Policy Research Institute’s “World Food Crisis” project is improved food security for the poor in developing countries in the current food crisis and increased resilience of their food systems against future crises. This project will support the draft June 2008 UN <b>comprehensive</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> on the global food crisis which focuses on meeting the immediate needs arising from the crisis as well as building resilience and contributing to longer-term global food security. The project will build a global research-based monitoring and capacity-strengthening device for successful identification and implementation of the appropriate policy actions in response to the food crisis. All of these actions come together at the country level, where the ownership and final accountability for implementation rests. As a central component of the project, this open access policy information portal has been established to provide comprehensive and detailed information country-by-country on food policy developments. We note that currently a lot of information is being collected in an un-coordinated fashion by different international and regional organizations. This portal is designed to pool such information in structured ways and check for data quality and relevance. The portal will contain relevant food crisis response information initially on its 20 partner countries (mostly in Sub-Sahara Africa, but also in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean) and shall be expanded beyond these pre-selected countries in the context of the project. The portal also includes a research-based capacity-strengthening “tool box” that will be developed to guide country responses. Where needed, advice on urgently needed policy actions will also be facilitated. Knowledge productNon-PRIFPRI 1 MTI...|$|E

40|$|Low-income, food-deficit {{countries}} have become especially {{concerned about the}} global and national food situation {{over the past three}} years. While the proximate cause of this heightened concern was the surge in food prices that began in 2006 and peaked in mid- 2008, concerns remain for other reasons, among them the higher market-clearing price levels that now seem to prevail, continuing price volatility, and the risk of intermittent food shortages occurring repeatedly far into the future. For lower-income Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries, ongoing contributing factors include persistently low productivity, difficulty adapting to climate change, financial difficulties (inability to handle the burden of high food or fuel prices or a credit squeeze), and increased dependence on food aid. Yet there is an additional, often-forgotten factor that exacerbates food insecurity: postharvest losses (PHL). They can and do occur all along the chain from farm to fork, which reduces real income for all consumers. This especially affects the poor, as such a high percentage of their disposable income is devoted to staple foods. Interest in the reduction of PHL is not new. After the mid- 1970 s food crisis, considerable development investment went into PHL reduction for staple crops. In fact, in 1975, the United Nations brought postharvest storage losses into international focus when it declared that “further reduction of postharvest food losses in developing countries should be undertaken as a matter of priority” (FAO 1981). Unfortunately, once real commodity prices resumed their historical downward trend, the policy shifted to emphasize food security through economic liberalization and trade. The world seems to have forgotten the importance of postharvest food losses in the African grain sector, and those networks or programs that sought to reduce them, such as FAO’s Prevention of Food Losses Program and the Global Postharvest Forum (PhAction), have fallen into abeyance. The low adoption of the PHL technologies promoted in various SSA countries has also led to the declining investments in this area. With renewed emphasis on agriculture, and {{in the aftermath of the}} recent food and financial crises, the profile of PHL has been significantly raised. Interventions in PHL reduction are seen as an important element of the efforts of many agencies to reduce food insecurity in SSA. PHL is increasingly recognized as part of an integrated approach to realizing agriculture’s full potential to meet the world’s increasing food and energy needs. Therefore, reducing PHL—along with making more effective uses of today’s crops, improving productivity on existing farmland, and sustainably bringing additional acreage into production— is critical to facing the challenge of feeding an increased world population. Postharvest losses feature prominently in recent global initiatives such as the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> issued in 2009 by the UN High-Level Task Force for Food Security and Nutrition after the global food crisis, the Global Agricultural and Food Security Program endorsed by the World Bank in January 2010, and the recently reformed Committee on World Food Security (CFS). It is clearly recognized that the context of agricultural production and marketing in SSA has evolved since the 1970 s and 1980 s, as have the challenges associated with PHL reduction. Changes have included (i) increasing competition from international markets in the wake of market liberalization; (ii) the state’s withdrawal from grain marketing activities that provided the commercial sector with variable technical support in grain handling and storage; (iii) development of more sophisticated grain value chains coordinated by an emerging private sector; (iv) increased regional integration, which has resulted in the easier movement of grain but with limited monitoring of quality; (v) impacts of HIV/AIDS and urbanization on labor availability; (vi) spread of the larger grain borer, a devastating storage pest; (vii) introduction of varieties with high yield that require inputs and are more susceptible to pest attack; (viii) increasing land fragmentation, with a corresponding decrease of farm size, accompanied by declining soil fertility; (ix) erratic weather patterns that have led to recurrent failures in harvests and consequent food shortages; and (x) the erosion of postharvest expertise to serve the needs of developing country producers and supply chains. Limited success in reducing PHL and a shrinking technical capacity to respond to the challenges of PHL reduction highlight the need to build up a knowledge base of lessons to raise the profile of PHL and to provide best practices and practical recommendations for scaling up. Consequently, the World Bank undertook this policy-oriented research of the current state of knowledge and technology related to PHL reduction. It did so in collaboration with FAO, with the expertise of the U. K. Natural Resources Institute, and with contributions of key PHL stakeholders and institutions, capturing lessons from past interventions that could provide insights for the implementation of effective PHL strategies. This analysis looks at the evolution of public and private sector responses over the last two decades to reduce losses along the various stages of the supply chains and supports and to build on the African Development Bank’s current Post Harvest Loss Initiative for SSA. It also highlights critical factors that determine technology uptake and sustainable use, with a focus on gender dimensions of technology adoption for reducing PHL. The main findings of this research are discussed in the following pages...|$|E
