Herein, we have successfully prepared a conductive textile via electroless deposition onto <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles</b> by using a three-step treatment process. The <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles</b> are first dipped in P 4 VP-SU 8 solution to form a uniform layer for the subsequent absorption of silver ions. Then, the <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles</b> are immersed in silver nitrate solution {{in preparation for the}} next step electroless deposition. The sheet resistance can be as low as 0. 05 Ωsq- 1. Two sensors were made based on the copper coated <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles.</b> One is flexible pressure sensor, the other is ECG sensor. Both sensors performed well, proving this method is a promising candidate for applications in the fabrication of functional textile-based wearable devices...|$|R

25|$|Up {{until the}} 19th century, India was the world's leading <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> manufacturer, with Bengal and Mysore {{the centers of}} cotton production. In order to compete with India, Britain {{invested}} in labour-saving technical progress for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, while implementing protectionist policies such as bans and tariffs to restrict Indian imports. At the same time, the British East India Company's rule in India contributed to its deindustrialization, with the decline of native industry opening up a new market for British goods. British colonization forced open the large Indian market to British goods while restricting Indian imports to Britain, and raw cotton was imported from India without taxes or tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton and sold {{them back to the}} Indian market. India thus served as both an important supplier of raw goods such as cotton to British factories and a large captive market for British manufactured goods. In addition, the capital amassed from Bengal following its conquest after the Battle of Plassey in 1757 was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth. Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> manufacturer in the 19th century. British colonial rule has been blamed for the subsequently dismal state of British India's economy, with investment in Indian industries limited since it was a colony.|$|E

25|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, there was {{significant}} demand for products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, {{as well as}} goods such as spices, peppers, indigo, silks, and saltpeter (for use in munitions).

From the late 17th century to the early 18th century, Mughal India accounted for 95% of British imports from Asia, and the Bengal Subah province alone accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia. In contrast, {{there was very little}} demand for European goods in Mughal India, which was largely self-sufficient. Indian goods, especially those from Bengal, were also exported in large quantities to other Asian markets, such as Indonesia and Japan.

40|$|Common <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles</b> are {{hydrophilic}} and oleophilic in nature. Superhydrophobic <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles</b> {{have the}} potential to be used as self-cleaning fabrics, but they typically are not super oil-repellent. Poor oil repellency may easily compromise the self-cleaning property of these fabrics. Here, we report on the prepn. of superoleophobic <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles</b> based on a multilength-scale structure, as demonstrated by a high hexadecane contact angle (153 Deg for 5 micro L droplets) and low roll-off angle (9 Deg for 20 micro L droplets). The multilength-scale roughness was based on the woven structure, with addnl. two layers of silica particles (microparticles and nanoparticles, resp.) covalently bonded to the fiber. Superoleophobicity was successfully obtained by incorporating perfluoroalkyl groups onto the surface of the modified cotton. It proved to be essential to add the nanoparticle layer in achieving superoleophobicity, esp. in terms of low roll-off angles for hexadecane. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R

25|$|The overall {{benefits}} of NAFTA have been quantified by several economists, whose {{findings have been}} reported in several publications like the World Bank's Lessons from NAFTA for LA and the Caribbean, NAFTA's Impact on North America, and NAFTA revisited by the Institute for International Economics. They assess that NAFTA has been positive for Mexico, whose poverty rates have fallen, and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the 1994–1995 Economic Crisis. Nonetheless, they also state that it has not been enough, or fast enough, to produce an economic convergence nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth. Beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in Mexico gained open access to the American market, promoting exports to the United States. The value of Mexican cotton and apparel exports to the U.S. grew from $3billion in 1995 to $8.4billion in 2002, a record high of $9.4billion in 2000. At the same time, the share of Mexico’s <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> market the U.S. has increased from 8 percent in 1995 to 13 percent in 2002.
