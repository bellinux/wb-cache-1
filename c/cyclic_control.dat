5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H also {{features}} a synchronized elevator on the tail boom, which {{is linked to the}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> and allows a wider center of gravity range. The standard fuel system consists of five interconnected fuel tanks, three of which are mounted behind the transmission and two of which are under the cabin floor. The landing gear consists of two arched cross tubes joining the skid tubes. The skids have replaceable sacrificial skid shoes to prevent wear of the skid tubes themselves. Skis and inflatable floats may be fitted.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} composites. Its 23.00 ft diameter two-bladed rotor employs an ATI 012 (VR-7 mod) airfoil at the blade root, transitioning to an ATI 008 (VR-7 mod) airfoil at the tip.

2500|$|The final {{variant of}} the VS-300 was powered by a 150hp Franklin engine. The VS-300 {{was one of the}} first {{helicopters}} capable of carrying cargo. [...] The VS-300 was modified over a two-year period, including removal of the two vertical tail rotors, until 1941, when a new <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> system gave it much improved flight behavior.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> {{was found}} to be {{difficult}} to perfect, and led to Sikorsky locking the cyclic and adding two smaller vertical-axis lifting rotors to either side aft of the tailboom. By varying pitch of these rotors simultaneously, fore and aft control was provided. [...] Roll control was provided by differential pitching of the blades. [...] In this configuration, {{it was found that the}} VS-300 could not fly forward easily and Sikorsky joked about turning the pilot's seat around.|$|E
50|$|A {{helicopter}} {{has four}} flight control inputs. These are the cyclic, the collective, the anti-torque pedals, and the throttle. The <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> is usually located between the pilot's legs and is commonly called the cyclic stick or just cyclic. On most helicopters, the cyclic {{is similar to}} a joystick. However, the Robinson R22 and Robinson R44 have a unique teetering bar <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> system and a few helicopters have a <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> that descends into the cockpit from overhead.|$|E

50|$|To {{control the}} {{collective}} {{pitch of the}} main rotor blades, the entire swashplate must be moved up or down along its axis without changing {{the orientation of the}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls.</b> Conventionally, the entire swashplate is moved along the mainshaft by a separate actuator. However, some newer model helicopters remove this mechanically complex separation of functionalities by using three interdependent actuators that can each move the entire swashplate. This is called cyclic/collective pitch mixing.|$|R
50|$|Flight {{controls}} allow {{pilots to}} control the collective (or throttle, on fixed pitch helicopters), the <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls</b> (pitch and roll), and the tail rotor (yaw). Controlling these in unison enables the helicopter to perform the same maneuvers as full-sized helicopters, such as hovering and backwards flight, and many that full-sized helicopters cannot, such as inverted flight (where collective pitch control provides negative blade pitch to hold heli up inverted, and pitch/yaw controls must be reversed by pilot).|$|R
50|$|This {{condition}} is recognizable when {{coming to a}} hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a nose-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive rearward displacement of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. In this condition, the pilot could rapidly run out of rearward <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> as the helicopter consumes fuel. The pilot may also find it impossible to decelerate sufficiently to bring the helicopter to a stop. In the event of engine failure and the resulting autorotation, the pilot may not have enough <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> to flare properly for the landing.|$|E
50|$|In all cases, {{the pilot}} may {{compensate}} the induced roll with {{left or right}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> input (as determined by {{the rotation of the}} rotor) up to a degree.

50|$|The {{swash plate}} is two {{concentric}} disks or plates. One plate rotates with the mast, connected by idle links, {{while the other}} does not rotate. The rotating plate is also connected to the individual blades through pitch links and pitch horns. The non-rotating plate is connected to links that are manipulated by pilot controls—specifically, the collective and <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls.</b> The swash plate can shift vertically and tilt. Through shifting and tilting, the non-rotating plate controls the rotating plate, which in turn controls the individual blade pitch.|$|R
50|$|An aft CG {{condition}} can {{be recognized}} by the pilot when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a tail-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive forward displacement of <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. If there is a wind, the pilot needs even greater forward cyclic. If flight is continued in this condition, the pilot may find it impossible to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to inadequate forward cyclic authority to maintain a nose-low attitude. In addition, with an extreme aft CG, gusty or rough air could accelerate the helicopter to a speed faster than that produced with full forward <b>cyclic</b> <b>control.</b> In this case, dissymmetry of lift and blade flapping could cause the rotor disc to tilt aft. With full forward <b>cyclic</b> <b>control</b> already applied, the rotor disc {{might not be able}} to be lowered, resulting in possible loss of control, or the rotor blades striking the tail boom.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s the Aeroflightdynamics Directorate at the Ames Research Center has been {{conducting}} tests on isolated hingeless rotors in hover and forward flight. The primary objective is to generate a database on aeroelastic stability in trimmed flight for torsionally soft rotors at realistic tip speeds. The rotor test model has four soft inplane blades of NACA 0012 airfoil section with low torsional stiffness. The collective pitch and shaft tilt are set prior to each test run, and then the rotor is trimmed in the following sense: the longitudinal and lateral <b>cyclic</b> pitch <b>controls</b> are adjusted through a swashplate to minimize the 1 /rev flapping moment at the 12 percent radial station. In hover, the database comprises lag regressive-mode damping with pitch variations. In forward flight the database comprises <b>cyclic</b> pitch <b>controls,</b> root flap moment and lag regressive-mode damping with advance ratio, shaft angle and pitch variations. This report presents the predictions and their correlation with the database. A modal analysis is used, in which nonrotating modes in flap bending, lag bending and torsion are computed from the measured blade mass and stiffness distributions. The airfoil aerodynamics {{is represented by the}} ONERA dynamic stall models of lift, drag and pitching moment, and the wake dynamics is represented by a state-space wake model. The trim analysis of finding, the <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls</b> and the corresponding, periodic responses is based on periodic shooting with damped Newton iteration; the Floquet transition matrix (FTM) comes out as a byproduct. The stabillty analysis of finding the frequencies and damping levels is based on the eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis of the FTM.

A major finding is that dynamic wake dramatically improves the correlation for the lateral <b>cyclic</b> pitch <b>control.</b> Overall, the correlation is fairly good...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{continuum}} mechanics-based viscodamage (VD) constitutive {{relationship is}} proposed to model fatigue damage of asphalt concrete. The {{form for the}} evolution of the viscodamage function is postulated based on the damage density which was determined from uniaxial constant strain rate tests that were performed at different strain rates. The proposed viscodamage model is coupled with Schapery’s nonlinear viscoelastic (VE), Perzyna’s viscoplastic (VP), and micro-damage healing (H) models to simulate the nonlinear mechanical response of asphalt concrete during fatigue. Numerical algorithms are implemented in the finite element code Abaqus via the user material subroutine UMAT. The proposed model is validated against extensive experimental data including constant strain rate, <b>cyclic</b> displacement <b>controlled,</b> and <b>cyclic</b> stress <b>controlled</b> tests over a range of temperatures, strain rates, loading frequencies, and stress/strain levels/amplitudes. The model predictions show that the VE–VP–VD–H model is capable of predicting the fatigue damage response of asphalt concrete subjected to different loading conditions. The results demonstrate that micro-damage healing occurs not only during the rest period, but also during the <b>cyclic</b> strain <b>controlled</b> tests {{even in the absence of}} the resting time...|$|R

However [...] "pitch links" [...] on the blades transmit the pitch information way ahead of the blade's actual position, giving the blades time to [...] "fly up" [...] or [...] "fly down" [...] to reach the desired position. That is, to tilt the helicopter forward, the difference of lift around the blades should be maximum along the left-right plane, creating a torque that, due to the gyroscopic effect, will tilt the rotor disc forward and not sideways.|$|R

40|$|A heavily {{instrumented}} 1 : 5 scaled {{model of}} the ERICA tilt-wing configuration has been tested in the DNW-LLF wind tunnel {{as part of the}} EU co-funded NICETRIP project. Tests were made for a variety of conditions ranging from pure helicopter and conversion corridor cases up to a low speed aircraft mode, with appropriate changes in tilt rotor and outer wing pitching angles. In total over 400 test conditions were measured. Rotor forces and moments have been measured with rotor balances. Blade bending moment and torsion as well as rotor shaft bending and torque were measured with calibrated strain gauge sensors. Measurements were made for fully trimmed and for non-trimmed conditions. The four bladed rotors are counter-rotating, are rigid in plane and allow <b>cyclic</b> blade pitch <b>control</b> through a remote controlled swash plate. Since <b>cyclic</b> pitch <b>control</b> caused damage to the blade pitch bearings, most of the test conditions had to be done without <b>cyclic</b> blade pitch <b>control,</b> leading to a large in-plane moment in the rotor plane and high bending moments in the rotor shaft. Some test cases were both measured with and without <b>cyclic</b> pitch <b>control.</b> The present paper analysis the rotor induced forces, moments and nacelle vibrations for the trimmed conditions. Both steady and dynamic contents of the signals are analyzed. It is found that with <b>cyclic</b> blade pitch <b>control</b> the time mean rotor in-plane forces and moments and the 1 /rev rotor shaft and blade bending moments are effectively suppressed, but the dynamic components of the rotor in-plane forces and moments become larger than without <b>cyclic</b> blade pitch <b>control.</b> Without <b>cyclic</b> blade pitch <b>control</b> the 1 /rev blade and rotor shaft bending moments become quite large and, rather surprisingly, for some of these test conditions also a large 2 /rev blade bending moment is observed. Careful analysis of the data suggests that the 2 /rev flap bending is caused by a 1 /rev excitation (in the non-rotating system) of both nacelles, caused by the proximity of the nominal rotor rpm frequency to symmetric and anti-symmetric nacelle torsion eigen-frequency and probably also in combination with other nacelle related eigen-modes. The measured data are well suited to validate or verify existing semi-empirical or CFD methods to predict the steady and unsteady loads of the rotors. A correlation between rotor dynamics and (outer) wing dynamic loading and the influence of the outer wing and/or flaperon setting on the rotor forces and moments is left for future anal-ysis.
