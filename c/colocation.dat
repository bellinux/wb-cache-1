But for these constructions, three of which were monumental, and the Angels, the sculptor received a smaller compensation than Cairano did for his Apostles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In many {{application}} domains, {{occurrences of}} related spatial features may exhibit co-location pattern. For example, some disease {{may be in}} spatial proximity of certain type of pollution. This paper studies the problem of regional co-locations with arbitrary shapes. Regional <b>colocations</b> represent regions in which two spatial features exhibit stronger or weaker co-location than that in other regions. Finding regional <b>colocations</b> of arbitrary shapes is very challenging because: (1) statistical frameworks for mining regional co-location do not exist; and (2) testing all possible arbitrary shaped regions is computational prohibitive even for very small dataset. In this paper, we propose frequentist and Bayesian frameworks for mining regional co-locations and develop a probabilistic expansion heuristic to find arbitrary shaped regions. Experimental results on synthetic and real world data show that both frequentist method and Bayesian statistical approach can recover the region with arbitrary shapes. Our approaches outperform baseline algorithms in terms of F measure. Bayesian statistical approach is approximately three orders of magnitude faster than the frequentist approach. ...|$|R

The author administered two tests: one was a depth of vocabulary knowledge test and the other was a reading test. 67 Kanji compounds from the text of the reading test were selected as items for the depth of vocabulary knowledge test and the knowledge of definitions, synonyms, <b>colocations,</b> and pronunciation was examined. 75 Chinese JFL learners who had studied for 1 to 3 years at university in China participated in this experiment. All subjects had been learning Japanese as their major. The results of the analysis show that subjects who attained a high mark on the depth of vocabulary knowledge test attained a high score on the reading test as well. Furthermore, correlation of the reading test score and 4 items of the depth of vocabulary knowledge (definitions, synonyms, <b>colocations,</b> and pronunciation) was analyzed. The result showed that the knowledge of synonyms contributed to the text comprehension for the high proficiency group. In the low proficiency group, on the other hand, there was no particular item which was related to text comprehension. This result shows that Chinese learners are able to use their Kanji knowledge for Japanese text comprehnsion, however Kanji knowledge is not sufficient for deeper understanding...|$|R

Communication is the medium through which team members share the information required for successful amalgamation. In this work, we postulate that both high {{and low levels of}} team communication can impede team performance, thus leading to a curvilinear relationship between team performance and team communication. To test this hypothesis, the relationships between face-to-face, e-mail, and telephone communication and team performance were examined for 60 cross-functional project teams. E-mail and face-to-face communication were curvilinearly associated with performance, but telephone communication was not.

First, we review evidence indicating that actions using a tool can modulate unilateral visual neglect and extinction, where patients {{are unaware of}} stimuli presented {{on one side of}} space. We show that, at least for some patients, modulation comes about through a combination of visual and motor cueing of attention to the affected side (Experiment 1). Subsequently, we review evidence that action-relations between stimuli reduce visual extinction; there is less extinction when stimuli fall in the correct <b>colocations</b> for action relative to when they fall in the incorrect relations for action and relative to when stimuli are just associatively related. Finally, we demonstrate that action relations between stimuli can also influence the binding of objects to space, in a patient with Balint's syndrome (Experiment 2).

In contrast, the ability to localize the objects was affected by whether the objects were in familiar as opposed to unfamiliar locations with respect to one another. Action relations between objects facilitate joint attention to both objects but do not facilitate binding to location. Familiar spatial relations facilitate spatial binding, but do not cue joint attention to the stimuli. Effects of action relation on attention and localization can be dissociated from effects of semantic relationship and familiarity of spatial location on attention and localization...|$|R

Despite being weighted by the popularity of a venue, values in the top quartile of unconnected pairs (na) are relatively high with respect to other link types. However, in terms of median values {{there is still a}} distinction between the different levels of multiplexity which each link type represents. On the other hand, while distance (Figure  4 (D)) does not vary much in terms of median values for the different link types, based on the top quartiles of the distributions across link types, it appears that Foursquare only pairs (fo) are more likely to frequent locations close to each other, closely followed by multiplex link pairs (tf) where distances for both are below 20  km. Twitter only (to) and unconnected pairs frequent locations similarly further away. This indicates that both Foursquare spatial features are better at distinguishing multiplex links and native Foursquare links than other link types based on the distributions observed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Kernel {{moisture}} at {{harvest is}} an important trait since a low value is required to prevent unexpected early germination and ensure seed preservation. It is also well known that early germination occurs in viviparous mutants, which are impaired in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. To provide {{some insight into the}} genetic determinism of kernel desiccation in maize, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected for traits related to kernel moisture and ABA content in both embryo and endosperm during kernel desiccation. In parallel, the expression and mapping of genes involved in kernel desiccation and ABA biosynthesis, were examined to detect candidate genes. Results The use of an intermated recombinant inbred line population allowed for precise QTL mapping. For 29 traits examined in an unreplicated time course trial of days after pollination, a total of 78 QTLs were detected, 43 being related to kernel desiccation, 15 to kernel weight and 20 to ABA content. Multi QTL models explained 35 to 50 % of the phenotypic variation for traits related to water status, indicating a large genetic control amenable to breeding. Ten of the 20 loci controlling ABA content colocated with previously detected QTLs controlling water status and ABA content in water stressed leaves. Mapping of candidate genes associated with kernel desiccation and ABA biosynthesis revealed several <b>colocations</b> between genes with putative functions and QTLs. Parallel investigation via RT-PCR experiments showed that the expression patterns of the ABA-responsive Rab 17 and Rab 28 genes as well as the late embryogenesis abundant Emb 5 and aquaporin genes were related to desiccation rate and parental allele effect. Database searches led to the identification and mapping of two zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) and five novel 9 -cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) related genes, both gene families being involved in ABA biosynthesis. The expression of these genes appeared independent in the embryo and endosperm and not correlated with ABA content in either tissue. Conclusions A high resolution QTL map for kernel desiccation and ABA content in embryo and endosperm showed several precise <b>colocations</b> between desiccation and ABA traits. Five new members of the maize NCED gene family and another maize ZEP gene were identified and mapped. Among all the identified candidates, aquaporins and members of the Responsive to ABA gene family appeared better candidates than NCEDs and ZEPs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Fresh {{fruit and}} {{vegetables}} are {{a major source of}} ascorbic acid (vitamin C), an important antioxidant for the human diet and also for plants. Ascorbic acid content in fruit exhibits a quantitative inheritance. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for ascorbic acid content have been mapped in three tomato populations derived from crosses between cultivated tomato varieties (Solanum lycopersicum accessions) and three related wild species or subspecies. The first population consists of a set of introgression lines derived from Solanum pennellii, each containing a unique fragment of the wild species genome. The second population is an advanced backcross population derived from a cross between a cultivated tomato and a Solanum habrochaites (formerly Lycopersicum hirsutum) accession. The third population is a recombinant inbred line population derived from the cross between a cherry tomato line and a large fruited line. Common regions controlling ascorbic acid content have been identified on chromosomes 2, 8, 9, 10, and 12. In general, the wild alleles increased ascorbic acid content, but some improvement could also be provided by S. lycopersicum. Most QTLs appeared relatively stable over years and in different environments. Mapping of candidate genes involved in the metabolism of ascorbic acid has revealed a few <b>colocations</b> between genes and QTLs, notably {{in the case of a}} monodehydroascorbate reductase gene and a QTL present in two of the populations on chromosome 9 (bin 9 -D), and a previously mapped GDP-mannose epimerase and a QTL on chromosome 9 (bin 9 -J) ...|$|R

Unlike previous work [12, 18, 19], we frame the multilayer link prediction problem across online social network platforms and apply media multiplexity {{as a measure of}} tie strength, showing its applicability to link prediction in the geo-social domain. We find that pairs of users with links on both Twitter and Foursquare exhibit significantly higher interactions on both social networks than those pairs of users with a link on just one or the other in terms of number of mentions and <b>colocations</b> within the same venues, as well as a lower distance and higher number of common hashtags in their tweets. In our evaluation, we use these interaction features to predict Twitter links from Foursquare features and vice versa, and we achieve this with AUC scores up to 0.86 on the different datasets, which is just as good as predicting links internal to the network on Twitter and almost as good for Foursquare (AUC= 0.86 for Twitter and AUC= 0.88 for Foursquare). In predicting links which span both networks, we achieve the highest AUC score of 0.88 from our multilayer features set which is higher than results for each single network, suggesting that multilayer frameworks can be a useful tool for social bootstrapping and friend recommendations due their comprehensive perspective on the online social ‘ecosystem’.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{reconstruct}} the image of the role of the city and bourgeoisie in the seventeenth century, settled in the Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz. The lexemes naming the city appear in the definitions of the various terms of space, they serve its scratching. The reader, however, must complement a spatial arrangement drawn up by the storyteller. Imaging the city is followed by the exploitation of key words, which name the elements of the architecture of the city. The lexemes specifying the residents of the city, their activities and competitions appear sporadically. Quite often H. Sienkiewicz exploits anthropomorphisation efforts and metonymy, applied to the conceptual category of the city, which allows to talk about the features and social functions of the middle class. The lexicon associated with the city shows that, seen from the perspective of a noble, is a symbol of a self-sufficient residence that fills many needs of a noble: it provides money, soldiers, goods, serves as a refuge in times of war or bad weather, can resist the invaders. A noble point of view of the narrator is also expressed in attention to a defensive function of the city and the brave or cowardly attitudes of townspeople. A full overview of the lexical resource serving the definition of the city and the bourgeoisie reveals, in addition to standard and repetitive efforts also non-standard ones, breaking stereotypes, heterogeneous and difficult to classify.  It is manifested in the exis by a large group of <b>colocations,</b> which occur at a time. Language creation of the middle class is on the one hand firmly schematic, and surprisingly unique on the other hand.

The GMI design for on-orbit calibration includes warm load and cold sky design features that mitigate many of the radiometric calibration issues observed on historical microwave radiometers. The GPM spacecraft was launched on February 27, 2014. During the first year of on-orbit operations, calibration and validation activities demonstrated the accuracy and stability of the GMI calibration. The GMI radiometer was designed, built, and tested by Ball Aerospace 2 ̆ 6 Technologies Corp. After launch, on-orbit data were processed and analyzed to determine the performance of key radiometric parameters. Extensive calibration and validation of the lower frequency channels (36 GHz and below) showed that the instrument meets radiometric performance requirements, offering stable, accurate brightness temperatures for use in the retrieval of geophysical products. This paper evaluates the calibration performance of the high frequency channels at 89 GHz and above.
