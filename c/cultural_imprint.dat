2500|$|It is not {{impossible}} the fort at Uqair {{could be the}} result of the Portuguese domination of the Persian Gulf, which began in 1506 with the expedition of Afonso de Albuquerque.

(From the Trucial States to the United Arab Emirates, Frauke Heard-Bay, p. 271).

As implied by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear cognitive bias, in that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human common sense.

Rather, the categories it introduces are thought of as cognitive artifacts, which are ultimately depending on human perception, <b>cultural</b> <b>imprints</b> and social conventions. In this sense, they intend to be just descriptive (vs prescriptive) notions, that assist in making already formed conceptualizations explicit.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{controversial}} aspects to Gârbea's public notoriety, involving reactions against academic verdicts, and objecting to the {{close relationship between}} Gârbea and mainstream cultural forums such as the USR. The implications of positive appraisals by these venues were debated by literary critic Bogdan Creţu, who argued that Nicolae Manolescu tended to overrate authors in his proximity, while being dismissive of Vişniec's contribution to drama (which Manolescu had claimed lacked originality). Critic Dan C. Mihăilescu criticized in particular Manolescu's [...] "caprices", suggesting that, in a 2008 synthesis of Romanian literary history, his older colleague had assigned Gârbea's entry undeserved space, more than to a better known novelist like Gib Mihăescu. Also according to Mihăilescu, Cărtărescu may have had his rival Gârbea in mind when reproaching Manolescu that he had insisted on writers who were not at all worthy of recognition. Nicolae Oprea saw Gârbea as apparently [...] "uninhibited" [...] in matters of literary discourse, but critically noted that the poet was also preoccupied, [...] "to the point of obsession", with his own <b>cultural</b> <b>imprint</b> (citing as proof the fact that, in its original version, Creşterea iguanelor de casă features the English-language versions of five poems, translated by Gârbea's own hand). A highly critical voice is that of Bianca Burţa-Cernat. She suggests that, in adopting all forms of writing, Gârbea displays [...] "an implausible self-certainty". She polemically connects the critical appreciation with {{his status as a}} [...] "good colleague" [...] and [...] "devoted shadow" [...] of other writers, noting that Gârbea's notoriety is ensured by a promotional system with [...] "all the stakes" [...] and [...] "all the pulleys", as well as by [...] "the argument of prolificity", but that these attributes also surpass his actual value.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} a loose-knit genre of mystery thrillers produced every year between 1966 and 1996, defined as neo-noir movies. Whereas much {{work has been}} published on classic film noirs, produced between 1940 and 1958, little criticism {{has been written about}} the newer films. The first chapter provides a theoretical analysis and critique of the general history of film genre and noir study and is followed by three chapters that read specific neo-noir films from a cultural perspective. Black thrillers reveal key aspects of neo-noir, and issues of black masculinity, female beauty, and race relations are all emphasized in these movies. White mystery thrillers compare well with classic film noirs and examine issues of masculinity, social class, and viewing practices since post-classic Hollywood production and reception. White female noirs are examined in terms of gender differences, female roles in traditionally male parts, and in the idea of women as professional crime fighters or criminals. Together, these four chapters reveal that neo-noir films study black signatures, feminine ecritures, and fresh <b>cultural</b> <b>imprints</b> on neo-noirs. The final chapter argues the need to teach neo-noir by delineating recent theories of postmodern pedagogy and providing a syllabus from a sample course. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{explore the}} tension between {{different}} intellectual traditions concerning the relationship between nature and modernity as they are manifested {{in the work of}} postwar German artists Joseph Beuys and Gerhard Richter. I show that they represent contrasting intellectual and aesthetic traditions. For Beuys, nature holds innate meanings capable of guiding human thought and action, whereas for Richter, nature is simply a screen onto which we project our own <b>cultural</b> <b>imprints.</b> I conclude that these differing perspectives help to elucidate contemporary intellectual concerns over the relationship between nature-based ideologies and the ecological critique of modernity. By extending our understanding of “social nature ” to the cultural arena, we can discern new ways of exploring relations between society and nature.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{identify}} conceptual metaphors in two genetically distinct languages, namely Iranian Persian and British English, analyze their domains and attempt to detect possible cultural impacts on their construction. Although there are a good number of studies on the relationship between metaphor and culture in some languages, there appears to be a limited number of comparative studies on different languages with culturally distinct contexts and their metaphors. In an attempt to investigate the <b>cultural</b> <b>imprints</b> on metaphor, this thesis has a special focus on metaphors applied in two Persian and English short stories. ‘Roast Goose’ by M. A. Jamalzadeh and ‘The Luncheon’ by W. S. Maugham are two well-known near contemporary short stories, which are subject to our study. The two emotions of anxiety and greed, as the most dominant subjects of metaphorical expressions in these stories, are identified following MIP (Metaphor Identification Procedure) and the concepts involved in the construction of their underlying conceptual metaphors will be analyzed based on Kövecses’s (2010 a) method. The thesis presents a conceptual approach within a cognitive linguistic perspective to pinpoint metaphors and the stories behind them in these two literal texts. ...|$|R
40|$|The Bronze Age of Scandinavia (1750 - 500 BC) is {{characterized}} by the sudden appearance of bronze objects in Scandinavia, the sudden mass appearance of amber in Mycenaean graves, and the beginning of bedrock carvings of huge ships. We take this to indicate that people from the east Mediterranean arrived to Sweden on big ships over the Atlantic, carrying bronze objects from the south, which they traded for amber occurring in SE Sweden in the Ravlunda-Vitemölla–Kivik area. Those visitors left strong <b>cultural</b> <b>imprints</b> as recorded by pictures and objects found in SE Sweden. This seems to indicate that the visits had grown to the establishment of a trading centre. The Bronze Age of Österlen (the SE part of Sweden) is also characterized by a strong Sun cult recorded by stone monuments built to record the annual motions of the Sun, and rock carvings that exhibit strict alignments to the annual motions of the Sun.
