25|$|Composition {{alone does}} not allow to {{generate}} a nullary function from the corresponding unary <b>constant</b> <b>function,</b> this is the technical reason why nullary functions are excluded from clones in Post's classification. If we lift the restriction, we get more clones. Namely, each clone C in Post's lattice which contains at least one <b>constant</b> <b>function</b> corresponds to two clones under the less restrictive definition: C, and C together with all nullary functions whose unary versions are in C.|$|E

50|$|<b>Constant</b> <b>functions</b> {{have zero}} mean oscillation, {{therefore}} functions differing for a constant c > 0 can {{share the same}} BMO norm value even if their difference is not zero almost everywhere. Therefore, the function ||u||BMO is properly a norm on quotient space of BMO functions modulo the space of <b>constant</b> <b>functions</b> on the domain considered.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, the Dirac delta function, {{although}} not a function, is a finite Borel measure. Its Fourier transform is a <b>constant</b> <b>function</b> (whose specific value depends upon {{the form of the}} Fourier transform used).|$|E
25|$|While we {{have not}} shown the Venn {{diagrams}} for the constants 0 and 1, they are trivial, being respectively a white box and a dark box, neither one containing a circle. However we could put a circle for x in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, x, which returns the same value independently of x, called a <b>constant</b> <b>function.</b> As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; {{the difference is that}} a constant takes no arguments, called a zeroary or nullary operation, while a <b>constant</b> <b>function</b> takes one argument, which it ignores, and is a unary operation.|$|E
25|$|Fix a monoid M. The set of all {{functions}} from a given set to M {{is also a}} monoid. The {{identity element}} is a <b>constant</b> <b>function</b> mapping any value to the identity of M; the associative operation is defined pointwise.|$|E
25|$|The {{overshoot}} and undershoot can {{be understood}} thus: kernels are generally normalized to have integral 1, so they result in a mapping of <b>constant</b> <b>functions</b> to <b>constant</b> <b>functions</b> – otherwise they have gain. The value of a convolution at a point is a linear combination of the input signal, with coefficients (weights) {{the values of the}} kernel.|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} denoising piecewise <b>constant</b> <b>functions</b> by using both an adapted moving average and Haar wavelet shrinkage. The piecewise <b>constant</b> <b>functions</b> are contaminated with Poisson-like noise and are measurements of perceived itch by human subjects in an experiment to relate perceived itch to bloodflow in response to histamine iontophoresis. We show that the translation-invariant wavelet transform with universal wavelet shrinkage provides a fast and automatic method for producing good estimates of the underlying perceived itch and that the method is superior to the adapted moving average and standard wavelet shrinkage. The article then looks in more detail at the noise structure of the signals and highlights some new wavelet techniques that might be useful. 1 Introduction This article {{addresses the}} problem of denoising piecewise <b>constant</b> <b>functions.</b> The piecewise <b>constant</b> <b>functions</b> {{in this article are}} recorded signals where the signal level registers a subjec [...] ...|$|R

25|$|By {{definition}} of a function, {{the image of an}} element x of the domain is always a single element y of the codomain. However, the preimage of a singleton set (a set with exactly one element) may in general contain any number of elements. For example, if f(x) = 7 (the <b>constant</b> <b>function</b> taking value 7), then the preimage of {5} is the empty set but the preimage of {7} is the entire domain. It is customary to write f−1(b) instead of f−1({b}), i.e.|$|E
25|$|Otherwise, if a {{feasible}} solution {{exists and}} if the (linear) objective function is bounded, then the optimum value is always attained on the boundary of optimal level-set, by the maximum principle for convex functions (alternatively, by the minimum principle for concave functions): Recall that linear functions are both convex and concave. However, some problems have distinct optimal solutions: For example, the problem of finding a feasible solution {{to a system of}} linear inequalities is a linear programming problem in which the objective function is the zero function (that is, the <b>constant</b> <b>function</b> taking the value zero everywhere): For this feasibility problem with the zero-function for its objective-function, if there are two distinct solutions, then every convex combination of the solutions is a solution.|$|E

25|$|Deep {{water in}} lakes {{and the ocean}} can provide {{pressure}} without requiring high-pressure vessels or drilling into salt caverns or aquifers. The air goes into inexpensive, flexible containers such as plastic bags below in deep lakes or off sea coasts with steep drop-offs. Obstacles include {{the limited number of}} suitable locations and the need for high-pressure pipelines between the surface and the containers. Since the containers would be very inexpensive, the need for great pressure (and great depth) may not be as important. A key benefit of systems built on this concept is that charge and discharge pressures are a <b>constant</b> <b>function</b> of depth. Carnot inefficiencies can thereby be reduced in the power plant. Carnot efficiency can be increased by using multiple charge and discharge stages and using inexpensive heat sources and sinks such as cold water from rivers or hot water from solar ponds. Ideally, the system must be very clever—for example, by cooling air before pumping on summer days. It must be engineered to avoid inefficiency, such as wasteful pressure changes caused by inadequate piping diameter.|$|E
