5|$|In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones {{to conduct}} an {{excavation}} at Linford, a gravel pit {{near the village of}} Mucking on the Thames Estuary. The site had been discovered in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. These initial investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by gravel extraction, prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory excavation. Jones quickly concluded that the <b>crop</b> <b>marks</b> at Mucking represented an extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On that basis, the Ministry extended her contract and initiated a full excavation of the site.|$|E

25|$|Before Word 2010 (Word 14) for Windows, {{the program}} was unable to {{correctly}} handle ligatures defined in TrueType fonts. Those ligature glyphs with Unicode codepoints may be inserted manually, but are not recognized by Word for what they are, breaking spell checking, while custom ligatures present in the font are not accessible at all. Since Word 2010, the program now has advanced typesetting features which can be enabled: OpenType ligatures, kerning, and hyphenation. Other layout deficiencies of Word include the inability to set <b>crop</b> <b>marks</b> or thin spaces. Various third-party workaround utilities have been developed.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to receiving compensation, farmers whose land {{was used to}} build the structures were paid after the war to fill in ditches and trenches and to demolish pillboxes. Today, hardly anything remains of the anti-tank ditches, {{but at the time}} they must have been the most conspicuous of all the fortifications. A few remain, much humbled, as field drains or field boundaries, whereas others can be seen only as <b>crop</b> <b>marks.</b> In the case of pillboxes, the sum of £5 is sometimes mentioned to pay for demolition, but the challenge of demolishing such structures is considerable and it seems that most farmers pocketed the cash, treating it as compensation.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1980s, the state-appointed Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments {{commissioned}} an investigation into the Rollright Stones and their immediate surroundings [...] "in order that a fully integrated policy for the future preservation and management of the complex might be formulated." [...] This investigation took place between 1981 and 1982, and involved both archaeologists and historical researchers. As a part of the initial survey, historians undertook documentary research, examining the reports and accounts of the site that had been produced since the 17th century, with particular emphasis on antiquarian and early archaeological drawings. Aerial photographs of the area were looked at for signs of prehistoric <b>crop</b> <b>marks,</b> whilst both a geophysical survey and a fieldwalk of the area were undertaken.|$|E
2500|$|The {{site was}} on the [...] gravel terrace, close to the north bank of the Thames, and was owned by Surridge Disposals Ltd. There {{were a number of}} other Saxon {{settlements}} in the vicinity - see list of archaeological sites in Thurrock. The site was discovered as a result of aerial photographs showing cropmarks and soil marks. The earliest photographs to reveal the site were taken by the Luftwaffe in 1943. However, these were not readily available to archaeologists. The importance of the site was recognised following photographs taken by Dr JK St. Joseph of Cambridge University on 16 June 1959, although these photos were not published until 1964. The tenant farmer (T Lindsey) remarked that <b>crop</b> <b>marks</b> for archaeologists were his best crop. Following publication of the crop mark photos, DG Macleod of Prittlewell Museum and DA Whickham, Chief Librarian for Thurrock realized the site was threatened by gravel extraction and instigated the scheduling of the site under the Ancient Monuments Act.|$|E

40|$|The {{region of}} Tadjenanet- Chelghoum Laid {{is located in}} the upper valley of Oued Rhumel.

40|$|A small hilltop {{enclosure}} at Carrog, Llanbadrig, Anglesey, {{that had}} been identified from a <b>crop</b> <b>mark</b> on an aerial photograph was investigated by geophysical survey and subsequently evaluated by excavation. The enclosure was interpreted on typological grounds as a possible Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age defended site. The enclosure ditch was substantial, {{but there was no}} trace remaining of any accompanying bank. Within the enclosure were numerous post-holes and pits. Some of the latter proved to be hearths of Early Neolithic date and these have produced radiocarbon dates in the fourth millennium cal BC. The post-holes appeared to belong to structures from occupation of the enclosure, and dates from these and from the ditch showed that it was probably constructed about 800 cal BC and occupied until about 400 cal BC confirming the original interpretation. Late in its existence the ditch had been partially backfilled and a small building constructed within it, radiocarbon-dated to the eighth–ninth century cal AD...|$|R
50|$|In 1986, {{the first}} systematic, multi-disciplinary {{excavations}} of an Indus Valley city were begun by the Harappa Archaeological Project (HARP), {{under the direction}} of George F.

To the north, a hollowed belt containing green <b>crops</b> <b>marks</b> an old bed of the River Ravi, which today flows six miles (10 km) further north between the citadel and the riverbed, Mound F contains much of the town planning; to the south of the citadel lie the outlying hills, the Harappan cemetery and the post Harappan cemetery. To the southeast, sporadic digging has been carried out in Area G, but the ragged Mound E and its surroundings are unexplored. Most of the site remains unexcavated. The earliest deposits on the site go back to 5300 B.C. and the area seems to have been continuously inhabited ever since.|$|R
