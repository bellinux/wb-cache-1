5|$|The Drexler–Smalley {{debate on}} {{molecular}} nanotechnology {{was a public}} dispute between K. Eric Drexler, the originator of the <b>conceptual</b> <b>basis</b> of molecular nanotechnology, and Richard Smalley, a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for {{the discovery of the}} nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.|$|E

Interest in a one-state solution is growing, however, as the two-state approach fails to accomplish a final agreement.|$|E

That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A lot of people have hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit me up, and said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E

2500|$|According to Heinz Katsching, expert {{committees}} {{have combined}} phenomenological criteria in variable ways into categories of mental disorders, repeatedly defined and redefined {{over the last}} half century. The diagnostic categories are termed [...] "disorders" [...] and yet, despite not being validated by biological criteria as most medical diseases are, are framed as medical diseases identified by medical diagnoses. He describes them as top-down classification systems similar to the botanic classifications of plants in the 17th and 18th centuries, when experts decided a priori which visible aspects of plants were relevant. Katsching notes that while psychopathological phenomena are certainly observed and experienced, the <b>conceptual</b> <b>basis</b> of psychiatric diagnostic categories is questioned from various ideological perspectives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mathematical}} {{theory is}} {{not dependent on}} such physical ideas on a technical level, but there are examples of mutual influence (see for example Mark Kac's question Can you hear {{the shape of a}} drum?). Hilbert's adoption of the term [...] "spectrum" [...] has been attributed to an 1897 paper of Wilhelm Wirtinger on Hill differential equation (by Jean Dieudonné), and it was taken up by his students during {{the first decade of the}} twentieth century, among them Erhard Schmidt and Hermann Weyl. The <b>conceptual</b> <b>basis</b> for Hilbert space was developed from Hilbert's ideas by Erhard Schmidt and Frigyes Riesz. [...] It was almost twenty years later, when quantum mechanics was formulated in terms of the Schrödinger equation, that the connection was made to atomic spectra; a connection with the mathematical physics of vibration had been suspected before, as remarked by Henri Poincaré, but rejected for simple quantitative reasons, absent an explanation of the Balmer series. The later discovery in quantum mechanics that spectral theory could explain features of atomic spectra was therefore fortuitous, rather than being an object of Hilbert's spectral theory.|$|E
2500|$|NFC {{has been}} found to be {{strongly}} associated with a number of independently developed constructs, specifically epistemic curiosity, typical intellectual engagement, and openness to ideas. Epistemic curiosity can be defined as ‘‘desire for knowledge that motivates individuals to learn new ideas, eliminate information-gaps, and solve intellectual problems". Typical intellectual engagement was proposed by Goff and Ackerman (1992) and was defined as a [...] "personality construct that represents an individual’s aversion or attraction to tasks that are intellectually taxing". Openness to ideas is a facet of openness to experience associated with [...] "aspects of being open minded, engaging in unconventional thoughts, and solving problems and thinking as an end in itself". Based on the very large positive correlation between NFC and [...] typical intellectual engagement (r = [...]78) it has been argued that they may be essentially the same construct. Further studies have found that NFC, [...] typical intellectual engagement, epistemic curiosity, and openness to ideas were all strongly intercorrelated. Factor analysis showed that measures of all four constructs loaded strongly onto a single factor suggesting they all share a common <b>conceptual</b> <b>basis.</b> The author of this study argued that although the four constructs lack discriminant validity they are not necessarily all conceptually equivalent as each one may emphasise particular aspects of functioning more than others. A study comparing need for cognition and openness to ideas using confirmatory factor analysis found that although the two constructs were very strongly related they were not redundant. NFC and openness to ideas had somewhat contrasting correlation patterns with other personality traits. For example, NFC was more strongly correlated with emotional stability and activity than openness to ideas, whereas openness to ideas was more strongly correlated with novelty and experience seeking than NFC.|$|E

The many-body physics of inelastic final state channels as described by optical and multiple scattering theories is properly included by incorporating a full complex optical potential. Explicit nonrelativistic and relativistic momentum-space calculations quantitatively demonstrate the importance of such a treatment of final state interactions for both the transverse and longitudinal response. Nonrelativistic calculations are performed using final state interactions based on phenomenology, local density models and microscopic multiple scattering theory.
