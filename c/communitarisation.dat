40|$|Since {{the entry}} into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam in May 1999, asylum and {{immigration}} policies have fallen within the competence of the European Union. When {{the countries of the}} European Union signed the Charter of Fundamental Rights, one wonders which values Europe intended to defend concretely and what importance it placed on the protection of refugees. The <b>communitarisation</b> of the right of asylum has caused many concerns because, until now, the process of European harmonisation has focused on erecting a “fortress”, which has led to the erosion of the protection granted to refugees. However, by emancipating the contention on the rights of asylum seekers at national level, particularly close to election dates, <b>communitarisation</b> constitutes a single chance to break with the security-conscious Schengen years and to develop a generous policy based on the humanitarian principles that have formed the basis of European integration...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{resident}} third-country nationals in the European Union are {{no longer}} invisible. The <b>Communitarisation</b> of migration-related matters by the Amsterdam Treaty has opened up possibilities {{for the development of}} a comprehensive, legally binding and less restrictive framework as regards long-term resident third-country nationals. The Commission"s recently proposed directive aims at harmonising national laws governing the acquisition and scope of long-term resident status and granting long-term resident third-country nationals free movement rights within the Union. Although the grant of European denizenship is a welcome development, it should be seen as a first step towards equal membership and full political inclusion...|$|E
40|$|Situated as the {{cornerstone}} of the Common European Asylum System, the EU’s Dublin system functions as the legal mechanism for determining Member State responsibility for the processing of asylum claims. Controversial from inception, it has been subject to extensive criticism that speaks not only to the distributional inequalities that it produces among the Member States, but also to its potentially detrimental impact on the human rights of asylum seekers. Despite these problems, however, the core features of the system as originally agreed in the 1990 Dublin Convention have remained remarkably resilient over the course of two reforms – one in 2003, and one in 2013. At the same time, the EU’s governance landscape as it pertains to asylum policy-making has undergone a marked transformation. While Dublin I was the product of intergovernmentalism, both Dublin II and Dublin III were negotiated as part of the EU acquis communitaire, the former following the partial <b>communitarisation</b> of asylum policy-making and the latter following its full <b>communitarisation.</b> Though the specific changes to the institutional features of policymaking that this transition has entailed have been both theoretically expected and empirically proven to {{have a positive effect on}} EU policy output, the overall stability of the Dublin system in the face of these changes leaves it unclear as to what extent the ‘promise of communitarisation’ has been delivered in this particular case. How then do we explain the perseverance of a system that has not only failed to provide adequate standards of protection to those seeking it within EU borders, but which has also continually disadvantaged some of the very Member States party to its terms? And what impact, if any, has the <b>communitarisation</b> of asylum policy-making had on the attempts at its reform? This research traces the evolution of the Dublin system from its initial formation through to its current state, by analysing the negotiations that produced each of the three Dublin agreements in order to explain both the system’s emergence and its on-going stability. Using a rational choice institutionalist framework, it finds that the Dublin system’s endurance can ultimately be credited to the deliberate choices that have been made by both the Member States and the EU’s supranational institutions in pursuit of their preferences (bolstered or weakened by their relative strength of position) in the context of the (either empowering or constraining) institutional settings within which the reform negotiations took place...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the growing {{importance}} of the cooperation for development in the European Union and the appearance of a common growing public opinion agreement supporting this kind of initiatives, it is necessary to understand if we can talk today about a true common European consensus. Still covered on intergovernmental level and considered {{to be a part of}} the national foreign policies, EU development aid is still far from reaching the maximum of its efficiency. In this paper we try to introduce a new evaluation method of the cooperation for development policies and interpretation of the degree of <b>communitarisation</b> of the national policies that will enable us to appreciate the stages that have to be completed by the member countries but also by the EU to realize a completely uniform European assistance strategy and of the activities, so necessary for raising the efficiency of the funds allocated by the EU, but also in the perspective of achieving the Millennium Development Goals...|$|E
40|$|The {{initiative}} {{to introduce a}} single constitutional basis and more democratic control {{in this area is}} a welcome development. However, it may be observed here that the structural shift from the intergovernmental pillar to the Community method has not been accompanied by a re-examination of the issue of immigration and a reflection on the dialectic of inclusion and exclusion which sets apart EU nationals/Union citizens from non-EU migrants. In this paper, I argue that <b>Communitarisation</b> will enable the Union to expand its so far modest acquis in migration-related issues (section 1), but is has also opened the way for the installation of exclusive categories and the security paradigm which characterized the third pillar within the system of Community law (section 2). The implications of this for the Union itself, the state and its evolving security agenda, and for the shape of European immigration and asylum policy in Amsterdam Europe will be considered in section 3...|$|E
40|$|European Union {{citizenship}}, {{as a form}} {{of citizenship}} beyond the nation state, entails the promise of the formation of a heterogeneous and democratic European public, empowering citizens and ethnic residents. Notwithstanding this promise, the 1996 intergovernmental conference that culminated in the Treaty of Amsterdam (signed on 2 October 1997) did not extend the personal scope of Union citizenship to include long?term resident third country nationals. Other substantive reforms, however, such as the inclusion of an anti?discrimination clause, the institutionalisation of the right to information, the strengthening of democratic accountability and the enhanced respect for human rights, all improve the rights of citizens, and ethnic migrant residents and members of other disadvantaged groups generally. The partial <b>communitarisation</b> of the third pillar has furnished the basis for a Community immigration and asylum policy that is subject to increasing democratic and judicial control. However, it has also opened the way for the installation of exclusionary categories and the ‘security’ narrative on immigration control, which has largely characterised the third pillar within the system of Community law...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{seeks to}} explain the {{emergence}} of the EU’s international investment policy since the 1980 s. Building on theories of European Integration, it tests two ex ante hypotheses. Hypothesis H 1 builds on supranational thinking and stipulates that the Commission acted as policy entrepreneur and pushed for the <b>communitarisation</b> of international investment policy-making. Hypothesis H 2 builds on liberal intergovernmental thinking and stipulates that European business successfully lobbied the Member States for a <b>communitarisation</b> of international investment policy-making in order to ensure access to competitive state-of-the-art international investment agreements. To assess the validity of these hypotheses, the thesis traces throughout history and examines policy-making instances, which decisively shaped the EU’s de facto and legal competences in international investment policy since the 1980 s. It examines the EU’s involvement in investment-related negotiations during the Uruguay Round, on the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) and on Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with Mexico and Chile. It, moreover, analyses EU-internal debates on the EU’s legal competences in international investment regulation in the context of intergovernmental conferences on Treaty revisions and legal proceedings before the European Court of Justice. The joined analysis of international and EU-internal negotiations suggests that supranational thinking and Commission entrepreneurship best describe the integration process leading to {{the emergence of the}} EU’s international investment policy. The Commission acted as resourceful policy entrepreneur and used agenda setting, invoked the evolving trade agenda, fringe, implied and de facto competences, strategically used different international negotiating fora and legal review in order to consolidate the EU’s role in international investment policy. Functional and power considerations fuelled the Commission’s policy entrepreneurship. European business, on the other hand, was hardly informed, organised and interested in international investment policy-making. It did not seek to influence European or national policy-makers. The Member States, finally, occasionally favoured cooperating in certain international negotiating fora in order to maximise their bargaining power and to reach for the best possible deals with third countries. More often, however, they sought to contain the EU’s involvement and competences in international investment policy. The thesis makes an important empirical contribution to our knowledge of EU foreign economic policy. It is the first study to comprehensively document and {{to explain the}} EU’s role in the global investment regime. It, moreover, contributes to the long-standing debate between supranational and intergovernmental accounts of European Integration. It challenges mainstream assumptions on the role of business in the international investment regime and global political economy and finally contributes to historical institutionalist research on endogenous agency-driven institutional change...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. The AFSJ as {{a special}} {{challenge}} for enlargement. With the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May 1999 the development of EU policies in JHA {{was transformed into a}} fundamental treaty objective, Article 2 TEU providing for the maintenance and the development of the European Union as an "area of freedom, security and justice" (AFSJ). This new integration objective was at the same time strengthened by the introduction of a range of new policy objectives, the <b>communitarisation</b> asylum, immigration and other issues of the former "Third Pillar", the incorporation of the Schengen acquis, new and more appropriate legal instruments and improved judicial control. This, and the results of the Tampere European Council of October 1999, led to a further expansion of the scope of policy-making in justice and home affairs, with dozens of new legislative acts being adopted, a considerable number of new legislative initiatives and even the establishment of new bodies – such as the prosecution agency Eurojust and the European Police College. There is no other example in the history of EC/EU integration process of an area of previous loose intergovernmental cooperation only having made its way so quickly {{to the top of the}} Union’s political and legislative agenda...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} {{the role of the}} European Parliament (EP) in the recent reforms of the EU’s {{economic}} governance. It shows that, despite the post-Lisbon <b>communitarisation</b> of the EMU policy-making, the impact of the EP was limited. Based on original interview data and a wealth of primary and secondary sources, it reveals that the EP was only able to produce limited ‘first-order changes’ (i. e., adjustments to the details of the policy regime), whereas it had almost no influence on the goals and instruments of the EMU. The paper argues that the limited influence of the EP {{can be explained by the}} dominant role member states (still) play in the EMU. They defined the ‘policy core’ of economic and budgetary policies (in terms of sound public finances and low inflation) before the upgrade of the EP’s powers with the Lisbon treaty, and using several strategies they defended it successfully in the post-Lisbon context. The paper reviews the key policies adopted by the EU to tackle the crisis – from the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact to legislation on the Banking Union – and identifies five strategies through which the Council (often in tandem with the Commission) successfully managed to curb the influence of the EP...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{lessons to be learned}} from the Greek crisis is that large scale {{supranational}} <b>communitarisation</b> is a danger for democracy if mutual obligations between members undermine substantially the possibilities of political choice for the single member states. I argue that a well-balanced relation between (self-) responsibility, solidarity, performance incentives and democracy involves taking subsidiarity serious, as well as to admit a certain amount of institutional flexibility. This flexibility is demanded {{especially in the case of}} large scale communities which include countries as members, like the EU, and in which the basic ideas of social, economical and financial policy are rather heterogeneous. Democracy, responsibility and solidarity must be in a well balanced relation for any community to function and to be generally acceptable to the citizens. This includes the defence of rather ambitious forms of civil participation and sovereignty of the people against the paternalistic pretensions of experts or of political and cultural elites. And responsibility ―as a basic condition for democracy― requires that the design of the contractual basis of the EU must make possible that voting communities really assume responsibility for their decisions, which includes bearing possible negative consequences of these decision on themselves. Preserving a certain leeway for differing decisions about economical, financial or social questions is necessary for giving democratic substance to the demand of the primacy of politics. This puts serious limits to ambitions for treaty-based supranational communitisations...|$|E

40|$|Defence date: 10 December 2007 Examining board: Prof. Adrienne Héritier (EUI, Florence) (Supervisor); Prof. Frank Schimmelfennig (ETH, Zürich); Prof. Andy Smith (IEP, Bordeaux); Prof. Helen Wallace (EUI/RSCAS, Florence) This project investigates a {{ubiquitous}} yet under-studied {{phenomenon in}} national, European and global politics: delegated preparation, {{defined as those}} negotiations through which civil servants or experts "pre-cook" political choice in multi-level decision-processes. While examples are legion-reaching from legislative drafting in national ministries to the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) in the European Union (EU) - the project focuses on preparation in complex international negotiations, and chooses EU Intergovernmental Conferences (IGCs) as empirical case. Claiming that a look beyond {{the tip of the}} "decision-iceberg" will gain us deeper insights into how and by whom Europe has been constitutionalised, I tackle two wider questions: 1) What is preparation and what can it do? and 2) Under what conditions will preparation be effective? Linked to an understanding of international negotiation as a "thick" social process, I argue, first, that the key to preparatory effectiveness lies in a particular set of collective resources as a necessary condition, and in consensual preagreement as both necessary and sufficient. Second, with effective pre-decision-making thus hinging upon successful delegated arguing, a set of scope conditions favourable to persuasion are singled out. These include 1) a familiar, iterative and insulated social context as a pre-condition for the non-distortive use of arguments; 2) an issue's complexity as facilitating the resonance of expertise and novel ideas; and 3) a macronorm's constitutional-systemic nature as favouring factual arguments linked to the international system. The hypotheses are tested on the "Group of Government Representatives" (GoR), with units of observation chosen from the Amsterdam and Nice IGCs according to variation of issue complexity and constitutional-systemic nature. Process-tracing of five issues: the <b>communitarisation</b> of free movement, the integration of Schengen and the institutionalisation of flexibility (Amsterdam), as well as Commission reform and Council votes (Nice) confirms that delegated preparation plays a key role even in the "bastion of high politics" that is EU reform. Yet, empirical evidence shows that persuasion is less prominent than expected, and uncovers alternative mechanisms behind effective preparation,in particular accommodation, depoliticisation and systemic compensation...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{transposition}} of the Conventions adopted by the Member States of the Community in private international into internal Community measures.   Article 65 of the EC Treaty as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam allowed the Community to adopt general measures in private international law for the first time.   This competence {{has been used by}} the Community to adopt the Brussels I Regulation on jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, the insolvency Regulation, the service of documents Regulation, evidence Regulation and the Brussels II and Brussels II bis Regulations on jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility.   All these measures have in common, apart from the Evidence Regulation, {{the fact that they were}} adopted first as Community conventions.   The thesis aims to analyse the various issues arising out of the transposition of these Conventions into Community Regulations. The Brussels I Convention, which was originally adopted under Article 293 (4) (ex 220 (4)) EC Treaty, is the main focus of the thesis.   This Convention was the only successful Convention adopted under this Treaty basis and it was adopted by the Member States in 1968.   Because it has been in force for such a long time, it is possible to analyse the Convention negotiation and amendment process, to examine European Court of Justice’s approach to Community conventions and to compare the effectiveness of the convention process of adopting internal Community measures. In relation to the Community Regulations, the main question to be explored is: whether these instruments fulfil the purposes set out in the Treaty.   Article 65 EC allows the Community to adopt private international law measures that are “necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market”.   By looking at the substantive provisions adopted, other international instruments in the field, and other legislative options open to the Community an assessment will be made of whether the purposes of the Treaty were achieved in the best possible manner by adopting these instruments. Finally, the relationship of the Community with the Hague Conference on Private International Law is analysed.   The Hague Conference is a prestigious international organisation with specialty and expertise in private international law.   The effects, if any, that the <b>communitarisation</b> of private international law will have for the working of the Conference, and the position of the Member States in the Conference, will be examined.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} the question how foreign policy fits within the constitutional {{structure of the}} European Union. It does so by analysing, in the particular field of foreign policy, certain key constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques that are fundamental to the legal organisation of the Union. The study {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part examines {{the way in which the}} principles of conferral and primacy, as well as the Community method operate within Community external relations, as compared to their operation with respect to internal Community policies (for instance, exclusivity as the typical expression of the primacy principle in the field of external relations). The second part draws a further contrast between these concepts, principles, and legal techniques as they apply in relation to the common foreign and security policy and their operation under Community external relations. The subject of the third part are constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques, which, in practice, have been found to have a more significant part to play in Union foreign policy than in its internal policies, in particular the principle of consistency, or which have developed specifically in the field of external relations, in particular the technique of mixity. Essentially, therefore, this is a study of the extent to which foreign policy is legally sui generis within the sui generis constitutional order of the European Union, and of how the common foreign and security policy is in turn sui generis within the foreign policy structure of the Union. It is not of course suggested that the constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques that are here analysed are the only significant ones in the constitutional organisation of the Union, just that they are particularly suited to illustrate the sui generis character of the legal arrangements that govern the conduct of EU foreign policy. The present study provides both an analysis of the constitutional reality of EU foreign policy and theoretical reflections at a critical distance, which suggest possibilities for reform.

40|$|The EUs External Natural Gas Policy  Caught Between National Prioriti es and Supranationalism, studies EU {{external}} {{relations in the}} area of n atural gas supply with Russia and the former Soviet Republics in Central Asia. The primary question the thesis tries to answer is to assess to w hat extent Europe manages to formulate and execute its policy on natural gas towards Russia and Central Asia in a coherent manner. Moreover, wha t are the underlying causes as to why the Union does (not) succeed in do ing so? The aim of answering the above questions is to put forward an ex planation for both the current state of EU natural gas relations with Ru ssia and Central Asia, as well as their future direction. In order to aid an assessment of the future direction of EU natural gas relations with Russia and Central Asia, two theories of European in tegration are applied: (i) supranational governance theory and (ii) libe ral intergovernmentalist (LI) theory. According to the former, the integ ration of one sector leads to technical pressures pushing states to in tegrate other sectors. Based on this theory, it seems that pressures to enable the smooth operation of the internal market, allow us to explain why internal energy policy has been able to allow for European Community -level coordination, rules and dispute resolution. According to LI theor y, external energy policy by contrast rather seems to follow a more inte rgovernmental logic whereby states attain their goals through intergover nmental negotiation and bargaining, rather than through a centralised au thority making and enforcing decisions. The outcome of negotiations betw een EU Member States depends on the relative bargaining power of the act ors involved. The actors which would benefit least from a cooperative ag reement and more from the status quo are generally in a stronger positio n than those who would benefit most and can thus demand concessions from the latter. Thus, the extent to which Member States would benefit from a cooperative approach in external energy policy, or rather prefer to ke ep the status quo depends to a large extent on their perceived necessity for change. Europes long term energy security depends lar gely on its ability to establish effective dialogues and forms of cooper ation with external suppliers. Thus partly a foreign policy matter, ener gy security should, according to the EU, abide by its normative foreign policy doctrine of effective multilateralism. The ability to act effec tively however also requires the Union to organise itself efficiently in a consistent and coherent manner in cooperation with key actors involve d. Although coherence and consistency are often used interchangeably, th e two terms have different meanings. Whereas, consistency merely refers to the absence of contradiction, coherence, by contrast, implies positiv e connections and is a much broader concept. Combining the notion of coh erence with the EUs normative goal {{to live up to its}} principle of effective multilateralism, this thesis systematically engages ina comparati ve analysis of EU and Member State actions on natural gas vis-à-vis Russ ia and Central Asia to check for apparent signs of contradiction in thei r stated objectives or actions (consistency). To establish whether syner gies have actually been exploited between actors, the Unions external p olicy performance first needs to be understood: did it reach its objecti ves through enhanced unity and coordination (coherence) ? Empirically, three cases are examined in detail: (i) gas crises mana gement, (ii) (planned) pipeline projects and negotiations, and (iii) con sumer-producer relations on an institutional level. Particular attention is thereby given to the roles played by the division of competences bet ween the EU and its Member States in the field of energy, EU Treaty revi sions, the global institutional frameworks on energy governance, and ind ividual natural gas security at EU Member State level. In carrying out t he analysis, vital information is drawn from an in-depth stakeholder con sultation among key-experts involved in EU external energy relations. Th is information is complemented by document analysis and observation rese arch. The information gathered throughout the research is used to (i) ex plain how external policy on natural gas is formed; (ii) which factors d etermine the eventual outcome at EU level; and through this shed light o n (iii) the (future) direction and pace of European integration in this field. Coherence in Gas Crisis Management On 1 January 2009, natural gas delivers from Russia to Ukraine w ere halted. Reported shortages and a cut in supplies to other European c ountries followed a few days later. In January 2006, a similar crisis be tween the two countries had resulted in falling pressures and non-delive ry of gas reports by European companies. An analysis of the January 2009 crisis shows that a lack of a well-functioning exchange of up-to-date, reliable and consistent information between gas companies, as well as in adequate and fragmented information on cross-border flows served to unde rmine full effectiveness of emergency measures. On the political level, the Commissions bilateral diplomacy proved ineffective in preventing th e crisis from escalating as neither Russia, nor Ukraine acted on the EU s statements. Two clear coherence deficits in the EU s resolve can be discerned: (i) the fragmented character of information on the internal market and the coordination thereof in terms of emergenc y plans; and (ii) the sometimes haphazard manner by which bilateral dipl omacy is conducted. The Lisbon Treaty offers the Union a distinct set of actors and structures that could make for a more ambitious solution to the first problem, and solve the second problem at the same time. When a crisis occurs that carries foreign and security implications, it should be the task of the High Representative (HR) or, at the highest level, t he President of the European Council, assisted by the European External Action Service (EEAS), to engage in diplomatic efforts on behalf of theE U with the aim of striking a political agreement to the crisis and ensur e full consistency and coherence. Yet, their combined efforts should be based on EU-wide information on the Unions internal market, provid ed by emergency plans coordinated at Union level under the auspices of t he Commissioner for Energy. Coherence in Pipeline Projects and Negotiations In terms of coherence, th e impact of the 2006 and 2009 Russia-Ukraine crisis on both occasions se rved to get the EU Institutions and its 27 Member States to agree on the need to diversify natural gas suppliers and transit routes, and for Eur ope to present a united position externally. This would suggest that in a narrow view, the positions of all actors were consistent. However, in terms of the execution thereof, significant discrepancies exist between the positions of the European Commission and European Parliament (EP) on the one hand, and those of the Council and EU Member States on the othe r. Whereas the Commission and EP firmly advocated diversifying natural g as supplies and transit routes away from Russia by attracting gas from t he Caspian and Central Asia, Member States acted differently. Germany struck a deal with Gazprom in early 2006 to construct a direct pipeline between the two nations underneath the Baltic Sea. Simi larly, many central and eastern European Member States in fact strengthe ned their ties to Gazprom. What undoubtedly influenced this decision is the fact that many central and eastern European Member States possess fe w gas pipeline interconnections other than eastwards and do not have the financial means to construct new routes. Overall, when taking a broad u nderstanding of coherence, Member State actions have largely undermined the positions of the European Commission and the EP concerning diversifi cation of natural gas suppliers and transit routes prior to the Lisbon T reatys entry into force. The limited coherence in this period is essent ially related to the fact that the EU possesses few competences on energ y outside of the internal market. As decisions regarding the energy mix fall under the exclusive competence of the Member States, the Russia-Ukr aine crises prompted many of the Unions members to seek individual  bi lateral, rather than multilateral  solutions to the challenges posed by the interruptions. To alter this situation, the Commission instead has argued that energy policy should rather be given its own legal basis, re questing measures to be taken in connection with related policies on the environment and the EU internal market, but not based on the latters p rovisions in the treaties. The Lisbon Treaty fulfilled this desire. Lisbons creation of a specific legal basis for energy with det ailed objectives and new actors such as the HR and EEAS had sparked high hopes for a more coherent EU external energy policy. The European Commi ssion, the EP, as well as a majority of central and eastern European EU Member States were in favour ofgreater Europeanisation of energy polic y and a stated a desire to move away from bilateral agreements. This poi nted to some degree of coherence in the views of the above mentioned act ors. Yet, Europes larger Member States still hold positions inconsisten t with these policies. This not only undermines the EUs coherence, but even its consistency. Diversification efforts are a good example. T hree years after the Treatys entry into force, intra-EU competition has rendered Nabucco  the one pipeline among three initiatives with the mo st favourable overall impact on European energy security  an unlikely c andidate to wheel in a crucial gas contract from Azerbaijan. When asked, third states confirm that Member States promoting this or th e other pipeline, followed by the Commission ushering its support for ye t another, undermines the EUs negotiating position. In sum mary, where some of the Unions central and eastern Members are positive towards a larger role for the European Commission, countries such as Fr ance, Germany, the UK, Italy and the Netherlands are not too eager on ha ving their sovereignty limited, as they view their market size, level of interconnectedness through multiple gas pipelines, and energy sectors power as a sufficient defence against any threat posed by external depen dency. Different energy exposures are largely seen as preventing a stren gthened commitment to the external dimension of European energy policy. It seems therefore that the central and eastern European Memb er States feel they need the support of the European Commission to keep up with the bigger Member States when it comes to energy. When taking a broader understanding of coherence, the belief held by the larger EU Mem ber States that (large) infrastructural projects should preferably be in dustry driven, rather than discussed at Council level, undermines the po tential for synergies to trickle down and raise the impact of EU energy security initiatives beyond their immediate region of implementation. Consumer-Producer Relations at Institutional Level Of particular relevance to EU-Russia/Central Asia energy relati ons on an institutional level is the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT). The EC T represents a legally binding multilateral energy agreement that has as its aim to strengthen the rule of law on energy issues, by creating a l evel playing field of rules to be observed by all participating governme nts, and so mitigate risks associated with energy-related investment and trade. On the transit of energy, the ECT obliges its members not to let transit be interrupted as a result of a conflict with another member. P recisely, this obligation was broken by Ukraine in 2006 and 2009. During both crises, the EU did not resort to issuing public statements which d enounced Ukraines breach of the Charters transit provisions on non-int erruption and non-reduction of transit flows. In ligh t of the Unions overarching aim to conduct effective multilateralism, it is peculiar why the EU did not invoke the ECT. Doing so could havese nt a signal that the Union took a violation of an international agreemen t by one of its contracting parties very seriously, thus providing the T reaty with a potential early role in resolving the conflict. A possible reason as to why this was not done is that Russia refused to ratify the Treaty  in spite of the ECTs recognition of sovereignty over energy re sources. The Treaty was however applied provisionally, until on 20 Augus t 2009, Russia officially stated it intended to terminate provisional ap plication. Conclusions From a theoretica l point of view, EU Member States follow much closer the logic of libera l intergovernmentalist theory rather than supranational governance when it comes to decision-making on EU external natural gas relations. The fa ct that the central and eastern European states favour EU coordination o n natural gas matters has in this context little to do with a real prefe rence for supranational involvement, but much more with a calculation of available courses of action and a selection of the one that maximises t heir utility. Nonetheless, the observation that Europe seems split in w est and east when it comes to involvement of the European Commission, does indicate that a kind of energy iron curtain haunts European deci sion-makers. An analysis of the EUs crisis management effo rts during the January 2009 gas crisis showed that the EUs actions were  both in terms of a narrow and broad view on coherence  at times cont radictive and one could not speak of any apparent synergy between them. Moreover, recourse to effective multilateral interventions was rendere d troublesome due to the absence of Russia from the ECT. This means that  as seen during the January 2009 gas crisis  EU Member States do not necessarily act in concert as ECT Contracting Parties whenever there is a future problem with the supply of Russian gas. Moreover, a lack of suc h a multilateral safety net strengthens the perceived necessity for EU Member States to ensure their own energy security, leading to a further accentuation of existing divides within the European natural gas market. Lisbons creation of a specific legal basis for ene rgy may have inspired hopes for greater coherence in external energy rel ations, yet the fact remains that energy is still an area of shared competence where EU Member States hold the ultimate say over their energy mi x and often go their own way when it comes to natural gas security. This limits the occurrence of potential synergies with energy security initi atives taken by different actors and at different levels. To date, the H R and EEAS appear to have little to no authority to alter this state of affairs. Although desirable from the viewpoint of improving external coh erence, their inclusion seems unlikely as long as influential EU Member States continue to assert their competences in this field. The conclusion that no coherence gains were made through Lisbon might ju st be the snapshot of EU external natural gas policy at this moment in t he history of its integration. It may however also point to a broader tr end of renewed Member State reluctance to the <b>communitarisation</b> of forei gn policy, even in domains where much suggests that a common defence of positions would lead to desirable synergies. This begs the question whet her the Treaty reforms actually serve the purpose of their creation  or if they do just the opposite. Whilst the designation of the HR and EEAS was meant to move EU external policies beyond the purely cooperative go vernance mode into some form of centralisation, the analysis indicates t hat {{in the area of}} energy, where there are few possibilities for the EU to force Member States to comply if they choose otherwise, the two ins titutions make cooperation actually less likely. A certain degree of con sistency had been reached at the outset of policy formation since the Tr eaty of Maastricht for energy policy, which had been experiencing a grad ual integration among institutions through internal market and environme ntal legislation. Awareness that additional integration in external rela tions was needed for the Union to attain its goals was thus clearly pres ent among Member States. This incremental integration dynamic, while by no means stable, appears to have been interrupted by the new Treaty, wit h the HR and the EEAS provoking, in the first instance, negative respons es against further integration. If generalised and persistent, the Lisbo n Treaty may thus have the perverse effect of legally cementing the stat us quo of incoherence in EU external policies.
