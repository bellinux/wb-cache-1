40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{new test}} method has been {{developed}} to investigate the flamma-bility of trimmings used on soft furnishings. The trimming was attached to a sam-ple of the soft furnishing fabric by steel pins. The trimming/fabric combination was then fixed on a specially designed steel frame that could be slotted on to the BS 5438 : 1976 test rig. The frame supporting the trimming could be rotated along the vertical plane so that the trimming/fabric junction could be inclined at vari-ous angles {{with respect to the}} flame. It was found that the rate of propagation of the flame across the length of the trimming was dependant on fibre type and the angle of alignment. The transfer of flame from trimming to the host fabric also de-pended on the fibre type of both the trimming and the host fabric. It may be possi-ble to use this method to assess the flammability of the trimmings attached to upholstered furniture, using a small flame, where by all types of trimming (cords, <b>cut</b> <b>ruche,</b> fringes) could be tested for flammability and flame transfer at various degrees of alignment, e. g., horizontal, vertical, etc...|$|E
