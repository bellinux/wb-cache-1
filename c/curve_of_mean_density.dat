40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems is the understanding of physics of electrostatic and electromagnetic fluctuations in multi-scale plasma turbulence. Especially so, in continuously connected plasma regions with varying degree of magnetization. Examples range from multiscale plasmas in Magnetron-like devices to astrophysical plasmas confined by magnetic dipole structures, solar wind driven collision-less and weakly collisional plasmas around Earth, to mention a few. Such plasmas are dominated by both electron scale and ion scale physics as well as finite beta effects.

40|$|According to the {{classical}} Jeans analysis, all the molecular clouds of mass larger than a few 100 M(solar), size larger than about 1 pc and kinetic temperature Tk less than 30 K are gravitationally unstable. We have shown that in clouds supported by internal supersonic motions, local gravitational instabilities may appear within molecular clouds which are globally stable. The argument is threefold: (1) when the turbulent kinetic energy is included into the internal energy term, the virial equilibrium condition shows that molecular clouds such as those observed, which are gravitationally unstable according to the Jeans criterion, are indeed globally stable if supported by a turbulent velocity field of power spectrum steeper than 3; (2) 2 D compressible hydrodynamical simulations show that a supersonic turbulent velocity field generates a turbulent pressure within clouds, the gradients of which stabilize the unstable scales (i. e., the largest scales and the cloud itself) against gravitational collapse; (3) an analysis similar to the Jeans approach but including the turbulent pressure gradient term, gives basically the same results as those given in (1). Clouds <b>of</b> <b>mean</b> <b>density</b> lower than a critical value {{are found to be}} stable even though more massive than their Jeans mass. In clouds <b>of</b> <b>mean</b> <b>density</b> larger than that critical value, the gravitational instability appears only over a range of scales smaller than the cloud size, the largest scales being stable. In practice, the observed <b>mean</b> <b>densities</b> are lower than this critical value: the observation of a small number of cores and stars of a few solar masses embedded in clouds of several hundred solar masses can only be understood in terms of small scale density fluctuations of large amplitude generated by the supersonic turbulence which would occasionally overtake the limit of gravitational stability...|$|R

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, red-free conjunctival photographs of diabetic and normal individuals, aged 30 - 60 years, were taken under defined conditions and analyzed using a Radon transform-based algorithm for vascular segmentation. The image areas occupied by vessels (AOV) of different diameters were calculated. The main outcome measure was the distribution <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>mean</b> AOV <b>of</b> different sized vessels. Secondary outcome measures included total AOV and standard deviation (SD) of AOV of different sized vessels. Results: Two hundred and sixty-eight diabetic patients and 297 normal (control) individuals were included, differing in age (45. 50 ± 5. 19 vs. 40. 38 ± 6. 19 years, P < 0. 001), systolic (126. 37 ± 20. 25 vs. 119. 21 ± 15. 81 mmHg, P < 0. 001) and diastolic (78. 14 ± 14. 21 vs. 67. 54 ± 11. 46 mmHg, P < 0. 001) blood pressures.

40|$|The high {{resolution}} density of 16 firn and shallow ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica {{was determined by}} applying the gamma-ray absorption method. Profiles <b>of</b> <b>mean</b> <b>density</b> and density fluctuations (i. e. deviations from the mean) are presented and discussed. The profiles <b>of</b> <b>mean</b> <b>density</b> show the patterns well known from the numerous firn cores studied so far. However, the density fluctuations appear to behave anomalous insofar, as for a layered medium we expect a direct correlation of the density fluctuations {{with the increase in}} <b>density.</b> That <b>means</b> that the deviation from the mean decreases steadily with increasing density, until the density of bubbly ice is reached. But in contrast to the expected steady decrease we observe a relatively fast decrease of the amplitudes in density fluctuations close to the surface. They assume a local minimum for densities between 600 and 650 kg/m^ 3 (in depths of 20 to 50 meter, depending on accumulation rate and annual mean temperature) but then increase again. Local maxima are obtained for densities between 750 and 850 kg/m^ 3, leading to increased amplitudes throughout the firn-ice transition. Below the fluctuations decrease again, approaching the values for bubbly ice. Since the investigated cores reflect different climate conditions with accumulation rates varying from 30 mm water equivalent per year to > 1500 mm water equivalent per year and annual mean temperatures from - 20 °C to - 55 °C we assume, that the behaviour of the density fluctuations observed in our cores is a fundamental property of polar firn, not discussed much in literature {{due to the lack of}} {{high resolution}} density profiles.
