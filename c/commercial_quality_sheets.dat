40|$|This paper {{describes}} the technological procedure of obtaining the PtCl 4 of <b>commercial</b> <b>quality.</b> The procedure of decomposition H 2 [PtCl 6] x 6 H 2 O in chlorine stream {{was used to}} obtain the platinum (IV) chloride. By experimental laboratory testing, the platinum-tetra-chloride of <b>commercial</b> <b>quality</b> (content of Pt- 57. 9 %) was obtained. Starting material was platinum powder quality of 99. 98 %, obtained by processing the used platinum catalysts in chemical industry (production of nitric acid). The process of PtCl 4 was developed in several stages: 1) dissolution of Pt powder 2) evaporation and crystallization of H 2 PtCl 6 3) obtaining of PtCl 4 by chlorination of H 2 PtCl 6 in the defined working regime. Based on the experimental laboratory testing, the optimum parameters for obtaining the PtCl 4 of <b>commercial</b> <b>quality</b> are defined.

40|$|Quality {{of supply}} {{has been one}} of the main aspects covered by the European Energy Policy in the last decades {{together}} with the competitiveness and the sustainability. Several regulatory actions have been taken in this regard and have been applied at European level. Most of Energy National Regulatory Agencies have implemented electricity distribution network retribution mechanisms based on the quality of supply provided by the companies responsible for that. These measures were mainly based on the technical quality: number and length of service interruptions. However, electricity consumer satisfaction has not been measured for checking how <b>commercial</b> <b>quality</b> is affecting it. In this working paper, technical and <b>commercial</b> <b>quality</b> of supply indicators for household electricity consumers in Spain are assessed together by means of an statistic model. The impact of <b>commercial</b> <b>quality</b> will allow us to identify possible policy recommendations to be implemented in the regulatory framework. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the United States Army's use of commercial standards {{in place of}} military standards (MIL-STDs) for the acquisition of Non Developmental Items (NDI).

In addition, the future <b>commercial</b> <b>quality</b> standard, the ISO 9000 family of standards, is looked at. The paper begins {{with a discussion of}} current and future <b>commercial</b> <b>quality</b> standards. Then the MIL-STDs used and the MIL-STDs replaced by commercial standards in the acquisition of M 915 series trucks are discussed. Benefits and concerns arising from the use of commercial standards are followed by the final chapter which contains the paper's conclusion that the use of commercial standards for Army NDI acquisitions makes sense, and recommends that the Army move toward mandating the ISO 9000 commercial standards.

In {{order to identify}} popcorn cultivars that constitute a viable alternative For popcorn producers, an experiment was conducted using a randomized blocks experimental design with Five genotypes (BRS Angela, Zelia, IAC 112, IAC 12 and IAC TC- 01) and four repetitions, during the 2003 / 2004 crop. The experiment was carried out with 60 cm spacing between lilies and density of 75 thousand plants per hectare. During the experiment, agronomic and commercial characteristics were evaluated, under field and laboratory conditions. The variety BRS Angela featured increased yield, followed by simple hybrids IAC, with Zelia (triple hybrid) showing lower yield.

Using a batholith geology-mining map, a description of fracturing in the mining area, and underground information provided by continuous-core boreholes, an estimate of reserves was made that featured the following innovations: 1) the use of fuzzy set theory to assign qualities to each block, and 2) the inclusion of fracture anisotropy at the deposit level in the fuzzy mathematical formulation. These innovations enabled quality distributions in the rock mass to be assessed more realistic, by reducing the estimation error caused by assigning a single quality to the primary block and by improving the estimate {{of the distribution of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>qualities</b> defined by fracturing.
