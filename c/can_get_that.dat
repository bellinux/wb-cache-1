500|$|Grey's Anatomy used a color-blind casting technique, {{resulting}} in a racially diverse ensemble. Each role was cast without the character's races being pre-determined, keeping Rhimes' vision of diversity. The production staff began casting with the program's title character, Meredith Grey, which Rhimes stated was a difficult role to cast. [...] "I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile," [...] said Rhimes, [...] "and after a while, they were like, 'We think we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> girl from Moonlight Mile." [...] The next to be cast, Sandra Oh (Dr. Cristina Yang), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read {{for the role of}} Cristina instead. Many actors read for the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd, but when Patrick Dempsey read for the part, [...] "he was just perfect", according to Rhimes.|$|E
500|$|Pompeo {{discovered}} Grey's Anatomy {{after an}} extended period of doing nothing in the acting profession. [...] Her agent suggested she audition amongst other projects. [...] While casting actresses for the part of Meredith Grey, series' creator Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile, and after a while, they were like, 'We think we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> girl from Moonlight Mile.' I spent time with her and got to know her, and then we started casting for the men." [...] She reported that Grey was not an easy role to cast because of the strong verbal possibilities. [...] Rhimes was informed that the actress in question was Pompeo, who had a deal in place with ABC, having previously tested for a pilot show on the network. It has been speculated that Pompeo was the first character to be cast, but when asked, she said she did not know of this. When asked of how she created Pompeo's character, Rhimes said: ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Gulf News, Vikram spoke of the challenges in portraying all three characters while wearing the same costumes. He said, [...] "I love such challenges. [...] Although the costume defined {{each of the three}} characters in Anniyan, there were scenes where Ambi would suddenly become Remo and Remo would become Anniyan. There I made it dramatic to bring out each character." [...] He credited his wife Shailaja Balakrishnan, a psychologist, for helping him in fleshing out the character of Ambi, a person who has multiple personality disorder. In a conversation with film critic Baradwaj Rangan, Shailaja recalled the times the film was being made and spoke of Vikram, saying, [...] "I felt we should live in two houses. It's not easy to live with a man who <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> eccentric, an actor who wants to be that difficult on himself. I wouldn't say he becomes the character, but there's definitely some kind of internalisation." [...] Vikram confessed that he had a tough time during the film's making as playing different characters affected him and he found himself going mad. He added that he would take a break after a 15-day shoot and watch the pigeons on his terrace as a way of dealing with the pressure.|$|E
500|$|He started 2002–03 well, {{taking his}} place in the team due to {{injuries}} to other players. He made his first appearance in the opening match, a 1–1 draw away to Macclesfield Town on 10 August 2002, with chairman John Batchelor claiming Smith had a [...] "wonderful game and if we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> sort of attitude from everyone in the team we won't have any problems". Smith was dropped to the bench for a 1–1 home draw with Wrexham on 29 October 2002 due to a change in formation, having started every match in 2002–03 prior to this match, although he did play as a 48th-minute substitute. He suffered a hamstring injury in early-November 2002, making his return in a 1–0 victory away to Rochdale on 23 November. Smith received his first red card of 2002–03 for a second bookable offence in a 1–1 home draw with Hull City on 28 December 2002, resulting in a one-match suspension. This meant he missed York's match against Torquay on 11 January 2003, and after a short spell on the sidelines returned in a 2–1 home win over Macclesfield on 2 February. Smith finished 2002–03 with 39 appearances for York, and was described by the Evening Press as the [...] "surprise star of the season". Despite being in outstanding form and becoming a fans' favourite, he was not offered a new contract with York at the end of 2002–03 by Dolan, although he hoped to still to have a future at the club. This decision was reversed by newly appointed player-manager Chris Brass, and Smith signed a new one-year contract in July 2003.|$|E

2500|$|An {{official}} in France's Atomic Energy Commission {{reported that they}} estimated the blast was [...] "about or less than a kiloton" [...] and expressed uncertainty {{about whether or not}} the blast was actually nuclear. [...] There have been various large planned and unplanned non-nuclear explosions comparable in yield to small nuclear detonations, such as the U.S. [...] "Minor Scale" [...] explosion from 1985, which used conventional explosives to simulate a 4 kiloton detonation. According to the Washington Times anonymous U.S. intelligence sources speculated there [...] "was a seismic event that registered about 4 on the Richter scale, but it still isn't clear if it was a nuclear test. You <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> kind of seismic reading from high explosives". The Wall Street Journal explains that this blast was equivalent to the explosive force of about US$100,000 worth of ammonium nitrate. [...] International experts have said that it will take some time to confirm whether it was a successful nuclear test, as North Korea claimed, or an unsuccessful one ("fizzle"), or perhaps not even a nuclear test at all.|$|E
2500|$|Caroline Hawley and Meirion Jones {{from the}} BBC's Newsnight {{programme}} investigated the ADE 651 {{in a report}} broadcast in January 2010, asking the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory to assess one of the [...] "programmed substance detection cards" [...] used in the device to detect TNT. The laboratory found that the card contained only a standard radio frequency security tag of the type used in stores to prevent shoplifting. According to the laboratory's Dr. Markus Kuhn, it was [...] "impossible" [...] for the card to detect anything and it had [...] "absolutely {{nothing to do with}} the detection of TNT". The card could not be programmed, had no memory, no microprocessor and no form of information could be stored on it. Despite the high cost of the devices, the cards were worth only about two to three pence (3–5¢) each. Kuhn commented: [...] "These are the cheapest bit of electronics that you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> look vaguely electronic and are sufficiently flat to fit inside a card." [...] The [...] "card reader" [...] was found to be an empty plastic box. Psychology professor Bruce Hood has noted that the swinging of the antenna is merely due to its loose assembly and unconscious wrist movements by the user (ideomotor phenomenon). Explosives expert Sidney Alford described the device as [...] "immoral", telling Newsnight that [...] "it could result in people being killed in the dozens, if not hundreds". Newsnight noted that thousands of people had indeed been killed and injured in devastating car bomb attacks in Baghdad such as the 25 October and 8 December 2009 Baghdad bombings, without the bombers being detected by the ADE 651 devices.|$|E
