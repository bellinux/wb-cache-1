[...] With the test, investigators found that meaning in life mediated the relationships between religiosity and well-being; uncontrollable stress and substance use; depression and self-derogation. Crumbaugh found that the Seeking of Noetic Goals Test (SONG) is a <b>complementary</b> <b>measure</b> of the PIL. While the PIL measures the presence of meaning, the SONG measures orientation towards meaning.

However, they raise at least three broad questions. First, do their benefits (notably lower transactions costs) exceed the costs (reduced policy flexibility) ?

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for mobile robot exploration in unknown indoor environments using {{only a single}} forward-facing camera. Rather than processing all the data, the method intermittently examines only small 32 × 24 downsampled grayscale images. We show that for the task of indoor exploration the visual information is highly redundant, allowing successful navigation even using {{only a small fraction}} of the available data. The method keeps the robot centered in the corridor by estimating two state parameters: the orientation within the corridor, and the distance to the end of the corridor. The orientation is determined by combining the results of five <b>complementary</b> <b>measures,</b> while the estimated distance to the end combines the results of three <b>complementary</b> <b>measures.</b> These measures, which are predominantly information-theoretic, are analyzed independently, and the combined system is tested in several unknown corridor buildings exhibiting a wide variety of appearances, showing the sufficiency of low-resolution visual information for mobile robot exploration. Because the algorithm discards such a large percentage of the pixels both spatially and temporally, processing occurs at an average of 1000 frames per second, thus freeing the processor for other concurrent tasks. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{assessing}} {{the extent of}} food localization in Hawai‘i, we adopted the SSR and its <b>complementary</b> <b>measure,</b> the IDR. Hawai‘i had an overall food SSR of 15.7 % and an overall food IDR of 102.5 % in 2010. Obviously, the two complementary measures do not sum up to 100 %. This result led us to conclude that SSR was a better measure of “potential” local production to satisfy local market consumption of food in Hawai‘i. Likewise, the IDR exceeding 100 % indicates the existence of food imports that are then turned around and re-exported to other markets.|$|E

Our experiments show that combining the relational information with the attributes allows to detect the communities more efficiently than using only one type of information.
