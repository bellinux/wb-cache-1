Sisal pulp was found to be most suitable as reinforcement for the brittle cementitious matrix. Nanofibrillated cellulose was produced by the application of a high intensity refining process of the sisal pulp.

Cement mortar composites reinforced with both the sisal fibres and the nanofibrillated cellulose were prepared, and the mechanical properties were determined under flexural tests.

These membranes were first oxidized {{on both sides}} by a modified (2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidin- 1 -yl) oxyl (TEMPO) oxidation system using a controlled oxidation reaction technique. Then, the oxidized RC membranes were functionalized with polyethylenimine (PEI) via the glutaraldehyde crosslinking method to obtain bifunctional (carboxyl and amino) porous RC membranes, as revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), elemental analysis and zeta potential measurement. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the tests of the mechanical properties and permeability characteristics of modified RC membranes demonstrated that the porous structure and certain mechanical properties could be retained. The adsorption performance of the modified membranes towards dyes was subsequently investigated.

For <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> and dissolving <b>pulp</b> sheets, adding Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions is detrimental when ageing at 180 C under dry conditions (pH 5).

The carboxylate content of nanocrystals made from BPFs, SPFs, and CPFs were 2. 10, 2. 02, and 1. 66 mmol/g, respectively. Nanocrystals of BPFs and SPFs had widths of 5 to 15 nm and lengths of 400 to 800 nm. The length and width of CPFs nanocrystals were 200 to 400 nm and 15 to 25 nm.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Aqueous {{solutions}} of {{a number}} of metal complexes have been found to dissolve cellulose. Recently, a number of new metal complexes have been developed that completely dissolve cellulose by deprotonating and coordinative binding the hydroxyl groups in the C 2 and C 3 position of the anhydro glucose. A detailed comparative light scattering study is given for cellulose in Schweizer’s reagent (cuoxam), Ni-tren, and Cd-tren. Cuoxam is the well-known solution of cupric hydroxide in aqueous ammonia, and the abbreviation tren stands for tris(2 -aminoethyl) amine. Cuoxam and Ni-tren are deep blue solvents. The light scattering measurements were carried out with the blue line of an argon ion laser at wavelength ì 0) 457. 9 nm, and the data from these solvents required an absorption correction according to the Lambert-Beer law. Cd-tren is almost colorless, and the data could be used without correction. Because of traces of colloid particles, possibly originating from the metal hydroxides, a special treatment for optical clarification became necessary. A large number of samples, <b>cotton</b> <b>linters,</b> various <b>pulp</b> celluloses, and bacterial celluloses, were studied. All three solvents exhibited good solution properties, but only Cd-tren was capable of dissolving also the highest degrees of polymerization of <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> and bacterial cellulose (DPw) 9700).

30|$|The {{challenge}} is to utilize and convert these waste materials into useful and low-cost marketable products. Published {{studies have shown that}} the olive mill solid waste might be mixed with polypropylene and used as filler in the manufacture of wood-plastic composites [3] or mixed with pure wood fiber for the manufacture of fiber board [2]. Also, waste may be utilized as a soil amendment [4 – 10], a wetting agent [11], an energy source [12 – 14], a biosorbent for heavy metals [15], or treatment to reduce phytotoxicity [16]. There remains a challenge, however, to find an environmentally friendly and economical means of converting OISW into commercial cellulose derivatives. Among all cellulose derivatives, cellulose acetate has been recognized by far as the most important derivative of cellulose due to its extensive industrial and commercial applications [17 – 20]. There are numerous publications and patents on the preparation and utilization of cellulose acetate. However, to the best of our knowledge there are no known reports addressing the utilization of OISW to prepare cellulose esters.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel method for introducing the RGD cell adhesion peptide to enhance cell adhesion onto bacterial cellulose (BC). BC and <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> as reference were modified with xyloglucan (XG) and xyloglugan bearing a GRGDS pentapeptide. The adsorptions followed Langmuir adsorption behavior, where both XGs probably decorate the cellulose surfaces as a monolayer. The adsorption maximum of the XGs reached around 180 mg/g on BC {{and only about}} {{three times as much}} on <b>cotton</b> <b>linters.</b> The adsorption was verified with colorimetric methods. The specific surface area of BC measured with XG and XG-GRGDS was about 200 m (2) /g and was almost three times less for <b>cotton</b> <b>linters,</b> 60 m (2) /g. The difference in the amounts of XGs adsorbed might be explained by the swollen network of bacterial cellulose and a more exposed and accessible bulk as compared to <b>cotton</b> <b>linters.</b> The nanocellulose material was modified homogeneously throughout the material, as seen by the z-scan in confocal microscopy. Moreover, the modification in the water phase, in comparison with organic solvents, was clearly advantageous for preserving the morphology, as observed with SEM. The modification slightly increased the wettability, which might explain the decrease in or undetectable adsorption of adhesive protein shown by QCM-D. Initial cell studies showed that adhesion of human endothelial cells is enhanced when the BC hydrogel is modified with XG-GRGDS. QCM-D studies further revealed that the cell enhancement is due to the presence of the RGD epitope on XG and not to a nonspecific adsorption of fibronectin from cell culture medium.

Found adjacent to the cellulose, it is believed {{to function as a}} cementing material which contributes crosslinks and rigidity to the cellulose framework. The only noncovalent linkage reported in the primary cell wall cellulose-hemicellulose-pectic polysaccharide matrix of the cultured tissues is that between xyloglucan and cellulose. Therefore, the xyloglucan:cellulose association has been of great interest to researchers. Xyloglucan can be bound to cellulose in vitro to simulate this in vivo relationship. Previously, the sorption of xyloglucan fragments onto cellulose under non-physiological conditions had been studied, but little information was available on xyloglucan polymer sorption onto cellulose under more natural conditions. This thesis examined the sorption of the xyloglucan polymer isolated from Tamarindus indica onto cellulose fibers (<b>cotton</b> <b>linters)</b> in an aqueous environment. The structure of the xyloglucan isolated from Tamarindus indica in this thesis resembled that of other tamarind xyloglucans reported in the literature. Due to the milder isolation procedure employed, the molecular weight of this polymer was much larger than those previously found. No acetyl, pyruvate, methoxyl, or carboxyl groups were found. The molecular weight and certain structural features (e. g., no fucose units) also differed from the xyloglucan found in plant primary cell walls. When sorbed onto well characterized <b>cotton</b> <b>linters,</b> this xyloglucan exhibited equilibrium sorption within 24 hours. The equilibrium adsorption isotherm was defined. Monolayer sorption occurred. A maximum specific sorption value of 3. 9 milligrams of xyloglucan sorbed per gram of <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> was calculated using Langmuir's adsorption isotherm theory. This value was compared with other values {{found in the}} literature for similar polymer adsorption studies. The effect of molecular weight on sorption equilibrium was also examined and found to be insignificant over the molecular weight range of the polymer isolated in this thesis. Ph. D...|$|R
