40|$|Introduction: The {{absolute}} risk of {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) as well as extension and/or recurrence in superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) of the leg is considerable and underestimated. We retrospectively evaluated therapeutic management, thrombophilic risk factors and clinical outcome of SVT. Methods: A database search was performed for consecutive patients with a suspected SVT of the lower extremities referred to our institution between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2004. The primary outcome measure was pain reduction at follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were progression or recurrence of SVT in the leg and the occurrence of (a) symptomatic DVT or symptomatic PE at follow-up. Results: In 73 patients follow-up information was present (3 / 76 non-evaluable patients). In 9 / 32 (28 %) of the patients treated with <b>carbasalate</b> <b>calcium,</b> there was progression of SVT as assessed by ultrasonographic evaluation, compared with 3 / 11 (27 %) in the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) group and 3 / 6 (50 %) in the no treatment group. DVT was diagnosed in 5 / 36 (14 %) of the patients treated with <b>carbasalate</b> <b>calcium</b> compared with 1 / 13 (1 %) in the LMWH and 1 / 3 (33 %) in the other treatment groups at follow-up. Furthermore, 34 were tested for thrombophilic defects, 27 of whom had one or more thrombophilic defect. Conclusion: The results of our study show that SVT may be prone to venous thromboembolism and therefore needs to be treated or carefully followed u...|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims: Effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> is a calcium-salt of {{acetylsalicylic acid}} causing less local gastric damage than acetylsalicylic acid at high doses in healthy controls. The {{aim of the}} study was to {{investigate}} the incidence of peptic ulcers in a population-based cohort using bioequivalent low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (80 mg) or effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> (100 mg). Methods: Incident acetylsalicylic acid or effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> users were identified from the Integrated Primary Care Information database. The study cohort comprised 19, 819 subjects: 11, 891 on acetylsalicylic acid and 7928 on effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate.</b> Incidence rates for documented peptic ulcer disease confirmed by endoscopy were calculated and time-dependent adjusted Cox regression analysis was used to compare the risk of peptic ulcers for patients using acetylsalicylic acid or effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate.</b> Results: During an average 1. 85 years of follow-up evaluation, 115 ulcers were found. The risk for developing a peptic ulcer during drug use was: 3. 07 per 1000 person-years for acetylsalicylic acid and 4. 31 for effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate.</b> The risk of peptic ulcers was not statistically significantly higher in patients using effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> than in acetylsalicylic acid users (adjusted hazard ratio, 1. 39; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 92 - 2. 12). Conclusions: The incidence rate of peptic ulcer disease is similar in patients using low-dose effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> compared with regular low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. This implicates that peptic ulcers seem to be related to systemic rather than to local effects of low-dose acetylsalicylic aci...|$|R
40|$|Analgesic {{drugs like}} acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol, and {{ibuprofen}} are frequently used by subjects suffering from headache of acute mountain sickness (AMS). It {{is not clear}} if the effect is due to analgesia or prevention of AMS. We performed a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing a low dose of an acetylsalicylic acid analog, <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> (380 mg /day), to placebo in a cohort of altitude-na√Øve subjects attempting a fast climb of Mt. Kilimanjaro (5896 m). A third noncontrolled open arm was proposed-the usual recommended preventive treatment of acetazolamide 500 mg/day. Of 93 potential participants, 44 chose prevention with acetazolamide, 18 refused participation, 15 received <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate,</b> and 16 received placebo. Mean age was 39 +/- 9 (SD) yr and 15 % were female. AMS was quantified by the Lake Louise Symptom Score and physician assessment. <b>Calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> at 380 mg/day {{did not have any}} preventive effect on AMS and did not have any effect on the prevalence and intensity of headache. Event rate of AMS in the pooled carbasalate-placebo group was 84 % and 55 % in the acetazolamide group. The number needed to treat (NNT) at 500 mg/day of acetazolamide was 3. One subject on acetazolamide developed high altitude cerebral edema and was treated with dexamethasone, oxygen, and descent by evacuation. In conclusion, low-dose <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> is not effective for prevention of AMS. In addition, these results corroborate the contention that in typical steep climbing profile settings, such as used by commercial enterprise on Mt. Kilimanjaro, acetazolamide 500 mg/day may not be sufficient to prevent AMS or to sufficiently reduce symptom intensity in almost half of subjects...|$|R
40|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> is a therapeutically active {{salicylate}} {{which seems}} to cause less gastroduodenal mucosal damage than aspirin in laboratory animals. This endoscopist-blinded, randomised, cross over trial aimed to compare acute gastric mucosal damage in 20 healthy volunteers treated with acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) (650 mg three times daily) and effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> (ECC) (826. 8 mg three times daily) bioequivalent to 650 mg ASA over a five day period. Endoscopy was performed immediately before treatment and on day 5 of each treatment. Serum salicylate, thromboxane B 2, and gastric mucosal prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) concentrations were measured after endoscopy. ECC caused fewer gastric mucosal erosions than ASA. The total number of gastric erosions was 23. 8 (16. 1) in the ASA treated subjects compared with 9. 1 (8. 7) in ECC treated subjects (p = 0. 004). Differences between ASA and ECC were significant for both the gastric antrum and body, and for both haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic erosions. The mean gastric body Lanza score for mucosal damage was lower after ECC than ASA (p = 0. 003). The visual analogue score for gastric body damage was lower for ECC (16. 9 mm (15. 9)) than for ASA (32. 7 mm (20. 8)), p = 0. 008. Serum salicylate concentrations were similar after both preparations (ASA: 66 (23) mg/l, versus ECC: 58 (17) mg/l, NS). Serum thromboxane B 2 was similarly reduced using both preparations- 97. 2 (3. 5) % inhibition with ASA, 95. 2 (5. 5) % inhibition with <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> (NS). Suppression of gastric mucosal PGE 2 synthesis was similar with both preparations (ASA: 83. 4 (17. 1) %; ECC 84. 3 (12. 9) %; NS). It is concluded that ECC causes significantly less gastroduodenal mucosal damage than ASA administered at bioequivalent doses as judged by serum salicylate, serum thromboxane, and mucosal PGE 2 values. ECC may therefore be a less harmful alternative treatment to plain ASA...|$|R
40|$|Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{commonly}} used drugs in the world. In the 5 th century BC, Hippocrates already prescribed leaves and bark of the willow tree, consisting of ASA precursor salicin, to patients with high fever and extreme pains. Nowadays, chronic low-dose ASA is widely prescribed as a platelet aggregation inhibitor in patients at risk for myocardial infarction or stroke. In the Netherlands, it is the second most used drug with 7. 6 million prescriptions in 2012 [1]. One of the main disadvan-tages of ASA, however, is up-regulation of COX- 2 in the stomach, which may result in gastrointestinal side effects including dyspepsia, gastrointestinal ulcers, and bleeding [2]. These side effects instigated the development of alterna-tives such as effervescent <b>carbasalate</b> <b>calcium</b> (ECC). ECC is a salt formulation of ASA, which makes it more soluble an...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Aspirin is {{associated}} with gastrointestinal side effects such as gastric ulcers, gastric bleeding and dyspepsia. High-dose effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> (ECC), a buffered formulation of aspirin, {{is associated}} with reduced gastric toxicity compared with plain aspirin in healthy volunteers, but at lower cardiovascular doses no beneficial effects were observed. AIM: To compare the prevalence of self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms between low-dose plain aspirin and ECC. METHODS: A total of 51, 869 questionnaires were sent to {{a representative sample of}} the Dutch adult general population in December 2008. Questions about demographics, gastrointestinal symptoms in general and specific symptoms, comorbidity, and medication use including bioequivalent doses of ECC (100 mg) and plain aspirin (80 mg) were stated. We investigated the prevalence of self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms on ECC compared with plain aspirin using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 16, 715 questionnaires (32 %) were returned and eligible for analysis. Of these, 911 (5 %) respondents reported the use of plain aspirin, 633 (4 %) ECC and 15, 171 reported using neither form of aspirin (91 %). The prevalence of self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms in general was higher in respondents using ECC (27. 5 %) compared with plain aspirin (26. 3 %), but did not differ significantly with either univariate (OR 1. 06, 95 %CI 0. 84 - 1. 33), or multivariate analysis (aOR 1. 08, 95 %CI 0. 83 - 1. 41). Also, none of the specific types of symptoms differed between the two aspirin formulations. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort representative of the general Dutch population, low-dose ECC is not associated with a reduction in self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms compared with plain aspirin...|$|R
40|$|This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multi-center, parallel-group study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>carbasalate</b> (equivalent to 900 mg aspirin) plus metoclopramide 10 mg (CM) with ergotamine tartrate 1 mg plus caffeine 100 mg (EC) admi nistered {{in the treatment of}} 2 acute migraine attacks. A total of 296 patients fulfilling the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine were enrolled. In total, one or two migraine attacks were treated in 268 and 235 patients, respectively. The primary endpoint for the first treated attack was headache relief, with intensity decreasing from moderate or severe to mild or absent 2 h after drug intake. Usual secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed. A superiority of CM over EC was observed for both treated attacks for the main endpoint: success in 54 versus 36 %, p = 0. 003 for the first attack and 60 versus 44 %, p = 0. 02 for the second attack. CM was also significantly superior to EC during the first attack for complete headache relief (20 vs. 8 %, p = 0. 006), nausea (42 vs. 63 %, p = 0. 007) and willingness to take the drug again (90 vs. 80 %, p = 0. 043). The global efficacy evaluation, rated by the investigators, was significantly more favorable to CM for both attacks (p = 0. 001 for the first attack and p = 0. 02 for the second). The patients' evaluation was significant for the first attack (p = 0. 002). The global incidence of adverse events was 45 % higher with EC, though not significant (32 vs. 22 %, p = 0. 075). They were most often unspecific and mild to moderate in intensity. Gastrointestinal side effects were significantly less frequent with CM than EC (7 vs. 21 %, p = 0. 001). Thus, CM is more effective and has a better gastrointestinal safety than EC in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
