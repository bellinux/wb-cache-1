5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi <b>Crude</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>Pipeline</b> and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E
5|$|The Sava River {{valley is}} also a route for road and rail traffic. The river valley routes {{are a part of}} the Pan-European Corridor X, and forming {{junctions}} with Pan-European Corridors V, Vb, Vc, Xa and Xb in area of Ljubljana (V), Zagreb (Vb, Xa), Slavonski Šamac (Vc), and Belgrade (Xb). The motorways forming the Pan-European Corridor X in the area—Slovenia's A2, Croatia's A3 and Serbia's A1 motorways—represent a part of European route E70 Bordeaux–Turin–Ljubljana–Zagreb–Belgrade–Bucharest, and the European route E61 Villach–Ljubljana–Trieste–Rijeka. A largely double track railroad with a railway electrification system {{is also a}} part of the Corridor X. The railroad was a part of the Simplon-Orient-Express and Direct-Orient-Express routes. The navigable river course between Belgrade and Galdovo north of Sisak is spanned by 25bridges. The Sava River valley east of Sisak is also used as a route for the Jadranski naftovod, a <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline.</b> The system connects the Port of Rijeka oil terminal to oil refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, to Brod in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as Novi Sad and Pančevo in Serbia.|$|E

25|$|In April 2012, a <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline,</b> {{from the}} Exxon Corp Baton Rouge Refinery, burst and spilled at least 1,900 {{barrels of oil}} (80,000 gallons) in the rivers of Point Coupee Parish, Louisiana, {{shutting}} down the Exxon Corp Baton Refinery for a few days.

25|$|Pipeline {{industry}} spokesmen {{have noted}} that {{thousands of miles of}} existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, in southeast Wyoming, eastern Colorado and New Mexico, western Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Pioneer <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> crosses east-west across Nebraska, and the Pony Express pipeline, which crosses the Ogallala Aquifer in Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas, was being converted as of 2013 from natural gas to crude oil, under a permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.|$|E

25|$|Construction of the Interprovincial Pipeline {{system from}} Alberta to Central Canada began in 1949 with surveys and procurement. Field {{construction}} of the Edmonton/Regina/Superior (Wisconsin) leg began early in 1950 and concluded just 150 days later. The line began moving oil from Edmonton to the Great Lakes, a distance of 1,800 kilometres, {{before the end of}} the year. In 1953, the company extended the system to Sarnia, Ontario, in 1957 to Toronto. Other additions have extended the pipe to Montreal, Chicago and even Wood River in southern Illinois. The Interprovincial <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> (now part of Enbridge Inc.) was the longest oil pipeline in the world when it was first constructed; the longest oil pipeline is now the Druzhba pipeline from Siberia. Until the completion of the TransCanada gas pipeline, it was also the longest pipeline in the world.|$|E
25|$|The IPL line {{fundamentally}} {{changed the}} pricing of Alberta oil {{to make it}} sensitive to international rather than regional factors. The wellhead price reflected {{the price of oil}} at Sarnia, less pipeline tolls for shipping it there. IPL is by far the longest <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> in the western hemisphere. Looping, or constructing additional lines beside the original, expanded the Interprovincial system and allowed its extension into the American midwest and to upstate New York. In 1976, it was 3,680 kilometres through an extension to Montreal. Although it helped assure security of supply in the 1970s, the extension became a threat to Canadian oil producers after deregulation in 1985. With Montreal refineries using cheaper imported oil, there was concern within the industry that a proposal to use the line to bring foreign oil into Sarnia might undermine traditional markets for Western Canadian petroleum.|$|E
500|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) {{includes}} the trans-Alaska crude-oil pipeline, 11 pump stations, several hundred miles of feeder pipelines, and the Valdez Marine Terminal. TAPS {{is one of}} the world's largest pipeline systems. [...] It is commonly called the Alaska pipeline, trans-Alaska pipeline, or Alyeska pipeline, (or the pipeline as referred to in Alaska), but those terms technically apply only to the [...] of the pipeline with the diameter of 48inches (122cm) that conveys oil from Prudhoe Bay, to Valdez, Alaska. The <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> is privately owned by the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} {{constructing}} such a pipeline was first proposed in 1940 by the Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, {{who argued that}} [...] "the building of a <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> from Texas to the East might not be economically sound; but that {{in the event of}} an emergency it might be absolutely necessary". A consortium led by Standard Oil put forward a bid to build one in spring 1941, but the plan failed, due to concerns over the amount of steel that would be required for such a project. In May 1941, Ickes was appointed as the Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense, and in December 1942 became the administrator of the Petroleum Administration for War. New laws were passed to enable the building of pipelines necessary for the war effort, including the compulsory purchasing of land under the right of eminent domain.|$|E
2500|$|The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) or Bakken {{pipeline}} is a [...] underground {{oil pipeline}} in the United States. It {{begins in the}} Bakken shale oil fields in northwest North Dakota and continues through South Dakota and Iowa to the oil tank farm near Patoka, Illinois. Together with the Energy Transfer <b>Crude</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>Pipeline</b> from Patoka to Nederland, Texas, it forms the Bakken system.|$|E

The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are [...] of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope. Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers. Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.|$|E

40|$|Laying two {{pipelines}} in one ditch is a {{new technology}} recently employed by the petroleum companies of China and has great advantages of minimizing environmental disruption as well as bringing tremendous economic and social benefits. In this study, by means of numerical simulations analyses are carried out to evaluate heating energy saving for the operation of two hot <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipelines</b> laid parallel in one ditch.
