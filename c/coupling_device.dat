25|$|Also {{known as}} a Janney coupler and the buckeye coupler, the knuckle coupler is the {{derivative}} of a <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> that links and connects rolling railway cars such as passenger, refrigerator, freight, and stock cars together on railroad track. The knuckle coupler have a bifurcated drawhead and a revolving hook, which, when brought in contact with another coupler, automatically interlocks with its mate. Knuckle couplers replaced the much more dangerous link-and-pin couplers and {{became the basis for}} standard coupler design {{for the rest of the}} 19th century. The knuckle coupler was invented and patented by Eli H. Janney in 1873.|$|E
25|$|The {{fifth wheel}} {{coupling}} provides a pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a fifth wheel configuration, requiring the coupling to be installed {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a coupling pin (or kingpin) {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the fifth wheel coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} found, using a charge <b>coupled</b> <b>device</b> {{detector}} and a novel on chip pre-binning technique, that qualitative high dispersion spectroscopy is possible {{with a small}} telescope and poor seeing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a performance analysis for star trackers that adopt Active Pixel Sensor photodetector technology. They have many advantages on Charge <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices</b> such as low power consumption, single voltage supply needed (3. 3 V or 5 V), increased radiation hardness, simplified qualification procedures, capability of local reset and readout, onchip integrated timing, control, and analog-to-digital conversion. Unfortunately, their noise level {{is higher than}} in Charge <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices.</b> Anyway, this effect can be compensated {{by taking advantage of}} their capability to manage different local exposure times. This allows for tracking bright stars at a faster tracking frequency than the one that is selected for Charge <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices,</b> whereas a slower frequency is set for dim stars. The resulting temporal average of the number of observed stars is closer than the one of single shutter systems to the number of stars observed by Charge <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices.</b> As a consequence, also the accuracy in attitude determination increases because it {{is a function of the}} number of detected stars. An analytical investigation of the attainable accuracy is discussed. All sensor noise sources are considered and their effects are evaluated as a function of the exposure time. The resulting accuracy turns out to be in the range 1 - 3 arcsec that is the one requested for low cost star sensors...|$|R
