50|$|The {{original}} mills {{around the}} which the village grew have now gone, though their sites have been partially re-used for light industry. Recent {{years have seen}} {{the closure of the}} bulk of the remaining manufacturing industry in the village, including specialised textiles, joinery and <b>constructional</b> <b>timber.</b> Whilst there are still employment opportunities in the shops, schools and other village services, or on the surrounding farms, the majority of working residents now commute to Bradford, Keighley, Halifax or Leeds.|$|E
40|$|The current {{designs of}} thermal {{insulation}} for buildings {{concentrate on the}} achievement of the required heat transmission coefficient. However, another factor that cannot be neglected is the assessment of the possible water vapour condensation inside the construction. The aim {{of the study was to}} find out whether the designed modification of the cladding structure of an existing log house will or will not lead to a risk of possible water vapour condensation in the walls after an additional thermal insulation mounting. The condensation could result in the increase in moisture of the walls and consequently the <b>constructional</b> <b>timber,</b> which would lead to the reduction of the timber construction strength, wood degradation by biotic factors – wood-destroying insects, mildew or wood-destroying fungi. The main task was to compare the theoretically established values of moisture of the <b>constructional</b> <b>timber</b> with the values measured inside the construction using a specific example of a thermal insulated log house. Three versions of thermal insulation were explored to find the solution of a log house reconstruction which would be the optimum for living purposes. Two versions deal with the cladding structure with the insulation from the interior, the third version deals with an external insulation. In a calculation model the results can be affected to a great degree by input values (boundary conditions). This especially concerns the factor of vapour barrier diffusion resistance, which is entered in accordance with the producer’s specifications; however, its real value can be lower as it depends on the perfectness and correctness of the technological procedure. That is why the study also includes thermal technical calculations of all designed insulation versions in the most unfavourable situation, which includes the degradation of the vapour barrier down to 10 % efficiency, i. e. the reduction of the diffusion resistance factor to 10 % of the original value. Moreover, the dependence of the weight moisture of timber inside the insulated cladding on temperature-moisture changes in the internal and external ambient environment was examined...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 71 - 83. A {{variety of}} studies have shown the {{problems}} of energy supply faced by low-income communities in southern Africa. Most of these communities are dependent upon indigenous fuelwood supplies. In addition, many of these communities use indigenous wood for construction. This largely uncontrolled utilisation imposes severe threats on woody vegetation communities. The Eastern Cape/Ciskei region {{is an area where}} energy supply problems are particularly severe and impacts on woody vegetation correspondingly severe. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using remote sensing techniques to monitor the the impact caused by collection of wood in the Eastern Cape/Ciskei forest and thicket communities. A variety of remote sensing techniques for landcover analysis were investigated. In all cases, visual interpretation was used because it is considerably cheaper and demands less technical expertise than would computer processing. In addition, many studies have shown visual interpretation to be superior. Maps were drawn from multitemporal aerial photograph sequences and from Landsat and SPOT satellite images. These maps showed that there has been relatively little change in area of woody vegetation in the study area since 1956. However, field studies showed that vegetation community structure had been degraded as a result of intense and sustained human impact. This qualitative decline also reflected a decline in usefulness of the woody vegetation of the area to local communities. This substantial degradation was not visible on any of the remote sensing imageries. This emphasises that field-based checks to monitor human impacts on forest and thicket formations are essential. Strategies for reducing the dependence of low-income communities on indigenous vegetation for energy supplies and <b>constructional</b> <b>timber</b> have been reviewed from the literature and these are descibed in Appendix 1. Most successful strategies {{in other parts of the}} world have been the result of a national commitment to tree planting, recognition of a multiplicity of constraints and the voluntary involvement of the communities the strategies are intended to assist...|$|E
50|$|Built between 1897 and 1899 out of {{the stones}} found in the {{immediate}} locality, and constructed directly onto outcrops of exposed Charnwood bedrock, Stoneywell creates the impression it is an organic part of the landscape. Set away from the road, it is close to Stoneywell Wood and its surrounding gardens are by design and necessity more wild than cultivated. The house is built on a slope and approached from above so that a visitor is required to walk round the house {{to get to the}} front door, which faces south-west over the rugged landscape. At one end the roof almost reaches the ground, and the massive chimney stack buttresses the south wall. The roof, like many of Gimson's houses, was originally thatch, but following a fire in 1938 was re-roofed in second-hand Swithland slates. The rooms, windows and roofline step downwards, along the open z-shape of the groundplan, to follow the contours of the hill, such that the ground floor is on three levels, and both groundfloor and dormer windows are all at different heights. The fireplace and doorway have huge Swithland slate lintels, that were found nearby at abandoned slate quarries. The stone walls were built from undressed stones, their surfaces being kept even by the careful selection of each stone by the masons, to fit needs of the wall. Many of the stones were re-used from dry stone walls already on the site, or recovered from the boulder clay and outcrops around about. Externally the stone has been left in a natural state, whereas internally both the walls and the exposed timbers are white. These <b>constructional</b> <b>timbers,</b> matching the intricate irregularities of the ground plan, had been cut and prepared by Richard Harrison at Sapperton, Gloucestershire to Ernest Gimson's design, and transported the 150 miles for assembly on site, showing how much pre-planning and design had gone into Gimson's plan. In 1966 it was listed as a Grade II* listed building.|$|R
50|$|Slade Hall is a {{timber house}} on a low stone base built {{at the end of}} the 16th century, and still {{preserving}} its ancient front. It is of two storeys, the upper one projecting on a plaster cove, and has two gables on the principal elevation facing east. The front has been extended northward by an addition, built about 1681, the end of which faces the road, and is now painted to imitate half-timber work. The north end of the house was formerly continued eastward as a projecting wing, but the buildings, which were of brick, and two storeys in height, have been pulled down in recent times. The present front of the 17th-century addition was rebuilt after the demolition of these buildings in a style harmonizing with the original timber elevation. The length of the principal front is now about 70 ft, but the original building consists only of the middle portion under the two gables and the wing to the south. These stand on three different planes, the main gable being 18 ft in front of the southern end of the house, and the porch and staircase bay occupying the angle between them. The timber front is composed principally of straight diagonal pieces between the <b>constructional</b> <b>timbers,</b> but has quatrefoil panels in the smaller gable. On a beam over the porch is cut, or stamped, the date 1585 and the initials E. S. for Edward Siddall the builder of the house. Underneath are the initials G. S. (George Siddall, his son). The date 1585 is also on another beam in the front. The two dates and the initials E. S. are enclosed in ornamental borders. The west and south sides have been faced in brick, and a block added at the north-west, which is a rather good specimen of the dignified brick architecture of the early part of the 19th century. The roofs are covered with modern blue slates, and the chimneys are of brick.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a new seismic {{protection}} system for timber platform frame buildings, either for retrofit or for new construction. The system consists in connecting the timber frame to a steel framed structure that includes hysteretic energy dissipators designed to absorb most of the seismic input energy thus protecting the timber frame and the other steel members; alternatively, the system might contain other dissipative devices. The steel structure comprises horizontal beam-like elements, vertical column-like elements and chevron-like bracing members; the beam-like elements are steel belts embracing each slab {{of the building and}} the bracing members hold the energy dissipators. The steel structure is self-supporting, i. e. the timber frame is not affected by horizontal actions and can be designed without accounting for any seismic provision; in turn, the steel members do not participate in the main carrying-loads system. The timber-steel contact is even, smoothed and spread; it guarantees that the yielding of the dissipators is prior to any timber failure. This research belongs to a wider project aiming to promote the structural and <b>constructional</b> use of <b>timber</b> by improving the seismic capacity of wooden buildings; this research includes experiments and advanced numerical simulation aiming to derive accurate design criteria.
