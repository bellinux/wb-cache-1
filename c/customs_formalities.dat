According to {{official}} sources, Dziekański required language support to complete initial <b>customs</b> <b>formalities.</b> After he completed initial immigration processing, his whereabouts between 4:00 p.m. and about 10:45 p.m. remain unclear, though at various points he was seen around the baggage carousels. Dziekański's mother, Zofia Cisowski, {{had told him to}} wait for her at the baggage claim area but it was a secured area where she was not allowed to enter. At 10:45 p.m., when he attempted to leave the Customs hall, he was directed again to secondary immigration as his visa had not yet been processed. Dziekański's immigration procedures were completed at about 12:15 a.m. on October 14. After 30 minutes in an immigration waiting area, he was taken to the international arrivals reception area. Cisowski had been making enquiries of airport staff since the early afternoon. Airport staff told her Dziekański was not at the airport and she had returned to Kamloops at about 10 p.m., believing her son had missed his flight.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, as the {{increasingly}} intense {{international trade and}} logistics, the administrative burden of customs has been dramatically raised. In order to reduce repetitive taxing work and promote automatic administration, custom warehouses with electronic declaration systems are introduced and implemented by EU countries. The owner of custom warehouses can postpone the payment of import duties {{under the supervision of}} customs in case these goods are re-exported. The implementation of customwarehouses has significantly simplified <b>custom</b> <b>formality</b> and enhance administrative efficiency. However, its successful management highly depends on the accuracy and reliability of inventory information. Inaccurate inventory records may lead to a variety of undesirable effects, such as troubles in taxing and compliance failure with custom terms. As the common way to address this problem in the past, the traditional physical auditing is always time-consuming and costly, especially when the inventory is various and massive. Moreover, since the multiple stakeholders involvement in custom warehouses, the fault detection and diagnosis processes for inventory record inaccuracy in reality are usually problematic and complicated. Without the effective communication and cooperation between different stakeholders, it is difficult to solve inventory record inaccuracy issues and to guarantee the efficiency and reliability of customwarehousemanagement.
