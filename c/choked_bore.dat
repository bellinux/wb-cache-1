The London Trial of 1875 pitted <b>choke</b> <b>bores</b> and cylinder guns of various manufacturers in four categories—Class 1 (large bores, any <b>boring),</b> Class 2 (<b>Choke</b> <b>bores,</b> 12 gauge), Class 3 (Guns of English boring or Cylinders) and Class 4 (Small gauges, any <b>boring).</b> The <b>choke</b> <b>bored</b> guns performed better that the cylinder guns in all these tests, and W.W. Greener <b>choke</b> <b>bore</b> guns won the class 1, class 2 and class 4 categories. Greener <b>Choke</b> <b>bores</b> also won at the London Gun Trials of 1877 and 1879, and the Chicago Field Gun Trial of 1879. The results of these trials were responsible for making the W.W.

5000|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>choke</b> <b>bores</b> was {{largely responsible for}} the fame of the W.W. Greener name. The invention of <b>choke</b> <b>boring</b> is usually attributed to American gunsmiths. The first known patents for <b>choke</b> <b>boring</b> were granted to a Mr. Sylvester H. Roper, an American inventor and gunsmith, ( [...] , Improvement In Revolving Fire-Arms, April 10, 1866; and , Improvements In Detachable Muzzle For Shot-Guns, dated July 14, 1868.) This was followed by a patent claim in London by Mr. Pape, an English Gun maker, whose patent application was six weeks too late to the 1866 Roper patent. Mr. J.W. Long, in his book [...] "American Wildfowling", credits a Mr. Jeremiah Smith of Southfield, Rhode Island, as the gunsmith who first discovered the concept, as far back as 1827.|$|R
5000|$|W. W. Greener's first intimation of the choke {{formation}} {{was derived}} from instructions given in a customer's letter, in early 1874. The customer's instructions described a choke, but did not give any details on the size or shape, or how {{it was to be}} obtained. Hence, Greener had to conduct many experiments to determine the perfect shape and size of a choke for a given bore. After that, he developed tools to produce the <b>choke</b> <b>bore</b> profile correctly and smoothly. The system of <b>choke</b> <b>boring</b> that he pioneered was so successful that it was later adopted by other manufacturers and hence, some authorities give him the credit for inventing the concept, since his method became the first repeatable method of <b>choke</b> <b>boring.</b> William Wellington Greener is thus widely credited as being the inventor of the first practical choke, as documented in his classic 1888 publication, The Gun and its Development.|$|R

50|$|In December 1874, {{the first}} mention of Greener's <b>choke</b> <b>bore</b> {{appeared}} {{in an article}} by J.H. Walsh, the editor of Field magazine. The article mentioned the extraordinary shot pattern that the Greener shotgun could produce. The next issue came with an advertisement from Greener, stating that the firm would guarantee that their new guns would shoot a closer pattern than any other manufacturer. The advertisement claimed that Greener 12 bores were warranted to shoot an average pattern of 210, when the best 12 bore gun in the London Gun Trial of 1866 could only average 127. Naturally, the advertisement generated considerable controversy, especially from rival manufacturers of cylinder guns, who refused to believe the numbers quoted in the advertisement.|$|R

Kurt had {{to get his hands}} on this German, and when he did it liberated a strange and terrible joy in him. No weapon would have sufficed. Hardly aware of Nash's blows, Kurt tore at him, swung and <b>choked</b> him, <b>bore</b> him down on the bank, and there beat him into a sodden, bloody-faced heap.|$|R
5000|$|The M37 came in two styles, Standard and Boy's Model (introduced 1958). Modified <b>choke</b> or {{cylinder}} <b>bore</b> was furnished at {{no extra}} charge on special order only. The M37 was chambered {{in the following}} gauges and shells respectively: 12, 16, 20, 28, and 410 using 2 3/4", 2 3/4", 2 3/4", 2 7/8", 3" [...] shells. The M37 unit weight was between 5 3/4 to 6 lbs, the fluctuation was dependent on the chambered gauge.|$|R
50|$|For older {{shotguns}} {{having only}} one fixed choke, intended primarily for equally-likely use against rabbits, squirrels, quail, doves, and pheasant, an often-chosen choke is the improved cylinder, in a 28 in barrel, making the shotgun {{suitable for use}} as a general all-round hunting shotgun, without having excess weight. Shotguns having fixed chokes intended for geese, in contrast, are often found with full choke barrels, in longer lengths, and are much heavier, being intended for fixed use within a blind against distant targets. Defensive shotguns with fixed chokes generally have a cylinder <b>bore</b> <b>choke.</b> Likewise, shotguns intended primarily for use with slugs invariably also are found with a choke that is a cylinder bore.|$|R
40|$|The electrogun metal vapor plasma {{discharge}} {{is a new}} high-power pulsed device for producing vapors of different metals. The process employs electrode erosion to vaporize one of the discharge electrodes. The eroded metal vapor is subsequently ionized to form a dense plasma in which a high current discharge is sustained. The vapor plasma then exits the discharge {{where it can be}} used in the synthesis of novel materials or as an ignitor for electrothermal – chemical guns. A model for the electrogun discharge bore plasma ow, bore wall erosion, and simpli ed models for the cathode and anode regions are presented in this paper. The bore plasma ows under local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions and is weakly nonideal. Two electrogun shots involving different cathode materials (aluminum and titanium) are sim-ulated. Results reveal the physics underlying the operation of the electrogun discharge. High pressures of the bore plasma result in thermal <b>choking</b> at <b>bore</b> exit. Cathode material erosion dominates over the bore wall erosion, thus ensuring a relatively pure metal vapor yield. The exit parameters of the electrogun are predicted and can be used as input boundary conditions for analysis of the external plasma jet ow...|$|R
5000|$|Solid {{propellant}} boosters are not controllable {{and must}} generally burn until exhaustion after ignition, unlike liquid propellant or cold-gas propulsion systems. However, launch abort systems and range safety destruct systems can attempt {{to cut off}} propellant flow by using shaped charges. [...] estimates for SRB failure rates have ranged from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 100,000. SRB assemblies have failed suddenly and catastrophically. Nozzle blocking or deformation can lead to overpressure or a reduction in thrust, while defects in the boosters casing or stage couplings can cause the assembly to break apart by increasing aerodynamic stresses. Additional failure modes include <b>bore</b> <b>choking</b> and combustion instability. Failure of an O-ring seal on the Space Shuttle Challengers right solid rocket booster led to its disintegration shortly after liftoff.|$|R
5000|$|For {{shotguns}} with fixed chokes {{integral to}} the barrel, it is sometimes still possible to change the choke to a tighter choke. This is done by increasing {{the diameter of the}} bore inside the barrel for a short length of barrel, while the portion of the barrel and bore nearest the muzzle is left as it was. The effect is to form what is called a [...] "jug choke" [...] or a [...] "reverse choke". [...] This method is sometimes used by gunsmiths to implement a tighter choke on an existing gun without replaceable chokes, and can be done without requiring replacement of a barrel and without installing new screw-in replaceable chokes. Advantages claimed for a [...] "jug choke" [...] include improved patterns, reduction of recoil, and an increase of choke in a shotgun that does not have replaceable choke tubes. When a [...] "jug choke" [...] is implemented in an existing <b>choked</b> barrel, the <b>bore</b> inside the bored-out section of barrel effectively becomes [...] "overbored", and this also typically lessens the amount of shot deformation, thereby increasing the shot pattern density.|$|R
