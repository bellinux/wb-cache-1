Also, nitrogen is helpful in such standard industry processes as neutral tempering, cementing, hard brazing, stress relieving, <b>cyanide</b> <b>hardening,</b> metal-powder sintering and extrusion die cooling.|$|E
5000|$|Punchcutting: If the glyph design {{includes}} {{enclosed spaces}} (counters) then a counterpunch is made. The counter shapes are transferred in relief (cameo) onto {{the end of}} a rectangular bar of mild steel using a specialized engraving tool called a graver. The finished counterpunch is hardened by heating and quenching (tempering), or exposure to a <b>cyanide</b> solution (case <b>hardening).</b> The counterpunch is then struck against {{the end of a}} similar rectangular steel bar—the letterpunch—to impress the counter shapes as recessed spaces (intaglio). The outer profile of the glyph is completed by scraping away with a graver the material outside the counter spaces, leaving only the stroke or lines of the glyph. Progress toward the finished design is checked by successive smoke proofs; temporary prints made from a thin coating of carbon deposited on the punch surface by a candle flame. The finished letter punch is finally hardened to withstand the rigors of reproduction by striking. One counterpunch and one letterpunch are produced for every letter or glyph making up a complete font.|$|R
