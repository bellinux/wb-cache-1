[...] Additionally, Waldman wrote: [...] "Braeden's {{contribution}} to the show these past three decades really cannot be understated.

Victor has adopted several nicknames on the show that have carried into the media. This includes [...] "The Mustache" [...] and [...] "The Dark Night". When asked which storyline he felt affinity for or strongly about in his thirty years during an interview with AOL TV, Braeden stated it was the scenes in which he met his dying mother, Cora Miller (Dorothy McGuire), {{for the first time since}} he was seven years old.

2500|$|Retinoic acid via the {{retinoic acid}} {{receptor}} influences {{the process of}} cell differentiation, hence, the growth and development of embryos. During development there is a concentration gradient of retinoic acid along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. Cells in the embryo respond to retinoic acid differently depending on the amount present. For example, in vertebrates the hindbrain transiently forms eight rhombomers and each rhombomere has a specific pattern of genes being expressed. If retinoic acid is not present the last four rhombomeres do not develop. Instead rhombomeres 1–4 grow to cover {{the same amount of}} space as all eight would normally occupy. Retinoic acid has its effects by turning on a differential pattern of Homeobox (Hox) genes which encode different homeodomain transcription factors which in turn <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> cell type specific genes. Deletion of the Homeobox (Hox-1) gene from rhombomere 4 makes the neurons growing in that region behave like neurons from rhombomere 2. [...] Retinoic acid is not required for patterning of the retina as originally proposed, but retinoic acid synthesized in the retina is secreted into surrounding mesenchyme where it is required to prevent overgrowth of perioptic mesenchyme which can cause microphthalmia, defects in the cornea and eyelid, and rotation of the optic cup.|$|E

The map pack includes three new multiplayer maps and one new Nazi Zombies map, entitled [...] "Zombie Verrückt" [...] (...)

I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that.
