40|$|Abstract: The furthest {{dangerous}} cracking type {{of asphalt}} pavement is usually considered of the simplex type crack(namely shear crack) under traffic load, but the so-called type crack {{should be the}} compound cracking at the concurrence of I type crack (namely splay crack) and type crack. In order to study the compound type crack propagation behavior of asphalt concrete, a three point bending beam with compound type notched has been designed. Asymmetry-gap small girder specimens of asphalt concrete are adopted in the test, and the <b>central</b> <b>testing</b> equipment is MTS. A series of compound type three point bending beam tests have been performed to simulate compound type crack initiation and growth. The propagation of compound type crack is studied by a newly developed numerical code, Rock Failure Process Analysis (RFPA 2 D). it is shown that the crack initiation angle and the peak load increased as {{the distance of the}} preexisting crack from the midpoint of the beam increased, the crack propagation path follows some regularity in general and the main force of crack propagation is still tensile stress. Through this work, the understanding of the mechanism about damage and early destroy of asphalt pavement can be advanced and it can provide guidance for asphalt pavement design and maintenance...|$|E

Progeny were weaned at an average of 129 d and given ad libitum access to a high energy finishing diet postweaning. Progeny traits of interest were weaning weight, preweaning average daily gain (ADG), postweaning ADG, final weight, final weight per day of age (WDA), hot carcass weight (HCW), fat thickness (FT), longissimus muscle area (LMA), and carcass length. Progeny performance was regressed on sire's <b>central</b> <b>test</b> performance (ADG, final weight, ultrasound FT, and ultrasound LMA). Paternal half-sib and parent-offspring heritability estimates for the traits of interest were also calculated. Regression coefficients were only significantly different from zero for progeny postweaning ADG and final WDA when regressed on sire's ADG and final weight, and progeny FT when regressed on sire's ultrasound FT. When regressed on sire's average daily gain, the coefficients for postweaning ADG and WDA were 0. 18 ? 0. 10 and 0. 12 ? 0. 05, respectively. The coefficients, when regressed on sire's final weight, were 0. 0011 ? 0. 00044 for ADG and 0. 0004 ? 0. 0002 for final WDA. Paternal half-sib heritability estimates ranged from 0. 21 for carcass length to 0. 84 for postweaning average daily gain. Parent-offspring heritability estimates were 0. 36 for postweaning ADG, 0. 12 for final weight, 0. 34 for FT, and 0. 12 for LMA. The estimated correlation coefficient between feed consumption and sire's ADG was 0. 35 and was different from zero (P < 0. 01).
