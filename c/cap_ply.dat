40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the finite element modelling of a steel belted radial tyre under static contact load using ABAQUS code. The model combines the 3 D {{parts of the}} complex tread patterns and the quasi axisymmetric part of the tyre in which the tread blocks are not included. These two sections were meshed separately and linked together using a tying algorithm implemented in the code. The fibber reinforced parts of the tyre including ply, belts, and <b>cap</b> <b>ply</b> were modelled using rebar layer embedded in the surface elements. A hyperelastic material model was {{used in conjunction with}} a linear elastic one to describe the stress-strain behaviour of rubber and reinforcing fibres, respectively. The developed model was used to simulate the 175 / 70 R 14 steel-belted radial tyre subjected to inflation and contact loads. Three belts angles were selected to examine the effect of belt angle variations on the mechanical behaviour of the tyre. In addition, the results were also compared with a similar tyre model in which a simply ribbed tread was used instead of complex tread pattern. The friction between tread surface and contact road surface was simulated using the Coulomb’s friction law. The numerical results and also the comparison of experimentally measured tyre deflection under concentrated vertical load revealed that neglecting the details of the tread blocks has very minor effect on the predicted tyre deformation. However, differences can be large enough when considering secondary or higher variables such as contact pressure, stress, and strain energies. It is also shown that a belt angle of 20 o is the best comprised value among the selected design parameters...|$|E
40|$|A {{full scale}} carbon {{phenolic}} heat shield was fabricated for the Outer Planet Probe {{in order to}} demonstrate the feasibility of molding large carbon phenolic parts with a new fabrication processing method (multistep). The sphere-cone heat shield was molded as an integral unit with the nose <b>cap</b> <b>plies</b> configured into a double inverse chevron shape to achieve the desired ply orientation. The fabrication activity was successful and the feasibility of the multistep processing technology was established. Delaminations or unbonded plies were visible on the heat shield and resulted from excessive loss of resin and lack of sufficient pressure applied on the part during the curing cycle. A comprehensive heat shield characterization test program was conducted, including: nondestructive tests with the full scale heat shield and thermal and mechanical property tests with small test specimen...|$|R

5000|$|The wing has {{a single}} box spar with spruce webs and <b>ply</b> <b>caps.</b> [...] Plywood skin forward around {{the nose of the}} wing forms a D-shaped torsion box ahead of the spar and there is fabric {{covering}} aft, including the ailerons. In plan the wing centre section has constant chord; there are airbrakes which open above the wing only, placed immediately aft of the spar and about two-thirds the way out along this section. The outer wing panels are tapered on both edges and have semi-elliptical tips; ailerons, hinged parallel to the trailing edge fill these panels spanwise. On each side a single, faired, metal wing bracing strut runs from the lower fuselage longeron to the wing spar at about half centre section span. The horizontal tail is of similar construction to the wing and largely fabric covered, mounted on top of the fuselage far enough forward to place the trailing edge of the split elevator ahead of the rudder hinge. The fin is small and straight edged but the rudder, again fabric covered, is full and slightly curved; it is horn balanced and extends down to the keel.|$|R
40|$|In this study, design considerations, {{structural}} analysis and manufacturing techniques for hat-stiffened composite panels were investigated. The material {{used in this}} study was unidirectional carbon fibres preimpregnated with bismaleimide resin, Cytec's Rigidite 5250 - 4 and the carbon fibres were Hercules Corp. Magnamite continuous type IM 7. A stiffened panel configuration consisting of a flat 12 -ply skin and three equally spaced longitudinal hat-shaped stiffeners, having a web of 12 plies, a flange of 5 <b>plies</b> and a <b>cap</b> of 24 <b>plies,</b> was designed. The co-curing manufacturing technique was used to produce the stiffened composite panel and simple techniques were developed to efficiently lay up plies for stiffener elements and built-up composite structure. The panel was designed to carry loads after the initiation of skin buckling. Both the buckling and post-buckling behavior were predicted using the finite element method (NISA Code). The 3 -D laminated composite general shell element was used in the modeling. A quarter of the whole panel was modeled, due to the symmetry, using a total of 864 8 -node quadrilateral elements with 2566 active nodes. The panel was tested in compression to verify its structural performance. Strain and load outputs were gathered by a data acquisition system (Sciemetric System 200) and recorded by a computer. The shadow Moire technique was used to monitor buckling patterns during the test. The finite element predictions were compared with the test data and good agreement was obtained...|$|R
