The complete system {{is a combination of}} several standard items of equipment and a newly developed intelligent data logger which has the capability to send data directly to a large scale computer for reduction and plotting. The data logging and all interfacing with peripheral equipment are accomplished using digital electronics. The heart of the system is a four-bit microprocessor and digital cassette tape unit. The system, which is controlled by instructions from a cathode ray tube terminal, has the capability to transmit data from the <b>cassette</b> <b>unit</b> to a large computer via a time sharing option.

40|$|Compact vision testing {{apparatus}} is described for testing {{a large number}} of physiological characteristics of the eyes and visual system of a human subject. The head of the subject is inserted into a viewing port at one end of a light-tight housing containing various optical assemblies. Visual acuity and other refractive characteristics and ocular muscle balance characteristics of the eyes of the subject are tested by means of a retractable phoroptor assembly carried near the viewing port and a film <b>cassette</b> <b>unit</b> carried in the rearward portion of the housing (the latter selectively providing a variety of different visual targets which are viewed through the optical system of the phoroptor assembly). The visual dark adaptation characteristics and absolute brightness threshold of the subject are tested by means of a projector assembly which selectively projects one or both of a variable intensity fixation target and a variable intensity adaptation test field onto a viewing screen located {{near the top of the}} housing...|$|E
25|$|Revox went {{one step}} further: after much {{hesitation}} {{about whether to}} accept cassettes as a medium capable for meeting their strict standards from reel-to-reel recorders at all, they produced their B710MK I (Dolby B) and MK II (Dolby B) machines. Both <b>cassette</b> <b>units</b> possessed double capstan drives, but with two independent, electronically controlled capstan motors and two separate reel motors. The head assembly moved by actuating a damped solenoid movement, eliminating all belt drives and other wearable parts. These machines rivaled the Nakamichi in frequency and dynamic range. The B710MKII also achieved 20–20,000Hz and dynamics of over 72dB with Dolby C on chrome and slightly less dynamic range, but greater headroom with metal tapes and Dolby C. Revox adjusted the frequency range on delivery with many years of use in mind: when new, the frequency curve went upwards a few dB at 15–20kHz, aiming for flat response after 15 years of use, and headwear to match.|$|R

40|$|Summary form only given, as follows. A small microcomputer, using a Motorola 6800, {{has been}} developed. Two printed-board {{versions}} have been operating since 1979 in the NA 3 experiment, and about 30 other {{are used for}} test and small experiments in various laboratories. The computer consists of a 2 / 25 or 3 / 25 CAMAC unit, which can be crate controller or branch driver. In normal use, it is connected to SA 400 floppy disks and a terminal. Optionally, interfaces to a <b>cassette</b> <b>unit,</b> PROM programmer and three analog outputs can be operated on the same boards. Total memory size is 11 kbytes PROM (22 kbytes with 2716 memories) and 8 kbit RAM. Software on PROM consists of an input-output monitor, with disassembling facility, editor and local assembler, a fast and easy-to-use floppy disk monitor, and an histogram package, in 7 kbytes PROM. Some macro instructions are recognised in the assembler: message printing, CAMAC functions, initialisations and are then very easily performed. (0 refs) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{rationale}} for {{the study was to}} determine if music could be used as an effective reinforcer for increasing appropriate practice behaviors, and reduce problem behaviors in the competitive swimming environment. The effects of musical reinforcement were examined with six competitive swimmers. The swimmers were selected by the coach as individuals who did not consistently make effective use of practice sessions. The swimmers were randomly assigned to either a contingent reinforcement group or a noncontingent reinforcement group. A reversal replication ABAB design, was used to compare the groups to standard coaching prodecures. A portable stereo <b>cassette</b> <b>unit</b> was used to present instances of contingent and noncontingent musical reinforcement during the treatment phases. During the noncontingent reinforcement phase, music was presented to the swimmers regardless of the behaviors emitted during the dry land training sessions. Music was only presented in the contingent reinforcement phase if 20 percent of appropriate behaviors was achieved. Differences in performance levels during the contingent and noncontingent phases were recorded and compared. Since the experimental design in this study was based on the steady state method, departures from the baseline were used to evaluate the treatment. Results indicated that there was a large and immediate effect shown during the contingent reinforcement conditions for all subjects when compared to the baseline phases. Slight improvements were noted during the noncontingent phase for two of the subjects, however a much larger and more consistent effect was demonstrated with these subjects when they were later switched to the contingent phase. At the conclusion of the study, social validation questionnaires were distributed to the swimmers and the coach. The questionnaires asked the athletes and coach to evaluate the goals, procedures and results produced by the intervention. Social validation measures indicated that 3 out of 4 subjects rated the procedure positively, felt the procedure improved the dry land training period and wished to have the procedures continued in the future. Data suggests possible benefits of using a musical reinforcement condition might be obtained in other sports settings and could be investigated further. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the contingent reinforcement condition produced improved time usage during the dry land training sessions. Results indicated an increase in the percentages of appropriate behaviors per session and a decrease in the frequency of inappropriate behaviors occurred when the independent variable was applied...|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{for the first}} time the transcriptional response of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae to fluctuating concentrations of arginine, an essential amino acid for this bacterium. By means of DNA microarray analyses, several operons and genes were found, the expression of which was affected by the concentration of arginine in the medium. Five of the identified operons were demonstrated to be directly repressed in the presence of high arginine concentrations via the concerted action of the ArgR-type regulators ArgR 1 and AhrC. These ArgR 1 /AhrC targets encompass the putative amino acid transport genes artPQ, abpA, abpB, and aapA; the arginine biosynthetic genes argGH; and the virulence genes aliB and lmB/adcAII-phtD encoding an oligopeptide-binding lipoprotein and cell surface Zn 2 -scavenging units, respectively. In addition, the data indicate that three of the amino acid transport genes encode an arginine ATP-binding <b>cassette</b> transporter <b>unit</b> required for efficient growth during arginine limitation. Instead of regulating arginine biosynthetic and catabolic genes as has been reported for other Gram-positive bacteria, our findings suggest that the physiological function of ArgR 1 /AhrC in S. pneumoniae is to ensure optimal uptake of arginine from the surrounding milieu. ...|$|R

The aim of the ten day experiment {{was to investigate the}} effect of microgravity on single plant cells. Fully automated experiment <b>cassettes</b> (Plunger Box <b>Units)</b> were developed by Centre for Concepts in Mechatronics (Nuenen, the Netherlands). Tobacco BY- 2 cells were immobilized in a semi- solid agarose matrix that was reinforced by a nylon mesh. This assembly allowed liquid medium refreshment, oxygen supply and chemical fixation, including a post- fixative wash. The method was optimized for post- flight analysis of cell structure,shape and size, cell division, and the microtubule cytoskeleton. The viability of cells in the agarose matrix was similar to cells grown in liquid medium under laboratory conditions, only the stationary growth phase was reached six days late...|$|R
40|$|The Brr 2 helicase {{provides}} the key remodeling activity for spliceosome catalytic activation, during which it disrupts the U 4 /U 6 di-snRNP (small nuclear RNA protein), and its activity {{has to be}} tightly regulated. Brr 2 exhibits an unusual architecture, including an ∼ 500 -residue N-terminal region, whose functions and molecular mechanisms are presently unknown, followed by a tandem array of structurally similar helicase <b>units</b> (<b>cassettes),</b> only {{the first of which}} is catalytically active. Here, we show by crystal structure analysis of full-length Brr 2 in complex with a regulatory Jab 1 /MPN domain of the Prp 8 protein and by cross-linking/mass spectrometry of isolated Brr 2 that the Brr 2 N-terminal region encompasses two folded domains and adjacent linear elements that clamp and interconnect the helicase cassettes. Stepwise N-terminal truncations led to yeast growth and splicing defects, reduced Brr 2 association with U 4 /U 6 •U 5 tri-snRNPs, and increased ATP-dependent disruption of the tri-snRNP, yielding U 4 /U 6 di-snRNP and U 5 snRNP. Trends in the RNA-binding, ATPase, and helicase activities of the Brr 2 truncation variants are fully rationalized by the crystal structure, demonstrating that the N-terminal region autoinhibits Brr 2 via substrate competition and conformational clamping. Our results reveal molecular mechanisms that prevent premature and unproductive tri-snRNP disruption and suggest novel principles of Brr 2 -dependent splicing regulation...|$|R

One of the main factors limiting to cassava production is disease. More than 30 bacterial, fungal, viral and mycoplasma diseases attack cassava, causing losses in stand and vigor, reduced photosynthetic capacity and root rot. The following diseases are described and illustrated: (a) bacterial - CBB (Xanthomonas manihotis), bacterial stem rot (Erwinia carotovora var. carotovora), bacterial necrosis (Xanthomonas cassavae), stem gall (Agrobacterium tumefaciens); (b) Viral and mycoplasma -AMD, common mosaic, leaf vein mosaic, frog skin, witches'-broom; (c) fungal leaf diseases - brown leaf spot (Cercosporidium henningsii = Cercospora henningsii), leaf blight (Cercospora vicosae), white leaf spot (Phaeoramularia manihotis = Cercospora caribaea), concentric-ring leaf spot (Phoma spp. = Phyllosticta), cassava ash (Oidium manihotis), superelongation (Sphaceloma manihoticola), anthracnose (Glomerella manihotis = Colletotrichum manihotis), rust (Uromyces spp.), Periconia leaf spot (Periconia shyamala); fungal stem diseases -necrosis caused by Glomerella sp. and Botryodiplodia sp. and rot caused by basidiomycetes or ascomycetes; root rots -preharvest. rots caused by Phytophthora drechsleri, Pythium spp., Rosellinia necatrix, Rigidoporus lignosus (equal Fomes lignosus), Armillariella mellea (equal Armillaria mellea), and postharvest rots (microbial and physiological).

40|$|Abstract Background Conserved domains are {{recognized}} as {{the building blocks of}} eukaryotic proteins. Domains showing a tendency to occur in diverse combinations (‘promiscuous’ domains) are involved in versatile architectures in proteins with different functions. Current models, based on global-level analyses of domain combinations in multiple genomes, have suggested that the propensity of some domains to associate with other domains in high-level architectures increases with organismal complexity. Alternative models using domain-based phylogenetic trees propose that domains have become promiscuous independently in different lineages through convergent evolution and are, thus, random with no functional or structural preferences. Here we test whether complex protein architectures have occurred by accretion from simpler systems and whether the appearance of multidomain combinations parallels organismal complexity. As a model, we analyze the modular evolution of the PWWP domain and ask whether its appearance in combinations with other domains into multidomain architectures is linked with the occurrence of more complex life-forms. Whether high-level combinations of domains are conserved and transmitted as stable <b>units</b> (<b>cassettes)</b> through evolution is examined in the genomes of plant or metazoan species selected for their established position {{in the evolution of the}} respective lineages. Results Using the domain-tree approach, we analyze the evolutionary origins and distribution patterns of the promiscuous PWWP domain to understand the principles of its modular evolution and its existence in combination with other domains in higher-level protein architectures. We found that as a single module the PWWP domain occurs only in proteins with a limited, mainly, species-specific distribution. Earlier, it was suggested that domain promiscuity is a fast-changing (volatile) feature shaped by natural selection and that only a few domains retain their promiscuity status throughout evolution. In contrast, our data show that most of the multidomain PWWP combinations in extant multicellular organisms (humans or land plants) are present in their unicellular ancestral relatives suggesting they have been transmitted through evolution as conserved linear arrangements (‘cassettes’). Among the most interesting biologically relevant results is the finding that the genes of the two plant Trithorax family subgroups (ATX 1 / 2 and ATX 3 / 4 / 5) have different phylogenetic origins. The two subgroups occur together in the earliest land plants Physcomitrella patens and Selaginella moellendorffii. Conclusion Gain/loss of a single PWWP domain is observed throughout evolution reflecting dynamic lineage- or species-specific events. In contrast, higher-level protein architectures involving the PWWP domain have survived as stable arrangements driven by evolutionary descent. The association of PWWP domains with the DNA methyltransferases in O. tauri and in the metazoan lineage seems to have occurred independently consistent with convergent evolution. Our results do not support models wherein more complex protein architectures involving the PWWP domain occur with the appearance of more evolutionarily advanced life forms. </p...|$|R
