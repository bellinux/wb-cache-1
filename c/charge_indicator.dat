40|$|Road User Charging (RUC) is {{designed}} to reduce congestion and collect revenue {{for the maintenance of}} transportation infrastructure. In order to determine the charges, it is important that appropriate Road User <b>Charging</b> <b>Indicators</b> (RUCI) are defined. This paper focusses on Variable Road User Charging (VRUC) as the more dynamic and flexible compared to Fixed Road User Charging (FRUC), and thus is a better reflection of the utility of the road space. The main issues associated with VRUC are the definition of appropriate <b>charging</b> <b>indicators</b> and their measurement. This paper addresses the former by proposing a number of new <b>charging</b> <b>indicators,</b> considering the equalization of the charges and marginal social cost imposed on others. The measurement of the indicators is addressed by a novel data fusion algorithm for the determination of the vehicle state based on the integration of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) with Dead Reckoning (DR) and road segment information. Statistical analyses are presented in terms of the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) parameters of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability, based on simulation and field tests. It is shown that the proposed fusion model is superior to positioning with GPS only, and GPS plus GLONASS, in terms of all the RNP parameters with a significant improvement in availability...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} the oligolytic {{treatment}} of piggery slurry on a lab-scale level is discussed. A comparison is {{made between the}} results obtained with the oligolytic treatment and non-treatment. Oligolysis, developed by Muller in 1982, is an electrolytic treatment in which small quantities of metal ions (esp. Cu-ions) are dissolved in the slurry. At least two copper electrodes, working alternatively as anode and cathode, are installed in the manure storage tank below the slatted floor or in the external treatment tank. The oligolytic treatment unit has to be fed by a constant current intensity. If necessary, copper resorption can take place by activating two iron electrodes. Two identical barrels, each of them placed in separated places, are filled with 150 l liquid piggery manure. One barrel acts as reference while the other contains two copper electrodes between which a current intensity of 0. 9 A is maintained. Every 30 secondes migration movement inversion of the copper ions occurs. The oligolytic treatment lasts for 91 days. Afterwards the copper electrodes are replaced by an iron electrode couple. A microbiological and chemical analysis of the manure is carried out. During this experiment oligolysis does not cause a significant reduction of the pathogenic <b>charge</b> <b>indicators.</b> It has however been found that the manure treated with oligolysis is much less offensive than the untreated piggery slurry.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} the development, characterization {{and application of}} fluorescence-based, optical pH sensors. Special attention {{is given to the}} dependence of the sensor signal and changes of ionic strength in the analyte solution. Based on three different methods for minimization of this dependence, various sensor membranes are presented in detail. Further, a new concept to reference fluorescence intensity signals is introduced and applied to an optical pH sensor. 	Chapter 1 emphasizes the necessity of precise pH control and measurements by means of examples. An overview of possible fields of pH sensors is given in general. In particular, three different formats of optical pH sensors are presented. Furthermore, the cross-sensitivity of the calibration curve of optical sensors towards ionic strength is mentioned. 	At the beginning of chapter 2, a short, review {{on the development of the}} term �pH� is given, followed by the explanation of the principle of optical pH sensors. The effect of ionic strength on the signal of optical pH sensor is explained by means of the law of Debye and Hückel and the definition of activity coefficients. A paragraph about the state of the art in optical pH sensor technology is followed by the second half of chapter 2, concerning the phenomena luminescence. Beside from basics, also methods for referencing and measurement techniques are explained. 	Chapter 3 {{describes the}} application and spectral properties of commercially available, pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes. HPTS, carboxyfluorescein and fluorescein were checked on their cross-sensitivity towards IS in the range from 25 to 500 mM. According to the theory of Debye and Hückel, the two-fold negative <b>charged</b> <b>indicator</b> fluorescein is less affected by IS than HPTS which carries four negative charges. A novel, partially positive <b>charged</b> <b>indicator</b> shows a contrary change of the dissociation constant. In an equimolar mixture with carboxyfluorescein, the effect of IS was distinctly reduced. 	In chapter 4, two methods are presented based on the principle described previously for the compensation of the effect of IS. The pH-indicator carboxyfluorescein was immobilized on partially amino-modified carboxycellulose. For the first method, the remaining carboxy groups were converted to positively charged groups. Again, mixing positively and negatively charged celluloses made an improvement of the cross-sensitivity towards IS in the range from 25 mM to 500 mM possible. 	For the second method, the negatively charged cellulose strand was partially loaded with negative charges. Six differently charged sensors were checked on their cross-sensitivity towards IS. One sensor shows a minimal cross-sensitivity towards IS and it shows the smallest zeta-potential, meaning a low charge density and a successful compensation of negative and positive charges. 	Chapter 5 deals with the third method for minimization the cross-sensitivity towards IS. Novel, fluorescein-based, lipophilic pH-indicators were embedded in an ion-permeable, charge-free polymer. The indicators were made lipophilic by esterification of the carboxy group with a C 18 alkyl chain. This ester-modification reduces the number of charges to one and zero for basic and acid form, respectively. As a result of the charge reduction, the effect of IS is reduced to minimum and becomes negligible in the range from 25 to 500 mM. The fluorescent dyes differ in their substituents at 2 �- and 7 �-position of the xanthene structure. This variation of substituents results in dissociation constants between 5. 5 and 8. 5. Sensor properties like photo stability, temperature dependence and fluorescent lifetime were analyzed and discussed in detail. Finally, two applications using these sensor membranes were demonstrated. 	The chapter 6 deals with new amino-modified polymers. The polymers were embedded in hydrogel together with pH-inert reference particles. The fluorescence intensity of the sensors is converted into a phase shift by means of a novel referencing method (Dual Lifetime Referencing) using luminophores with different fluorescent decay times...|$|R
