5|$|A {{new problem}} confronted the Confederates. The {{dead and wounded}} of Grant's army lay {{in the heat of}} Mississippi summer, the odor of the {{deceased}} men and horses fouling the air, the wounded <b>crying</b> <b>for</b> medical help and water. Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it a show of weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.|$|E

Domingo Matheu was the most affected one by his death, {{to the point of}} <b>crying</b> <b>for</b> it. Alberti was replaced in the Junta by Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, a decided morenist. Saavedra and Funes did not like him, but with the social commotion generated by Alberti's death, they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination.|$|E

5|$|Edgardo {{was visited}} {{by his father}} several times under the {{supervision}} of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome <b>crying</b> <b>for</b> his parents, and that the boy wanted nothing more than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's <b>crying</b> <b>for</b> his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the only thing she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, the Landlord {{is brought to}} the triad boss, who {{increases}} his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus {{are more concerned about}} the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them {{with the rest of the}} money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby <b>crying</b> <b>for</b> them as a blood sample is taken from his arm. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.|$|E

5|$|The Bhramapureeswarar temple, {{also called}} Sattainathar temple, {{is an ancient}} temple complex {{dedicated}} to Shiva, and has three Shiva shrines. The temple is mentioned in the Saiva canonical work, Tevaram, by Thirugnana Sambanthar, Tirunavukkarasar and Sundarar, the foremost Saivite saints of 7th–eighth century CE and is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. There is a separate shrine for Sambandar celebrating the miracle of Parvathi suckling the child Sambandar when he was <b>crying</b> <b>for</b> milk. Shiva is worshipped in three different forms; the Shivalingam (Bhrammapureeswarar), Uma Maheswarar (Toniappar) at the middle level, and Bhairavar (Sattanathar) at the upper level. The original temple was enlarged {{during the period of}} Kulothunga Chola I, Vikrama Chola, Kulothunga Chola II and Kulothunga Chola III (as in Chidambaram – 11th through the 13th centuries). Every year in the Tamil month of Chithirai (April – May), a 10-day festival is celebrated.|$|E
5|$|The mass {{deportation}} of Jews {{from the}} Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July 1942 {{with the first}} shipment of 6,000 people. The gas chambers started operation the following morning. For the next two months, deportations from Warsaw continued {{on a daily basis}} via two shuttle trains (the second one, from 6 August 1942), each carrying about 4,000 to 7,000 people <b>crying</b> <b>for</b> water. No other trains were allowed to stop at the Treblinka station. The first daily trains came in the early morning, often after an overnight wait, and the second, in mid-afternoon. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the Sonderkommando squad that managed the arrival platform, and from there to the gas chambers. According to German records, including the official report by SS Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, 265,000 Jews were transported in freight trains from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka during the period from 22 July to 12 September 1942.|$|E
5|$|Daphnomeles {{participated in}} the {{subsequent}} conflicts against Tsar Samuel, but his greatest feat was the capture of the Bulgarian leader Ibatzes in 1018, {{for which he is}} given a prominent position in Skylitzes's work. Following the defeat at the Battle of Kleidion in 1015, Bulgarian resistance began to collapse. By 1018, most Bulgarian commanders had surrendered, and only Ibatzes, who had retreated with his followers to the royal estate of Pronista, a naturally strong and defensible highland position, continued to resist. He rejected both bribes and threats from the Byzantines, and for 55 days, the Byzantine army under Emperor Basil II remained encamped at Deabolis nearby, waiting for his surrender. At that point, and as local crowds gathered to Ibatzes's palace for the feast of the Dormition, Daphnomeles, now strategos of nearby Achrida, on his own initiative, resolved to end the impasse. With only two escorts, he climbed the way to the estate, and announced himself to Ibatzes. Ibatzes, believing that Daphnomeles would not have come alone unless he intended to forge an alliance against Basil, retreated with the strategos to a secluded wooded glade in the gardens for a private discussion. There, Daphnomeles and his two hidden associates sprang on the Bulgarian general, blinded him, and carried him to the upper story of the palace, through the assembled crowds who were too stunned to react. When the Bulgarians recovered, they gathered underneath the building <b>crying</b> <b>for</b> revenge. Daphnomeles, however, addressed them and managed to convince them of the futility of further resistance, and to lay down their arms and seek the emperor's pardon.|$|E
