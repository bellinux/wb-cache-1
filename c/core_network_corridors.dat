This {{will be used to}} create a geographical and technical database (TENtec) that can show the ETCS deployment status on the Trans-European Network. From the comparative overview the commission wants to identify the needs for additional coordination measures to support the implementation. Synchronous with the publication of ETCS SRS 3.6.0 on 15 June 2017 the Regulation 2016/796/EC was published. It mandates the replacement of the European Railways Agency by the European Union Agency for Railways. The agency was tasked with the creation of a regulatory framework for a Single European Railway Area (SERA) in the 4th Railway Package to be resolved in late June 2016. A week later the new EU Agency for Railways emphasized the stability of B3R2 and the usage as the foundation for oncoming ETCS implementations in the EU. Based on projections in the Rhine-Alps-Corridor a break-even of the cross-border ETCS implementation is expected in the early 2030s. A new memorandum of understanding was signed on InnoTrans in September 2016 for a completion of the first ETCS Deployment Plan targets by 2022. The new planning was accepted by the European Commission in January 2017 with a goal to have 50% of the <b>Core</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Corridors</b> equipped by 2023 and the remainder in a second phase up to 2030.|$|E
40|$|The European Commission {{has adopted}} a {{proposal}} to develop the trans-European network for freight and passenger transports (TEN-T). A multimodal core transport network for Europe has been proposed, {{as part of the}} TEN-T (including all modes of transport; roads, railways, airports and canals). As parts of the core network, ten <b>core</b> <b>network</b> <b>corridors</b> have been appointed. They will be used as instruments for implementing the entire core network. European Coordinators will facilitate the implementation of the <b>core</b> <b>network</b> <b>corridors,</b> in cooperation with corridor platforms to be established by Member States concerned. There is no overall solution to how this core network with partly appointed network corridors would be managed, and how the corridor platforms will be synthesized and inter-organized to accomplish seamless transnational transport solutions. This literature review pinpoints three areas of specific importance for future work in creating transport corridor management structures. First, broad stakeholders inclusion, where formalized partnerships in agreements are suggested. Second, several ways of communication between stakeholders to ensure common progress, and third, to complement the dominant causation processes with effectuation processes to capture the stakeholders own driving forces towards common goals.

40|$|In December 2013, the new European {{transport}} infrastructure {{policy has been}} launched through {{the adoption of the}} new TEN-T (Trans European Transport Network) guidelines, and throughout to the “Connecting Europe Facility” as the related funding instruments. The previous TEN-T regulation achieved certain successes in cross border infrastructure. However, the revision is necessary {{for the development of the}} internal market and to allow the achievement of the Europe 2020 objectives (reduction of CO 2, removing bottlenecks from transport chains that limit the smooth functioning of the European internal market and the regular flows of passengers and goods, etc.), translated as a more sustainable, green, efficient energy, safe and secure EU Transport. In order to support the implementation of the <b>Core</b> <b>network</b> <b>Corridors,</b> the new Regulation contains specific tools: Corridors and Coordinators. The corridors will allow bringing together all relevant stakeholders (such as Member States, regions, local authorities, infrastructure managers, port authorities, and users) under the leadership of a European coordinator and concentrate on cross border sections, intermodality and interoperability. The TENT revision aims to establish and develop an integrated trans-European transport network which covers the infrastructure for all transport modes, ensures the functioning of the internal market and strengthens economic and social cohesion. This paper introduces the WiderMoS project, an initiative promoted by the TEN-T program through the INEA “Innovation and Network Executive Agency”, and developed by 5 EU countries and 16 institutions leaded by La Spezia Port Authority, which will meet interoperability among some of the nine Priority <b>Core</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Corridors,</b> from west Mediterranean countries to central – north Europe, promoting the integration of {{transport infrastructure}}s (port, road and rail), information structures (info-structures: Port Community Systems and Single Window Services) and transport actors, from a Business to Business (B 2 B) point of view, in a private – public action.

40|$|Intermodal road, rail, air and sea {{transport}} networks across the European Union (EU) calledTrans-European Networks for Transport (TEN-T) {{are currently being}} implemented. Keyelements, which should be implemented by 2030, are the most strategic TEN-T Core networkcorridors. These nine corridors are expected to enhance smoothness and sustainability oftransport across the EU, thereby enhancing cohesion between EU nations, and relate to non-EU nations. In the EU Regulation 1315 / 2013 a governance framework for implementation ofthe <b>Core</b> <b>network</b> <b>corridors</b> is outlined, which mainly involves appointment of a Europeancoordinator for each corridor, establishment of Corridor forums for consultations, andformulation of work plans and follow-up measures. This framework is now being implemented in practice. A recognised challenge in the processis engaging the numerous, diverse stakeholders. A possible solution is to introduceappropriate elements of complementary governance. Thus, in this doctoral research, suitablecomplementary governance to support the sustainable development of a Core networkcorridor was investigated. Complementary governance, a concept that was developed andrefined during the project, refers here to additional governance {{in relation to the}} governanceframework described for the EU <b>Core</b> <b>network</b> <b>corridors</b> in the EU Regulation 1315 / 2013. To address an identified gap in knowledge on the nature and utility of complementarygovernance a series of studies was carried out. The studies included a study of relevantacademic literature, studies of EU transport policy and implementation documents regardinggovernance and sustainability, a survey of views of Scandinavian-Mediterranean Corridorforum participants, and interviews with stakeholders in the Baltic Sea region. These studiescollectively constitute a case study, focusing on the Scandinavian-Mediterranean Corenetwork corridor, of the need for, and if a need is present the optimal design of,complementary governance in the process of sustainable development of a Core networkcorridor. The main findings of the studies are that the implementation process of the Core networkcorridors could benefit from complementary governance measures, mainly to increaseinclusiveness, which is crucial for a sustainable development. Complementary governancecould both deepen and broaden stakeholder awareness and involvement. This may haveseveral advantages, such as increasing possibilities for stakeholders to influence the processand benefit from the corridor, align activities, and promote cooperation and learning betweenstakeholders. Moreover, including stakeholders who are based outside the corridors mayimprove distributive aspects of the investments and reduce risks of focusing attention tooclosely on the corridors per se. However, broadening stakeholder inclusion also hasdisadvantages, as it increases the complexity of the process, which may impair itseffectiveness, and may lead to unrepresentative involvement due to differences instakeholders’ interests, administrative capacities and power. It also increases requirements forcoordination. The nature of complementary governance is multifaceted and related to diverse dimensions ofgovernance, such as processes, stakeholder participation and implementation documents. For complementary governance measures a flexible and task-specific multi-level design isemphasised, which may involve various types of engagement mechanisms. Further, thefindings showed a need to extend previously recognised types of public engagementmechanisms based on communication, consultation and participation in the decision-makingstage, by recognising another category, named stakeholder exchange. This category ischaracterised by stakeholder cooperation and collaboration in an implementation stage wheremain goals and policies already are in place. Areas for complementary governance in the implementation process of the Core networkcorridors were indicated in the interview study. They consisted of extended involvement ofprivate stakeholders, extended involvement of regional and local stakeholders, extendedinvolvement of stakeholders geographically external to the immediate corridor, and extendedinformation both generally and specifically (i. e. directed information to specific stakeholders). Several complementary governance measures that could potentially improve implementationof the <b>Core</b> <b>network</b> <b>corridors</b> were raised in the interviews, ranging from minor adjustment inthe existing process to entirely new solutions. These ideas correspond well to the indicatedareas and provide robust foundations for further discussion. Thus, findings from the research suggest several governance measures to systematicallyinvolve and engage diverse stakeholders in the Core network corridor implementationprocess. However, before introducing such measures, they should be assessed together withexisting governance measures, to avoid overlapping or contradictory initiatives, possiblyusing policy packaging approaches, where policies are combined and analysed together toachieve a desired overall outcome.

30|$|North America railroads retain, as intimated earlier, many routing {{options and}} {{infrastructure}} {{for what is}} effectively largely domestic traffic. European railway undertakings {{have to contend with}} a multiplicity of international borders (facing bureaucratic and time consuming cross-border clearance issues that are absent for trucking companies) although these are now of lesser significance than in the past. The routing preferences may vary within a national domain and this represents a measure of resilience and connectivity that yields benefits in the event of disruption. The European 2011 White Paper on Transport outlined that infrastructure has to be planned in a way that maximises the positive impact on economic growth and minimises the negative impact on the environment [9]. The recent designations of freight and passenger corridors - The <b>Core</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Corridors</b> – that are aimed provide the essential infrastructure for carrying freight and passenger [7]. Now the European railways tend to emphasise the high capacity main lines as the preferred axes where investment has been channelled to accommodate high volumes of traffic. In some respects this is not dissimilar to the focus on the main lines within the major Class 1 railroads in the US and Canada as the primary conduits for traffic much of which is routinely moving between known origin and destination points.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Old Bridge {{over the}} Danube in Bratislava {{was built in}} years 1889 – 1890. At {{the end of the}} WWII steel {{structure}} of the bridge was destroyed. In 1945 new road part of the bridge (Roth-Waagner system) was built as a replacement for an original structure. It had 7 spans. In later time a railway bridge was laid on common pillars beside the road bridge. The railway bridge consisted of simple supported trussed beams. In 1985 the railway bridge was set out of order. In 2010 the road part of the bridge with main girders with Roth – Waagner system fell into disrepair. Consequently several expertises were made and based on their results it was decided to immediately stop traffic and to close the bridge. In June 2010 employees of Ingsteel, spol. s r. o. for Alfa 04, a. s. worked out a proposal of reconstruction of the railway part of the bridge to the stage of construction permit. Considerations were given to using the original riveted main girders of the railway bridge. During the reconstruction of the bridge with the original width of 5. 0 m had to be widened to 11. 0 m and it had to be complemented with a new orthotropic deck, footpaths on both sides and new upper and lower longitudinal bracings. Due to change of the concept of <b>core</b> <b>network</b> <b>corridors</b> system of public transport in Bratislava axle loads of trams were increased (change to tram-train system). Also the width of footpaths was increased from 3. 0 m to 4. 5 m. Analysis proved that original main girders do not have enough capacity to bear this increased loads and the reasonable strengthening of the structure is not possible. Later, in February 2012 Ingsteel submitted to customer unfinished project for construction permit with proposal of new bridge with continuous beams shaped similarly to the railway part of the Old Bridge...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{governance}} for developing main transport corridors in the European Union was examined {{by means of}} document- and literature studies. European Union transport policy documents were studied as well as legislation regarding development of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T). One of the most strategic parts of the TEN-T, the Scandinavian – Mediterranean (ScanMed) transport corridor, was particularly studied with documents concerning the implementation of ScanMed. Qualitative content analyses have been conducted and three themes consisting of “governance organisation”, “actors” and “governance in practical implementation process” were studied. It was concluded that {{a broad range of}} stakeholders have to contribute in order to accomplish a well-functioning transport system. Accordingly the studied policy, legislative and implementation documents all concern governance matters in various ways. Depending on the actual transport initiative, and its objectives, stakeholder involvement can vary. A framework for governance arrangements for the most strategic parts of TEN-T, the <b>Core</b> <b>network</b> <b>corridors</b> is set in a regulation. A European coordinator was appointed for each Core network corridor and has an important role in facilitating the implementation. Such governance structure was already foreseen in earlier policy documents. Corridor forum is a new tool aiming to bring key stakeholders together for consultative purposes and in addition working groups can be connected to the Corridor forums. The policy and legislative documents have a focus on the responsibilities and activities for the European Commission and the concerned Member states. The importance of other stakeholders such as cities, ports, regional authorities, private actors is mentioned, but their activities are not explicitly stated in these formal European documents. However, participation of various stakeholders in the ScanMed Core network corridor implementation process is tangible, especially when concrete projects are discussed. Further, in the ScanMed Core network corridor implementation process the Corridor forum is explored as a new tool for bringing stakeholders together, progressively reaching an increasing number of stakeholders, including users of infrastructure in future stages. Encompassing eight countries and several modes of transport a large number of stakeholders are indicated. The idea of future ideas laboratories acting as meeting spots for development of the transport corridor on specific topics, and bringing a variety of stakeholders together, is interesting. A key challenge for future implementation of the ScanMed Core network corridor is the large number of stakeholders concerned by a transnational and multimodal transport system. Governance design to strengthen involvement of stakeholders in European transports initiatives such as the TEN-T should be encouraged. Suitable forums for cooperation and collaboration for inclusiveness for various actors need to be elaborated, where common overarching objectives need to be agreed upon. These forums have to be developed together with concerned stakeholders so that choice of forum is suitable due to its expected function. Key stakeholders which can actively contribute to progress and new ideas need to be connected to the process. And developed working groups, ideas laboratories and similar, on a geographical basis for parts of the corridor or for a specific topic, need to be adequately bridged to a European level...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} a method and tool for emulation of the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) <b>core</b> <b>network</b> needed as an environment to test the routing functionality. GPRS is the most widely adopted mobile packet data delivery technology in the world. It utilizes an Intranet Protocol (IP) -based <b>core</b> <b>network</b> and involves significant changes {{to the way the}} Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) air interface is structured. It also forms the basis of the future structure of mobile network transmission and switching. The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) is the most fundamental node in GPRS. Ericsson produces and manages an increasing number of SGSN nodes in the world. One of main functionalities of SGSN node is to forward IP packets according to the destination address in the IP header on IP <b>core</b> <b>network.</b> In each new release of SGSN, or when implementation or upgrades have been done on routing application on SGSN, design and test engineers at Ericsson need to emulate the IP <b>core</b> <b>network.</b> This must be done with use of many routers to generate huge amounts of data that can simulate the real world IP <b>core</b> <b>network.</b> The major goal of this thesis was to analyze and verifying the use of a suitable and economical solution to emulating IP <b>Core</b> <b>Network</b> of the GPRS system for testing of different functionality of the routing application running in SGSN, instead of building up a physical <b>Core</b> <b>Network</b> with different infrastructure and many routers. The method chosen for emulating the IP <b>core</b> <b>network</b> with many routers, and investigated in the thesis, is based on a Cisco simulator called “Dynamips”, which runs many actual Cisco Internetwork Operating Systems (IOS) with many different models of Cisco products in a virtual environment on Windows or Linux platforms.
