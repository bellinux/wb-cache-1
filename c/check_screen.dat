40|$|Breast cancer {{currently}} {{accounts for}} 32 % of cancer incidence and 18 % of cancer mortality {{for women in}} the United States. There were 182, 000 new cases of breast cancer in the United States in 1993 and 46, 000 deaths. Five year survival rates are generally very high (93 %) for breast cancer staged as being localized, falling to 72 % for regional disease and only 18 % for distant disease [1]. The early detection of breast cancer is clearly a key ingredient ofany strategy designed to reduce breast cancer mortality. Despite advances in resolution and lm contrast, <b>check</b> <b>screen</b> / film mammography remains a diagnostic imaging modality where image interpretation is very difficult. Breast radiographs are generally examined for the presence of malignant masses and indirect signs of malignancy such as the presence of microcalcifications and skin thickening. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that major improvements in imaging performance will be achieved by technical advances in screen / film radiography alone. It has been suggested that as normally viewed, mammograms display only about 3 % of the information they detect! [4]. The major reason for poor visualization of small malignant masses is the minor difference in x-ray attenuation between normal glandular tissues and malignant disease [2]. This fact makes the detection of small malignancies problematical, especially in younger wome...|$|E

The study found that teachers have pedagogically-informed reservations about the phonics <b>screening</b> <b>check,</b> due to its inclusion of pseudo-words and its purpose to test a child’s decoding skills alone, without considering comprehension development. It also found that teachers are reluctant to view the <b>screening</b> <b>check</b> as a potential indicator for developmental dyslexia, and instead advocate a more robust, effective benchmarking approach to detect any reading-related learning difficulties...|$|R

Conclusions: 1) Predictive values are important indicators of screening test quality. 2) The positive predictive value of the phonics check is low (0. 31) when compared to a standardised reading test but high (0. 84) when compared to teachers’ phonics phases judgements, reflecting poor agreement (kappa= 0. 27) between reference tests. 3) Results have implications for practice in terms of choice of reference standard, and choice of threshold criterion for children to pass the <b>screening</b> <b>check.</b> Longitudinal data are needed to assess the predictive validity and utility of the check...|$|R

40|$|Checked baggage, {{placed in}} the hold of an aircraft, {{screening}} {{is one of the}} most important elements of the airport security system, affecting the safety of entire air transport. In various airports, technical equipment but also the organization of <b>checked</b> baggage <b>screening</b> process vary widely. The paper presents an analysis aimed at creating a model of the organization of the screening process. Using this model can help airport managers in selection of the variant of screening organization depending on the current situation in the terminal. The essence of the method is to determine the relationship between factors such as: technical equipment, staff training and the number of staff errors, and also a variant of the organization of screening process and the effectiveness of the screening. This relationship cannot be defined in a precise and accurate manner, so it is necessary to use methods appropriate for the case when we have the information imprecise, uncertain and subjective. The obtained results allow to assess how effective is the <b>checked</b> baggage <b>screening</b> process at each of the possible variants of the organization. This allows the selection of a variant according to the technical equipment we have and also what passengers stream must be serviced...|$|R
40|$|Reliability {{evaluations}} and assurances cannot be delayed until the device (system) is fabricated {{and put into}} operation. Reliability of an electronic product should be conceived at {{the early stages of}} its design; implemented during manufacturing; evaluated (considering customer requirements and the existing specifications), by electrical, optical and mechanical measurements and testing; <b>checked</b> (<b>screened)</b> during fabrication; and, if necessary and appropriate, maintained in the field during the product’s operation. Prognostics and health monitoring (PHM) effort can be of significant help, especially at the last, operational stage, of the product use. Accordingly, a simple and physically meaningful probabilistic predictive model is suggested for the evaluation of the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of an electronic device (system) after an appreciable deviation from its normal operation conditions has been detected, and the corresponding increase in the failure rate and the change in the configuration of the wear-out portion of the bathtub curve has been assessed. The general concepts are illustrated by a numerical example. The model can be employed, along with other PHM forecasting and interfering tools and means, to evaluate and to maintain the high level of the reliability (probability of non-failure) of a device (system) at the operation stage of its lifetime. 1...|$|R
