5000|$|The {{manner in}} which the Soviet Union transacted trade varied from one trade partner to another. Soviet trade with the Western industrialized {{countries}}, except Finland, and most Third World countries was conducted with hard currency, that is, currency that was freely convertible. Because the ruble was not freely convertible, the Soviet Union could only acquire hard currency by selling Soviet goods or gold on the world market for hard currency. Therefore, the volume of imports from countries using convertible currency depended on the amount of goods the Soviet Union exported for hard currency. Alternative methods of cooperation, such as barter, <b>counter</b> <b>trade,</b> industrial cooperation, or bilateral clearing agreements were much preferred. These methods were used in transactions with Finland, members of Comecon, the People's Republic of China, Yugoslavia, and a number of Third World countries.|$|E

Therefore, instead of applying devaluation to get the then crisis-wrecked economy of Nigeria back on track, Buharism rather employed a policy of curbing imports of goods deemed unnecessary, curtailing oil theft and improving exports through a <b>counter</b> <b>trade</b> policy of bartering seized illegally bunkered crude oil for needful goods like machinery, enabling it to export above its OPEC quota.|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. The {{methodology}} of supply chain optimisation {{is a fairly}} new concept {{in the field of}} logistics management and is also referred to as value chain optimisation. This short dissertation explores and describes the effects of a national improvement in supply chain processes on the sales and profitability of RS Components SA. The study contains discussions from various theoretical disciplines and includes topics such as customer service, customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, logistics management and supply chain methodology. The link between the performance of the logistics processes and perceived customer service levels is also discussed in detail. Finally the study will show how improved logistical performance can lead to improved levels of customer satisfaction, which in turn leads to customer loyalty and increased profitability. In order to improve the organisation's national supply chain, RS Components SA decided to open a new <b>Trade</b> <b>Counter</b> in the Cape Town sales region. Before the opening of this <b>Trade</b> <b>Counter</b> however, improvements were made to the national logistical network to ensure seamless integration of the new sales branch as a fully operational warehouse. Various financial indicators were measured for the year after the opening of the new <b>Trade</b> <b>Counter</b> in Cape Town, in order to compare such figures to the year prior to the opening of said <b>Trade</b> <b>Counter.</b> The primary results were as follows: Sales for the Cape Town sales region have increased by a greater margin than originally budgeted for. The sales growth target was exceeded by 30. 21 %. The number of invoices generated for the year after the opening of the <b>Trade</b> <b>Counter</b> in Cape Town has increased steadily while the average invoice value has shown no mentionable growth. This indicates that the <b>Trade</b> <b>Counter</b> in Cape Town has spurned a greater percentage of repeat purchases and that sales have not merely increased due to bigger sales orders. Growth in the number of individual purchasing customers for the Cape Town region also reached a staggering growth of 71. 71 % compared to the growth target of 45 %. Substantial growth was also achieved throughout the year for the number of <b>Trade</b> <b>Counter</b> visits to the Cape Town <b>Trade</b> <b>Counter.</b> Whilst staggering growth rates were achieved in all of the above-mentioned categories, overhead expenses came in lower than was originally budgeted for the Cape Town sales region. A saving of 3. 65 % was achieved against a sales growth of 75. 21 %. In conclusion, this study indicated an increase in sales and profitability in the Cape Town sales region. Based on the success achieved through supply chain optimisation, both in terms of increased revenue as well as perceived levels of customer satisfaction, a recommendation is made for further expansion of the supply chain network of RS Components SA through the opening of a new <b>Trade</b> <b>Counter</b> in Durban...|$|R

5000|$|LETS is not {{a scheme}} for {{avoiding}} the payment of taxation, and generally groups encourage all members to personally undertake their liabilities to the state for all taxation, including income tax and goods and services tax.

Taxation liabilities accrue when a tradesperson or professional person provides his or her professional services in payment for LETS units, or a registered or incorporated business sells part of its product for LETS units.
