40|$|Abstract Background Total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is {{a common}} form of treatment to relieve pain and improve function in cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Good clinical outcomes have been reported {{with a variety of}} TKA prostheses. The cementless Hi-Tech Knee II cruciate-retaining (CR) -type prosthesis, which has 6 fins at the anterior of the femoral component, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) retention, flat-on-flat surface component geometry, all-polyethylene patella, strong initial fixation by the <b>center</b> <b>screw</b> of the tibial base plate, 10 layers of titanium alloy fiber mesh, and direct compression molded ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), is appropriate for TKA in the Japanese knee. The present study was performed to evaluate the clinical results of primary TKA in RA using the cementless Hi-Tech Knee II CR-type prosthesis. Materials and methods We performed 32 consecutive primary TKAs using cementless Hi-Tech Knee II CR-type prosthesis in 31 RA patients. The average follow-up period was 8 years 3 months. Clinical evaluations were performed according to the American Knee Society (KS) system, knee score, function score, radiographic evaluation, and complications. Results The mean postoperative maximum flexion angle was 115. 6 °, and the KS knee score and function score improved to 88 and 70 after surgery, respectively. Complications, such as infection, occurred in 1 patient and revision surgery was performed. There were no cases of loosening in this cohort, and prosthesis survival rate was 96. 9 % at 12 years postoperatively. Conclusion These results suggest that TKA using the cementless Hi-Tech Knee II CR-type prosthesis is a very effective form of treatment in RA patients at 5 to 12 years postoperatively. Further long-term follow-up studies are required to determine the ultimate utility of this type of prosthesis. </p...|$|R

The system for testing in an inert gas has a graphite resistance element furnace in a chamber with rigidly mounted, water cooled, hydraulically actuated grips. Unidirectional SiC fiber reinforced reaction bonded Si 3 N 4 and triaxially woven, two dimensional, SiC fiber reinforced enhanced SiC composites were tested in unidirectional tension. Theories for predicting the Young's modulus, modulus near the ultimate strength, first matrix cracking stress, and ultimate strength were applied and evaluated for suitability in predicting the mechanical behavior of SiC/RBSN and enhanced SiC/SiC composites. The SiC/RBSN composite exhibited pseudo tough behavior (increased area under the stress/strain curve) from 22 C to 1500 C. The rule of mixtures provides a good estimate of the Young's modulus of the SiC/RBSN composite using the constituent properties from room temperature to 1440 C for short term static tensile tests in air or nitrogen. The rule of mixtures significantly overestimates the secondary modulus near the ultimate strength. The ACK theory provides the best approximation of the first matrix cracking stress when residual stresses are ignored. The theory of Cao and Thouless, based on Weibull statistics, gave the best prediction for the composite ultimate strength. The enhanced SiC/SiC composite exhibited nonlinear stress/strain behavior from 24 C to 1370 C in air with increased ultimate strain when compared to monolithic SiC.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to radiologically {{evaluate}} the femoral tunnel position in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions using the isometric and anatomical techniques. METHODS: a prospective analytical study was conducted on patients undergoing ACL reconstruction by means of the isometric and anatomical techniques, using grafts from the knee flexor tendons or patellar tendon. Twenty-eight patients were recruited during the immediate postoperative period, at the knee surgery outpatient clinic of FCMMG-HUSJ. Radiographs of the operated knee were produced in anteroposterior (AP) view with the patient standing on both feet and in lateral view with 30 &# 9702; of flexion. The lines were traced out and the distances and angles were measured on the lateral radiograph to evaluate the sagittal plane. The distance from the <b>center</b> of the <b>screw</b> to the posterior cortical bone of the lateral condyle was measured and divided by the Blumensaat line. In relation to the height of the screw, the distance from the <b>center</b> of the <b>screw</b> to the joint surface of the lateral condyle of the knee was measured. On the AP radiograph, evaluating the coronal plane, the angle between the anatomical axis of the femur and a line traced at the <b>center</b> of the <b>screw</b> was measured. RESULTS: with regard to the pmeasurement (posteriorization of the interference screw), the tests showed that the p-value (0. 4213) was greater than the significance level used (0. 05); the null hypothesis was not rejected and it could be stated that there was no statistically significant difference between the anatomical and isometric techniques. With regard to the H measurement (height of the screw in relation to the lower cortical bone of the knee), the p-value observed (0. 0006) was less than the significance level used (0. 05); the null hypothesis was rejected and it could be stated that there was a statistically significant difference between the anatomical and isometric techniques. It can be concluded that the latter difference occurred because the isometric technique generated greater values for the H measurement than the anatomical technique. With regard to the MED variable (position of the screw on the AP radiograph), the observed p-value (0. 000) was less than the significance level (5 %); the null hypothesis was rejected and it could be stated with 95 % confidence that there was a significant difference between the anatomical and isometric techniques. CONCLUSIONS: there were statistically significant differences in the radiological evaluations of the femoral tunnel, both in the sagittal and in the coronal plane, between the ACL reconstruction techniques...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Momentum {{transfer}} in an annular duct with upward gas-Iiquid flow was studied under {{the condition that}} the liquid flowed as a film only on the inner core of the annulus, the outer wall remaining dry. Previous workers have studied climbing and falling liquid films in tubes or on vertical planes. With this type of apparatus {{it is very difficult to}} study pressure losses, gas velocity profiles, and the structure of the climbing film. The difficulty has been overcome by forming a liquid film on the inner core and maintaining a dry outer wall of an annular duct. The column consists of a three-inch I. D. outer tube with a concentric one-inch O. D. inner core. The inner tube was supported laterally by sets of streamlined <b>centering</b> <b>screws.</b> The total length of the column was about 35 feet and the test section was 20 feet long. All measurements were made at two stations, the first was 76 inches from the liquid injector, the second 154 inches from the liquid injector. The liquid injector is a porous stainless steel cylinder with one inch O. D. and two inch length. The air flow rates varied from 170 cfm to 410 cfm at 1 atmosphere pressure and 68 ° F temperature. The water flow rates used were 0. 47 lbm/min and 0. 79 lbm/min. The study has two major divisions. First division is the study of the mechanics of the air flow in the annulus as it is affected by the presence of the climbing film of liquid. This portion of the study involves an investigation of velocity profiles, the point of maximum velocity, friction losses, and the role of capillary waves in the annular flow. It was found that: 1) the pressure loss for climbing film flow in an annulus can be predicted by the Lockhart and Martinelli correlation for two-phase flow in tubes, 2) the capillary waves of the climbing film affect only the location of the point of maximum air velocity and the air velocity profile at the inner portion of the annulue, 3) the location of the point of maximum air velocity shuts to the outer wall as water film is introduced, 4) the air velocity profiles in the inner portion of the annulus with the film present, plotted as u⁺ versus y⁺, are shifted downward, relative to those for annular flow without the film, although they have same slope. The second part is the study of the mechanics of flow of a climbing water film which has a solid wall as one boundary and highly turbulent air stream as the other. The mean film thickness, wave length, and amplitude of the climbing film were measured by a photographic method. This method gave good results in the measurement of mean film thickness at the lower and moderate air velocities. However, the wave length and amplitude determined by this method have only a qualitative significance, because of the irregularity of wave shapes. With increasing air flow rates, the film thickness, wave length, and amplitude decreased. Generally the ratio of wave length to amplitude varied between 20 to 30. As a first approximation, Kapitza's theory of wave formation in the vertical plane with downward flow, based on laminar conditions, was extended to the climbing film in an annular duct in order to obtain an expression for the mean film thickness, the velocity profile of liquid film, and the wave length. Comparison between the prediction and the experiment was found to be reasonably good, The mean film thickness data for climbing film flow in an annulus was correlated with the Lockhart and Martinelli parameters, R[subscript L] and X, and was compared with the correlation for climbing film flow in a tube. If a unique correlation for climbing film flow in both tubes and annuli exists (this is the original proposal of Lockhart and Martinelli), it would appear that the region in the vicinity of x = 0. 01 is a transition region. More data at high water flow rates are necessary to reach a general conclusion concerning the correlation...|$|R
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the three {{established}} adiabatic invariants are separating invariants in the sense of Liouville. It is widely claimed that no more than three adiabatic invariants can exist for the motion of a point charge. However, additional independent (not separating) adiabatic invariants do exist. For a force free motion, the components of angular momentum provide two additional constants of motion. This result can be generalized to the Hamilton Jacobi equation. The number of independent constants of motion is reduced if there is a global symmetry. For a gyrating particle, neglecting a gyro helix type of invariant, four 'useful' invariants could exist. A radial drift invariant, corresponding to the average of the radial coordinate of the particle, is a constant of motion for a confined gyrating particle. For the special case of a screw pinch where each gyro center moves on a magnetic flux surface without mirror trapping, the radial drift invariant is the radial coordinate of the gyro <b>center.</b> For a <b>screw</b> pinch, the set of constants of motion consising of the energy, parallel velocity and radial drift invariant is convenient to model the equilibrium. Local Maxwellian distribution functions expressed in this set of invariants are demonstrated to provide MHD-type of equilibria, for which it is straightforward to model the radial profiles of the particle and field components.

ResultadosPelos testes, o p‐valor (0, 4213) é maior do que o nível de significância adotado (0, 05), a hipótese nula não é rejeitada e pode ser afirmado que não há diferença estatisticamente significativa entre as técnicas anatômica (TAN) e isométrica (TIS) no que diz respeito à Medida P (posteriorização do parafuso de interferência). Como o p‐valor (0, 0006) observado é menor do que o nível de significância adotado (0, 05), rejeita‐se a hipótese nula e pode ser afirmado que há diferença estatisticamente significativa entre a TAN e a TIS no que diz respeito à Medida H (altura do parafuso em relação à cortical inferior do joelho). Pode‐se concluir que essa diferença ocorre porque a TIS gera valores maiores para a Medida H do que a TAN. Como o p‐valor observado (0, 000) é menor do que o nível de significância (5 %), rejeitou‐se a hipótese nula e afirmamos com 95 % de confiança que há diferença significativa entre a TAN e a TIS no que diz respeito à variável MED (posição do parafuso na radiografia em AP). ConclusõesHouve diferença estatisticamente significativa na avaliação radiológica do túnel femoral, tanto no plano sagital como no coronal, entre as técnicas de reconstrução do LCA. AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to radiologically evaluate the femoral tunnel position in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions using the isometric and anatomical techniques. MethodsA prospective analytical study was conducted on patients undergoing ACL reconstruction by means of the isometric and anatomical techniques, using grafts from the knee flexor tendons or patellar tendon. Twenty‐eight patients were recruited during the immediate postoperative period, at the knee surgery outpatient clinic of FCMMG‐HUSJ. Radiographs of the operated knee were produced in anteroposterior (AP) view with the patient standing on both feet and in lateral view with 30 ° of flexion. The lines were traced out and the distances and angles were measured on the lateral radiograph to evaluate the sagittal plane. The distance from the <b>center</b> of the <b>screw</b> to the posterior cortical bone of the lateral condyle was measured and divided by the Blumensaat line. In relation to the height of the screw, the distance from the <b>center</b> of the <b>screw</b> to the joint surface of the lateral condyle of the knee was measured. On the AP radiograph, evaluating the coronal plane, the angle between the anatomical axis of the femur and a line traced at the <b>center</b> of the <b>screw</b> was measured. ResultsWith regard to the P measurement (posteriorization of the interference screw), the tests showed that the p‐value (0. 4213) was greater than the significance level used (0. 05), the null hypothesis was not rejected and it could be stated that there was no statistically significant difference between the anatomical and isometric techniques. With regard to the H measurement (height of the screw in relation to the lower cortical bone of the knee), the p‐value observed (0. 0006) was less than the significance level used (0. 05), the null hypothesis was rejected and it could be stated that there was a statistically significant difference between the anatomical and isometric techniques. It can be concluded that the latter difference occurred because the isometric technique generated greater values for the H measurement than did the anatomical technique. With regard to the MED variable (position of the screw on the AP radiograph), the observed p‐value (0. 000) was less than the significance level (5 %), the null hypothesis was rejected and it could be stated with 95 % confidence that there was a significant difference between the anatomical and isometric techniques. ConclusionsThere were statistically significant differences in the radiological evaluations of the femoral tunnel, both in the sagittal and in the coronal plane, between the ACL reconstruction techniques...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{resistivity}} {{and volume}} resistivity data show all the tested non-metallic materials of the Ares I FTS antenna assembly to be insulative. The external materials (White foam, phenolic) {{should be able}} to develop a large surface charge density upon tribocharging with ice crystal impingement. Dielectric breakdown tests on the FTS antenna housing materials show that each of the insulative materials are very resistive to electrical breakdown. The thicknesses of these materials in a nominal housing should protect the antenna from direct breakdown from external triboelectric charging potentials. Per data from the Air Force study, a maximum external electric potential in the range of 100 kV can be developed on surfaces tribocharged by ice crystal impingement. Testing showed that under operational pressure ranges, this level of exterior voltage can result in a potential of about 6 kV induced on the electrically floating interior antenna vanes. Testing the vanes up to this voltage level showed that electrostatic discharges can occur between the electrically floating vanes and the <b>center,</b> grounded <b>screw</b> heads. Repeated tests with multiple invisible and visible discharges caused only superficial physical damage to the vanes. Fourier analysis of the discharge signals showed that the frequency range of credible discharges would not interfere with the nominal operation of the FTS antenna. However, due to the limited scope, short timetable, and limited funding of this study, a direct measurement of the triboelectric charge that could be generated on the Ares I antenna housing when the rocket traverses an ice cloud at supersonic speeds was not performed. Instead, data for the limited Air Force study [3] was used as input for our experiments. The Air Force data used was not collected with a sensor located to provide us with the best approximation at the geometry of the Ares I rocket, namely that of the windshield electrometer, because brush discharges to the metal frame of the windshield periodically depleted any charge accumulated. The configuration of the Ares I antenna assembly does not include any exposed metals in the vicinity and the windshield data could not be used. Since the windshield sensor data was unusable, we decided that the Patch 2 location would provide us with a rough approximation to the Ares I antenna configuration and would give us an indication of the possible charging levels that would develop. This was the data that we used in this study. Whether these charging levels would be of the same order of magnitude as the actual charges developed by the Ares I traversing a cloud with ice particles is at this point unknown. An actual experimental test, requiring the acquisition of additional instrumentation, is strongly advised before a final recommendation can be formulated regarding the safe levels of electrostatic charging on the antenna housing. Thus {{the results of this study}} should be considered to be preliminary...|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of Season 8, Vince undergoes court-ordered rehab for 90 days and emerges victorious. Having gotten his confidence back, he focuses on his friendships again. The group goes {{to great lengths to}} prevent Vince from relapsing, such as disposing of alcohol or drugs around the house. Vince concocts an idea to make a movie involving the plight of a buried miner, intending to get Drama cast in the role. He ends up writing a 20-page treatment, that surprises Ari and Dana Gordon, who can help get it made. Vince also runs into veteran film producer Carl Ertz at the same rehab <b>center.</b> Ertz had <b>screwed</b> Vince out of a deal and tries to get him to make another one before relapsing. Ertz later commits suicide when Vince and Turtle try to come to his rescue. A small media storm ensues just as Vince is about to undergo mandatory drug testing. He soon confesses to E that he had a couple puffs of marijuana and fears that it will jeopardize his test. The group tries to come to his rescue until Vince talks to Billy Walsh, who gets him a prosthetic penis with a clean urine sample, and the ploy works. Vince also tries to help Turtle as he tries to help a New York friend expand his restaurant business to the west coast. Turtle initially refuses his help but Vince later reveals that he didn't sell his stock out of the tequila company that Turtle helped launch. Although Turtle sold his stock, Vince bought his share to prevent Turtle from making such a mistake, making Turtle a millionaire. Vince later has an interview with a Vanity Fair reporter named Sophia, who writes an article that he doesn't quite agree with. Vince goes to great lengths to prove to her that he's reformed, even producing a video with women he's slept with, to highlight the gentleman that he is. He succeeds in courting her and spends an unforgettable 24 hours with her, before getting engaged to her, with the ceremony taking place in Paris. The group attends, except for E, with whom Vince later smooth things over. In the movie, Vince and Sophia separate after nine days of marriage. Vince makes his directorial debut with the film Hyde. He goes over budget by $15 million and requests an additional $10 million from the studio head, his former agent Ari Gold.|$|R
