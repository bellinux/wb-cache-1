And when, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has refused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised never to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters, he should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long, and send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine quite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he was. And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about everywhere with one's husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one was, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if his conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really badly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in the wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman's duty to forgive, and one <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> over again from the beginning, with variations.|$|E

5000|$|Ellen Ejonar of The Independent also {{praised the}} episode, {{summarising}} that the episode was [...] "great on our technology culture, but also just great; well cast, expertly structured and genuinely unsettling". She also compared it favourably to other Christmas television episodes, concluding that: [...] "at {{a time of}} year when schmaltz usually covers the TV schedules like a snowdrift, this sidelong look at the state of humanity is all the more welcome". Danny Krupa of IGN gave the episode 8.5/10. In particular, he praised the acting, although he noted that Chaplin's role was the least developed. Despite Hamm's star billing, Krupa noted: [...] "it's really Spall who shines brightest over the course of 90 minutes, as we experience the full depth of his misery". Finally, Den of Geek noted that the episode's finale was [...] "a thrilling development that invites you to rewatch right from the beginning (something that will greatly benefit from the DVD release, when we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> without <b>all</b> those ad breaks)".|$|R
