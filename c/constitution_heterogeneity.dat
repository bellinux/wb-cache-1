40|$|The textural {{description}} of a solid {{can be seen as}} a two stages job. The first one consists in determining the mineralogical composition and the size of the components. Information collected during this step will be named Granularity Parameter (GP). The second stage is a study of the spatial distribution of the components, called below Distribution Parameter (DP). The proposed method quantifies GP and DP by respectively <b>constitution</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> (HC) and distribution heterogeneity (HD). HC and HD are functions defined by P. Gy, 1982 and 1988 in his “Theory of particule material sampling”...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a cradle-to-grave model for political union between two unequally endowed states. We introduce negotiated, contested, and time-consistent contested constitutions to address various classes of merger problems. Merger agreement {{is shown to}} be path dependent and, in some cases, time inconsistent. The possibility of contest constrains the set of mutually agreeable tax rates and provides stability to a <b>constitution.</b> Demographic <b>heterogeneity</b> constrains the set of mutually agreeable mergers. Rent extracted by technologically advanced province for transferring technology to the backward province in a union is shown to be increasing in complexity of technology but bounded from above. The model can also support the possibility of historical cycles of political geography. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to highlight the role of technology gap and unequal distributio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA solid can be {{regarded}} as a set of contiguous elementary units. The distribution within the solid of any properties, measurable within each elementary unit, can be characterized using two parameters. These parameters are built using the <b>constitution</b> and distribution <b>heterogeneities</b> of P. Gy (1982, 1988). The former account for the granularity of the elementary units, whereas the latter assess the spatial distribution of the property. A texture which definition involves several properties can be described using a diagram where both parameters work as variables. Potential applications encompass: (i) the textural classification of soils, ore, breccia and concrete and (ii) the monitoring of textural transformation during process like dolomitization, metamorphism, weathering, deformation or annealing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo apply a {{decision-making}} scheme using-a statistical classification while {{conforming to}} the meaning of representativeness as defined by the US EPA, we propose an equation defining the representativeness of a sample. To utilize this equation, the batch must be homogenized. This requires analyzing the <b>constitution</b> and distribution <b>heterogeneities.</b> The equation relates the sample weight m(s) to its representativeness R either by a statistical approach or by a physical approach-using the following equation:m(s) = { 4 /(1 - R) (2) } center dot [K + k(e) (1 - 2 t(e)) /t(e) ]. In the equation; K and k(e) are the heterogeneity factors determined from a descriptive analysis. This equation is applicable to solid waste with majority constituents such as automobile shredder residue. (ASR) and domestic waste. This analysis was applied to a sample of ASR in the framework of-a verification for France. The results of the analysis showed that the sample weight must be at least 140 kg to have a representativeness of 90 %...|$|R
