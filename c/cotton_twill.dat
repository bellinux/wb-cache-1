2500|$|During World War II, a single-breasted heavy <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> {{jacket with}} {{shoulder}} boards was worn with <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> trousers over a long-sleeved cotton {{shirt with a}} black necktie as [...] "Service Dress Khaki", allowing cleaning in shipboard laundry facilities. Later on, through the Vietnam War, the trousers and jacket were often made of light wool or wool-blend fabric [...] as routine access to dry-cleaning facilities became available. The uniform was dropped in 1975 by then-Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, {{in order to reduce}} the number of items in the officer's seabag. A revived version of the uniform was announced in 2006 on a test basis. It was authorized for wear by commissioned officers and CPOs during the summer months and in tropical climates. Some commentators, including the periodical Navy Times, spoke of this uniform as having a [...] "throwback" [...] look.|$|E
2500|$|Cotton {{is used to}} make {{a number}} of textile products. These include terrycloth for highly {{absorbent}} bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; cambric, popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which we get the term [...] "blue-collar"); and corduroy, seersucker, and <b>cotton</b> <b>twill.</b> Socks, underwear, and most T-shirts are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with linen as Linen-cotton blends which give benefit of both plant materials which wrinkle resistant, lightweight, [...] breathable and can keep heat more effectively than only linen. These blends are thinner and lighter, but stronger than only cotton.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 May 1940, {{eight days}} after the {{formation}} of the LDV, it was announced by the War Office that 250,000 field service caps were to be distributed as {{the first part of the}} uniform of the new force and that khaki brassards or [...] "armlets" [...] were being manufactured, each carrying the letters [...] "LDV" [...] in black. In the meantime, LDV units improvised their own brassards with whatever materials were available; local Women's Voluntary Service branches were often asked to produce these, sometimes using old puttees donated by veterans. The British Army used loose-fitting work clothes called [...] "Overalls, Denim" [...] which were made of khaki-coloured <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> fabric and consisted of a short jacket or [...] "blouse" [...] and trousers. They were cut to the same style as, and designed to be worn over, the 1938 pattern Battle Dress. It was announced that 90,000 sets of denim overalls would be released from military stores at once and that more would be issued as soon as they could be manufactured. On 25 June, Anthony Eden announced in the House of Commons that LDV uniform was intended [...] "to consist of one suit of overalls of design similar to that of battle dress, a field service cap, and an armlet bearing the letters 'L.D.V.'". On 30 July 1940, Eden further announced that the Home Guard (as the LDV had been renamed) would be issued with military boots as supplies became available.|$|E

5000|$|A {{second and}} less common uniform, the Herringbone Twill (HBT) uniform was issued, made of 8.2-ounce heavy <b>cotton</b> {{herringbone}} <b>twill</b> cloth. The uniform {{consisted of a}} shirt, trousers, and initially a circular-brimmed [...] "clamdigger" [...] HBT utility hat. This was later followed by a billed cap {{that was based on}} a design used by railroad workers. Initially {{it was meant to be}} worn over the basic wool uniform to provide protection, however it proved to be much better material than the primary uniform for hot weather and tropical climates.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{recruits}} previous to 1940 {{were issued}} a fatigue uniform (Drillichanzug) for basic training which they kept for work details, weapons cleaning and other duties likely to soil clothes. This was an unlined, insignia-less uniform made of linen or <b>cotton</b> herringbone <b>twill</b> (HBT) that typically had two buttonless patch pockets on the skirt; enlisted versions had a standing collar while NCO and officer versions had rise-and-fall collars. The fatigue uniform originally was undyed {{and therefore a}} colour that ranged from white to oatmeal to cement grey. On 12 February 1940 the colour was ordered changed to a bluish green called [...] "reed-green." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bras were {{originally}} made of linen, <b>cotton</b> broadcloth, and <b>twill</b> weaves and sewn using flat-felled or bias-tape seams. They are now {{made of a}} variety of materials, including Tricot, Spandex, Spanette, Latex, microfiber, satin, Jacquard, foam, mesh, and lace, which are blended to achieve specific purposes. Spandex, a synthetic fiber with built-in [...] "stretch memory", can be blended with cotton, polyester, or nylon. Mesh is a high-tech synthetic composed of ultra-fine filaments that are tightly knit for smoothness.|$|R
500|$|The neckerchief is a {{universal}} symbol of Scouting and its Maclaren tartan represents Wood Badge's ties to Gilwell Park. The neckerchief, called a [...] "necker" [...] in British and some Commonwealth Scouting associations, is a standard triangular scarf made of <b>cotton</b> or wool <b>twill</b> with a taupe face and red back; a patch of Clan MacLaren tartan is affixed near the point. The pattern was adopted in honor of a British Scout commissioner who, as a descendant of the Scottish MacLaren clan, donated money for the Gilwell Park property on which the first Wood Badge program was held.|$|R

50|$|The paratroopers {{got their}} own unique uniform in 1942, also. It was {{constructed}} of light green <b>cotton</b> <b>twill,</b> with four front pockets and two pant-leg cargo pockets. They also got a new boot design of their own, a leather boot of similar construction to the infantry shoe, only being mid-shin high.|$|E
30|$|Denim garment {{was treated}} with {{cellulase}} enzyme by varying the process parameters, namely concentration of enzyme, washing temperature and time to develop novel design and fashion. The effect of process parameters on the physical and mechanical properties of cotton denim garment was investigated and denim fabric properties like tensile strength, elongation at break, weight loss, stiffness, water absorption, shrinkage, color fading and morphological values by SEM were discussed. To obtain the desired fashion effect in terms of color fading, comfort ability in terms of reducing the stiffness of denim and high wear performance in terms of longevity/minimum tensile strength losses of denim, indigo dyed denim garment (trousers, 100 % <b>cotton</b> with <b>twill</b> weave 3 / 1 construction) had been chosen and processed with the enzyme concentration of 0.5 % to 3.5 %, treatment temperature from 40 °C to 70 °C and treatment time from 20  min to 60  min. The process parameters were optimized and the optimized washing condition for the best value is 2 % enzyme concentration at 55 °C for 40  min.|$|R

The quality of dyed fabric {{depends on the}} quality of greige fabric. <b>Cotton</b> Plain and <b>Twill</b> weave fabrics were woven at three different warp yarn tension and then dyed using monochlorotriazine, Drimerene Red Cl- 5 B dye gives difference in fabric properties. The ASTM, American International Standards were used to determine the greige and dyed fabric properties. It has been observed fabric woven at proper loom setting or warp yarn tension have high strength, less pilling and abrasion tendency as compared to fabric woven at variant warp yarn tension. Moreover, fabric tenacity is decreased after dyeing whereas, slight difference in pilling and abrasion values is observed after dyeing than that of greige fabric...|$|R
5000|$|Viyella was a {{blend of}} wool and cotton first woven in 1893 in England, and soon to be the [...] "first branded fabric in the world". It was made of 55 percent merino wool and 45 percent <b>cotton</b> in a <b>twill</b> weave, {{developed}} by James and Robert Sissons of William Hollins & Company, spinners and hosiers. The brand name, first registered as a trademark in 1894, and registered in the United States in 1907, soon covered not only the original fabric, to be sold by the yard (piece goods), but also clothing. At first this was made by separate businesses, {{but it was not}} long before Hollins started producing their own clothes and offering franchises to manufacturers who would use the Viyella label. Following increasing emphasis on garment manufacture over the years, Viyella is now a fashion brand for clothes and home furnishings made of a variety of fabrics. The original wool/cotton blend is no longer on sale.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, a single-breasted heavy <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> {{jacket with}} {{shoulder}} boards was worn with <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> trousers over a long-sleeved cotton {{shirt with a}} black necktie as [...] "Service Dress Khaki", allowing cleaning in shipboard laundry facilities.

50|$|Historic {{eighteenth century}} crewel {{embroidery}} preferentially used a linen and <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> plainweave because it wore well. The fabric's diagonal rib {{was regarded as}} an esthetically pleasing contrast to the embroidery, although sometimes it was brushed before working to create a smoother nap. This material, known as fustian originated in Fustât in ancient times and was probably the forerunner of velvet.|$|E
50|$|Mills Manufacturing Company was {{organized}} during the mid-1890s by entrepreneur Otis Prentiss Mills (1840-1915), {{a native of}} Henderson County, North Carolina, and a former Confederate officer. The corporation received its charter and began construction of the brick mill in 1896—just outside city limits to avoid paying city taxes, and near Brushy Creek to have water for steam generation and a holding pond. Mills convinced the Southern Railway {{to put in a}} siding, and in 1897, he opened the mill with 5,000 spindles and about two hundred employees, mostly former tenant farmers from the mountains of North and South Carolina. By 1903, there were 120 houses and a thousand residents in the mill village; in 1907 there were 450 employees and 27,000 spindles in a mill that produced <b>cotton</b> bed sheets, <b>twills,</b> and satin. Workers pastured their cows on the flood plain and put outhouses, pig sties, and chicken coops behind their residences. The mill also built a company store, a church used alternately by Baptist and Methodist congregations, and a YMCA that employed two paid social workers.|$|R
30|$|Denim as a fabric, has {{received}} the widest acceptance among all textile products. It has had an incredible influence on consumers both socially and culturally (Paul 2015). This <b>twill</b> <b>cotton</b> fabric usually has warp threads indigo dyed while weft remains plain white. The warp faced fabric therefore looks blue {{on one side and}} white on reverse. The warp being ring dyed, creates denim’s fading characteristics, which is unique compared to every other textile material. With changing times, many new variants of denim came into existence. Denim washing {{is one of the key}} areas in getting the faded look. Earlier stone washing used to be done to achieve soft feel and the desired appearance. During washing, the pumice stone, scraps off the dye particles from the yarn surface in the denim fabric. Due to the ring dyeing of denim fabric and heavy abrasion during stone washing process, the faded effect is achieved. Oxidative bleaching agent with or without the addition of stones have also been used to get fading effect. Difficulty in removing residual pumice from fabric, damage to equipment and clogging of machine drainage passage due to particulate material proved to be major drawbacks with the technique (Heikinheimo et al. 2000). Later on use of enzymes became a sustainable option to get the worn out look in denim. The enzymes used are cellulase enzymes, specifically acting on the cellulose part, mainly on the surface of the fabric. This gives the desired look and at the same time, removes hairiness from surface thus giving a smooth and soft feel. Enzymes are substrate specific in their action, unaffecting the others. They are primarily used in textiles to promote hydrolysis of the required substrate (Patra 2003).|$|R

50|$|In 2007, the PLA {{introduced}} the Type 07 combat and training uniforms {{such as the}} US BDU-style. They replaced the Type 87 combat and training uniforms which dated to the 1980s. The uniform includes a winter style made of heavy-weighted cotton fabric material and a summer style made of polyester and <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> fabric. Both styles include a coat, trousers, a soft cap and black leather boots.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{relatively}} small in size, having one twelve inch speaker. Depending on the model it has either two or four inputs and two channels. Each channel has a volume control. Both channels share a tone control. The inputs and controls are mounted {{at the top of}} the amplifier. It is often referred to as the [...] "Tweed Deluxe" [...] because of its covering—a light brown material which is actually a <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> that is often lacquered.|$|E
50|$|Dungaree {{appears to}} be a subset of denim and {{typically}} refers to the most common style of blue denim. Typically only the warp threads are pre-dyed with the traditional colouring agent indigo, the weft threads are left uncoloured (white), resulting in the unique fade patterns of the fabric. Denim however refers to <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> which may be warp dyed, undyed, or dyed after weaving. Denim may be 2x1 or 3x1 twill. It's unclear what types of twill dungaree fabric was available in traditionally.|$|E
5000|$|Fender tweed is {{a generic}} name {{used for the}} guitar {{amplifiers}} made by the American company Fender between 1948 and 1960. The amplifiers are named for the cloth covering, which consists of varnished <b>cotton</b> <b>twill,</b> incorrectly called tweed because of its feel and appearance. They are praised for their sound, their circuitry considered [...] "hallowed ground". Fender generally stopped using the twill covering in 1960, though the Harvard was still covered in twill until 1963, and the Champ until 1964.|$|E
5000|$|On {{official}} aviation combat garments, the ERDL {{pattern was}} {{used on the}} USAF Type K-2B Flying Coveralls, in a cotton poplin textile version. The USAF ERDL Coveralls saw some use in SEA from 1967-69, until replaced by the USAF Nomex Coveralls in 1970. The Navy also produced an official ERDL aviation garment in their Flying Coverall 'MIL-C-5390G' pattern, produced in a <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> textile. This Navy ERDL Coveralls saw very limited SEA use from 1967-68, as their Nomex Coveralls were already in use.|$|E
50|$|DRx x Converse Boro Chuck Taylor 1970s - Romanelli {{has worked}} with Converse before and for this {{collaboration}} decided to use vintage boro, a collectible Japanese textile. The Converse Chuck Taylor 1970s encapsulated both brands’ (Romanelli's and Convers') appreciation for premium materials with olive <b>cotton</b> <b>twill,</b> inspired by a vintage World War II U.S. Army jacket from Romanelli’s personal vintage collection, paired with a coarse cotton plaid.

5000|$|In 1987, THD Electronics put {{the first}} vintage reissue vacuum tube guitar {{amplifier}} into production, the 4-10 amp. It was modeled after a 1959 5F6-A [...] "tweed" [...] (a misnomer: the cloth is actually twill) Fender Bassman and, unlike the Peavey Classic Amplifiers of the 1970s (which {{were covered in}} twill-patterned vinyl) the 4-10 was covered in authentic <b>cotton</b> <b>twill,</b> the first since Fender and Gibson stopped production of twill-covered amplifiers in 1960. The 4-10 was in production from 1987-1993. In 1989 a head-only and 2-10 version were released as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of an immense balloon of <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> was carried to completion. But before the inflation some differences arose between the aeronauts regarding {{the reliability of the}} balloon. Donaldson's inexperience placed him in a secondary position throughout the entire transaction, but when the time for action came he found himself the principal, Wise having withdrawn. The dimensions of the balloon were enormous enough to be beyond the capabilities of Donaldson's management at that time. Three unsuccessful attempts were made at inflation, the balloon bursting each time, when finally the aeronaut Samuel Archer King was sent for, and the work was accomplished.|$|E
50|$|Dungaree fabric (used in English since 1605-15, {{from the}} Marathi dongrī) is a {{historical}} term for coarse thick 2/2 twill-weave cotton cloth, often coloured blue. <b>Cotton</b> <b>twill</b> with indigo dyed warp thread is now more {{commonly referred to as}} denim, or more specifically blue denim. The word is possibly derived from Dongri, a dockside village near Mumbai. In US English the term is used for hard-wearing work trousers made from such fabric, and in British English for bib overalls in various fabrics, either for casual or work use. By 1891 Kipling was using the word to refer to a kind of garment (in the plural) as well as a fabric.|$|E
50|$|The Harris Mill, {{also known}} as the Interlaken Mills, is a {{historic}} mill complex at 618 Main Street in the Harris village of Coventry, Rhode Island. This complex of ten buildings occupies a 4.3 acre parcel adjacent to the North Branch of the Pawtuxet River. The oldest portion of the main mill building dates to 1850, with a major expansion added in 1870. The mill was founded by Elisha Harris, who had recently served as Governor of Rhode Island, and produced <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> cloth. It was acquired by Interlaken Mills in 1900, for whom it had been a major supplier, and was operated until 1953.|$|E
50|$|BDUs were {{initially}} only issued in a 50/50 nylon and <b>cotton</b> <b>twill</b> blend, called the Temperate Weather BDU, or TWBDU. Complaints regarding the heat retention of these uniforms, especially following {{the invasion of}} Grenada in 1983, led {{to the introduction of}} the Hot Weather BDU, the HWBDU. The Hot Weather BDU coat and trousers were constructed of 100 percent ripstop cotton, in a four-color woodland camouflage pattern. However, after complaints of shorter wear and frayed cuffs, along with requirements imposed by unit commanders to starch the all-cotton uniform for parade, the Enhanced Hot Weather BDU (EHWBDU) replaced the HWBDU commencing in 1996. The EHWBDU's components are made with 50/50 ripstop nylon and cotton poplin blend.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s Kangol berets {{entered a}} new phase of fashion history with their {{adoption}} {{by members of the}} hip-hop community, such as Grandmaster Flash, Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Kangol Kid of UTFO, and The Notorious B.I.G. The brand was popularized even more by the 1991 movie New Jack City. The release of more consciously stylish products in the 1990s such as the furgora (angora-wool mix) Spitfire, was helped by its presence upon the head of Samuel L. Jackson in 1997. Kevin Eubanks, bandleader for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, sported a Kangol beret on an almost nightly basis. In 2009, Eminem wore the <b>Cotton</b> <b>Twill</b> Army Cap Kangol hat on his Beautiful video.|$|E
