5|$|Copper {{smelting}} was independently {{invented in}} different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led {{to the discovery of}} iron smelting. Production in the Old <b>Copper</b> <b>Complex</b> in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E

40|$|Investigations of {{bioactive}} <b>copper</b> <b>complexes</b> are {{of great}} interest for the pharmaceutical industry from the aspect of therapy of hypochromic microcitary anemia and hypocupremia. The structure of bioactive <b>copper</b> <b>complexes</b> with oligosaccharides {{has not yet been}} explained in details despite a number of studies. This work represents further development in the research of the complex structure and pharmacobiological activity of the <b>copper</b> <b>complexes.</b> Different <b>copper</b> <b>complexes</b> with dextran and pullulan oligosaccharides, as well as reduced derivatives, have been analyzed by IR spectroscopy. Characterization of the complexes has been performed by using modern spectroscopic techniques: RT-FTIR, LNT-FTIR, D 2 O-FTIR, ATR-FTIR and FTIR microspectroscopy. Results of FTIR microspectroscopic investigations show that the structural form of <b>complexes</b> and <b>copper</b> content depend considerably on constitution and ligands conformation, degree of crystallinity, polymerization, polydispersity, and linearity of macromolecules. Also, stability of the synthesized complexes, as well as their pharmacological effect, depend on these parameters.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{asymmetric}} copper-catalyzed 1, 4 -addition reactions new applications were established using triorganoaluminum reagents in etheral solvents.

Therefore, NMR spectroscopic investigations of the precatalytic structure of phosphoramidite <b>copper</b> <b>complexes</b> in THF-d 8 were performed. Combined low-temperature studies, spectra simulations, and a detailed integral analysis indicated [(CuIL) (CuIL 2) 4] as precatalyst in THF.

40|$|Several organic soluble N-based ligands {{and their}} <b>copper</b> <b>complexes</b> were firstly {{investigated}} as catalysts to depolymerise organosolv lignin in the organic solvent, dimethylformamide (DMF) and an ionic liquid (1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium xylenesulfonate, [emim][ABS]). The results of screening depolymerisation reactions in DMF and [emim][ABS] showed {{that all the}} copper–amine complexes catalysed lignin depolymerisation more efficiently in ionic liquids than in DMF. Among the seven types of ligands, <b>copper</b> <b>complexes</b> with two types of ligands (E) -N-(pyridin- 2 -ylmethylene) aniline and (E) - 4 -methoxy-N-(pyridin- 2 -ylmethylene) aniline depolymerised the lignin more efficiently than the others.

The most effective depolymerisation by conditions involved treatment at 180 °C for 12 h in [emim][ABS].

25|$|Between 10,800 and 9500 BCE, the {{continental}} glaciers retreated {{north of the}} Great Lakes. Glacial lake outburst floods occurred during the melt outflow. Flooding disturbed archaeological layers of lithics and ceramics in the alluvium of the south branch of the Potomac at the Romney bridge replacement archaeological site. Early Lake Erie, which was Lake Michigan and Lake Erie combined, flowed west out from Little River (Great Black Swamp proglacial lake's drainage embayment) and the Wabash River, before changing direction to the east into Glacial Lake Iroquois. Earlier sediments built up event outbursts, near the Little River, more than once which altered the drainage direction and the remaining Great Black Swamp. 3000 years ago, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie assumed their present shapes. Lake Erie's water level was similar to Lake Nipioing phase of Lakes Michigan and Huron basins 5,000 years ago. By 3500 years ago, the level had lowered by four meters and by 2000 years ago the level had increased to possibly five meters above today's levels. The Hopewell culture arrived from the north in west central Ohio and Indiana at least 2000 years ago. Earlier trading peoples also from the north, a vanguard Armstrong variant, in southwest West Virginia mingled peacefully with Late Adena peoples. Cold-worked copper from the pits in Wisconsin Old <b>Copper</b> <b>Complex</b> region {{have been found in}} some Adena mounds. The Upper Ohio Valley was experiencing the Sub-Atlantic climatic phase (3000–1750 years ago) of warm and moist climatic conditions and stable stream levels upon the occurrence of the Hopewell culture.
