40|$|In this paper, {{fundamental}} {{mechanisms for}} iron ore reduction in coal–ore mixtures {{have been investigated}} using several advanced experimental techniques. Firstly, the thermal properties of coal–ore mixtures were studied and apparent specific heat of coal–ore mixtures against temperature was obtained at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Several exothermic and endothermic peaks were observed which {{were related to the}} decomposition reactions and reduction. The flue gases from the mixture were analysed using a mass spectrometer. Secondly, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the iron phase analytical techniques were applied to identify the iron phase changes with the temperature. It has been found that <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> and iron oxides reduction occur simultaneously during the heating of the mixture. H₂ and CO gases produced from <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> and char gasification were responsible for the reduction of iron oxides at these temperatures. Iron oxides undergo step-wise reduction over the whole process. The results in this work provide a fundamental understanding for the direct reduced ironmaking processes...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 South Africa has {{large coal}} {{reserves}} and produces approximately 74 % of its primary energy from coal. Coal gasification using moving bed gasifiers {{is one of}} the most important coal utilisation technologies, consuming ± 17. 5 % of locally produced coal. This study was motivated by the need to investigate alternative coal gasification technologies for the utilisation of fine, high-ash and caking coals for future Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and coal to liquids (CTL) plants. These coals are estimated to form a large percentage of the remaining coal reserves in South Africa and could be difficult to utilise efficiently in moving bed gasifiers. Fluidised bed gasification was identified as a technology that could potentially utilise these coals. Coals from the New Vaal and Grootegeluk collieries were selected as being suitable for this investigation. The coals were subjected to detailed characterisation, bench-scale and pilot-scale fluidised bed gasification tests. The results of the pilot-scale atmospheric bubbling fluidised bed gasification tests show that stable gasification is possible at temperatures between 880 °C and 980 °C. The maximum fixed carbon conversion achievable in the pilot plant is, however, limited to ± 88 % due to the low reactivity of the coals tested and to thermal fragmentation and attrition of the coal in the gasifier. It was found that oxygen enrichment of the gasification air from 21 % to 36 % by means of oxygen addition produces a significant increase in the calorific value of the gas (3. 0 MJ/Nm 3 to 5. 5 MJ/Nm 3). This observation has not previously been reported at pilot-plant scale. A mathematical model for a bubbling fluidised bed coal gasifier was developed based on sub-models for fluidised bed hydrodynamics, <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation,</b> chemical reactions, transfer processes and fines generation. A <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> sub-model to predict the products of <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> in a fluidised bed gasifier was developed and incorporated into the model. Parameters associated with the rates of the gasification reactions and the devoltilisation process were obtained by means of bench-scale tests. The heat loss parameter (Q) in the model was estimated by means of a heat loss calculation. The results from the pilot-scale gasification tests were used to evaluate the predictive capability of the model. It was found that for temperature, fixed carbon conversion and calorific value of the gas the difference between measured and predicted values was less than 10 %. Recommendations are made for further refinement of the model to improve its predictive capability and range of application. The model was used to study the effect of major operating variables on gasifier performance. It was found that increasing the reactant gas (air, oxygen and steam) temperature from 250 °C to 550 °C increases the calorific value of the gas by ± 9. 3 % and the gasification efficiency by ± 6. 0 %. Increasing the fluidised bed height has a positive effect on fixed carbon conversion; however, at higher bed heights the benefit of increasing the bed height is less due to the inhibiting effects of H 2 and CO on the rates of char gasification.

40|$|Four {{different}} coals were investigated: two sub-bituminous, one bituminous and lignite, {{which were}} processed in the temperature range 750 - 950 Â Â°C. The heat for pyrolysis was generated by partial gasification of the char produced. Air {{was used as}} the gasifying medium with amounts of 0. 6 - 1. 5 m 3 /kg of coal, depending on the required gasification-temperature. Two sequential phenomena were taken into account: char gasification and <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> in respect of temperature. The experimental data on carbon dioxide and monoxide concentrations in a LCV gas produced were used for the correlation of Boudouard's equilibrium and the data on carbon burn-off and final volatile matter content in char were used for the solid-products yield. The equations for the quasi-equilibrium state were developed and calculated values were compared with the measurements. The model takes into account the equations developed and the total energy-balance assuming the heat losses of the experimental system. The investigated coal throughput amounted to 200 - 300 kg/h depending on the coal properties. Process characteristics were discussed, namely: the effect of air/coal ratio on the pyrolysis temperature; char and gas yield, volatile matter and ash content in a char; as well as the gas calorific value.

The resul- ting char was characterised regarding porosity, pore volume, surface area and particle size distribution. It was found that char porosity and pore volume increased with devolatilisation temperature and time. Devolatilisation operation conditions did not produce any effect on char’s specific surface area.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the influence that an advanced demineralisation procedure has on the combustion characteristics of coal. A high-volatile bituminous coal with 6. 2 % ash content was treated in a mixture of hydrofluoric and fluorosilicic acids (HF/H 2 SiF 6). Nitric acid was used either as a pre-treatment, or as a washing stage after HF/H 2 SiF 6 demineralisation, with an ash content as low as 0. 3 % being attained in the latter case. The structural changes produced by the chemical treatment were evaluated by comparison of the FTIR spectra of the raw and treated <b>coal</b> samples.

40|$|Intrinsic (chemical) {{kinetic data}} for gas-char {{reactions}} are typically measured under conditions where temperatures and pressures {{are lower than}} those in operational entrained flow gasifiers/combustors. In this paper, a method using an “effectiveness factor ” is applied to use intrinsic data in the determination of gasification rates at high temperatures and pressures {{as a function of}} several parameters (physical and morphological properties of coal-char and reactor conditions). A sub-model for gas-char reactions has been written and linked with a commercial CFD package, FLUENT, as a user-defined function (UDF). The numerical model presented in this paper is a steady-state 2 D axial-symmetric model which also includes <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation,</b> volatiles gas combustion; the effects of turbulence on the motion of the coal particles; and radiative heat transfer in the gas phase, moving particles and reactor walls. A Lagrangian scheme is used to trace the particles. The model provides detailed information on temperatures, reaction rates, gas composition and carbon conversion along the length of a high pressure entrained-flow reactor. A series of numerical simulations has been performed for the gasification of a range of Australian bituminous coals under different operating conditions (reactor temperatures & O:C ratio), and the results are then compared with the experimental data. The model results are consistent with operating practice, and provide novel insights into our understanding of the coal gasification reaction system...|$|E
40|$|The {{deployment}} of oxy-fuel combustion in utility boilers {{is one of}} the major options for CO 2 capture. However, combustion under oxy-firing conditions differs from conventional air-firing combustion, e. g., in the aspect of radiative heat transfer, coal conversion and pollutants formation. In this work, a numerical study on pulverised coal combustion was conducted to verify the applicability and accuracy of several sub-models refined for oxy-fuel conditions, e. g., gaseous radiative property model, gas-phase combustion mechanism and heterogeneous char reaction model. The sub-models were implemented in CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations of combustion of three coals under air-firing and various oxy-firing (21 – 35 % vol O 2 in O 2 /CO 2 mixture) conditions in an EFR (entrained flow reactor). The predicted coal burnouts and gaseous emissions were compared against experimental results. A good agreement between the simulations and experiments was achieved, indicating a good applicability and reliability of the refined sub-models and suitability of use of the experimentally derived kinetic data in <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> and char oxidation sub-models.

40|$|Knowledge of the <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> rate is {{of great}} {{importance}} because it exerts a marked effect on the overall combustion behaviour. Different approaches {{can be used to}} obtain the kinetics of the complex devolatilisation process. The simplest are empirical and employ global kinetics, where the Arrhenius expression is used to correlate rates of mass loss with temperature. In this study a high volatile bituminous coal was devolatilised at four different heating rates in a thermogravimetric analyser (TG) linked to a mass spectrometer (MS). As a first approach, the Arrhenius kinetic parameters (k and A) were calculated from the experimental results, assuming a single step process. Another approach is the distributed-activation energy model, which is more complex due to the assumption that devolatilisation occurs through several first-order reactions, which occur simultaneously. Recent advances in the understanding of coal structure have led to more fundamental approaches for modelling devolatilisation behaviour, such as network models. These are based on a physico-chemical description of coal structure. In the present study the FG–DVC (Functional Group–Depolymerisation, Vaporisation and Crosslinking) computer code was used as the network model and the FG–DVC predicted evolution of volatile compounds was compared with the experimental results. In addition, the predicted rate of mass loss from the FG–DVC model was used to obtain a third devolatilisation kinetic approach. The three methods were compared and discussed, with the experimental results as a reference.

It also accounts for heat conduction in the ceramic oven wall when assuming a constant temperature at the heating channel side. The model was solved numerically using partly implicit methods for gas flow and heat transfer problems. The histories of temperature, gas evolution and internal pressure were presented and analysed. The theoretical predictions of temperature change in the centre plane of the coke oven were compared with industrialscale measurements. Both, the experimental data and obtained numerical results show that moisture content determines the coking process dynamics, lagging the temperature increase above the water steam evaporation temperature and in consequence the total coking time.

40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} the applicability of Large Eddy Simulations to pulverised coal combustion. The Navier-Stokes equations that describe an incompressible tur- bulent reactive flow are presented, with a source term which ac- counts for {{the effect of the}} coal particles on the gas phase. Both a Eulerian and Lagrangian approach are presented to describe the coal particles motion and their heat exchange with the gas phase. The main processes that characterise pulverised <b>coal</b> combustion: <b>devolatilisation,</b> volatile combustion and char combustion are described and the main models to represent them are presented. The performance of the numerical approximation is tested on two main experimental cases: 1) a pulverised coal jet flame surrounded by a methane pilot and 2) a 100 kWth swirling burner operating in an O 2 /CO 2 environment. The results of the simulations are com- pared to qualitative and quantitative experimental measurements for both test cases. Finally a parametric study is performed on both test cases to understand firstly, which combustion processes are dominant and secondly to understand which models perform best for each experimental set-up. The results showed the Lagrangian approach to be more representative of the pulverised coal combustion process. The analysis for the pulverised coal jet flame, showed that the radiation and char combustion processes have almost negligible effect. Instead, the simulation results were highly sensitive to variations in the devolatilisation and volatile combustion models and model parameters. For the second test case, char combustion was dominant throughout most of the domain as the coal particles had a longer time to burn. The devolatilisation and volatile combustion processes were dominant at the initial stages of the combustion process and characterised the initial flame bhevaiour. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|On an {{international}} basis, coal is used extensively for power generation {{and this is}} likely to remain the case well into this century. Although many standard tests are currently used to assess and select coals for combustion purposes, these have proven to be unable to predict coal burnout behaviour. For a power station based on coal combustion, a clear knowledge and understanding of the coals offered in the market is essential to achieve optimum conversions and to meet environmental constraints. There is, therefore, a need to develop suitable and efficient methods and techniques to characterise coals so that the combustion plant performance can be predicted more effectively. In the present work, a series of experiments were conducted to characterise chars obtained from a Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) and a 1 MW combustion rig from which the effect of particle size distribution on <b>coal</b> reactions during <b>devolatilisation</b> and combustion of pulverised coal have been studied. The effect of temperature on coal pyrolysis in the DTF was also assessed. The coals used in this study were mainly from South America whose coals are widely traded internationally, and were characterised by standard tests and a novel automated image analysis technique called the Reactivity Assessment Program (RAP). The morphology of the chars were examined manually and using an automated image analysis technique and thermogravimetric analysis. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide a better understanding of the RAP and the automatic image analysis of chars, particularly related to South American coals. The results indicated that temperature significantly influences the <b>coal</b> behaviour during <b>devolatilisation,</b> and hence, the reactivity and morphology of the char generated. The structure and morphology of the char were found to play a significant role in burnout of the residual char, with a significant effect of coal type and particle size. Multiple linear regressions of char properties, such as intrinsic reactivity, morphology, and burnout, against particle size and maceral content of the feed coal were performed. The results showed that there was only a good correlation of high temperature volatiles with macerals. Subsequently when rank was included in the regressions, the correlation remarkably improved in all cases. However, when a novel approach which involved the correlations of char properties with bands of the grey scale histogram (RAP profile) of the coals was performed, much better correlations were achieved. The initial improvement is related, evidently, to the inclusion of the variation of vitrinite structure with rank. The grey scale histogram of coal takes this stage further by including the variation in reflectance for all the macerals. Therefore, the results indicate that the RAP analysis provides a simple and objective technique to predict the combustion behaviour of coals...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{advanced}} coal combustion and gasification processes operate under pressurised conditions. Current knowledge of the in situ effect of pressure on <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> and swelling, however, is limited, but is essentially required for optimisation of these technologies and to ensure future developments. During heating, fluidity is induced by breaking the coal covalent bonds and forming a plastic state where nucleation occurs, volatiles evolve as bubbles and they flow, diffuse, coalesce and rupture in a complex combination of events {{that lead to the}} transient structural evolution of the heated coal particle. The effect of pressure on swelling of individual coal particles {{is the subject of this}} work. Density fractions of particles were prepared using a sink-float technique to achieve homogeneous particle properties. Groups of particles from each density fraction were heated in a pressurised single particle reactor at pressures ranging from 0. 1 to 5 MPa. The thermal behaviour of each sample was recorded using a long distance microscope attached to a CCD camera. Pressure was found to have parallel and competitive effects on the particle fluidity and transient swelling, resulting in a maximum for both transient and ultimate particle swelling at pressures of 1 MPa. For pressures of over 2 MPa, the observed particle swelling was lower than at higher pressures. In most cases, post-swelling particle contraction was observed with the largest contractions occurring under atmospheric pressure conditions as a result of the major bubble rupture and consequent mass loss. The contraction showed a minimum at 2 MPa and a slight increase at the pressure of 5 MPa thought to be due to an increase of the time the particle remained fluid, enabling the high pressure to further deform the particle. Particles from the lower density group showed larger transient swelling and particle oscillations, while the transient swelling decreased rapidly with increases in the particle density...|$|E

This study is carried out considering a finite volume method (FVM) tool using AVL Fire version 2009. 2 coupled with the user defined subroutines especially for the <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> and char combustion modelling. This code is validated comparing the experimental radiative heat flux with the numerically predicted data and results show that reasonable agreement has been found with the measured radiative heat flux on the furnace wall. Different combustion environments were investigated including an air-fired as reference case and three recycled flue gas (RFG) fired combustion environments. The different cases are composed of varying recycled ratio (RR) between 65 % and 75 %. It {{was found that the}} flame temperature distribution for the reference case (air fired) and RR 72 % case were found to be similar. The flame temperature increased with O 2 concentration and decreasing RR. With the decrease of RR, the length of the flame is also shortened. The ignition condition improved with enriched O 2 concentration in the RR 65 % (O 230. 9 %, CO 269. 2 % by mass) case. The results show that radiative and convective heat flux is significantly manipulated by the RR. The position of peak radiative flux moves downstream with increasing RR due to increased mass flow rate and reduced O 2 at higher RR. With the increase of normalised total flow (NTF), mean flame temperature and exit temperature decreased whereas with the increase of normalised O 2 flow (NOF), mean flame temperature and exit temperature increase. The presented working range for the Russian coal, suggests that the air equivalent radiative heat flux can be obtained at a RR &# 8776; 71 % while air equivalent flame temperature were observed at RR of 72 %.

40|$|The {{release of}} sodium from low rank coal during {{combustion}} {{is known to}} be an important factor in the phenomena of fouling and corrosion in industrial boilers. Although much is known about the gas phase chemistry of sodium compounds, and the likely sequence of events that lead to fouling and corrosion, very little fundamental work has been undertaken on the release of sodium from the coal particle as it is combusted. The principal objective {{of this study was to}} perform detailed quantitative measurements and mathematical modelling of sodium release during combustion of single brown coal particles. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) was applied for the in-situ measurement of the atomic sodium concentration field in the plume of single Loy Yang brown coal particles. Laser absorption measurements at the sodium D 1 line (589. 59 nm) were utilised to calibrate PLIF measurements of atomic sodium in a purpose designed flat flame environment. Detailed measurements of atomic sodium in the plume of single combusting brown coal particles of varying amounts and forms of sodium and of varying particle sizes were then undertaken. A run-of-mine Loy Yang brown coal sample and two samples that were processed using Mechanical/Thermal Expression (MTE), which removed a fraction of the inherent moisture and concomitant dissolved salts, were investigated. An experiment was also performed to simultaneously measure the particle temperature, particle size, and the atomic sodium concentration in the plume of a single burning Loy Yang brown coal particle. From the experimental results, the proportions of sodium released during the stages of <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation,</b> char combustion and from the remaining ash after combustion were determined for the three coals used at various particle sizes. The relative differences between the sodium release behaviour of water-bound and organically bound sodium were also inferred. During char combustion, the release of sodium was determined to be dependent on both the particle temperature and particle size. In order to decouple these parameters and determine the true controlling parameter(s) for sodium release, a model was established for the release of sodium, the char burnout behaviour of the particles, and the particle surface temperature. By combining the modelling with further analysis of the experimental data, the temperature dependent kinetics of sodium release during brown coal char combustion were established. A full mechanism was also proposed for sodium release during the various stages of coal combustion, which suggested that the rate determining step for sodium release during char combustion is the formation of a reduced form of sodium in the char, which subsequently leads to the rapid loss of sodium from the particle. The results of this study advance the knowledge of the release of sodium from brown coal combustion. Two major contributions are the development of a methodology that enables the direct in-situ measurements of the concentration of atomic sodium in the plume of individual burning coal particles, and the establishment of the kinetics and mechanism for the release of sodium during Loy Yang brown coal combustion. These results provide, for the first time, essential data for the development of sodium release sub-models within large scale brown coal boiler Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models. Such models will help in the development of improved measures to mitigate fouling and corrosion problems in brown coal fired combustion and gasification systems. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The gasifier will be fed with imported, low sulphur coal and with Sardinian, high sulphur coal (Sulcis coal). Performance has been analysed {{by means of a}} computer simulation model developed at the DIMECA, which considers a “two zone” gasification process (<b>coal</b> drying and <b>devolatilisation</b> zone and char combustion and gasification zone), assuming thermodynamic equilibrium for the char combustion and gasification zone.

The results have also been compared with a second simulation model developed using Aspen Plus 12. 1 simulation software. This model enables to schematise, in more detail, the gasifier in different zones: coal preheating and drying, devolatilisation, gasification, combustion and oxidant preheating.

40|$|Advanced {{clean coal}} technologies, e. g. power {{generation}} from integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and {{pressurised fluidised bed}} combustor, have attracted increased interest from the scientific and technological communities {{over the last few}} decades. Pressures up to 40 atm have been applied to these technologies, which inherently result in an increase in coal throughput, a reduction in pollutant emissions and an enhancement in the intensity of reaction. Therefore, fundamental understanding of the effect of operating pressure on coal reactions is essential to the development of these technologies. In this paper, the pressure effect on a variety of aspects of coal reactions reported in the open literature has been reviewed. Major emphasis of the paper is given to experimental observations, although some theoretical modelling is reviewed. The pressure has been found to significantly influence the volatiles yield and <b>coal</b> swelling during <b>devolatilisation,</b> hence the structure and morphology of the char generated. More char particles of high porosity are formed at higher pressures. Char structure appears to {{play a significant role in}} burnout of residual char and ash formation. In general, at higher pressures, coal particles burn quicker and form finer ash particles. Increasing reactant pressure enhances char combustion and gasification reaction rate, which can be understood by an adsorption–desorption mechanism. These factors have been applied to the understanding of a practical high-pressure gasifier. Most of the work published has been at the lower temperatures (typically < 1000 °C), which can be achieved in experiments involving captive particles or coal samples. Experiments in pressurised TGA and wire mesh systems at these low temperatures are the most commonly reported, with some experiments for entrained flow system reported at the higher temperatures typical IGCC conditions in entrained flow reactors. Although the difficulty and cost have restricted these experiments, the entrained flow work is the current research need. The structure of the char generated has recently been related to char reactivity and the ash formed, but the mechanisms leading to the effect of pressure on this structure are not understood. Progressing the understanding of the formation of char structure at pressure and its relation to coal properties is an obvious research need...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} predict coal {{behaviour}} during certain utilisation processes, {{and to improve}} and develop coal conversion technologies, {{it is important to}} understand the swelling behaviour and plastic properties of coal. X-ray CT (computed tomography) and mercury submersion were used to quantitatively and qualitatively describe the swelling behaviour (N 2 atmosphere, 7 K/min) of large particles (− 20 + 16 mm) of South African coals, and were compared to conventional swelling related characteristics for powdered coals. Three South African coals, with low, intermediate and high Free Swelling Indices (FSI) were selected. Single coal particles were devolatilised (from ambient to 700 °C at 7 K/min) in a furnace equipped with a video camera. Image analysis was conducted on the images obtained from the furnace, to describe the swelling behaviour of single coal particles as a function of devolatilisation temperature. X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) and mercury submersion measurements were used to analyse particles before and after devolatilisation, to quantify the degree of swelling. While the FSI, dilatometry and Gieseler results did not indicate any plastic behaviour for the TWD sample (− 212 μm particles), the large particles did exhibit a significant degree of swelling during devolatilisation. The GG and TSH large coal particles started swelling at a slightly lower temperature than the initial softening temperature obtained by dilatometry for the − 212 μm coal particles. Image analysis qualitatively described the swelling behaviour of large <b>coal</b> particles during <b>devolatilisation,</b> while both the X-ray CT and mercury submersion methods quantified the volumetric swelling ratio of large coal particles. The average swelling ratios obtained for TWD, GG, and TSH respectively were 1. 9 ± 0. 5, 2. 1 ± 0. 6 and 2. 5 ± 0. 9 from image analysis and 1. 8 ± 0. 4, 2. 2 ± 1. 0 and 2. 5 ± 1. 0 from mercury submersion. The anomaly found for the TWD coal is expected, since mass transfer of tar and volatiles out of the particles will influence the thermoplastic behaviour, and consequently the difference in swelling behaviour due to particle size variation. Therefore, it is hypothesised that the FSI, and other conventional techniques used to describe the plastic behaviour of small particles of coal, can in general not be used for the prediction of large coal particle swellingSouth African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation of South Africa (Chair Grant No. 86880, UID 85643, Grant No. 85632) [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{measured}} coke reactivity index (CRI) and coke strength after reaction (CSR) {{determined in}} experiments based on coke formed in pilot-scale coke ovens {{are the two}} main parameters that are employed to evaluate coke for its potential utilization in the blast furnace. Thermoplasticity, such as swelling, permeability and fluidity, chemical reactions, such as the evolution of gases and tars, and thermal changes, such as heat of devolatilisation and thermal conductivity, on coal heating are known to dominate the transformation of coal to coke in the coke oven, and determine the CRI and CSR of coke. Coal properties, such as vitrinite and inertinite components, and coking conditions, such as heating rate and particle size, have also been found to influence the physical, chemical and thermal properties during coking. Many studies have previously investigated the swelling of different coals and coal maceral concentrates {{as well as the}} influence of heating rate and particle size on swelling during coking. The literature has highlighted the correlations between swelling, mass loss and the properties of the released tars and gases for a range of coals and coal maceral concentrates using a number of techniques. However, the correlations between swelling and the dynamic evolution of total volatiles (gases and tars), and the physical and chemical properties of the evolved tars, are made from data collected from independent experiments and therefore the interpretations are not very clear. Previous work compared heat of devolatilisation between thermal coals and coking coals. For coking coals only, the differences in heat of devolatilisation and thermal conductivities between high fluidity and low fluidity coking coals also were studied. However, reasons for the differences in the thermal properties of different coals are still unclear. In particular, the effects of coal maceral components on heat of <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> and thermal conductivity are still unknown. The potential associations of swelling and thermal changes with the properties of tars for coals and coal maceral concentrates are scarcely studied. The main objectives of this study are therefore to identify the sequence of physical, chemical and thermal changes of heating coal and coal maceral concentrates to provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms in the transformation of coal to coke. This work in particular is focused on (a) separation of coal maceral concentrates without using chemicals; (b) simultaneous measurements of swelling and thermal changes of heating coal and coal maceral concentrates from a single experimental run; (c) characterising the dynamic evolution of gases and tars for difference coal maceral concentrates; (d) revealing the mechanisms in the transformation of coal to coke thereby correlating the physical, chemical and thermal changes of coal and coal maceral concentrates. To achieve the objectives, three novel techniques were employed. A water based device called the Reflux Classifier was employed to separate coal maceral concentrates on the basis of varying settling rates of different density particles. The existing Computer Aided Thermal Analysis (CATA) technique was modified to simultaneously estimate swelling and shrinkage, permeability, apparent volumetric specific heat and thermal conductivity of heating coal and coal maceral concentrates. Swelling and shrinkage of the heating coal and coal maceral concentrates were measured by the contraction and expansion of a compressible spring. The permeability of heating coal pellet was estimated based on Darcy’s law by the measurements of swelling of coal sample bed and the pressure drop of gas flowing through the coal sample bed. The pressure drop of gas flowing through the coal sample bed was measured using a pressure sensor. Endothermic and exothermic behaviour of heating samples was evaluated based on the estimated apparent volumetric specific heat. The apparent volumetric specific heat and thermal conductivity were estimated by the measurements of the control, surface and centre temperatures of the heating sample. A new technique, Dynamic Elemental Thermal Analysis (DETA), was used to measure the evolution of total volatiles, gases and tars from different coal maceral components. The released tars of maceral concentrates during devolatilisation were condensed using a tar condenser, while the residual tars in char were extracted using solvents of acetone and toluene. The physical properties, such as boiling point, and chemical properties, such as elemental compositions, for condensable and extracted tars also were evaluated using the DETA technique...|$|E

Due to the altered ignition and combustion feature of coal under this environment, the oxy-fuel burner has to be re-designed. With the construction and testing in various pilot-scale and demonstration-scale power plant, oxy-fuel combustion has been progressively advancing in recent years. However, most of these studies were centred towards the use of black coal as the main fuel source. Therefore, Victorian brown coal (VBC) is highlighted in this thesis due to the limited knowledge for its oxy-fuel combustion. VBC also possesses distinct properties and also burns distinctively from other coal. Although coal ignition has been widely studied, the impact of alkali and alkaline earth metal (AAEM) species and moisture, which are abundant in brown coal, are scarcely reported. The AAEM species are responsible for notorious slagging and fouling in the boiler which can be subsided via the injection of fuel additives. Additionally, the recirculation of flue gas is also likely to increase the overall steam concentration in the furnace. Understand of all these impacts on VBC ignition are essential for the deployment of oxy-fuel combustion in Latrobe Valley, Victoria. The scope of this research involves both experimental and modeling studies. For the experimental aspects of this research, a bench-scale entrained flow reactor with flat flame burner is commissioned for ignition study. Using an advance in-situ non-intrusive diagnostics facility, coal ignition behavior is captured in a series of photograph to elucidate the transient phenomena occurring during the particle heat up, devolatilisation and ignition. For the modeling approach, series of mathematical equations for coal combustion are written in MATLAB, including a single-film model to quantitatively describe the contribution of the two gasification reactions on char burnout and a transient ignition model for the ignition of dense particle stream. The calculated results are validated by experimental measurements. The first part of this research involves the investigation of the effect of AAEM species on coal ignition. The Chinese lignite from Xinjiang, which is rich in AAEM species, is used for this experiment. Further to that, ignition of coal upon the addition of kaolinite and the removal of AAEM are also investigated. The injection of kaolinite has a negligible effect on coal ignition but enhances the volatile decomposition rate. With the removal of AAEM species, the demineralised coal ignites considerably slower. This delay, however, can be eliminated by increasing the oxygen concentration to 30 % in oxy-firing mode. Following that, the second distinct property in brown coal, abundant inherent moisture, is studied. Victorian brown coal with differing moisture content from 12 % to 30 % is prepared. It was later found that the coal ignition can occur although moisture in brown coal is not completely evaporated. This remaining moisture, referred to as inherent moisture, exerts influence on the subsequent devolatilisation and char combustion rate. Nonetheless, wet brown coal still ignites slightly later compared to its air-dried counterpart. An oxygen concentration of 30 % in oxy-firing was also found sufficient to compensate for the detrimental effect of the inherent moisture on coal ignition. Next, the impact of the remaining moisture is investigated during char combustion process. From a modeling approach, it has been clarified that the un-evaporated moisture in wet coal is further released with the volatiles simultaneously in the air-firing mode. On the other hand, a portion of the inherent moisture still remains even after <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> in the oxy-firing case. This residing moisture on particle surface later triggers a char-steam gasification reaction and its contribution is quantified through the modeling study in MATLAB. Finally, this research concludes with the ignition study of dense particle stream as means to extend these results to a real pulverized coal-fired burner. Here, it is more interesting to evaluate the effect of elevated steam concentration in the flue gas rather than evaluating the effect of the inherent moisture in the raw coal. Surprisingly, a faster ignition under the steam-rich condition was revealed from this research. This is later confirmed from modeling approach that the homogenous water-gas shift reaction is influential in accelerating the ignition of the volatiles released from Victorian brown coal. In summary, this thesis has identified a number of distinct features associated with the ignition and burnout of Victorian brown coal in the oxy-fuel combustion mode. Some of these findings can be further extended to commercial software for industrial applications. This research ultimately provides a clearer picture on ignition behavior of Victorian brown coal that is essential to develop an oxy-fuel burner...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{economic}} benefits of pulverised coal injection (PCI) into blast furnace include {{a reduction in the}} cost of hot metal, resulting primarily from decreased coke consumption and an increase in hot metal production. Since coal is consumed directly, without going through the cokemaking plant, PCI is also thought to be environmentally friendly. Therefore, PCI has become a standard practice in many blast furnaces worldwide. To improve the performance of PCI operation, a comprehensive understanding of pulverised coal combustion behaviours are required. The goal of this thesis was to study the coal burning characteristics in the regions of blowpipe, tuyere and raceway through both numerical and experimental methodology. From the validation of model, the calculation region and the application of calculated results in practice, the PCI combustion model was developed through 4 phases in this work: (1) validation of the coal combustion model by comparing its predictions with experimental data; (2) investigation into the influence of operation conditions to coal burnout in the regions of blowpipe and tuyere; (3) performance evaluation of coal blend injection in terms of pressure loss caused by combustion within a simplified raceway space; and (4) examination of combustion characteristics of oxy-coal injection technology in the regions of blowpipe, tuyere and raceway, which is a porous space featured by Eulerian-Eulerian multi-fluid approach. In the first phase, the performance of <b>coal</b> <b>devolatilisation</b> models and kinetic parameters were validated by comparing predicted gas temperature profiles with the experimental results of Burgess et al. (1983). It is found that the kinetic parameters proposed by Ubhayakar et al (1976) for the two competing devolatilisation model permit a reasonable simulation of the measured results for blast furnace conditions. The coal combustion in the regions of blowpipe and tuyere was modelled under the conditions of CSC’s N⁰ 3 blast furnace in the second phase. The influence of operation conditions to coal burnout was comprehensively studied. It is found early ignition can be achieved with higher coal burnout when the double lance is employed instead of the single one. Accordingly, the injection lance used at CSC was changed from the single to the double air-cooled coaxial lance arrangement in 2002. In the third phase, the calculation was extended to the raceway with simplified configuration. The performance of coal blend injection was examined. As indicated in the calculation results, a decrease in coal burnout is found with decreasing the coal volatile content, while the pressure loss within the raceway can be abated due to less volatile released to gas and moderate gas expansion in the combustion region. With improved permeability, more hot blast air can be introduced into the blast furnace for higher productivity. Consequently, the high volatile coal injection was replaced by the coal blend (mixtures of high and low volatile coals) injection at CSC in 2003. In the last phase, the Eulerian-Eulerian multi-fluid model was employed for the prediction of raceway configuration with consideration of coke combustion in all coke operation. Validation work against measured raceway shape and gas composition distribution by Nogami et al. (2005) indicates that the model is acceptable for the simulation. The calculation results show the oxy-coal lance injection enables to fulfil two contradictory conditions at the same time: (1) to retard the coal combustion for moderating the pressure loss in the upstream of coal plume; and (2) to enhance coal combustion and reduce unburnt char generation in the downstream of coal plume. Taking these advantages from the oxy-coal lance injection, blast furnaces can be operated with more blast for higher productivity, or with higher PCI rate for lower fuel cost, thereby achieving the goal of hot metal production with energy saving. In this work, a drop tube furnace has been established and used to provide fundamental insights on PCI coal combustion behaviours. The experiments were carried out in three stages. In the first stage, the volatile release and the generation of char particle and tiny aerosols in the region of coal plume were studied. Only the tested low volatile coal (HGI= 85) with larger size (100 - 200 mesh) exhibits fragmentation during heating. This may encourage the use of low volatile coals in granular coal injection. Significant char agglomeration is found for both tested high and low volatile coals with smaller size (200 - 325 mesh). It implies that excessive grinding may be avoided in PCI operation. Considering the generation of tiny aerosols composed of soot particles and tar droplets, it is mainly determined by the content of volatile matter and elemental oxygen. In the second stage, a technology has been developed and employed at CSC to evaluate the combustion efficiency of PCI coals. It is found that the coal burnout increases with decreasing the fuel ratio (FC/VM), except for certain coals departing from the general trend. It {{can be explained by the}} effect of maceral content to coal combustion. When the coal size is smaller than 200 mesh, the burnout can not be improved further, resulting from the agglomeration of fine particles. In the PCI operation at CSC, the coal quantity passing through 200 mesh has been reduced from 80 to 60 %. The experiments for the last stage aim to gain a fundamental insight into the combustion characteristics of pulverised biofuels under conditions pertinent to the raceway of blast furnace. From the van Krevelen diagram, it is found that the rate of hydrogen release from biomass fuels is faster than that of oxygen during the pre-treatment. An increase in pretreating temperature almost linearly decreases the burnout of biofuels. As revealed in the experimental results, the fuel properties, such as fuel ratio, burnout, and ignition temperature, of biomass torrefied at 300 °C or pyrolysed between 400 and 500 °C, are between a high-volatile bituminous coal and a low-volatile one. Therefore, the pretreated biomass can partially replace the coals consumed for PCI and blends with coals to keep reasonable burnout in raceways. It is emphasised that, due to the objectives of this thesis, some results or countermeasures obtained from the comprehensive experimental and numerical studies have been taken into PCI operation at CSC. This seems as a limitation of this study, but it may have a wide range of applications for the improvement of PCI operation...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{swelling}} and caking propensity of coals may cause operational {{problems such as}} channelling and excessive pressure build-up in combustion, gasification and specifically in fluidised-bed and fixed-bed operations. As a result, the {{swelling and}} caking characteristics of certain coals make them less suitable for use as feedstock in applications where swelling and/or caking is undesired. Therefore, various {{studies have focused on}} the manipulation of the swelling and/or caking propensity of coals, and have proven the viability of using additives to reduce the swelling and caking of powdered coal (< 500 μm). However, there is still a lack of research specifically focused on large <b>coal</b> particle <b>devolatilisation</b> behaviour, particularly swelling and caking, and the reduction thereof using additives. A comprehensive study was therefore proposed to investigate the swelling and caking behaviour of large coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm) of typical South African coals, and the influence of the selected additive (potassium carbonate) thereon. Three different South African coals were selected based on their Free Swelling Index (FSI) : coal TSH is a high swelling coal (FSI 9) from the Limpopo province, GG is a medium swelling coal (FSI 5. 5 - 6. 5) from the Waterberg region, and TWD is a non-swelling coal (FSI 0) from the Highveld region. Image analysis was used to semi-quantitatively describe the transient swelling and shrinkage behaviour of large coal particles (- 20 + 16 mm) during lowtemperature devolatilisation (700 °C, N 2 atmosphere, 7 K/min). X-ray computed tomography and mercury submersion were used to quantify the degree of swelling of large particles, and were compared to conventional swelling characteristics of powdered coals. The average swelling ratios obtained for TWD, GG, and TSH were respectively 1. 9, 2. 1 and 2. 5 from image analysis and 1. 8, 2. 2 and 2. 5 from mercury submersion. The results showed that coal swelling measurements such as FSI, and other conventional techniques used to describe the plastic behaviour of powdered coal, can in general not be used for the prediction of large coal particle swelling. The large coal particles were impregnated for 24 hours, using an excess 5. 0 M K 2 CO 3 impregnation solution. The influence of K 2 CO 3 -addition on the swelling behaviour of different coal particle sizes was compared, and results showed that the addition of K 2 CO 3 resulted in a reduction in swelling for powdered coal (- 212 μm), as well as large coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm). For powdered coal, the addition of 10 wt. % K 2 CO 3 decreased the free swelling index of GG and TSH coals from 6. 5 to 0 and from 9. 0 to 4. 5, respectively. The volumetric swelling ratios (SRV) of the 20 mm particles were reduced from 3. 0 to 1. 8 for the GG coal, and from 5. 7 to 1. 4 for TSH. In contrast to the non-swelling (FSI 0) behaviour of the TWD powders, the large particles exhibited average SRV values of 1. 7, and was found not be influenced by K 2 CO 3 -impregnation. It was found that the maximum swelling coefficient, kA, was reduced from 0. 025 to 0. 015 oC- 1 for GG, and from 0. 045 to 0. 027 oC- 1 for TSH, as a results of impregnation. From the results it was concluded that K 2 CO 3 -impregnation reduces the extent of swelling of coals such as GG (medium-swelling) and TSH (high-swelling), which exhibit significant plastic deformation. Results obtained from the caking experiments indicated that K 2 CO 3 -impregnation influenced the physical behaviour of the GG coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm) the most. The extent of caking of GG was largely reduced due to impregnation, while the wall thickness and porosity also decreased. The coke from the impregnated GG samples had a less fluid-like appearance compared to coke from the raw coal. Bridging neck size measurements were performed, which quantitatively showed a 25 - 50 % decrease in the caking propensity of GG particles. Coal TWD did not exhibit any caking behaviour. The K 2 CO 3 -impregnation did not influence the surface texture or porosity of the TWD char, but increased the overall brittleness of the devolatilised samples. Both the extent of caking and porosity of TSH coke were not influenced by impregnation. However, impregnation resulted in significantly less and smaller opened pores {{on the surface of the}} devolatilised samples, and also reduced the average wall thickness of the TSH coke. The overall conclusion made from this investigation is that K 2 CO 3 (using solution impregnation) can be used to significantly reduce the caking and swelling tendency of large coal particles which exhibits a moderate degree of fluidity, such as GG (Waterberg region). The results obtained during this investigation show the viability of using additive addition to reduce the caking and swelling tendency of large coal particles. Together with further development, this may be a suitable method for modifying the swelling and caking behaviour of specific coals for use in fixed-bed and fluidised-bed gasification operations.
