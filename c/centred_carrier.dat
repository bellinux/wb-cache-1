40|$|Wideband {{signals are}} already playing an {{important}} role in telecommunications and radar remote sensing. In telecommunication applications, large-bandwidth signals are required for generating high channel capacity and data-transfer rates. In radar-imaging applications, large bandwidths are required for obtaining higher spatial resolution, for instance. The well known benefits of wideband signals, however, are available only under the premise that the free-space propagation effects do not distort or impair the amplitude and phase composition of the different frequency components contained in such signals. Indeed, the so-called free-space is, however, often filled with precipitation media, such as rain. Contrary to popular belief, such media are entirely capable of generating dispersion by causing unequal attenuation and phase-shift of the different frequency components present in the wideband signal. In this contribution, we shall report investigations in this regard. More precisely, using an appropriate scattering model of rain media, we shall, in the first step, quantify the frequency dependent amplitude extinction and phase-shift in rain media for different frequencies in the range of 1 - 60 GHz. In the second step, we shall use this information to quantify the distortion of wideband signals with different <b>centre</b> <b>carrier</b> frequencies and different modulation depths. Also, the results will be used to construct the ‘channel impulse response’ appropriate for different rain media that are likely to occur in reality. In this contribution, for brevity and accuracy of scattering calculations, the polarization dependence of rain media will not be considered. The results should enable the radar engineer and the telecommunication engineer to estimate the degree of tropospheric-propagation induced distortion of wideband signals both in the frequency domain and the time domain. ...|$|R

Marimastat is an MMP inhibitor with potent in-vitro antimetastatic activity and was recently in Phase III clinical trials for a variety of cancer types. We have synthesised a Co(II 1) complex of marimastat incorporating the tetradentate ligand tpa (tris(2 -methylpyridyl) amine) as a carrier ligand. The complex was structurally characterised in the solid state by single crystal X-ray diffraction, the first example of a crystal structure containing marimastat. 2 D COSY and NOESY NMR spectra showed that the complex exists in two isomeric forms in solution, corresponding to the cis and trans isomers yet only crystallises in one of these forms. Biological testing of the complex in mice with 4 T 1. 2 tumours showed interesting and unexpected outcomes. Initial results of the tumour growth inhibition study showed that a significant inhibition of growth was exhibited by the complex over the free inhibitor and the control. However, the metastatic potential of both free marimastat and the complex were higher than the control indicating likely problems with the experimental protocol.

The attention has been focused on a unknown family of Ferrara which was an important role for the artistic movement of that city: the Calcagnini family. The history of this family and its possessions in terms of paintings and works of art was performed in the archives of Modena, Ferrara and Rome where the Calcagnini private heritage it’s recorded (family archive, notary files, letters of the family members, etc.). This thesis is organized into two sections. Aim of the first part is to illustrate the nature of the Calcagnini’s collection during the Seicento and its evolution in the following century; the second part aims to give an overview of its artistic asset, unfortunately lost to this date. This investigation has allowed us to not only follow the hereditary path of the family picture collection from mid of XVII century, but also to display the inedit Calcagnini’s relations – in terms of collecting – with others important families in Ferrara during the seicento and settecento, such as with the Pio di Savoia, Varano and Villa families. The recovered appraisal of the assets, often drawn up by qualified painters, describes different attributive proposals that make us understand the collection trends of the various members of this family. Having a leading member of this family, Carlo Leopoldo, elected bishop and resident in Rome, has enabled to identify new connections, particularly artistic, between the legatine centre and the Papal Court following a tradition started with the devolution in 1598 since Leopoldo’s collection was sent to his heir in Ferrara in 1746. This last rich roman collection, in particularly, reflects the classic-Arcadian taste successful in the contemporary prelates Courts, as we can found in Michel Rocca’s paintings, whose some work of art has been here identified. Like for the Seicento, even for the XVIII Century has been found inventories of other distinguished collectors, strictly related to the ferrarese as well as the roman scenes, like the abbot Giuseppe Carli, erudite connoisseur, or the abbot Carlo Cesare Grazzini whose piece of works ended in the legatine <b>centre</b> as <b>carrier</b> of new ideas and new artistic creations. ...|$|R

Methods and results: Anthropometric and metabolic assessment and B-mode ultrasound of the carotid IMT were measured in 1306 subjects [589 men; 717 women, mean +/- SD age 43. 8 +/- 8. 3 years, BMI 25. 5 +/- 4. 0 kg/m(2) ] recruited from 19 centres in 14 European countries. Carriers of the - 11426 G allele and homozygous carriers of the - 11391 G allele had significantly lower plasma adiponectin levels. These relationships remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, recruitment <b>centre,</b> and BMI. <b>Carriers</b> of SNP - 11377 G allele had significantly greater IMT values compared with C allele homozygotes [geometric mean (interquartile range) 601 (543 - 665) vs. 590 (537 - 647) mm, P = 0. 021].

This is mainly {{due to the fact}} that large-area (industrial) graphene includes in its structure and on its surfaces a significant density of defects that make as many traps and scattering <b>centres</b> for charge <b>carriers.</b> The idea of the present work, contrary to diminishing the defect density, is to use the defects and the very large surface to volume ratio of that 2 D material, to transform it into high sensitivity sensors. When defects are useful, low-temperature growth becomes the method that best satisfies both physical and financial demands. Here, we further decrease preparation costs by performing growth not only at low temperature directly on the final insulating substrate (glass), but also by printing the device contacts by ink-jet printing.

40|$|Animals {{communicate}} in non-ideal and noisy conditions. The primary method {{they use to}} improve communication efficiency is sender-receiver matching: the receiver's sensory mechanism filters the impinging signal based on the expected signal. In the context of acoustic communication in crickets, such a match {{is made in the}} frequency domain. The males broadcast a mate attraction signal, the calling song, in a narrow frequency band <b>centred</b> on the <b>carrier</b> frequency (CF), and the females are most sensitive to sound close to this frequency. In tree crickets, however, the CF changes with temperature. The mechanisms used by female tree crickets to accommodate this change in CF were investigated at the behavioural and biomechanical level. At the behavioural level, female tree crickets were broadly tuned and responded equally to CFs produced within the naturally occurring range of temperatures (18 to 27 degrees C). To allow such a broad response, however, the transduction mechanisms that convert sound into mechanical and then neural signals must also have a broad response. The tympana of the female tree crickets exhibited a frequency response that was even broader than suggested by the behaviour. Their tympana vibrate with equal amplitude to frequencies spanning nearly an order of magnitude. Such a flat frequency response is unusual in biological systems and cannot be modelled as a simple mechanical system. This feature of the tree cricket auditory system not only has interesting implications for mate choice and species isolation but may also prove exciting for bio-mimetic applications such as the design of miniature low frequency microphones...|$|R
