50|$|Production of the 3-wheeled Mechanical Horse {{commenced}} in 1934. The design {{had been}} refined in 1933 by Oliver Danson North, who modified the original prototype. This featured automatic trailer coupling {{and the single}} front wheel could be steered through 360 degrees. This was a very simple and sturdy vehicle which was constructed on a steel channel frame and fitted with a wooden cab, the early versions having canvas doors. The Mechanical Horse came in two sizes, capable of carrying loads of three tons and six tons, {{each of the two}} sizes had a corresponding <b>coupling</b> <b>size,</b> which became known as the 3-ton and the 6-ton coupling. The tractor units were powered by Scammell's own side valve petrol engine of 1125cc in the 3 ton version and 2043cc in the larger 6 tonner. The engine was offset {{to the left of the}} cab, which could cause stability problems in some circumstances. The vehicles had manoeuvrability which was unmatched; it was possible to turn through 360 degrees in under 20 feet with a 16-foot trailer. The road speed of about 20 mph suited the vehicle to local deliveries, and fuel consumption of 10 to 20 mpg was acceptable. Railway companies were the primary customers for the Mechanical Horse, but they were also used by a number of private companies, particularly breweries, who valued the nimble little lorries. The British armed forces used them in stores and on aircraft carriers. The 6-ton coupling equipment was also fitted to popular makes of lorry such as Bedford, Thornycroft and Austin. Bedford tractor units so equipped were sold under the Bedford-Scammell brand. Such was the popularity and success of the Mechanical Horse that there was a separate sales department using dealers for this unique machine. During the difficult trading years of the 1930s the threewheeler was the saviour of Scammell Lorries Ltd.|$|E

System 1 had 34 classes, System 2 had 318 classes, System 3 383 classes, System 4 1055 classes, and System 5 1460 classes. Metric values were computed for the Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM), Coupling between Object Classes (CBO), Response For a Class (RFC), Number of Children (NOC), Depth of Inheritance (DIT), Weighted Methods per Class (WMC), Number of Public Methods (NPM) and Afferent Coupling (CA). LCOM was used as cohesion variable; CBO, RFC, CA as coupling variables; WMC, NPM, NOC as size variables and DIT as inheritance variable.

This fact is corroborated by the huge amount of metrics that have appeared in the literature related to the measurement of UML diagrams at a high level design stage. Most of these metrics are focused on the measurement of internal quality attributes such as structural complexity, <b>coupling,</b> <b>size,</b> etc. However, none of the proposed metrics take into account the added complexity involved when a UML model are complemented by expressions written in Object Constraint Language (OCL), that is a UML/OCL model. Due OCL is essential in building consistent and coherent platform-independent models we propose a metric suite for structural properties of OCL expressions. These metrics were proposed considering OCL concepts related to the "chunking" and "tracing" cognitive techniques.

40|$|A first-principles {{approach}} to the unitarity problem for black holes is systematically explored, based on the postulates of 1) quantum mechanics 2) the ability to approximately locally divide quantum gravitational systems into subsystems 3) correspondence with quantum field theory predictions for appropriate observers and (optionally) 4) universality of new gravitational effects. Unitarity requires interactions between the internal state {{of a black hole}} and its surroundings that have not been identified in the field theory description; correspondence with field theory indicates that these are soft. A conjectured information-theoretic result for information transfer between subsystems, partly motivated by a perturbative argument, then constrains the minimum <b>coupling</b> <b>size</b> of these interactions of the quantum atmosphere of a black hole. While large couplings are potentially astronomically observable, given this conjecture one finds that the new couplings can be exponentially small in the black hole entropy, yet achieve the information transfer rate needed for unitarization, due to the large number of black hole internal states. This provides a new possible alternative to arguments for large effects near the horizon. If universality is assumed, these couplings can be described as small, soft, state-dependent fluctuations of the metric near the black hole. Open questions include that of the more fundamental basis for such an effective picture. Comment: 31 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|Stein’s {{method is}} used to obtain two theorems on multivariate normal approximation. Our main theorem, Theorem 1. 2, {{provides}} a bound on the distance to normality for any nonnegative random vector. Theorem 1. 2 requires multivariate size bias coupling, which we discuss in studying the approximation of distributions of sums of dependent random vectors. In the univariate case, we briefly illustrate this approach for certain sums of nonlinear functions of multivariate normal variables. As a second illustration, we show that the multivariate distribution {{counting the number of}} vertices with given degrees in certain random graphs is asymptotically multivariate normal and obtain a bound on the rate of convergence. Both examples demonstrate that this approach may be suitable for situations involving non-local dependence. We also present Theorem 1. 4 for sums of vectors having a local type of dependence. We apply this theorem to obtain a multivariate normal approximation for the distribution of the random p-vector which counts the number of edges in a fixed graph both of whose vertices have the same given color when each vertex is colored by one of p colors independently. All normal approximation results presented here do not require an ordering of the summands related to the dependence structure. This is in contrast to hypotheses of classical central limit theorems and examples, which involve e. g., martingale, Markov chain, or various mixing assumptions.

40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of cephalopods are poorly understood because intra-specific size-at-age is characteristically variable. Much {{of the variation}} observed is attributed to temperature and food, but other generally overlooked factors such as hatchling size and inherent growth capacities also affect size-at-age. In the present paper, we investigated the relative influence of the principal abiotic (environmental temperature) and biotic (food consumption, hatchling size, inherent growth capacity) factors affecting size-at-age in immature octopus. Using a bioenergetics model and size-at-age data of wild-caught immature Octopus pallidus, we simulated the juvenile growth trajectories of individuals hatched in different seasons (summer, autumn and winter) based on food availability, metabolism, environmental temperature and individual variability, under an assumption of 2 - phase growth. Simulations predict {{that the effect of}} hatchling size on size-at-age was secondary to that of inherent growth capacity. Projections suggest that wild immature populations comprise a mixture of individuals displaying exponential growth and 2 -phase growth and that the proportion of each depends primarily on the individuals’ inherent growth capacities and food availability. High food intake was projected to decrease the number of individuals displaying 2 -phase growth by delaying the transition between the 2 growth phases, resulting in larger individuals. Overall, individuals hatched in summer grew to larger sizes and matured earlier than individuals hatched in autumn or winter, independent of food availability. The size-at-age distribution of the summer and autumn cohorts tended to become bimodal under certain food intake levels, which highlights the importance of <b>coupling</b> <b>size</b> data with accurate age estimates in future octopus population studies...|$|E

40|$|Computer {{software}} {{has become}} an important foundation in several versatile domains including medicine, engineering, etc. Consequently, with such widespread application of software, the essential need of ensuring certain software quality characteristics such as efficiency, reliability and stability has emerged. In order to measure such software quality characteristics, we must wait until the software is implemented, tested and put to use for {{a certain amount of}} time. Several software metrics have been proposed in the literature to avoid this long and costly process, and they proved to be a good means of estimating software quality. For this purpose, software quality prediction models are built. These are used to establish a relationship between internal sub-characteristics such as inheritance, <b>coupling,</b> <b>size,</b> etc. and external software quality attributes such as maintainability, stability, etc. Using such relationships, one can build a model in order to estimate the quality of new software systems. Such models are mainly constructed by either statistical techniques such as regression, or machine learning techniques such as C 4. 5 and neural networks. We build our model using machine learning techniques in particular rule-based models. These have a white-box nature which gives the classification as well as the reason for it making them attractive to experts in the domain. In this thesis, we propose a novel heuristic based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to optimize rule-based software quality prediction models. We validate our technique on data describing maintainability and reliability of classes in an Object-Oriented system.

40|$|A {{physical}} model of starch structure during hydrolysis is presented. The model states that various crystalline {{states of the}} constituent starch molecules are present {{throughout the course of}} degradation. These crystalline states are associated with the natural state of the strach granule as well as with recrystallized states caused by retrogradation. In order to properly describe enzymatic starch liquefaction, these crystalline states must be accounted for. ^ An appropriate means of determining the macromolecular size and molecular size distribution of starch during hydrolysis, aqueous size exclusion chromatography, is developed. The method employs a strong alkaline mobile phase and porous gel chromatographic supports which are stable to the basic solutions. The separation range of molecular sizes can be extended by <b>coupling</b> <b>size</b> exclusion chromatographic columns in a manner that will maintain linearity in molecular size separation with elution volume. Although separation efficiency is mass transfer limited, efficiency of separation can be increased by controlling eluent flow rate and gel particle packing size and packing size distribution. ^ Although the size exclusion chromatographic system cannot be calibrated directly using well characterized starches due to their non-availability, secondary calibrants can be used for this purpose. Commercially available polyelectrolytes (sodium polystyrene sulfonates) and polysaccharides (dextrans) are appropriate calibrants for aqueous size exclusion chromatography, provided the basic phenomena governing separation are understood. Molecular size in solution, as measured by hydrodynamic volume, controls separation by size exclusion. Excluded volume effects are incorporated into the calculation of the molecular hydrodynamic volume. The electrostatic interactions present in polyelectrolytes are modeled as an excluded volume effect. When the hydrodynamic volume of the two secondary standards is determined using these concepts, a common calibration curve results for moderate to high ionic strength alkaline solutions. Other effects dominate for basic solutions of low ionic strength and for eluents with different co-solutes. ^ Monitoring enzymatic starch depolymerization by aqueous size exclusion chromatography shows that molecular size distribution, reaction extent and reaction rate strongly depends upon the crystalline state of the substrate and the activity of the enzyme. The susceptibility of starch to hydrolysis by (alpha) -amylase is closely related to the crystalline states of the substrate. Starch crystals are present both in the natural granule structure and in retrograded starch; retrogradation lowers reaction extent. Due to thermal deactivation, the highest overall conversion achieved for a given amount of enzyme is obtained at temperatures below the upper limits of the gelatinization range of starch. The initial rate of the reaction is greatest at temperatures above the gelatinization range. The rate and extent of depolymerization is increased by increasing the enzyme concentration within the reactor or by the addition of certain stabilizing agents. ...|$|E
