500|$|Venom atrophication {{has also}} {{occurred}} following {{the evolution of}} constriction {{as a method of}} prey capture that does not require venom. Constriction is hypothesized to have evolved independently in several lineages. North American ‘rat snakes’ [...] such as the <b>Corn</b> <b>snake</b> Pantherophis guttatus use constriction to trap and kill their rodent prey, and do not possess functional venom. A similar process has occurred in the African colubrid lineage Lamprophiidae, such as Pseudaspis cana, {{as well as in the}} genus Acrochordus.|$|E
2500|$|In the Western world, some snakes (especially docile {{species such}} as the ball python and <b>corn</b> <b>snake)</b> are kept as pets. To meet this demand a captive {{breeding}} industry has developed. Snakes bred in captivity tend to make better pets and are considered preferable to wild caught specimens. Snakes can be very low maintenance pets, especially compared to more traditional species. They require minimal space, as most common species do not exceed [...] in length. Pet snakes can be fed relatively infrequently, usually once every 5 to 14 days. Certain snakes have a lifespan of more than 40 years if given proper care.|$|E
50|$|Like all <b>snakes,</b> <b>corn</b> <b>snakes</b> are carnivorous, and in {{the wild}} they eat every few days. While most <b>corn</b> <b>snakes</b> will eat small rodents, such as the White-footed Mouse, they may also eat {{reptiles}} or amphibians, or climb trees to find unguarded bird eggs. Behavioral/chemosensory studies with <b>corn</b> <b>snakes</b> suggest that odor cues are of primary importance for prey detection, whereas visual cues are of secondary importance. Like many species of Colubridae, <b>corn</b> <b>snakes</b> exhibit tail vibrating.|$|R
50|$|<b>Corn</b> <b>snakes</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular types of snakes to keep in captivity or as pets. Their size, calm temperament, and ease of care {{contribute}} to this popularity. Captive <b>corn</b> <b>snakes</b> tolerate being handled by their owners, even for extended periods. A <b>corn</b> <b>snake's</b> space requirements are low since a 25-gallon vivarium provides enough room for a fully grown <b>snake.</b> <b>Corn</b> <b>snakes</b> enjoy hiding and burrowing, usually accommodated with a loose substrate (such as Aspen wood shavings or newspaper) and one or more hide boxes. Captive <b>corn</b> <b>snakes</b> are generally fed pre-killed or stunned feeder mice, because captive-bred rodents reduce the risk of pathogens or live prey-induced injuries.|$|R
5000|$|Normal or {{wildtype}} <b>corn</b> <b>snakes</b> are orange {{with black}} lines around red colored saddle markings going down their back {{with black and}} white checkered bellies.

50|$|The <b>corn</b> <b>snake</b> {{is named}} for the species' regular {{presence}} near grain stores, where it preys on mice and rats that eat harvested corn. The Oxford English Dictionary cites this usage {{as far back as}} 1675. Some sources maintain that the <b>corn</b> <b>snake</b> is so-named because the distinctive, nearly-checkered pattern of the snake's belly scales resembles the kernels of variegated corn. Regardless of the name's origin, the corn reference can be a useful mnemonic for identifying corn snakes.|$|E
40|$|A {{beautiful}} snake with a docile temperament. This attractive snake {{is one of}} North Carolina’s most color ful {{and popular}} rep-tiles. Its common name is likely derived from its resemblance to the color and pattern of Indian corn—not from its habitat or diet. It is also sometimes called “red rat <b>snake.</b> ” <b>Corn</b> <b>snakes</b> are popular in the pet trade. Their beauty, availability, medium size, docile nature and tendency to thrive in captivity make them the ideal pet snake. Like hamsters, gold fish and budgerigar parakeets, there are lines of captive <b>corn</b> <b>snakes</b> that have unique color or even albino markings. Many herpetolo gists {{feel that this is}} unfortu nate, especially since escaped or intentionally liberated indi viduals—a common occurrence—may threaten native populations by introducing harmful genetic material that has been artificially selected by captive breeding. Description A <b>corn</b> <b>snake’s</b> dorsal side is orange, reddish, gray or brownish with prominent large reddish brown blotch es and smaller lateral blotches bordered with black. The belly is boldly marked with a black-and-white checkerboard pat tern. There is usually a blotch resembling a spear point on top of the head. Some large males may have four faint, dark longi tudinal stripes. The glossy, al most iridescent scales usually have weak keels that are faint or absent in juveniles. A <b>corn</b> <b>snake’s</b> relatively slender body is shaped like a loaf of bread in cross-section, the flat belly meet ing the sides of the body at an angle, unlike the more cylindri cal bodies of most snakes. This body shape may be an adapta tion for climbing...|$|R
5000|$|Pantherophis guttatus was {{previously}} {{placed in the}} genus Elaphe, but Elaphe {{was found to be}} paraphyletic by Utiger et al., leading to placement of this species in the genus Pantherophis. The placement of Pantherophis guttatus and several related species in Pantherophis rather than Elaphe has been confirmed by further phylogenetic studies. Many reference materials still use the synonym Elaphe guttata. Molecular data has shown that <b>corn</b> <b>snakes</b> are actually more closely related to king snakes (genus Lampropeltis) than they are to the Old World rat snakes with which they were formerly classified. <b>Corn</b> <b>snakes</b> have even been bred in captivity with California king snakes to produce fertile hybrids known as [...] "Jungle corn snakes".|$|R
