In this study, a mesoporous molecular sieve that incorporates the transition <b>metal</b> <b>cerium</b> (Ce-MCM- 41) was synthesized using the hydrothermal method {{with the goal of}} improving the structural properties for adsorption. The molar composition of the obtained gel was 1 CTMABr: 4 SiO 2 : 1 Na 2 O: 0. 2 Ce 2 O 3 : 200 H 2 O. The pure mesoporous molecular sieve MCM- 41 was also synthesized using the same method. The materials were characterized by the following techniques: XRD, BET/BJH, SEM/EDS, TG and FT-IR. A preliminary test to evaluate the materials as adsorbents to remove naphthenic acids present in jet fuel was performed. The results of the characterization showed that the incorporation of the <b>metal</b> <b>cerium</b> did not affect the MCM- 41 structure and that mesporous materials were formed. Ce-MCM- 41 exhibited good thermal stability, high specific surface area and large pore volume, which are characteristics of a good adsorbent.

30|$|Cerium (Ce) with {{an atomic}} number of 58 {{is one of}} the most {{abundant}} lanthanide <b>metals.</b> <b>Cerium</b> has wide applications for its intriguing mechanical, physical, and chemical properties. It is known that machined surface morphology of metal parts has a strong influence on their functionality, performance, and life cycle. For instance, the corrosion resistance of metal parts can be effectively improved by reducing surface roughness or introducing compressive residual stress in machined surface [1 – 3]. More recently, Yan et al. employed a novel tip-based mechanical machining technique to fabricate periodic triangular micro-cavities on Cu(111), which is demonstrated to be a surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrate [4]. Specifically for cerium that is used to store hydrogen [5], the surface finish of cerium strongly influences the reaction between cerium and hydrogen at room temperature. Therefore, achieving high accuracy of machined surface morphology of cerium is crucial for its applications. Ultra-precision diamond cutting is one important manufacturing technique to obtain ultra-smooth surface finish of high surface integrity, ultra-low surface roughness, high flatness, low metallographic structure evolution, and low subsurface damage [6, 7]. However, either experimental or theoretical work about the diamond cutting of cerium had been rarely reported. Furthermore, since in the ultra-precision diamond cutting process, the tool edge radius is comparable with depth of cut, the properties of workpiece material play an important even dominant role in the cutting process. Therefore, the understanding of machining mechanisms of cerium is challenging for its complex deformation behavior.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the years}} {{electronic}} structure theory {{has proven to}} be a powerful method with which one can probe the behaviour of materials, making it possible to describe and predict material properties. The numerical tools needed for these methods are always in need of development, since the desire to calculate more complex materials pushes this field forward. This thesis contains work on both this implementational and developmental aspects. It begins by reviewing density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory, with the aim of merging these two methods. We point out theoretical and technical issues that may occur while doing this. One issue is the Padé approximant, which is used for analytical continuation. We assess the approximant and point out difficulties that can occur, and propose and evaluate methods for their solution. The virial theorem is assessed within the framework of density functional theory merged with many-body methods. We find that the virial theorem is extended from its usual form, and confirm this by performing practical calculations. The unified theory of crystal structure for transition metals has been established a long time ago using early electronic structure calculations. Here we implement the first- principles exact muffin-tin orbitals method to investigate the structural properties of the 6 d transition metals. The goal of our study is to verify the existing theory for the mostly unknown 6 d series and the performance of the current state-of-the art in the case of heavy d metals. It is found that these elements behave similarly to their lighter counterparts, except for a few deviations. In these cases we argue that it is relativistic effects that cause this anomalous behaviour. Palladium is then studied, taking many-body effects into account. We find that we can reproduce experimental photoemission spectra by these methods, as well as the Fermi surface. The thesis ends with an investigation of the stacking fault energies of the strongly correlated <b>metal</b> <b>cerium.</b> In addition to providing the first ab-initio stacking fault data for the two cubic phases of Ce, we discuss how these results could have an impact on the interpretation of the phase diagram of cerium   QC 20150522 </p...|$|R
40|$|Methanotrophs are {{a unique}} set of {{bacteria}} capable of mitigating methane emissions by converting methane to carbon dioxide which has a lower global warming potential. Studies on methanotrophs mainly focus on understanding the physiological and biochemical properties of methanotrophs to model them for field scale applications. While methanotrophs are known to be sensitive to copper, information about the effect of other abundant metal ions in the environment is scarce. Understanding the behavioral response of methanotrophs to diverse environments is thus vital for exploiting them in bioremediation. Firstly, the effect of metals other than copper on the expression and activity of methane monooxygenase was studied. Gold was shown to affect the “copper-switch” by competing with copper for uptake by a copper chelating molecule, methanobactin, secreted by few methanotrophs. The presence of copper is well known to suppress the activity of soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO), however, gold induced sMMO activity in Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b in the presence of copper. This indicates the need for understanding how the relative abundance of metals in the environment affects methanotrophic activity. Secondly, the effect of the rare earth <b>metal,</b> <b>cerium,</b> on the expression of methanol dehydrogenase was studied. The study indicates that cerium acts as a switch between the two forms of methanol dehydrogenase in M. trichosporium OB 3 b. Such information will likely prove important when designing systems where one form of methanol dehydrogenase is preferred over the other. Thirdly, M. trichosporium OB 3 b when grown with copper and methanobactin from Methylocystis sp. strain SB 2, induces sMMO activity. This shows that “cross-talk” can occur between methanotrophs and thus methanobactin qualifies as a signaling molecule affecting the gene expression in a methanotroph that did not secrete it. Lastly, this study attempted to identify the complete regulatory basis of the “copper-switch” as competing models currently exist. A series of electro-mobility shift assays were performed between DNA upstream of genes and the gene products to determine if any specific gene product activates or suppresses the expression of the gene. The results are not confirmative and thus more work is needed to fully define the mechanism underlying the “copper-switch” in methanotrophs...|$|R
