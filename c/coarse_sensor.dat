Improved track maintenance should be achievable by maintaining <b>coarse</b> <b>sensor</b> resolutions on maneuvering targets and utilizing finer sensor resolutions to resolve closely-spaced targets. There are inherent optimal resolutions for sensors and restricted altitudes that constrain operational performance that a sensor manager must optimize for both wide-area surveillance and precision tracking.

The lack of an historical burnt area dataset to complement recent products, covering the global extent and its full variability,makes it difficult to detect significant trends. Due to the lack of global information before year- 2000, a burned area product based on the NOAA Pathfinder AVHRR land (8 km) dataset was developed covering the period from 1981 to 1999.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the specific capabilities of the defect energy parameter technique for global damage detection developed by Saleeb and coworkers. The feature extraction is the most important capability in any damage-detection technique. Features are any parameters extracted from the processed measurement data in order to enhance damage detection. The damage feature extraction capability was studied extensively by analyzing various simulation results. The practical significance in structural health monitoring is that the detection at early stages of small-size defects is always desirable. The amount of changes in the structure's response due to these small defects was determined to show the needed level of accuracy in the experimental methods. The arrangement of fine/extensive sensor network to measure required data for the detection is an "unlimited" ability, but there is a difficulty to place extensive number of sensors on a structure. Therefore, an investigation was conducted using the measurements of <b>coarse</b> <b>sensor</b> network. The white and the pink noises, which cover most of the frequency ranges that are typically encountered in the many measuring devices used (e. g., accelerometers, strain gauges, etc.) are added to the displacements to investigate the effect of noisy measurements in the detection technique. The noisy displacements and the noisy damage parameter values are used to study the signal feature reconstruction using wavelets. The enhancement of the feature extraction capability was successfully achieved by the wavelet theory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{increasing}} number of mobile devices are capable of automatically sensing and recording rich information about the surrounding environment. Spatial locations of such data can help to better learn about the environment. In this work, we {{address the problem of}} identifying the locations visited by a mobile device as it moves within an indoor environment. We focus on devices equipped with odometry sensors that capture changes in motion. Odometry suffers from cumulative errors of dead reckoning but it captures the relative shape of the traversed path well. Our approach will correct such errors by matching the shape of the trajectory from odometry to traversable paths of a known map. Our algorithm is inspired by prior vehicular GPS map matching techniques that snap global GPS measurements to known roads. We similarly wish to snap the trajectory from odometry to known hallways. Several modifications are required to ensure these techniques are robust when given relative measurements from odometry. If we assume an office-like environment with only straight hallways, then a significant rotation indicates a transition to another hallway. As a result, we partition the trajectory into line segments based on significant turns. Each trajectory segment is snapped to a corresponding hallway that best maintains the shape of the original trajectory. These snapping decisions are made based on the similarity of the two curves as well as the rotation to transition between hallways. We will show robustness under different types of noise in complex environments and the ability to propose <b>coarse</b> <b>sensor</b> noise errors. ...|$|E

Large seasonal fluctuations in the extent are apparent with those of the Southern Hemisphere having larger amplitudes but less symmetrical seasonal distribution than those of the Northern Hemisphere. The large scale interannual variability of the ice cover has been evaluated globally as well as regionally and in the Northern Hemisphere, the yearly anomaly maps show a predominance of positive values in the 1980 s and negative values in the 1990 s. Regression analysis show that the ice extent and ice area are on a decline at the rate of - 2. 0 +/- 0. 5 % and - 3. 1 +/- 0. 3 % per decade, respectively, in the Northern Hemisphere but there are regions like the Bering Sea with positive trends. What is intriguing, however, is that the perennial sea ice cover has been declining at a much faster rate than for the entire hemisphere, i. e., 6. 7 +/- 2. 4 % and 8. 3 +/- 2. 4 % per decade for ice extent and ice area, respectively. The perennial ice cover consists mainly of thick multiyear ice floes, and its persistent decline would mean a reduction in the average thickness of sea ice and a change in the overall characteristics of the Arctic sea ice cover. Furthermore, the yearly anomaly patterns are coherent with those of surface temperatures derived from 19 years of thermal infrared AVHRR data. The latter also shows that in consolidated ice regions, the average temperature during summer minima has been increasing at about 0. 9 +/- 0. 6 K per decade...|$|E

Here we show that the reversal in perceived direction disappears if the stimulus is reduced in size from 2. 8 deg to 0. 35 deg radius. We show that for a stimulus with 1. 4 deg radius, the reversals occur when the ratio between the contrast of the fine features and of the coarser features is higher than 0. 8 and lower than 4. For stimulus with 0. 35 deg radius, the reversals never appear for any contrast ratio. We also show that if the stimulus is presented within an annular window with small radius, errors disappear but they return if the radius is increased to 2 deg.

Some methods, which date from the early 1960 's, compare the angular separation between observed stars with a small catalog. In the last 10 years, several methods have been developed which speed up the process and reduce the amount of memory needed, a key element to onboard attitude determination. However, each of these methods require some a priori knowledge of the spacecraft attitude. Although the Sun and magnetic field generally provide the necessary coarse attitude information, there are occasions when a spacecraft could get lost when it is not prudent to wait for sunlight. Also, the possibility of efficient attitude determination using only the highly accurate CCD star tracker could lead to fully autonomous spacecraft attitude determination. The need for redundant <b>coarse</b> <b>sensors</b> could thus be eliminated at substantial cost reduction.

The near infrared and short-wave infrared bands were found more adequate than visible channels to separate burned areas from other land covers, although the thermal channels of AVHRR also contributed significantly to separability indices.

SDO is equipped with <b>coarse</b> sun <b>sensors,</b> two star trackers, a digital sun sensor, and three two-axis inertial reference units (IRU). The IRUs are temperature sensitive and were designed to operate in a stable thermal environment. Due to battery degradation concerns the IRU heaters were not used on SDO and the onboard filter was tuned to accommodate the noisier IRU data. Since launch currents have increased on two IRUs, one had to eventually be powered off. Recent ground tests on a battery similar to SDO indicated the heaters would have negligible impact on battery degradation, so in 2016 {{a decision was made}} to turn the heaters on. This paper presents the analysis and results of updating the filter tuning parameters onboard SDO with the IRUs now operating in their intended thermal environment...|$|R
