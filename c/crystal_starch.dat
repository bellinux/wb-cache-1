The crushed or powder of stem is prescribed by tribal people and vidyas of Orissa, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and some parts of Karnataka for its healing properties in case of bone fractures, cuts and wounds. Inspite of its reputation in these ailments {{it has not yet}} been investigated scientifically hence it was thought worth to study it in detail. The present paper highlights the pharmacognostical and phytochemical details and their role in laying down standardization and pharmacopoeial parameters. The fluorescence analysis of stem powder, physicochemical parameters like moisture content, total ash, acid insoluble ash, alcohol soluble extractive value and water soluble extractive values are taken.

The wood was studied for pharmaconostic evaluations, including examination of morphological and microscopic characters, determination of ash values and extractive values. The morphological studies revealed that the wood is yellowish in color with smooth texture and characteristic odour. Qualitative studies indicated the presence of uni to biseriate medullary rays, pitted xylem fibers, big vessels in groups, xylem parenchyma, pith, calcium oxalate <b>crystals,</b> <b>starch</b> grains, lignified fibers. The total ash, acid insoluble ash and water-soluble ash values were observed to be 3. 3 %, 1. 9 % and 1. 1 % respectively. The wood was successively extracted with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol in increasing order of polarity. Preliminary phytochemical investigation showed the presence of alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, triterpenoids, carbohydrates and flavonoids. Total phenolic content was determined using a spectrophotometric technique, based on the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent, and calculated as gallic acid equivalents GAE/g. These findings will be useful towards establishing pharmacognostic standards on identification, purity, quality and classification of the plant, which is gaining relevance in plant drug research.

One site is an exploited forest that was disturbed by deforestation {{whereas the other}} site is preserved {{and has not been}} logged since selective logging in the 1960 's. For the evaluation of wood anatomy, plant material was processed following standard techniques for light microscopy and histochemical tests. The results indicated that A. pickelii did not vary qualitatively between the two sites. The histochemical tests indicated the presence of prismatic <b>crystals</b> and <b>starch</b> in radial parenchyma of samples from both sites. Some quantitative parameters differed significantly between the two sites including: vessel frequency; vessel length and lumina area; intervessel pits; diameter, lumina, length and wall thickness of fibres; and radial parenchyma width. In general, these quantitative parameters had higher values in the samples from the exploited site, suggesting an adjustment to the more severe drought conditions there. Quantitative anatomical differences in the samples from the two sites show the influence that environmental conditions can have on wood anatomy.

Montanari - Abstract: Analyses of papyrus plants (Cyperus papyrus L.) from the Botanical Garden of the University of Genova and Ciane River (Siracusa) were used {{as a basis for}} the detection of histological features in papyrus paper. Both modern and ancient papyrus papers were analysed. Modern papyrus were manufactured at “Museo del Papiro di Siracusa”; two types of ancient papyrus (Egyptian and Greek–Roman, from Cairo Archaeological Museum) were studied. Sections of paper and plant stalks, taken 20 cm from the top, were examined under a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscope (OM). The lignificated parts of both the plant and paper were either red (using acid flouroglucine) or blue–green (using Toluidine Blue) and were refracting under polarised light microscopy. Calcium oxalate <b>crystals</b> and <b>starch</b> granules were also detected. It was clear that the ancient Egyptian paper is richer in starch in comparison to the Roman one. It could be presumed that the Egyptian paper contains starch, a material which naturally occurs in the plant as a reserve. It was, in fact, preferably found in the residuals of the vascular bundle sheath. Microscope observations were compared with the results obtained by thermal and calorimetric analyses (TG and DSC). Thermal curves were different depending on which part of the plant was used to manufacture the papyrus and probably depend on the amount of cellulose and lignin present. Moreover, the Egyptian and Greek–Roman were also different in thermal behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryYong-Cheng ShiStarch is {{the most}} {{important}} source of food energy. However, the information about the metabolic quality of starchy foods is scarce. It is well known that native starches with a B-type X-ray diffraction pattern are more resistant to alpha-amylase digestion than those starches with an A-type X-ray pattern, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. It is not clear whether the enzyme resistance of B-type starch is due to its B-type crystalline structure or the other structural features in starch granules. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the structure and enzyme digestibility of highly pure A- and B-type <b>starch</b> <b>crystals,</b> and understand the roles of crystalline types in starch digestibility. Highly pure A- and B-type <b>starch</b> <b>crystals</b> were prepared from short linear α-glucans (short-chain amylose) generated from completely debranched waxy starches by manipulating the processing conditions such as starch solids concentration, crystallization temperature and chain length. High concentration, high temperature and short chain length favored the formation of the A-type structure, whereas reverse conditions resulted in the B-type polymorph. Digestion results using a mixture of α-amylase and glucoamylase showed that A-type crystals were more resistant to enzyme digestion than B-type crystals. The A-type crystalline product obtained upon debranching 25 % waxy maize starch at 50 ºC for 24 h gave 16. 6 % digestion after 3 h, whereas B-type crystals produced by debranching 5 % waxy maize starch at 50 ºC for 24 h followed by holding at 25 ºC for another 24 h had 38. 9 % digested after 3 h. The A-type crystals had a higher melting temperature than the B-type crystals as determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Annealing increased the peak melting temperature of the B-type crystals, making it similar to that of the A-type crystals, but did not improve the enzyme resistance. The possible reason for these results was due to more condense packing pattern of double helices in A-type crystallites. It seems that the crystalline types are not the key factor that controls the digestibility of native starch granules. The resistance of native starches with B-type X-ray diffraction pattern is probably attributed to the other structural features in starch granules...|$|R

50|$|The largest food {{application}} of lactylates {{is in the}} manufacture of baked goods such as yeast-leavened bakery products. In these systems, lactylates are added to strengthen dough and delay bread staling (i.e. soften the crumb). Dough in commercial bakeries requires some resistance to mechanical abuse and shock to maintain desirable volume in the finished baked good. Dough strengtheners interact with the protein components (e.g. gluten) in the dough. The interactions reinforce the protein network, preventing collapse of the loaf during baking. These additives ensure each loaf of bread conforms to the visual and textural quality expectations of the manufacturer and consumer. Crumb softeners are added to bread to reduce or delay staling of the finished baked good. Bread staling occurs when the starch components form hard crystals.

Annealing increases the amylopectin (AP) crystal stability and hence the remaining crystallinity at a given leaching temperature. Negligible AM leaching occurred at temperatures below the annealing dependent onset of melting. Leaching thus benefits from partial melting. Properties of AM leachates remained constant when the extent of starch melting remained below 80 %. Loss of more than 95 % of the melting enthalpy resulted in higher leachate DP at the expense of purity. As the crystallinity of annealed starches at a given leaching temperature was higher than for native starches, the leachate purity was higher. Although in no cases residual AP crystals remained at 90 C, annealed starches yielded more pure AM extracts in higher yields than did native starch. More effective leaching in this case may be due to annealing-induced strengthened AP-AP interactions and AM disentanglement from AP. status: publishe...|$|R

The development of geminating protocorms and young plantlets were recorded and compared among species. Spontaneous vegetative proliferation was also observed. Natural dispersed daylight and prevailing day-length were more favorable than l 6 -hour cool white fluorescent light for plantlet development. After {{two to three years}} of culture, the young plants were suitable for transfer ex vitro. The effects of organic compounds most commonly used for orchid micropropagation (peptone, coconut water, casein+lactalbumin and glucose) and medium consistencies were investigated for the development of temperate orchid protocorms from five species. Medium consistency had an important role in protocorm proliferation and development. In most cases, the liquid medium increased proliferation {{and the size of the}} protocorms. The media supplemented with the undefined organic compounds led to a greater proliferation rate and larger protocorms than the medium supplemented with glucose. In general, peptone and coconut water resulted in best development and proliferation of protocorms, but this varied with species. Anatomical structures and developmental patterns of seventeen temperate orchid species were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). New information was recorded about the early stages of seed germination and protocorm development, the structural details of roots with mycorrhiza, stored materials (calcium oxalate <b>crystals</b> and <b>starch),</b> leaf/stem stomatal structure and anatomical details of the generative organs and ovule/seed development.

40|$|A peak fitting {{procedure}} {{has been}} implemented for calculating crystallinity in granular starches. This methodology, widely used for synthetic polymers, is proposed to better reflect the crystalline content Of starches than the method normally used, {{in which it}} is assumed that relatively perfect crystalline domains are interspersed with amorphous regions. The new approach takes into account irregularities in crystals that are expected to exist in semicrystalline materials. Therefore, instead of assuming that the amorphous background extends up to the base of diffraction peaks, the whole X-ray diffraction (XRD) profile is fitted to an amorphous halo and several discrete crystalline diffraction peaks. The crystallinity values obtained from the XRD patterns {{of a wide range of}} native starches using this fitting technique are very similar to the double helix contents as measured by (13) C solid state NMR, suggesting that double helices in granular starches are present within irregular crystals. This contrasts with previous descriptions of crystalline and noncrystalline double helices that were based on the analysis of XRD profiles as perfect crystals interspersed in a noncrystalline background. Furthermore, with this fitting methodology it is possible to calculate the contribution from the different <b>crystal</b> polymorphs of <b>starch</b> to the total crystallinity.

To test this possibility, potato explants were examined (a leaf, axillary bud, and small stem segment) grown in the ASTROCULTURETM plant growth unit, which provided a controlled environment. During the 16 d flight of space shuttle Columbia (STS- 73), the axillary bud of each explant developed into a mature tuber. Upon return to Earth, tuber slices were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Results showed that the cell ultrastructure of flight-grown tubers could not be distinguished from that of tuber cells grown in the same growth unit on the ground. No differences were observed in cellular features such as protein <b>crystals,</b> plastids with <b>starch</b> grains, mitochondria, rough ER, or plasmodesmata. Cell wall structure, including underlying microtubules, was typical of ground-grown plants. Because cell walls of tubers formed in space were not required to provide support against the force due to gravity, it was hypothesized that these walls might exhibit differences in wall components as compared with walls formed in Earth-grown tubers. Wall components were immunolocalized at the TEM level using monoclonal antibodies JIM 5 and JIM 7, which recognize epitopes of pectins, molecules thought to contribute to wall rigidity and cell adhesion. No difference in presence, abundance or distribution of these pectin epitopes was seen between space- and Earth-grown tubers.

GC-MS and LCMS analyses on ethanol or methanol extracts showed the presence of synthetic cannabinoids, including JWH- 250 in Jungle, JWH- 122 in B- 52, and JWH- 073 and JWH- 018 in Blendz. In Kratom 10 x, only the indole alkaloid mitragynine was detected. All the identified synthetic cannabinoids, apart from mitragynine, are under the restriction of law in Italy (TU 309 / 90). Synthetic cannabinoid crystals were also identified by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which also detected other foreign organic chemicals, probably preservatives or antimycotics. In Kratom only leaf fragments from Mitragyna speciosa, containing the alkaloid mitragynine, were found. In the remaining products, aromatic plant species have mainly the role of hiding synthetic cannabinoids, thus acting as a “green shuttle” rather than as real drugs. Such a multidisciplinary approach is proposed as a method for the identification of herbal blends of uncertain composition, which are widely marketed in “headshops” and on the Internet, and represent a serious hazard to public health...|$|R
40|$|Bread is {{a popular}} staple food but has a limited shelf life. Fresh bread at ambient {{temperature}} contains a semi-crystalline amylose network and a thermoset gluten network. During storage, its crumb firms due {{to a combination of}} different events and to a degree determined by the strength of the different networks in the system. Amylopectin recrystallizes in a process referred to as retrogradation. This results in a continuous, rigid, semi-crystalline network which is strongly related to the increase in crumb firmness during the first days of storage. Besides structural changes in the starch fraction, water is also redistributed. It not only diffuses from crumb to crust, but also between biopolymer types. The combination of all of these phenomena stiffens the gluten network when its moisture content drops below a typical value, leading to a further increase in crumb firmness after a couple of days of storage. However, the impact of amylopectin retrogradation on the extent of water redistribution between gluten and starch is still under debate. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the importance of the starch mesoscale network organization for water distribution and, as a result, for crumb texture properties. To that end, three α-amylases that differently impact the starch (re) crystallization behavior and the resulting network organization were added to the bread recipe. The formation of <b>starch</b> <b>crystals</b> and changes in crumb firmness were monitored. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance was used to analyze proton mobilities of the bread constituents. The exo-working amylases to a variable degree slowed down amylopectin retrogradation, resulting in a less prominent starch network that included less water. Dehydration of the gluten network was therefore presumably less pronounced, contributing to a smaller increase in crumb firmness and a smaller decrease in crumb resilience. Internal starch degradation by an endo-working amylase resulted in sticky bread crumb with very low resilience. status: accepte...|$|R

High temperature extrusion process may change crystallinity of <b>starch</b> (<b>crystal</b> type of A to V and degree of crystallization). Changes in starch crystallinity may influence the physical properties of the rice analogue produced. This research aimed to assess the effect of flour amylose content and temperature of extrusion on the crystallinity and its impact on physical properties of rice analogue. High amylose corn starch and corn flour were mixed at certain ratios to obtain amylose contents of 16. 99, 19. 35, 21. 72, and 24. 09 %. The dough was made by adding water to the mixed flour to have a moisture content of 40 %. The dough was then extruded at temperatures of 70, 80, and 90 °C using a twin screw extruder (BEX-DS- 2256 Berto). The observed physical properties were type of crystal, degree of crystallinity, and hardness of the rice analogue. The results showed that the increase in extrusion temperatures from 70 °C to 90 °C increased the degree of crystallinity of the rice analogues from 7. 98 - 11. 49 % to 12. 15 - 13. 61 % and hardness from 4. 06 - 4. 91 kg to 4. 74 - 8. 20 kg.

40|$|A {{physical}} model of starch structure during hydrolysis is presented. The model states that various crystalline {{states of the}} constituent starch molecules are present {{throughout the course of}} degradation. These crystalline states are associated with the natural state of the strach granule as well as with recrystallized states caused by retrogradation. In order to properly describe enzymatic starch liquefaction, these crystalline states must be accounted for. ^ An appropriate means of determining the macromolecular size and molecular size distribution of starch during hydrolysis, aqueous size exclusion chromatography, is developed. The method employs a strong alkaline mobile phase and porous gel chromatographic supports which are stable to the basic solutions. The separation range of molecular sizes can be extended by coupling size exclusion chromatographic columns in a manner that will maintain linearity in molecular size separation with elution volume. Although separation efficiency is mass transfer limited, efficiency of separation can be increased by controlling eluent flow rate and gel particle packing size and packing size distribution. ^ Although the size exclusion chromatographic system cannot be calibrated directly using well characterized starches due to their non-availability, secondary calibrants can be used for this purpose. Commercially available polyelectrolytes (sodium polystyrene sulfonates) and polysaccharides (dextrans) are appropriate calibrants for aqueous size exclusion chromatography, provided the basic phenomena governing separation are understood. Molecular size in solution, as measured by hydrodynamic volume, controls separation by size exclusion. Excluded volume effects are incorporated into the calculation of the molecular hydrodynamic volume. The electrostatic interactions present in polyelectrolytes are modeled as an excluded volume effect. When the hydrodynamic volume of the two secondary standards is determined using these concepts, a common calibration curve results for moderate to high ionic strength alkaline solutions. Other effects dominate for basic solutions of low ionic strength and for eluents with different co-solutes. ^ Monitoring enzymatic starch depolymerization by aqueous size exclusion chromatography shows that molecular size distribution, reaction extent and reaction rate strongly depends upon the crystalline state of the substrate and the activity of the enzyme. The susceptibility of starch to hydrolysis by (alpha) -amylase is closely related to the crystalline states of the substrate. <b>Starch</b> <b>crystals</b> are present both in the natural granule structure and in retrograded starch; retrogradation lowers reaction extent. Due to thermal deactivation, the highest overall conversion achieved for a given amount of enzyme is obtained at temperatures below the upper limits of the gelatinization range of starch. The initial rate of the reaction is greatest at temperatures above the gelatinization range. The rate and extent of depolymerization is increased by increasing the enzyme concentration within the reactor or by the addition of certain stabilizing agents. ...|$|R
40|$|Starch is an abundantly {{available}} and multifunctional plant polysaccharide. In its native form, it is present under {{the form of}} semi-crystalline, water insoluble granules. The main starch constituent is the highly branched glucose polymer amylopectin (AP). Its outer branches interact to form stiff double helices, which crystallize into a dense A-, more open B- or mixed (A and B) C-type polymorph, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction. The other and essentially unbranched glucose polymer present in starch is amylose (AM). In native starch, AM is mainly amorphous. However, when AM is dispersed in aqueous media {{in the presence of}} a suitable ligand (e. g. linear alcohols or fatty acids), its conformation changes. A left-handed, single helix is formed with a central hydrophobic canal that can accommodate the apolar (part of the) ligand molecule. When AM is in this state, it is referred to as V-type AM. When V-type AM helices stack parallel into crystals, they give rise to a V-type X-ray diffraction pattern. In food applications, industrial starches function mainly as thickening and texture determining ingredients. The use of starch as a functional ingredient to tune the viscosity in food systems relies on its property to imbibe large amounts of water when heated above a characteristic temperature (i. e. the gelatinization temperature), allowing native <b>crystal</b> melting. Gelatinized <b>starch</b> provides viscosity to a vast array of food systems. For use in instant and ready-to-use-applications where heating is not desired, starches of enhanced cold-water swelling capacity are used. These are typically produced by gelatinizing starch and subsequently recovering it by drum drying. However, the resultant pregelatinized starch no longer has granular integrity and does not have the viscosity and texture building capacity which its native counterpart displays following gelatinization in situ. Another way to provide starch with cold-water swelling capacity is by heating native starch to sufficiently high temperatures in the presence of water and ethanol. This treatment results in a changeover from granules with double helical A-, B- or C-type crystals to granules which have single helical V-type crystals. The latter can be dispersed in water at ambient temperature. Such V-type granular cold-water swelling starch (GCWSS) is the subject of the present doctoral dissertation. Over the years, little research has been devoted to V-type GCWSS. The only conversion mechanism described dates from 1986 and contains hypotheses which are not compatible with subsequent research findings. The alleged contribution of AP to V-type crystal formation for instance seemed rather unlikely, since AM-free (waxy) starch disintegrates during high-temperature aqueous alcohol treatment or remains amorphous after alcoholic-alkaline treatment, a methodology that allows conversion of native starch into GCWSS at reduced temperatures. Also, no direct evidence has been delivered for the alleged necessity to remove the alcohol from the single helical cavities to confer upon the resulting starch cold-water swelling capacity. In addition to this, shortcomings associated with more recent studies prevented making clear statements on the influence of using different ethanol to water ratios on the thermal requirements to produce GCWSS. Further, GCWSS from different botanical origins display different degrees of V-type crystallinity, which has been attributed to dissimilarities in molecular structure and supramolecular organization of the corresponding native starch. However, no research reports ever went beyond this qualitative statement. Finally, basic research questions regarding the supramolecular arrangement of the newly created V-type crystals and the relative kinetics of native crystal melting and V-type crystal formation remain unresolved. Against the above background, this work aimed at unraveling the conversion mechanism of native into V-type GCWSS. This was in first instance achieved by studying regular and waxy (AM free) maize starch as model systems. Native maize starch was gradually converted into GCWSS by aqueous ethanol treatments at elevated temperatures. At a treatment temperature of 95 °C, decreasing ethanol concentrations from 68 to 48 % (v/v) led to decreased post-treatment gelatinization enthalpies in excess water, reflecting remaining original A-type crystals. Concomitantly to native A-type crystal melting, V-type crystals appeared. At an ethanol concentration of 48 %, a GCWSS was successfully produced. All crystals in its granules were of the V-type and appeared birefringent when studied in ethanol under polarized light. Removal of all residual solvent by high-temperature drying did not influence swelling power, proving that a high temperature drying step is not necessary to induce cold-water swelling capacity. Based on in situ calorimetric measurements, the thermal requirements to produce GCWSS from different ethanol:water mixtures were elucidated. The V-type crystallinity (18 %) of the regular maize GCWSS did not exceed its AM content (24 %). Moreover, it was impossible to produce a V-type GCWSS from waxy maize starch. Removing all residual solvent by high-temperature drying did not increase the swelling power of the GCWSS. To further elaborate on the structural role of AM, rice, cassava, potato and pea starches were studied. These covered a broad range in AM content and degree of polymerization (DP). They also represented the different native <b>starch</b> <b>crystal</b> types (A-, B- and C-types). These starches were converted gradually to V-type GCWSS by aqueous ethanol treatments at 95 °C in a 68 to 48 % ethanol (v/v) range. Microscopic, X-ray diffraction and calorimetric analyses showed that loss of native molecular order already occurred at the highest ethanol concentrations for starches containing the intrinsically less stable B-type crystals, whereas lower ethanol concentrations were necessary to induce native crystal melting in A-type starches. C-type starch, containing a mixture of A- and B-type crystals, exhibited features characteristic of both A- and B-type <b>starches.</b> No native <b>crystals</b> remained and granular products containing V-type crystals only were formed for all starches when using 48 % (v/v) ethanol. Surprisingly, there was no relation between V-type crystallinity and AM content, although V-type crystallinity again never exceeded the starch AM content. However, the relative kinetics of V-type crystallization, which were studied by DSC, depended on the AM DP. For low DP AM starches (maize and rice <b>starches),</b> V-type <b>crystals</b> formed already during heating to 95 °C and thus while the native crystals were melting. V-type crystallization went up to completion when samples were kept isothermally at 95 °C. For mid (pea starch) and high DP AM (potato and cassava starches) starches, V-type crystallization was initiated during holding at 95 °C and progressed further during subsequent cooling. The resulting V-type crystallinity decreased with increasing AM DP. Maize and potato starches which differed in native crystalline structure as well as in AM content and DP were heated to 160 °C, cooled to ambient temperature and reheated to 160 °C in 48 % (v/v) ethanol with continuous recording of the X-ray scattering at small (SAXS) and wide angles (WAXD). Their gelatinization in pure water was assessed as well. In the latter case, at the low-temperature side of the DSC gelatinization interval, SAXS picked up nano-morphologies of 58 and 34 nm in diameter, for maize and potato starch respectively. These values fell within the range of dimensions reported for starch building blocks (i. e. ‘blocklets’). Upon further heating, the native lamellar order was irreversibly lost. When maize starch was gelatinized in 48 % (v/v) ethanol, it developed layer like next to fractal like demixed features. This occurred prior to the loss of native lamellar order. Slightly beyond the DSC based onset of gelatinization, V-type crystals started to form. At this point, the layer like features started to homogenize. Time-resolved polarized optical microscopy (POM) revealed that the granular integrity in maize starch was lost during the temperature interval wherein WAXD and SAXS revealed V-type crystal melting. During gelatinization of potato starch in 48 % (v/v) ethanol, lamellar order was lost and demixed features were also created, but the latter did not homogenize. Instead, their length scale increased (coarsened) such that it probably exceeded the experimentally accessible SAXS window. This hypothesis was ground in the observation that potato starch did not lose its granular integrity even at very high temperatures (i. e. 160 °C) and that its granules showed an internal phase coarsening that became more pronounced at increasingly high temperatures. During subsequent cooling, (melts of) maize and potato starches crystallized into isolated and (a small quantity of) stacked V-type crystalline layers. The associated SAXS revealed that V-type crystals with similar average layer thicknesses (~ 70 Å) were created in both starches. However, for potato starch, this thickness value most likely resulted from the crystalline thicknesses of roughly two different crystal populations averaging out, whereas in maize starch, a more uniform crystal population was created. SAXS patterns collected during reheating revealed that (a fraction of) V-type <b>crystals</b> in potato <b>starch</b> started to reorganize at fairly low temperatures (~ 60 °C). The nature of this reorganization was not completely clear, but it clearly involved the formation of crystalline layer stacks. In maize starch, stack formation was limited. In both <b>starches,</b> V-type <b>crystals</b> melted and recrystallized into thicker crystals at higher temperatures (at the DSC based high-temperature melting endotherm). In this doctoral dissertation, valuable knowledge was acquired on the micro- and nano-structural transitions that occur when starch is converted into its V-type granular cold-water swelling counterpart. Research questions that remained unresolved so far, like the relative contributions of AM and AP in V-type crystal formation, the supramolecular organization of the resulting V-type helices and the mechanism behind the preservation of granular integrity, were answered. The industrial relevance of this study stems from the increased importance of instant and convenience foods, in which current cold-water swelling starches are commonly used ingredients. Furthermore, GCWSS could have applications as an ingredient in gluten free foodstuffs or as fat replacer. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Amylose (AM) is {{an almost}} linear glucose polymer. Together with {{amylopectin}} (AP), it makes {{up the bulk of}} granular starch. The AM content in regular starches ranges from 20 to 35 %. It greatly influences the functionality of starch in aqueous systems. In fully gelatinized starch dispersions, AM crystallization {{plays a major role in}} gelation. In many food preparation protocols, AM network formation starts immediately after starch gelatinization. Connected cylindrical objects and ultimately fractal structures are formed by aggregation of AM and the outer branches of AP. These structural transitions are exploited to provide texture to different food products. AM crystallization has also been used to produce type III enzyme resistant starch (RS), a type of starch that resists digestion, is fermentable in the colon and has several potential health benefits. AM crystallization depends on factors such as its average degree of polymerization (DP), its concentration in the suspension, the temperature and time. Its concentration determines the type of crystal arrangement which it adopts. While in diluted [typically 10. 0 % (w/v) ] systems. These crystal architectures resist digestion by pancreatic α-amylase. However, they are fermentable by the microbiota in the human colon. Despite the relevance of AM as a standalone polymer, the underlying mechanisms of its aggregation have mainly been investigated in starch systems, which by their own nature also contain AP. Against this background, this doctoral dissertation aimed to provide a better understanding of the production or isolation of AM and its physico-chemical properties in order to provide a basis for exploiting AM crystallinity in the development of potential applications in and beyond the food industry. A method for producing pure AM on laboratory scale was needed for studying the mechanisms of AM aggregation. Thus, the first part of this dissertation focused on producing or isolating AM. Three main in vitro approaches were considered for obtaining AM: enzymatic synthesis, AM leaching, and AM complexation following starch dispersion. However, the production or isolation of AM is not a simple task. The properties (i. e., purity, average DP and polydispersity) of isolated AM are influenced by the experimental conditions in each methodology. Aqueous leaching allows isolating AM on large scale and involves heating a starch suspension above the starch gelatinization temperature. Different factors influence leaching of AM, including the leaching temperature (LT) and starch concentration. A response surface analysis with a face centered central composite design was implemented to study the effect of maize (Zea mays L.) starch concentration [3. 0 – 7. 0 % (w/v) ] and LT (70 – 90 ˚C) on aqueous leaching of AM as a way to optimize the conditions for obtaining the highest yield of long chain AM [number average DP (DPn) ranging from 860 to 930] and highest purity. Second order empirical models were fitted via the least squares approach. Negligible terms were removed using backwards model reduction. Negligible lack of fit terms were obtained for the responses total leached carbohydrate and DPn. The optimization was complemented with a desirability test using the purity of the extracts. As optimization targets, maximum leachate yields, DPn ≈ 900, and purity > 95 % were set. Contour plots and prediction profilers were obtained and can be used by others for tailor made production of leachates. LT had the most significant effect as yields and DPn increased with temperature at the expense of purity. Purity was highly compromised when treatments were at temperatures exceeding 85 ˚C. This was reflected in the high DPn values (> 1, 500) which suggested the presence of AP material. When using 3. 0 % (w/v) maize starch suspension at an LT of 81 °C, the largest yield (15. 0 %, starch basis) of high DPn AM chains (DPn ≈ 900) and less than 3. 3 % of non-AM material were obtained. The effect of starch crystallinity on the aqueous leaching of AM was also studied. <b>Starch</b> <b>crystal</b> stability was altered via annealing. Leaching was studied in a 60 - 90 °C temperature range. The leachate yield, average DP and purity were related to the extent of melting of the <b>starch</b> <b>crystals</b> at the LT as determined via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Annealing increased the AP crystal stability and hence the remaining crystallinity at a given LT. Negligible AM leaching occurred at temperatures below those of the annealing dependent onset of melting. Leaching thus benefited from partial melting. Similar AM leachates were obtained when the extent of starch melting was below 80 %. Loss of more than 95 % of the melting enthalpy resulted in higher leachate average DP at the expense of purity. As the crystallinity of annealed starches at a given LT was higher than that of the native starches, the purity of leachates obtained from such starches was higher. Although no residual AP crystals remained at 90 °C, annealed starches subjected to leaching at such temperature still yielded AM extracts in higher yields and of higher purity than did native starch. More effective leaching in this case may be due to annealing-induced strengthened AP-AP interactions and AM disentanglement from AP. The second part of this work focused on the semicrystalline aggregation of AM. While previous studies had elucidated the role of AM average DP on its aggregation in diluted aqueous systems, no reports have elaborated on the crystallization of AM in concentrated systems. Here, AM samples with different weight average DP (DPw) were produced and subjected to a heating-cooling-heating process. Since AM crystals only melt at temperatures exceeding 100 °C, high-pressure devices were used to analyze the hydrated samples. High (DPw = 830), mid (DPw = 340), and low (DPw = 60) DP AM aqueous dispersions [25. 0 % (w/v) ] were first heated to 180 ˚C to produce fully dissolved aqueous solutions of AM. During subsequent cooling to ambient temperature and re-heating to 180 ˚C, their thermal and structural transitions were studied by DSC and X-ray diffraction at small (SAXS) and wide (WAXD) angles. During cooling, spherulitic crystal aggregates were formed the sizes of which decreased in the order mid DP > low DP > high DP AM. The crystallization events also depended on AM DP. Mid DP AM crystals were formed at high temperatures and its exothermic transition peaked at 74 ˚C. Those from low and high DP AM were formed below 60 °C with peaks at 37 and 42 °C respectively. A second (small) fraction was visible for low DP AM and it appeared close to the observed high temperature transition for mid DP. During the subsequent heating, mid DP AM crystals were the most stable and their melting signal peaked at 156 °C. Low DP AM crystals melted in two broad temperature ranges with peaks at 104 °C (large fraction) and 150 °C (small fraction). Those from high DP AM melted in a similar range as the low temperature signal for low DP AM. Time-resolved SAXS and WAXD measurements were implemented for the first time to reveal the nanostructural transitions of AM during the formation and disappearing of semicrystalline spherulites from low and mid DP AM. WAXD measurements revealed B-type AM crystals besides amorphous material, regardless of the temperature. Changes in the crystallinity index occurred in the temperature ranges where DSC revealed exo or endothermic transitions. Inter-crystallite interference was found in SAXS for low DP AM while this was not the case for mid DP AM. Mid DP AM spherulites were classified as open (no interference) while those of low DP AM as compact (with interference). Open spherulites had a lower internal crystallinity (below 20 %) than the compact ones (up to 80 %) but were able to fill the space completely at the end of cooling. Open spherulites from mid DP AM started from the crystallization of AM within a homogeneous liquid phase. This forms AM depletion zones around the crystals at a high crystallization rate. At lower temperatures spherulites grow and new ones are created at a lower rate. Here the liquid phase can follow the pace and can homogenize concomitantly. In the case of low DP AM spherulites, open spherulites similar to those from mid DP AM are first formed at high temperatures. During further cooling, the system separates into AM-rich and –poor liquid phases. Spherulites migrate to the AM-rich zone and further AM crystallization occurs rapidly turning the aggregates into compact spherulites. For high DP AM it was proposed that chain entanglement might inhibit the formation of large and ordered aggregates at high temperatures. Instead, liquid-liquid phase separation is favored and the crystallization of AM into small, disordered spherulites takes place in the AM-rich zone. In a third and final part, the crystallinity of AM was exploited in the development of a potential pharmaceutical application. Type III RS from debranched cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) starch was produced by favoring AM crystallization in a hydrothermal treatment. A thermostable crystal fraction was formed. Indeed, type III RS crystal melting was only observed at temperatures exceeding 120 °C. RS levels measured via in vitro digestion increased from 36. 6 (in the starting material) to 95. 1 % (in the final type III RS product). RS levels were positively correlated to the degree of crystallinity. Type III RS was highly fermentable in vitro by human fecal microflora and resulted in a significant production of short chains fatty acids. Acetate levels were much more increased than those of propionate and butyrate when compared to their levels noted for a fecal blank. A granulate of type III RS [60 - 70 % (w/w) ] and ethyl cellulose [40 - 30 % (w/w) ] was used to coat tablets of 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) using a compression-coating approach.
