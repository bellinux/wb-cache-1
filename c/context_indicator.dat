40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel clock {{calibration}} approach called FLIGHT, which leverages {{the fact that}} the fluorescent light intensity changes with a stable period that equals half of the alternating current’s. By tuning to the light emitted from indoor fluorescent lamps, FLIGHT can intelligently extract the light period information and achieve network wide time calibration by referring to such a common time reference. The light period can be also viewed as an indoor <b>context</b> <b>indicator.</b> As sampling the light sensor consumes substantially less energy, FLIGHT provides us a lightweight clock calibration and time synchronization solution. In addition, FLIGHT suits various mobility-enabled scenarios and it can work well even when the network is temporarily disconnected. We address a series of practical challenges and implement FLIGHT in TelosB motes. We conduct comprehensive experiments using a 12 -node test-bed in both static and mobile environments. Over one-week measurement suggests that compared with existing technologies, FLIGHT can achieve tightly synchronized time with low energy consumption. We further leverage the periodical pattern and upgrade FLIGHT to recognize the ambient indoor/outdoor context, based on which the on/off states of a variety of location-based services can be controlled automatically for mobile devices. Index Terms—Clock calibration, time synchronization, energy efficiency, fluorescent lighting, context recognition. ...|$|E
40|$|Given {{that human}} {{development}} is a complex process involving multiple components and determining factors, multidimensional indicators are needed. On {{the basis of the}} extensive literature on the subject, we advance two new indicators: the Matrix of Capabilities and Functioning (MCF), and the Algorithm of Human Development (HDA). The MCF is composed of vectors of capabilities and functionings, based on Sen’s idea of Refined Functionings. It is based in a matricial framework. both static and dynamic The main purpose of constructing this index is to study how different sets of capabilities relate to alternative functionings, to produce diverse outcomes. The Human Development Algorithm (HAD) is a multidimensional index concerning the set of goods and services needed to complete a life cycle. The HDA is a socio-economic <b>context</b> <b>indicator.</b> It is composed of the main â€œsatisfactorsâ€ or basic goods and services needed: food, health, education, housing, social security, decent employment and retirement programs, that might be available to all throughout of life cycle.

40|$|A {{literature}} {{survey was conducted}} to assess animal responses to logging and evaluate the usefulness of bioindicators as tools to assess biodiversity conservation in logged tropical forests. The survey indicated that studies {{on the impact of}} logging on arthropods and herpetofauna are under-represented. Mammals are the main subject of studies addressing the effect of logging on fauna. Overall, logging does have an effect on some animals but the responses varied between and within animal groups. Additionally, most of the studies conducted so far vary greatly in the forest structures, taxa, methodologies, and logging intensities and histories of the study site, resulting in a lack of comparability among papers. Few studies have investigated linkages between changes in the composition of animal groups and the functional significance of these changes, nor have they correlated responses with environmental changes after logging, complicating determination of cause-effect relationships. Further difficulties were taxonomical complexity, the small number of trained people, the costs of monitoring population trends, the lack of information on the relations between changes in different groups, and the lack of congruence between traditional scales of research (plots) and appropriate scales of land management. The sum of these difficulties suggests that until now animal indicators for monitoring biodiversity conservation in logging operations may be ineffective to implement in forest managements. In this <b>context,</b> <b>indicator</b> development continues to be a critical research need in forest ecology. However, it is good {{to keep in mind that}} in management systems, where changes are usually inevitable and most of time desirable, proposed indicators would actually be doing their role of early warning when facilitating the assessment of the acceptable degree of habitat modification.

40|$|The {{international}} {{debate on}} sustainable development policies focuses its intervention programmes on the urban context and, {{according to the}} principles of participation and subsidiarity, emphasizes the needs to define suitable indicators in order to represent complex problems in a simple way. However, in literature, common positions that acknowledge effective indicators are not yet available: if the utility in adopting reference descriptions and common indicators selection criteria is well established, the claim to define effective lists of indicators for all urban contexts is effective nowadays. In the experience lead by the Municipality of Padua, the standard ISO 14031, that describes the requirements relevant to the environmental performance assessment, was used as reference. In particular, in Padua, within the Local Agenda 21 urban process, the definition of <b>context</b> and performance <b>indicators</b> has followed up in different ways as long as it has pursued different goals: the <b>context</b> <b>indicators,</b> defined by a top-down process, describe the contingent circumstances in which the Forum operates, whereas performance indicators, defined by a participative process, measure the progress of the Local Action Plan, defined by the Forum, and its effectiveness in the future.

By answering this question, insight in the empirical applicability of innovation theories in the healthcare sector could be obtained, but also the potential tools to make the healthcare sector more efficient and hence lower the social costs. Seven successful and six unsuccessful cases were selected in two different technology areas: medical technology and ICT. Due to the complexity of the Dutch healthcare system, besides Rogers’ adoption indicators for the diffusion of innovation, these cases were analysed by using <b>context</b> <b>indicators</b> as well. Comparison of adoption factors showed that the ‘evidence required by users’ and ‘positive experts’ opinions’ are of importance for successful diffusion. In the ICT technology field, also the ‘absorptive capacity of users’ can form an obstacle for the diffusion of an innovation. Nonetheless, most of the cases showed good performance on all other adoption indicators, proving the significance of the context in the innovation process. From the context analysis, the relevant actors and twenty specific factors that are of importance for adoption of innovations were identified. The key actors are the medical professionals and, to somewhat lesser extent, the patients both as users of the innovations, and second, the CVZ and healthcare insurers respectively approving and providing financial compensation for innovations. By considering the twenty factors against all the cases, the ‘knowledge of regulations’ and the ‘adherence to the rules of conduct’ seem to be of importance for the successful adoption of a disruptive innovation as well. Additionally, in the ICT technology field, an insufficient amount of (financial) resources, dependence on policy changes, technology push development, and dependence on subsidies or other financial support are all potentially thwarting for the diffusion of a disruptive innovation. All in all, the diffusion process of disruptive innovations can be improved when for one, producers of disruptive innovations meet the relevant adoption and <b>context</b> <b>indicators,</b> but besides that, an increased focus on the efficiency of an innovation instead of on quality or efficacy would lead to more approvals for disruptive innovations and less ‘decision power’ with the same group of people (medical professionals) would result in more differentiation of innovations...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{management}} {{of research is}} increasingly based on quantitative bibliometric indices. Nowadays, the h-index is a major measure of research output that has supplanted all other citation-based indices. In this <b>context,</b> <b>indicators</b> that complement the h-index by evaluating different facets of research achievement are compelling. As an additional bibliometric source {{that can be easily}} extracted from available databases, we propose to use the number of distinct journals Nj in which an individual's papers were published. We show that Nj is independent of citation counts, and argue that it is a relevant indicator of research scope, since it quantifies readership extent and scientific multidisciplinarity. Combining the h-index and Nj, we define a two-dimensional index (H,M) that measures both the output (through H) and the outreach (through M) of individual's research. In order to probe the relevance of this two dimensional index, we have analysed the scientific production of a panel of physicists belonging to the same Department but with different research themes. The analysis of bibliometric data confirms that the two indices are uncorrelated and shows that while H reliably ranks the impact of researchers, M accurately sorts multidisciplinary or readership aspects. We conclude that the two indices together offer a more complete picture of research performance and can be applied to either individuals, research groups or institutions.
