40|$|Abstract. Cancer hazards from {{pesticide}} residues in food {{have been much}} discussed in the past decade. In this study, we showed that dichlorvos and dimethoate affect hemoglobin content and hematocrit value, but {{had no effect on}} red blood cell counts and total plasma protein in mice. A 40 -mg/kg/day dose of dichlorvos upregulated the expression of p 16, Bcl- 2 and <b>c-myc</b> <b>genes</b> in mouse gastric tissue. By contrast, expression of the p 16, Bcl- 2 and <b>c-myc</b> <b>genes</b> induced by low doses (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day) of dichlorvos demonstrated no change in the control check group (CK; 200 µl sterile saline perfused group; 0 mg/kg/day). Different doses of dimethoate all upregulated the expression of p 16, Bcl- 2 and <b>c-myc</b> <b>genes</b> in mouse gastric tissue. The results further demonstrated that mouse gastric tissue, exposed in the long-term to low doses of dichlorvos and dimethoate, has the potential to become cancerous...|$|R
40|$|In {{chromosome}} translocations {{characteristic of}} Burkitt lymphomas (BL) and murine plasmacytomas, <b>c-myc</b> <b>genes</b> become juxtaposed to immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) sequences, resulting in aberrant c-myc transcription. Translocated c-myc alleles that retain the first exon exhibit increased transcription from the normally minor c-myc promoter, P 1, and increased transcriptional elongation through inherent pause sites proximal {{to the major}} c-myc promoter, P 2, We recently demonstrated that a cassette derived from four DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS 1234) in the 3 'C alpha region of the IgH locus functions as an enhancer-locus control region (LCR) and directs a similar pattern of deregulated expression of linked <b>c-myc</b> <b>genes</b> in BL and plasmacytoma cell lines. Here, we report that the HS 1234 enhancer-LCR mediates a widespread increase in histone acetylation along linked <b>c-myc</b> <b>genes</b> in Raji BL cells. Significantly, the increase in acetylation was not restricted to nucleosomes within the promoter region but also was apparent upstream and downstream of the transcription start sites as well as along vector sequences. Histone hyperacetylation of control <b>c-myc</b> <b>genes,</b> which was induced by the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, mimics {{the effect of the}} HS 1234 enhancer on expression from the c-myc P 2 promoter, but not that from the P 1 promoter. These results suggest that the HS 1234 enhancer stimulates transcription of c-myc by a combination of mechanisms. Whereas HS 1234 activates expression from the P 2 promoter through a mechanism that includes increased histone acetylation, a general increase in histone acetylation is not sufficient to explain the HS 1234 -mediated activation of transcription from P 1...|$|R

50|$|Triple-stranded DNA is {{implicated in}} the {{regulation}} of several genes. Once, the <b>c-myc</b> <b>gene</b> was extensively mutated to examine the role that triplex DNA structure, versus linear sequence, plays in gene regulation. A c-myc promoter element, termed the nuclease-sensitive element or NSE, can form tandem intramolecular triplexes of the H-DNA type and has a repeating sequence motif (ACCCTCCCC)4. The NSE when mutated was examined for transcriptional activity and for intra- and intermolecular triplex forming ability. The transcriptional activity of mutant NSEs can be predicted by the element's ability to form H-DNA and not by repeat number, position, {{or the number of}} mutant base pairs. DNA may therefore be a dynamic participant in the transcription of the <b>c-myc</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E

50|$|Virus insertional {{mutagenesis}} is possible with both replication competent virus and the self-inactivating vectors that {{are commonly used}} in gene therapy. The virus inserts a gene (known as a viral onocogene) normally near the cellular myc (c-myc)gene. The <b>c-myc</b> <b>gene</b> is normally turned off in the cell; however when it is turned on {{it is able to}} push the cell into the G1 phase of the cell cycle and cause the cell to begin replication, causing unchecked cell proliferation while allowing the viral gene to be replicated.

Avian leukosis virus {{is an example of a}} virus that causes a disease by {{insertional mutagenesis}}. Newly hatched chicks infected with Avian leukosis virus will begin to form tumours that will begin to appear in their bursa of fabricus (like the human thymus).

This study showed that knockdown of HDAC7 resulted in significant cell arrest between the G(1) and S phases of the cell cycle. Subsequently, HDAC7 knockdown suppressed c-Myc expression which in turn blocked cell cycle progression. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, it was shown that HDAC7 directly binds with the <b>c-Myc</b> <b>gene</b> and therefore HDAC7 silencing decreased c-Myc mRNA levels.|$|E
50|$|Expression of the <b>c-myc</b> <b>gene,</b> which {{produces}} an oncogenic transcription factor, is tightly regulated in normal cells but is frequently deregulated in human cancers. The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional repressor thought to negatively regulate MYC function, {{and is therefore}} a potential tumor suppressor. This protein inhibits the transcriptional activity of MYC by competing for MAX, another basic helix-loop-helix protein that binds to MYC and is required for its function. Defects in this gene are frequently found in patients with prostate tumors. Three alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described. Additional alternatively spliced transcripts may exist but the products of these transcripts have not been verified experimentally.|$|E

40|$|The {{proto-oncogene}} c-myc encodes a basic helix–loop–helix {{leucine zipper}} transcription factor (c-Myc) {{that has a}} profound role in growth control and cell cycle progression. Previous microarray studies identified various classes of <b>c-Myc</b> target <b>genes,</b> including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. By screening the human B-cell line P 493 - 6 and rat fibroblasts conditionally expressing c-Myc, we could substantially extend the list of <b>c-Myc</b> target <b>genes,</b> particularly those required for ribosome biogenesis. The identification of 38 new <b>c-Myc</b> target <b>genes</b> with nucleolar function, prompted us to investigate processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA).

50|$|Pur-alpha was {{the first}} sequence-specific {{single-stranded}} DNA-binding protein to be discovered in higher organisms (GenBank M96684.1; GI:190749). It binds to both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, making contact with G residues in the purine-rich strand of its binding site. Cumulative data shows that Pur-alpha preferentially binds to the sequence (G2-4N1-3)n, where N is not G. N denotes a nucleotide, and n denotes the number of repeats of this small sequence.

50|$|Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are {{frequently}} {{integrated into the}} cellular DNA in cervical cancers.

An 8q24 copy number increase was detected by CGH. Dual-color FISH with a c-MYC probe mapping to 8q24 revealed colocalization with HPV18 at all integration sites, indicating that dispersion and amplification of the <b>c-MYC</b> <b>gene</b> sequences occurred after and was most likely triggered by the viral insertion at a single integration site. Numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations identified by SKY, genomic imbalances detected by CGH, as well as FISH localization of HPV18 integration at the c-MYC locus in HeLa cells are common and representative for advanced stage cervical cell carcinomas. The HeLa genome has been remarkably stable after years of continuous cultivation; therefore, the genetic alterations detected may have been present in the primary tumor and reflect events {{that are relevant to}} the development of cervical cancer.|$|E

CRD-BP has been shown to play a crucial role in cancer growth and invasion of tissues. CD44 proteins belong to a family of cell surface adhesion molecules that are involved in both cell-cell and cell-matrix communications. CRD-BP binds to and protects CD44 RNA which shows increased expression in cancers. CRD-BP plays a role in the localization of β-actin mRNA by binding to the localization element in the 3'UTR region. [...] Aberrant expression of the oncogenic <b>c-myc</b> <b>gene</b> has been shown in the formation of tumours.

CRD-BP also binds IGF2 and H19 mRNA. The H19 gene is located downstream of the IGF2 on chromosome 11 and chromosome 7 on humans and mice, respectively. The binding of CRD-BP to these transcripts has shown to alter the expression of the genes. The microtubule-associated protein (MAP) is coded for by tau mRNA and is mainly found in the axon of neurons. The 3’UTR of tau mRNA contains a cis-regulatory element that controls the axonal localization of tau mRNA.

We have examined the consequences of translocation on putative control sequences near to the <b>c-myc</b> <b>gene</b> by DNase I hypersensitivity mapping of chromatin. There is no detectable difference {{in the pattern of}} hypersensitivity (compared with the actively transcribed <b>c-myc</b> <b>gene</b> of lymphoblastoid cells) in Burkitt lymphoma cells where the translocation point occurs at a considerable distance upstream or downstream of c-myc. When the translocation occurs near the 5 ' end of the <b>c-myc</b> <b>gene,</b> resulting in loss of hypersensitive sites, those that remain show the same sensitivity as in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We conclude that translocation has little general effect on the usual pattern of hypersensitive sites near to the <b>c-myc</b> <b>gene</b> but new sites can be observed in some cases in the immunoglobulin region near to the breakpoint.

40|$|SummaryElevated {{expression}} of the c-Myc transcription factor occurs frequently in human cancers and is associated with tumor aggression and poor clinical outcome. The effect of high levels of <b>c-Myc</b> on global <b>gene</b> regulation is poorly understood but is widely thought to involve newly activated or repressed “Myc target genes. ” We report here that in tumor cells expressing high levels of c-Myc the transcription factor accumulates in the promoter regions of active genes and causes transcriptional amplification, producing increased levels of transcripts within the cell’s gene expression program. Thus, rather than binding and regulating {{a new set of}} <b>genes,</b> <b>c-Myc</b> amplifies the output of the existing gene expression program.
