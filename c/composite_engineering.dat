50|$|Fiber {{volume ratio}} is an {{important}} mathematical element in <b>composite</b> <b>engineering.</b> Fiber volume ratio, or fiber volume fraction, is the percentage of fiber volume in the entire volume of a fiber-reinforced composite material. When manufacturing polymer composites, fibers are impregnated with resin. The amount of resin to fiber ratio is calculated by the geometric organization of the fibers, which affects the amount of resin that can enter the composite. The impregnation around the fibers is highly dependent on {{the orientation of the}} fibers and the architecture of the fibers. The geometric analysis of the composite {{can be seen in the}} cross-section of the composite. Voids are often formed in a composite structure throughout the manufacturing process and must be calculated into the total fiber volume fraction of the composite. The fraction of fiber reinforcement is very important in determining the overall mechanical properties of a composite. A higher fiber volume fraction typically results in better mechanical properties of the composite.|$|E

40|$|The {{major issue}} {{regarding}} magnetic response in nature—“negative {{values for the}} permeability μ of material parameters, especially in terahertz or optical region” makes the electromagnetic properties of natural materials asymmetric.

Their unique combination of strength, hardness and toughness satisfies the most demanding applications. These materials have a unique combination of high hardness and good toughness within a wide range and thus constitute the most versatile hard materials group for engineering and tooling applications. After the fracture tests on notched cemented carbide specimens have been conducted and the relevant properties at initiation determined according to linear elastic fracture mechanics, an appropriate numerical model needs to be developed for the calibration of cohesive laws in order to reproduce the obtained experimental results. Finite volume modelling of three-point bend tests was performed and numerical results obtained. The impact speed and measured material properties were provided as input parameters, and the cohesive strength for each grade of material was determined across the range of loading rates used in the experiments at room temperature.

40|$|Apparent {{negative}} {{electrical resistance}} was observed, quantified, and controlled through <b>composite</b> <b>engineering.</b> Its mechanism involves electrons {{traveling in the}} unexpected direction relative to the applied voltage gradient, due to backflow across a composite interface. The observation {{was made in the}} through-thickness direction of a continuous carbon fiber epoxy–matrix two-lamina composite, such that the fibers in the adjacent laminae were not in the same direction and that the curing pressure during composite fabrication was unusually high (1. 4 MPa). At a usual curing pressure (0. 13 MPa), the resistance was positive. At an intermediate curing pressure (0. 33 MPa), the apparent resistance was either positive or negative, depending on the current direction, due to non-uniformity in the thickness within a junction. The magnitude of the apparent negative resistance decreased with increasing temperature. Appropriate apparent negative and positive resistances in series, as provided by more than two laminae, allowed tailoring of the total apparent resistance. Apparent negative resistance was also observed in carbon fiber cement-matrix composites and in bare carbon fibers held together by pressure. Relevant applications are electrical...|$|E

40|$|Paper is an {{extraordinary}} example of a <b>composite</b> <b>engineering</b> material with practical use in a huge variety of applications. Since its invention in China {{there have been many}} alterations to manufacturing techniques, component formulation and surface finishing, but the essential characteristics of the product have not changed greatly. The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate that the chromatographic performance of paper as a stationary phase may be used to distinguish between externally-similar materials. The procedure developed is so simple that even students with little exposure to practical chemistry and limited chemical knowledge can understand the essential content. Because of the ubiquitous nature of paper, it is often recovered from crime scenes as evidence for analysis. However, the variety of sources and the mechanical or chemical properties often make demonstration of unequivocal correlation between “questioned” and “known” or “reference” samples a complex task.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to show {{possibilities}} of numerical simulation software, based on heat transfer model, commonly used in foundry industry in cast composite properties engineering. Design/methodology/approach: The main restriction in most of used software systems is lack of heat transfer, which may occur at composite creation. In this work the reinforcing particle morphology an size were expressed by one quantity – morphological modulus Mm and were examined for influence on heat transfer and conductivity up to the Newton’s and Fourier’s laws. Findings: The main restrictions for using Fourier’s model based software for <b>composite</b> <b>engineering</b> are shown. The way for crystallization control was presented including influence of morphology, transition zone and thermo-physical properties of components. Research limitations/implications: Proposed methodology {{can be used for}} cast composite properties engineering in cases, where relative motion of components is negligible. In other cases heat transfer coefficient is justified only if the software used is based on Fourier’s model and the source code is accessible.

40|$|Cemented {{carbides}} {{are hard}} {{materials used in}} tough materials machining {{as well as in}} situations where other tools would wear away. These {{are one of the most}} successful <b>composite</b> <b>engineering</b> materials ever produced. The advantage of cemented carbides is that their structure and composition can be engineered to have properties tailored to specific applications and operations. These materials allow faster and more precise machining and will leave a better surface finish. Carbide tools can also withstand higher temperatures than standard high speed steel tools. Considering their application and known range of properties, main disadvantage of cemented carbides is appearance of their sudden fracture during machining process. This is caused by the low toughness at dynamic rates and overcoming this problem is yet to be researched further. In order to understand these limitations and provide suggestions for the improved design of the material, combined experimental and numerical analysis is currently being performed. Cohesive strength values numerically determined using Dugdale cohesive zone model are compared to flexural strength obtained experimentally. Reduction in flexural strength was then analysed and explained, relating it to the flaw size on the tensile surface of the specimen...|$|E
