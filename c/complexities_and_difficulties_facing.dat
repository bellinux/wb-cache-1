40|$|Regardless of {{the large}} number of Object-Oriented (OO) {{modeling}} languages currently being used in the Information Systems (IS) modeling process, unavailability of an OO modeling language {{that can be used in}} both the analysis and design phases disintegrates the two phases. The problem is, such disintegration can lead to a high level of missing information in the real world system from the analysis phase to the design phase. The approach of this study is to propose a framework to produce design phase models from analysis phase models using ontology based Unified Modeling Language (UML), thereby integrating the two phases. The results obtained from the porposed framework involve: a consructed language which can be used in generating the analysis phase scripts; and the development of script files based on the UML constructs at the analysis and design phases to automatically generate the UML scripts for those two phases. Since this study is a part of an ongoing research study, it can be concluded that, at the end of this study (1) both analysis and design phases would be able to integrate using a common OO modeling language (2) the manual work involved in the current analysis and design modeling would be reduced (3) the <b>complexities</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>faced</b> by the modelers (By modelers we mean the analysts and designers who are doing the analysis and design phase modeling) in using UML modeling tools would be reduced...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of open formulary non-medical prescribing has created opportunities to radically change health care delivery. This thesis {{is the first}} of its kind to document the process of undertaking an examination of NMP in a chemotherapy setting. A purposeful sample of 23 stakeholders connected with the chemotherapy service in a local cancer setting was used including 12 doctors, 5 nurses, 4 pharmacists and 4 managers. A serial data collection technique with individual interviews followed by uni professional focus groups was adopted. Finally a multi professional focus group was held to determine the strategic way forward. A systematic qualitative data management package -NUDIST was used to code and theme data and this data was used as the basis for discussion. This thesis offers an insight into the working of the multidisciplinary team in relation to NMP. It establishes the concerns and issues of the professional stakeholders as well as areas of concurrence. It charts the <b>complexities</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>faced</b> when shifting responsibilities of professionals. It has used a novel approach to engage with stakeholders from within the day to day practices of the clinic and developed a framework for monitoring agreed progress. An action oriented approach was inherent to the study and dovetailed to understand the service and concurrently create an opportunity for development. Through its insider perspective it has highlighted the complexes of changing practice and attempted to move forward using a negotiation process. The study illuminated the key features necessary to maximise success of NMP in chemotherapy clinics and captures the importance of good working relationships. Whilst different models of nurse-led practice will emerge, fundamental and core to services is the need for good team working, established and effective communication strategies and perhaps most importantly avoiding isolation in practice. This study additionally reinforced that any evaluation takes place within pre- existing political contexts and in particular medical dominance. Not all medical colleagues agreed with or wanted NMP for their patients highlighting difficulties of developing new models of working within a resisting culture. Medical dominance should be acknowledged and strategies developed to work within this dominance to ensure the unique contribution of nursing is valued and seen. Insights from this study raise the need for further research and exploration of the usefulness and acceptability of NMP in chemotherapy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The committee came to conclusion that [...] "The Metropolitan Police have a wide remit which has many <b>complexities</b> <b>and</b> the current <b>difficulties</b> <b>faced</b> by the organisation lead us to believe that the responsibility for counter-terrorism ought to be moved to the NCA in order to allow the Met to focus on the basics of policing London. The work to transfer the command ought to begin immediately with a view to a full transfer of responsibility for counter-terrorism operations taking place, for example within five years after the NCA became operational, in 2018. When this takes place, it should finally complete the jigsaw of the new landscape of policing." ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent {{critiques of}} {{incident}} reporting suggest that {{its role in}} managing safety has been over emphasized. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the perceived effectiveness of incident reporting in improving safety in mental health and acute hospital settings by asking staff about their perceptions and experiences. DESIGN: /st>Qualitative research design using documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews. SETTING: /st>Two large teaching hospitals in London; one providing acute and the other mental healthcare. PARTICIPANTS: /st>Sixty-two healthcare practitioners with experience of reporting and analysing incidents. RESULTS: /st>Incident reporting was perceived as having a positive effect on safety, not only by leading to changes in care processes but also by changing staff attitudes and knowledge. Staff discussed examples of both instrumental and conceptual uses of the knowledge generated by incident reports. There are difficulties in using incident reports to improve safety in healthcare at all stages of the incident reporting process. Differences in the risks encountered and the organizational systems developed in the two hospitals to review reported incidents could be linked to the differences we found in attitudes to incident reporting between the two hospitals. CONCLUSION: /st>Incident reporting can be a powerful tool for developing and maintaining an awareness of risks in healthcare practice. Using incident reports to improve care is challenging and the study highlighted the <b>complexities</b> involved <b>and</b> the <b>difficulties</b> <b>faced</b> by staff in learning from incident data...|$|R
40|$|PublishedJournal ArticlePurpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{association}} between children who are at risk of being or who have been excluded from school between the ages of 4 and 12 years and the role of psychopathology, development and attainment. Design/methodology/approach - A case-control approach was conducted. Cases were children who had been excluded from school compared to those who had no reported exclusions and normative data where possible. A range of measures were used to collect information from the parent, child and teacher on areas covering the child's mental health and well-being. Findings - The findings showed the number of <b>difficulties</b> <b>faced</b> by children who are at risk of being or who have been excluded from school compared to gender- nd age-matched controls and normative data increased. Behavioural difficulties were apparent in the majority of the cases and an alarming number of children reported self-harm. Interestingly nearly all the cases had recognised needs, but not all of them were accessing appropriate services. Practical implications - There have been a number of changes regarding the identification and support of children's mental health and well-being. This study highlights gaps in resources and provision, particularly around behavioural difficulties for children who are presenting as not coping in school. Originality/value - The findings from the SKIP study indicate the <b>complexities</b> <b>and</b> compounded <b>difficulties</b> <b>faced</b> by children who are experiencing exclusion from school. By implementing a systematic group of assessments the study was able to identify these complexities of need across a vulnerable group of children. The authors would like to thank all the children, their families and the schools for taking part in the study.
