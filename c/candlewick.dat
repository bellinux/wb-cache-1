60|$|In fact, Mr. Franklin {{found it}} so {{difficult}} to provide bread for his family, that, when the boy was ten years old, it became necessary to take him from school. Ben was then employed in cutting <b>candlewicks</b> into equal lengths, and filling the moulds with tallow; and many families in Boston spent their evenings {{by the light of}} the candles which he had helped to make. Thus, you see, in his early days, as well as in his manhood his labors contributed to throw light upon dark matters.|$|R
5000|$|Catherine Evans Whitener's {{revitalization}} of the pre-Civil War-era craft of <b>candlewicking</b> {{gave rise to}} a cottage chenille bedspread industry. Homes along U.S. Highway 41 displayed brightly patterned homemade bedspreads on frontyard clotheslines in hopes of luring tourists into a purchase. The stretch of highway passing through Whitfield County became known colloquially as [...] "Peacock Alley" [...] in reference {{to one of the most}} common patterns depicted on the bedspreads. The bedspread business booned to a multimillion-dollar industry by the 1950s, and from this early origin, the carpet tufting industry grew in Dalton after Glenn Looper developed an adaptation that allowed the mechanism used to tuft yarn into muslin or cotton for bedspreads to tuft into jute, shifting the nation's carpet manufacturers from woven wool products in the northeast to tufted synthetic carpets in northwest Georgia. Today, carpet mills remain the region's major employers and economic drivers.|$|R
2500|$|Like Eadwaker, other medieval Londoners {{acquired}} or {{adopted the}} [...] "surname" [...] "at London Stone" [...] or [...] "of London Stone" [...] because they lived nearby. One {{of these was}} [...] "Ailwin of London Stone", the father of Henry Fitz-Ailwin the first Mayor of the City of London, who took office at some time between 1189 and 1193, and governed the city {{until his death in}} 1212. The Fitz-Ailwin house stood away from <b>Candlewick</b> Street, {{on the north side of}} St Swithin's church.|$|E
2500|$|The brotherhood of drapers, a {{religious}} fraternity {{attached to the}} church of St Mary Bethlehem in Bishopsgate, was founded in honour of the Virgin Mary by [...] "good people Drapers of Cornhill and other good men and women" [...] for the amendment of their lives. The majority of drapers lived in and around Cornhill, <b>Candlewick</b> Street (now Cannon Street) and Chepe (Cheapside). Possibly it was {{for this reason that}} their allegiance was transferred to St Mary le Bow in Cheapside and later to St Michael, Cornhill, where the company continues to worship today. Despite these changes, the drapers retain the Blessed Virgin Mary as their patron saint.|$|E
2500|$|London Stone was {{originally}} {{situated on the}} south side of medieval <b>Candlewick</b> Street (since widened to create modern Cannon Street) opposite the west end of St Swithin's Church, and is shown in this position on the [...] "Copperplate" [...] map of London, dating to the 1550s, now in the Museum of London, and on the derivative [...] "Woodcut" [...] map of the 1560s. It was described by the London historian John Stow in 1598 as [...] "a great stone called London stone", [...] "pitched upright... fixed in the ground verie deep, fastned with bars of iron". Stow does not give the dimensions of this [...] "great stone", but fortunately a French visitor to London had twenty years earlier recorded that the Stone was three feet high, two feet wide, and one foot thick (90 × 60 × 30cm). Thus, although it was a local landmark, London Stone, at least that part of it standing above ground was not particularly impressive.|$|E
