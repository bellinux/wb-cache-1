40|$|We {{study the}} superconductor-insulator quantum phase {{transition}} in disordered Josephson junction chains. To this end, we derive the field theory from the lattice model that describes a chain of superconducting islands with a capacitive coupling to the ground (C_ 0) {{as well as between}} the islands (C_ 1). We analyze the theory in the short-range (C_ 1 ≪ C_ 0) and in the long-range (C_ 1 ≫ C_ 0) limits. The transition to the insulating state is driven by the proliferation of quantum phase slips. The most important source of disorder originates from trapped charges in the substrate that suppress the <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> slips, thus favoring superconducting correlations. Using the renormalization-group approach, we determine the phase diagram and evaluate the temperature dependence of the dc conductivity and system-size dependence of the resistance around the superconductor-insulator transition. These dependences have in general strongly non-monotonic character, with several distinct regimes reflecting an intricate interplay of superconductivity and disorder.

40|$|Dielectric {{loss from}} {{two-level}} states {{is shown to}} be a dominant decoherence source in superconducting quantum bits. Depending on the qubit design, dielectric loss from insulating materials or the tunnel junction can lead to short coherence times. We show that a variety of microwave and qubit measurements are well modeled by loss from resonant absorption of two-level defects. Our results demonstrate that this loss can be significantly reduced by using better dielectrics and fabricating junctions of small area � 10 µm 2. With a redesigned phase qubit employing low-loss dielectrics, the energy relaxation rate has been improved by a factor of 20, opening up the possibility of multi-qubit gates and algorithms. 1 Superconducting qubits are a promising candidate {{for the construction of a}} quantum computer (1). Circuits work well, and experiments have demonstrated single qubit operations with reasonably long coherence times (2 - 6). A recent experiment with phase qubits (7) has shown that the states of two qubits may be simultaneously measured, enabling full tomographic characterization of more complex gates (1).

40|$|International audienceNonlinear {{relations}} among frequencies and phases in modulational instability of circularly polarized Alfvén waves are discussed, {{within the context}} of one dimensional, dissipation-less, unforced fluid system. We show that generation <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>coherence</b> is a natural consequence of the modulational instability of Alfvén waves. Furthermore, we quantitatively evaluate intensity of wave-wave interaction by using bi-coherence, and also by computing energy flow among wave modes, and demonstrate that the energy flow {{is directly related to the}} phase coherence generation. We first discuss the modulational instability within the derivative nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) equation, which is a subset of the Hall-MHD system including the right- and left-hand polarized, nearly degenerate quasi-parallel Alfvén waves. The dominant nonlinear process within this model is the four wave interaction, in which a quartet of waves in resonance can exchange energy. By numerically time integrating the DNLS equation with periodic boundary conditions, and by evaluating relative phase among the quartet of waves, we show that the phase coherence is generated when the waves exchange energy among the quartet of waves. As a result, coherent structures (solitons) appear in the real space, while in the <b>phase</b> space <b>of</b> the wave frequency and the wave number, the wave power is seen to be distributed around a straight line. The slope of the line corresponds to the propagation speed of the coherent structures. Numerical time integration of the Hall-MHD system with periodic boundary conditions reveals that, wave power of transverse modes and that of longitudinal modes are aligned with a single straight line in the dispersion relation phase space, suggesting that efficient exchange of energy among transverse and longitudinal wave modes is realized in the Hall-MHD. Generation of the longitudinal wave modes violates the assumptions employed in deriving the DNLS such as the quasi-static approximation, and thus long time evolution of the Alfvén modulational instability in the DNLS and in the Hall-MHD models differs significantly, even though the initial plasma and parent wave parameters are chosen in such a way that the modulational instability is the most dominant instability among various parametric instabilities. One of the most important features which only appears in the Hall-MHD model is the generation of sound waves driven by ponderomotive density fluctuations. We discuss relationship between the dispersion relation, energy exchange among wave modes, and <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>phases</b> in the waveforms in the real space.

Next, we compared fMRI responses for broadband compound grating stimuli with congruent and random phase structures. All studied visual areas showed stronger responses for the stimuli with congruent phase structure. In addition, selectivity to phase congruency increased from V 1 to higher-level visual areas along both the ventral and dorsal streams.

Basing {{on the condition}} <b>of</b> minimizing the <b>phase</b> diffusion constant, we find the optimal forcing explicitly in the limits of small and large noise, in dependence <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> the oscillator. We show that {{the form of the}} optimal force bifurcates with the noise intensity. In the limit of small noise, the results are compared with purely deterministic conditions of optimal locking...|$|R
