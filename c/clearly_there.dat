25|$|It seems that, in {{response}} to this new submarine threat, some alterations were made to Lusitania and her operation. She was ordered not to fly any flags in the War Zone, a number of warnings, plus advice, were sent to the ship's commander to help him decide how to best protect his ship against the new threat, and it also seems that her funnels were most likely painted a dark grey to help make her less visible to enemy submarines. <b>Clearly,</b> <b>there</b> was no hope of disguising her actual identity, since her profile was so well known, and no attempt was made to paint out the ship's name at the prow.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} no {{agreed-upon}} scientific method for making experiments reproducible. Indeed, many alchemists included in their methods irrelevant {{information such as}} {{the timing of the}} tides or the phases of the moon. The esoteric nature and codified vocabulary of alchemy appeared to be more useful in concealing the fact that they could not be sure of very much at all. As early as the 14th century, cracks seemed to grow in the facade of alchemy; and people became sceptical. <b>Clearly,</b> <b>there</b> needed to be a scientific method where experiments can be repeated by other people, and results needed to be reported in a clear language that laid out both what is known and unknown.|$|E
25|$|These {{very large}} and dirty fission bombs were the largest pure-fission bombs {{deployed}} by any state, and unlike their predecessors, Blue Danube and Red Beard, they used HEU as a fissile material rather than plutonium, the reason being primarily economic. The cost of HEU to the Royal Air Force was (at 1958-9 prices) £19,200 per kg, with plutonium priced at £143,000 per kg. Although a HEU weapon needed more fissile material for a given yield than a plutonium weapon, a saving per weapon was {{of the order of}} £22.7M at 2006 prices. Thirty-seven Green Grass warheads were built (twelve as Violet Club) saving the Treasury £840M. The influence of the Treasury on weapons procurement should not be underestimated: it reaches even into weapons design. <b>Clearly,</b> <b>there</b> were economic benefits in building large and dirty U-235 fission bombs, rather than cleaner, but more expensive plutonium weapons, especially given the shortage of plutonium. By 1958 Britain's accumulated production of plutonium was only 472.2kg and a proportion of that was bartered to the United States in exchange for HEU and other items. Up to 1958, British output of HEU was only 860kg, while the United States supplied the UK with approximately seven tons of HEU from their less costly production process. So HEU used for Green Grass was purchased cheaply from the U.S. while selling to the U.S. the unwanted and high-priced weapons-grade plutonium.|$|E

500|$|Some have {{wondered}} if an anti-Christian sentiment lurks behind the thefts. Attorney Mike Johnson of the Alliance Defending Freedom (formerly the Alliance Defense Fund), a Christian legal group, stated, [...] "I suspect {{most of it}} is childish pranks. <b>Clearly,</b> <b>there</b> are adults with an agenda to remove Christ from Christmas. But they tend to occupy themselves with the courts and courtroom of public opinion." [...] Stephen Nissenbaum, the author of The Battle for Christmas and a retired professor, views Baby Jesus theft as neither innocent vandalism nor religious hate crimes. Nissenbaum writes that, [...] "What it means is that it's OK to go around violating even pretty important norms, as long as real human harm isn't being done. It's not exactly devaluing Christianity, but it is sort of a ritualized challenge to it. It could be Christian kids doing itand on January 2 they become good Christians again." ...|$|E
500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was {{a knock at the door}} and I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. <b>Clearly</b> <b>there</b> was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E
500|$|By early September, Klenau's {{force had}} rejoined Wurmser's column and fought at the Battle of Bassano on 8 September. Here, the Austrians were outnumbered almost {{two to one}} by the French. As the Austrian army retreated, Bonaparte ordered a pursuit that caused the Austrians to abandon their {{artillery}} and baggage. Most of the third battalion of the 59th Jordis, and the first battalion of the Border Infantry Banat were captured and these units ceased to exist after this battle. The Austrians lost 600 killed and wounded, and 2,000 captured, plus lost 30 guns, eight colors, and 200 limbers and ammunition waggons. Klenau was with Wurmser's column again as it fought its way to besieged Mantua and he participated in the combat at La Favorita near there on 15 September. This was the second attempt to relieve the fortress; as the Austrians withdrew from the battle, they retreated into Mantua itself, and from 15 September until 2 February 1797, Klenau was trapped in the fortress while the city was besieged. Following the Austrian loss at the Battle of Rivoli, [...] north of Mantua, on 14–15 January 1797, when <b>clearly</b> <b>there</b> would be no Austrian relief for Mantua, Klenau negotiated conditions of surrender with French General Jean Sérurier, although additional evidence suggests that Bonaparte was present and dictated far more generous terms than Klenau expected. When the garrison capitulated in February, Klenau co-signed the document with Wurmser.|$|E

500|$|On May17,2002, Robert S. Stephens and Roger A. Roffman of The Seattle Times {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] in a guest column for the newspaper. The two argued that drugs are almost always shown as having only negative effects, even though 10million people in the United States use marijuana for recreational purposes. [...] "We believe {{there are good reasons}} for a more honest dialogue about the positive and negative effects of marijuana use. A recent episode of the popular TV show The Simpsons highlighted {{the pros and cons of}} marijuana use, and Homer Simpson's experiences with marijuana provide an example of what we mean", they wrote. For example, when under the influence of marijuana, Homer is relieved from the pain in his eye, and he also finds himself having a variety of sensory experiences and an enhanced appreciation of music and food. [...] "These are real effects reported by many marijuana users, and we would be hard pressed to call them anything other than benefits", Stephens and Roffman wrote. However, Homer is also depicted spending more time with other drug users than with his family, and his friends find that his personality has changed. Eventually, Homer is shown having problems with memory and attention, losing track of the date on which a pro-marijuana rally takes place. Stephens and Roffman wrote that the side effects shown in the episode are [...] "Perhaps a bit exaggerated, but <b>clearly</b> <b>there</b> are costs of marijuana use similar to these that are experienced by real-life users." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1991 the Economic Council of Canada {{found that}} periods of {{immigration}} were not {{directly linked to}} periods of high growth. They noted that [...] "a historical perspective gives little or no support {{to the view that}} immigration is needed for economic prosperity. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the fastest growth in per capita real incomes occurred at times when net immigration was nil or negative. Later in the 20th century, the opposite linkage is seen but, <b>clearly,</b> <b>there</b> is no long-term correlation." [...] However, the same report found that a high rate of immigration was good for Canada's future, and recommended expanding immigration rates to bring Canada's population to 100 million. A University of Montreal study published in 2002 by professor Marc Termote used different methods and studied different countries and concluded that immigration has no statistically significant impact to the per capita income of a country.|$|E
2500|$|While <b>clearly</b> <b>there</b> was {{animosity}} between Catholics and Protestants {{during this}} time period, many historians point to the overwhelming evidence which suggests the motivation for the expulsion was military. [...] The British wanted to cut off supply lines to the Mi'kmaq, Louisbourg and Quebec. [...] They also wanted to end any military threat the Acadians posed (See Military history of the Acadians). A.J.B. Johnston wrote that the evidence {{for the removal of}} the Acadians indicates the decision makers thought the Acadians were a military threat, therefore the deportation of 1755 does not qualify as an act of ethnic cleansing. [...] Geoffery Plank argues that the British continued the expulsion after 1758 for military reasons: present-day New Brunswick remained contested territory and the New Englanders {{wanted to make sure that}} British negotiators would be unlikely to return the region to the French as they had done after King George's War.|$|E
