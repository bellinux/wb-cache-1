5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in <b>certain</b> <b>ways,</b> made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in <b>certain</b> <b>ways,</b> more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E

But since the mid-1990s the hip hop and reggaeton scenes have been taking over Mexico and other Latin American countries.|$|R

Villages were organized in <b>certain</b> <b>ways.</b> Cultural rules of kinship served to define relationships among the individuals of the group. Villages ranged in size from just two to more than a dozen sod houses (ena) for women and girls, one (or more in large villages) qasgiq for men and boys, and warehouses.|$|E

25|$|There are <b>certain</b> <b>ways</b> {{in which}} Plautus {{expressed}} {{himself in his}} plays, and these individual means of expression give a certain flair to his style of writing. The means of expression are not always specific to the writer, i.e., idiosyncratic, yet they are characteristic of the writer. Two examples of these characteristic means of expression are the use of proverbs {{and the use of}} Greek language in the plays of Plautus.|$|E
25|$|Ethical vegetarians {{may also}} {{object to the}} {{practices}} underlying the production of meat, or cite their concerns about animal welfare, animal rights, environmental ethics, and religious reasons. In response, some proponents of meat-eating have adduced various scientific, nutritional, cultural, and religious arguments {{in support of the}} practice. Some meat-eaters only object to rearing animals in <b>certain</b> <b>ways,</b> such as in factory farms, or killing them with cruelty; others avoid only certain meats, such as veal or foie gras.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} regarding resilience is its definition. Like other psychological phenomena, {{by defining}} specific psychological and affective states in <b>certain</b> <b>ways,</b> controversy over meaning will always ensue. How the term resilience is defined affects research focuses; different or insufficient definitions of resilience {{will lead to}} inconsistent research about the same concepts. Research on resilience has become more heterogeneous in its outcomes and measures, convincing some researchers to abandon the term altogether due to it being attributed to all outcomes of research where results were more positive than expected.|$|E

25|$|Singers {{can also}} learn to project sound in <b>certain</b> <b>ways</b> {{so that it}} resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as vocal resonation. Another major {{influence}} on vocal sound and production is {{the function of the}} larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of vocal registers. The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the Singer's Formant; which has been shown to match particularly well to the most sensitive part of the ear's frequency range.|$|E
25|$|One {{consequence}} of these positions that Unger points {{to is the}} revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If {{there is only one}} world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of <b>certain</b> <b>ways</b> in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, {{but it is not a}} part of the world.|$|E
25|$|Apparent {{correlation}} between heredity and {{behavior may be}} due to social stereotypes making people with certain physical characteristics (which may be hereditary physical characteristics) behave in <b>certain</b> <b>ways,</b> without any biological link between the genetic factor and the behavior. This violatates the equal environment assumption of twin design and suggests a stronger argument for environmental influences. This factor has an especially high likelihood of being the case for behaviors that are culturally depicted in mass media as being more accepted by those who consider them to be biological than by those who consider them learned (e.g. sexuality and some psychiatric diagnoses) and for physical characteristics that are not culturally considered by mass media to be bigoted to associate with certain behaviors (e.g. not ethnic or racial). Such unequal environment biases may concentrate on {{a relatively small number of}} minor physical characteristics that are subject to stereotypes that are considered to be politically correct, with no statistically significant effect on overall ratings of physical similarity, let alone anywhere near being able to pass identical twins off as being fraternal.|$|E
