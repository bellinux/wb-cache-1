40|$|Bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>calculations</b> are an {{important}} part of the design of foundations. Most of the terms in the bearing capacity equation, as it is used today in practice, are empirical. Shape factors for square and rectangular footings could not be derived in the past because three-dimensional bearing capacity computations could not be performed with any degree of accuracy. Likewise, depth factors could not be determined because rigorous analyses of foundations embedded in the ground were not available. In this paper, the bearing capacities of strip, square, circular and rectangular foundations in clay are determined rigorously based on finite element limit analysis. The results of the analyses are used to propose rigorous, definitive values of the shape and depth factors for foundations in clays. These results are helpful in reducing the uncertainties related to the method of analysis in bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>calculations,</b> paving the way for more cost-effective foundation design...|$|R

40|$|As European Union {{published}} the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline, {{the goal was}} to publish a guideline which would, among others, optimise the use of the power grid as well as the calculation and allocation of the cross border capacities. The guideline requires a coordinated manner to calculate the cross borders within transmission system operators as well as increase the frequency of the <b>capacity</b> <b>calculation.</b> Based on these objectives the currently in use <b>capacity</b> <b>calculation</b> methodology has to be developed to be in line with capacity allocation and congestion management guideline. The calculation methodology developed in this thesis utilises the NTC-method, which is currently in use, as a theoretical base. In the future this methodology is required to calculate capacities hourly for the whole Nordic synchronous area. This sets a strict operational environment for the CNTC method, in which the methodology is meant to calculate secure values fast. CNTC method was developed to utilise a simulation environment, which is used in Fingrid’s current <b>capacity</b> <b>calculation.</b> The method is divided into three main parts, which creates the base for the calculated technical maximum capacities. In the first stage the method collects all the necessary input data. Second phase is steady state analysis, where the N- 1 principle is examined as well as the violation of thermal and voltage limits. As the greatest cross-border capacity in steady state is found, the dynamic analysis is run. Once a dynamically stable case is found, the <b>capacity</b> <b>calculation</b> is seen as completed. The developed method was tested in case study calculating the capacity for the AC-border between Finland and Sweden. In order to conduct the case study the input data was collected from the relevant TSOs, which included grid models which comprised the whole Nordic synchronous system. With these calculations the developed CNTC method was proven to give capacities close to the ones that the current NTC methodology gives for the border. In order to finalise the developed CNTC method into a capacity allocation and congestion management guideline compliant more work is needed. The topics for the further development include the implementation of the current capacity allocation methodologies and inclusion of remedial actions. The implementation of said additions require further testing in order to take the method to production use in the Nordic <b>capacity</b> <b>calculation</b> region...|$|E
