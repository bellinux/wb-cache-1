AGDB mixes of traditional and distributed debugging facilities.

Using the Fieller–Creasy problem for illustration, we argue that an observed identifiability test statistic is directly relevant to the precision with which the structural parameters can be estimated, and hence we argue that inference in such models should be conditioned on the observed value of that statistic (or statistics). We examine in detail the effects of such conditioning on {{the properties of the}} ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimators for the coefficients of the endogenous variables in a single structural equation. We show that (a) conditioning has very little impact on the properties of the OLS estimator but a substantial impact on those of the TSLS estimator; (b) the conditional variance of the TSLS estimator can be very much larger than its unconditional variance (when the identifiability statistic is small) or very much smaller (when the identifiability statistic is large); and (<b>c)</b> <b>conditional</b> mean-square-error comparisons of the two estimators favor the OLS estimator when the sample evidence only weakly supports the identifiability hypothesis but favor TSLS when that evidence moderately supports identifiability.

MT 2816 /Rv 2745 c expression was induced in M. tuberculosis following redox stress, heat shock and acid shock and intracellular replication. Its expression was also induced by SDS and thioridazine, agents that impact M. tuberculosis cell-envelope. However, exposure to isoniazid or ethambutol, front-line antituberculosis drugs which also target the cell envelope, did not induce the expression of MT 2816 /Rv 2745 c.

Starting from an anti-essentialist perspective, which holds that language {{differences between men and women}} speakers are much less extensive than claimed in the past, we analysed 463 parliamentary speeches in the course of the XIVth legislature (5 - 2001 / 4 - 2006) in four parliamentarian pairs, differentiated by gender and political orientation. The general aim was to explore the socio-psychological constructs of agency and ingroup/outgroup dynamics as revealed by linguistic behaviour in men/women parliamentarians. The two constructs were detected by specific linguistic markers in the interventions of men/women parliamentarian pairs. Specifically, for agency, we detected: (1 a) pronoun variations between singular and plural first person (I, we); (1 b) amplitude of we as either specific or superordinate; (1 <b>c)</b> <b>conditional</b> modal form of verbs.

Here, we employed prostate-specific murine bi-genic systems to investigate the effects of gain and loss of Notch function during prostate development. We show that Nkx 3. 1 Cre and ProbasinCre alleles drive expression of Cre recombinase to the prostate epithelium and periepithelial stroma. We investigated the effects of gain of Notch function using the RosaNI 1 <b>C</b> <b>conditional</b> allele, which carries a constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch 1 receptor. We carried out the analysis of loss of Notch function in Nkx 3. 1 Cre/+;RBP-Jflox/flox prostates, where RBP-J is a ubiquitous transcriptional mediator of Notch signaling. We found that gain of Notch function resulted in inhibition of the tumor suppressor PTEN, and increase in cell proliferation and progenitor cells in the basal epithelium and smooth muscle compartments. In turn, loss of Notch/RBP-J function resulted in decreased cell proliferation and loss of epithelial and smooth muscle progenitors. Gain of Notch function resulted in an early onset of benign prostate hyperplasia by three months of age. Loss of Notch function also resulted in abnormal differentiation of the prostate epithelium and stroma. In particular, loss of Notch signaling and increase in PTEN promoted a switch from myoblast to fibroblast lineage, and a loss of smooth muscle. In summary, we show that Notch signaling is necessary for terminal differentiation of the prostate epithelium and smooth muscle, and that during normal prostate development Notch/PTEN pathway functions to maintain patterned progenitors in the epithelial and smooth muscle compartments. In addition, we found that both positive and negative modulation of Notch signaling results in abnormal organization of the prostate tissue, and can contribute to prostate disease in the adult organ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{unconditional}} self-love {{is fundamental to}} many theoretical perspectives in social science and is referred to periodically in the literature. This study addressed the problem that scientific literature refers to unconditional self-love, but does not clearly define it, differentiate it from other types of feelings that comprise self-esteem, measure it, or even attempt to substantiate its existence. The {{purpose of this study}} was to define, describe, and measure unconditional self-love so that it may be used in the treatment of problems caused by low self-esteem. To achieve this purpose, the concept of self-love was defined in relation to self-liking, separated from the other components of self-esteem, and operationalized through the creation of the Unconditional Self-Liking (USL) model and the Unconditional Self-Liking (USL) scale. The USL scale is a self-report questionnaire that simultaneously measures two variables in relation to one another. This was done using the intersect of the variables of personal success and self-liking as a measure of unconditionality across nine areas of self-identity. The USL model allows for the measurement and description of four primary types of self-liking: (a) conditional self-likers who like themselves only when they succeed, (b) unconditional self-dislikers who dislike themselves even when they succeed, (<b>c)</b> <b>conditional</b> self-dislikers who dislike themselves when they fail, and (d) unconditional self-likers who like themselves even when they fail. The USL scale was administered to a convenience sample of 164 undergraduate university students who also completed the Modified Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) and the 10 -question Rosenberg Self-Esteem (RSE) scale. The subjects 2 ̆ 7 responses on the three scales were compared. Major findings indicated that individual levels of self-liking varied between areas of self-identity. Moreover, the level of self-liking was not necessarily dependent on their level of success.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} perfect sampling methods {{within the context of}} Bayesian linear regression. We focus on inference problems related to the marginal posterior model probabilities. Model averaged inference for the response and Bayesian variable selection are considered. Perfect sampling is an alternate form of Markov chain Monte Carlo that generates exact sample points from the posterior of interest. This approach removes the need for burn-in assessment faced by traditional MCMC methods. For model averaged inference, we find the monotone Gibbs coupling from the past (CFTP) algorithm is the preferred choice. This requires the predictor matrix be orthogonal, preventing variable selection, but allowing model averaging for prediction of the response. Exploring choices of priors for the parameters in the Bayesian linear model, we investigate sufficiency for monotonicity assuming Gaussian errors. We discover that a number of other sufficient conditions exist, besides an orthogonal predictor matrix, {{for the construction of a}} monotone Gibbs Markov chain. Requiring an orthogonal predictor matrix, we investigate new methods of orthogonalizing the original predictor matrix. We find that a new method using the modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure performs comparably with existing transformation methods, such as generalized principal components. Accounting for the effect of using an orthogonal predictor matrix, we discover that inference using model averaging for in-sample prediction of the response is comparable between the original and orthogonal predictor matrix. The Gibbs sampler is then investigated for sampling when using the original predictor matrix and the orthogonal predictor matrix. We find that a hybrid method, using a standard Gibbs sampler on the orthogonal space in conjunction with the monotone CFTP Gibbs sampler, provides the fastest computation and convergence to the posterior distribution. We conclude the hybrid approach should be used when the monotone Gibbs CFTP sampler becomes impractical, due to large backwards coupling times. We demonstrate large backwards coupling times occur when the sample size is close to the number of predictors, or when hyper-parameter choices increase model competition. The monotone Gibbs CFTP sampler should be taken advantage of when the backwards coupling time is small. For the problem of variable selection we turn to the exact version of the independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) algorithm. We reiterate the notion that the exact IMH sampler is redundant, being a needlessly complicated rejection sampler. We then determine a rejection sampler is feasible for variable selection when the sample size is close to the number of predictors and using Zellner’s prior with a small value for the hyper-parameter c. Finally, we use the example of simulating from the posterior of <b>c</b> <b>conditional</b> on a model to demonstrate how the use of an exact IMH view-point clarifies how the rejection sampler can be adapted to improve efficiency...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} studies on {{modality}} and/or conditionals have presented the claim that conditionals are intimately connected to modality (Comrie, 1986 : 89; Dancygier, 1998 : 72; Huddleston & Pullum, 2002 : 741; Nuyts, 2001 : 352; Palmer, 1986 : 189; Sweetser, 1990 : 141); however, {{the nature of that}} connection has not been investigated empirically. This paper reports on parts of a larger study which empirically tested the above claim – namely the corpus-based approach and metrics developed in the study, as well as some significant findings. More specifically, the paper examines whether, and to what extent, this relationship [...] . a. holds for all conditionals, irrespective of their subordinator (e. g. if, in case, unless); b. extends to concessive-conditionals (e. g. even if); c. is limited to conditionals (and concessive-conditionals), or extends to other constructions sharing subordinators with conditionals (e. g. indirect interrogatives with if). d. holds for either of the two parts of bi-partite constructions (e. g. protasis and apodosis in conditionals; Fillmore, 1986). In the case of if-conditionals, the paper also examines the extent to which this relationship applies to their two basic types, direct and indirect (Quirk et al., 1985 : 1088 - 1097). The methodology combines a corpus-based, quantitative approach with close analysis of the data {{for the purposes of the}} annotation of modal marking in all corpus samples, and the classification of if-conditionals. The study uses eleven random samples from the written BNC, containing the following: a. All types of constructions, providing an indication of the average frequency of modal marking in written British English –which was used as the baseline; b. Non-conditional constructions, taken collectively; <b>c.</b> <b>Conditional</b> constructions (e. g. assuming, if, unless); d. Conditional-concessive constructions with even if and whether; e. Indirect interrogative (non-conditional) constructions with if and whether; f. Constructions with when and whenever (used as conjunctions), as they have been presented as synonymous with unmodalised if-conditionals in some studies (e. g. Athanasiadou & Dirven, 1996 : 617, 1997 : 62; Palmer, 1990 : 174 - 175). The analysis revealed that the modal load (i. e. the extent of modal marking) in conditionals as a construction family, and if-conditionals in particular, is significantly higher than the baseline and non-conditional constructions (taken collectively), as well as most, but not all, non-conditional constructions. More importantly, if-conditionals showed a distinctly higher modal load than other conditional constructions. Overall, constructions of the same family tend to have similar modal load; however, this is not consistently the case with individual constructions within a family. Also, constructions across and within bi-partite families show different ratios of modal load in their two parts. More importantly, the protases of if-conditionals have a modal load at least equal to that of the baseline, and, in some cases, significantly higher – despite protases being already modally marked by if.

40|$|The {{importance}} of insulin delivery and action is best characterized in Type 2 Diabetes, {{a disease that}} is becoming a pandemic both nationally and globally. Obesity is a principal risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes, and adipocyte function abnormalities due to adipose hypertrophy and hyperplasia, {{have been linked to}} obesity. Numerous reports suggest that the intracellular and systemic consequences of adipocyte function abnormalities include adipocyte insulin resistance, enhanced production of free fatty acids, and production of inflammatory mediators. A hallmark of adipocyte insulin sensitivity is the stimulation of glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT 4) trafficking events to promote glucose uptake. In the Type 2 diabetic and insulin resistant states the mechanism behind insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 trafficking is compromised. Therefore, understanding the role of factors involved in glucose-uptake in adipose tissue is of great importance. Studies from our laboratory suggest an important role for the unconventional myosin, Myo 1 c, in promoting insulin-mediated glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes. Our observations suggest that depletion of Myo 1 c in cultured adipocytes results in a significant reduction in the ability of adipocytes to take up glucose following insulin treatment, suggesting Myo 1 c is required for insulin-mediated glucose uptake. A plausible mechanism by which Myo 1 c promotes glucose uptake in adipocytes has been suggested by further work from our laboratory in which expression of fluorescently-tagged Myo 1 c in cultured adipocytes induces significant membrane ruffling at the cell periphery, insulin-independent GLUT 4 translocation to the cell periphery, and accumulation of GLUT 4 in membrane ruffling regions. Taken together Myo 1 c seems to facilitate glucose uptake through remodeling of cortical actin. In {{the first part of this}} thesis I, in collaboration with others, uncovered a possible mechanism through which Myo 1 c regulates adipocyte membrane ruffling. Here we identified a novel protein complex in cultured adipocytes, comprising Myo 1 c and the mTOR binding partner, Rictor. Interestingly our studies in cultured adipocytes suggest that the Rictor-Myo 1 c complex is biochemically distinct from the Rictor-mTOR complex of mTORC 2. Functionally, only depletion of Rictor but not Myo 1 c results in decreased Akt phosphorylation at serine 473, but depletion of either Rictor or Myo 1 c results in compromised cortical actin dynamic events. Furthermore we observed that whereas the overexpression of Myo 1 c in cultured adipocytes causes remarkable membrane ruffling, Rictor depletion in cells overexpressing Myo 1 c significantly reduces these ruffling events. Taken together our findings suggest that Myo 1 c, in conjunction with Rictor, modulates cortical actin remodeling events in cultured adipocytes. These findings have implications for GLUT 4 trafficking as GLUT 4 has been previously observed to accumulate in Myo 1 c-induced membrane ruffles prior to fusion with the plasma membrane. During our studies of adipocyte function we noticed that current siRNA electroporation methods present numerous limitations. To silence genes more effectively we employed a lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery system, and to standardize this technology in cultured adipocytes we targeted Myo 1 c and MAP 4 K 4. Using this technology we were able to achieve clear advantages over siRNA oligonucleotide electroporation techniques in stability and permanence of gene silencing. Furthermore we showed that the use of lentiviral vectors in cultured adipocytes did not affect insulin signaling or insulin-mediated glucose uptake events. Despite our inability to use lentiviral vectors to achieve gene silencing in mice we were able to achieve adipose tissue-specific gene silencing effects in mice following manipulation of the lentiviral conditional silencing vector, and then crossing resulting founders with aP 2 -Cre mice. Interestingly however, only founders from the MAP 4 K 4 conditional shRNA vector, but not founders from the Myo 1 <b>c</b> <b>conditional</b> shRNA vector, showed gene knockdown, possibly due to position-effect variegation. Taken together, findings from these studies are important because they present an alternative means of achieving gene silencing in cultured adipocytes, with numerous advantages not offered by siRNA oligonucleotide electroporation methods. Furthermore, the in vivo, adipose tissue-specific RNAi studies offer a quick, inexpensive, and less technically challenging means of achieving adipose tissue-specific gene ablations relative to traditional gene knockout approaches...|$|E
40|$|A rich body of {{literature}} has proposed that pairs behave significantly differently from individuals due {{to a number of}} reasons such as group polarization. This paper experimentally compares cooperation behaviors between pairs and individuals in a finitely-repeated two-player public goods game (continuous prisoner’s dilemma game). We show that pairs contribute significantly more than individuals to their group accounts. Especially, when two pairs are matched with each other for the entire periods, they successfully build long-lasting cooperative relationships with their matched pairs. Our detailed analyses suggest that the enhanced cooperation behavior of pairs may be driven by (a) the mere fact that they have partners when they make decisions, (b) group polarization – those who initially prefer to contribute smaller amounts are more affected by the partners in their pairs, and (<b>c)</b> stronger <b>conditional</b> cooperation behavior of pairs to their matched pairs.

40|$|We {{identified}} a partially sequenced Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene which encodes a protein {{related to the}} S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II subunit, RPB 7. Several lines of evidence suggest that this related gene, YKL 1, encodes the RNA polymerase III subunit C 25. C 25, like RPB 7, is present in submolar ratios, easily dissociates from the enzyme, is essential for cell growth and viability, but is not required in certain transcription assays in vitro. YKL 1 has ABF- 1 and PAC upstream sequences often present in RNA polymerase subunit genes. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mobility of the YKL 1 gene product is equivalent {{to that of the}} RNA polymerase III subunit C 25. Finally, a <b>C</b> 25 <b>conditional</b> mutant grown at the nonpermissive temperature synthesizes tRNA at reduced rates relative to 5. 8 S rRNA, a hallmark of all characterized RNA polymerase III mutants...|$|R
40|$|The {{equivalence}} paradigm {{has been}} applied {{to the development of a}} variety of procedures applied to teach reading, writing and arithmetic. This work aimed to investigate the effect of teaching stimulus equivalence relations between three different forms of arithmetic sum problems on problem-solving behavior. Seven first grade students of Fundamental Schooling (=Elementary Schooling) were submitted to a pre-test, and a post-test with sum problems printed in the form of slave (A), operations (B) and word problems (<b>C).</b> The <b>conditional</b> discrimination procedure established relations between A-B and A-C. Six of seven participants responded accordingly to the established classes. The performance of the participants in the post-test was higher than in the pre-test. It was concluded that the establishment of equivalence relations between arithmetic sum problems in the form of slave, operations, and word problems enhanced the performance of the resolution of those types of problems...|$|R
