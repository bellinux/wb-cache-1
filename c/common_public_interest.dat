Administration of Markets and Fairs Public Services from Craiova, Iasi, and Timisoara are providing public services {{consumed by the}} user, by means of contracts and subscription agreements with individuals or legal entities, either to achieve or to exploit the operation of commercial spaces. Administration is done {{in order to meet}} <b>common</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> but in terms of economic efficiency. Managerial success of the Administration of Markets and Fairs Public Service is determined by its ability to identify customer needs and provide products and/or services to satisfy their need by the attraction of small producers and farmers offering organic products. In public service, the results have to be oriented to citizens concomitantly with cost optimization. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Civil Service for the Administration of Markets and Fairs for three major cities in Romania, with a common set of indicators and indices. The commons variable are: population served, the total population of each city, market areas, their number and their distribution for each city, etc [...] This analysis helps halls to get closer to the citizen by identifying directions for action in order to increase the satisfaction of citizens served...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this Master's Thesis is a {{description}} of administrative and similar proceedings leading to issue of permits, consents, statements and expert opinions needed {{for the implementation of}} entrepreneurial plans that could potentially have negative impacts on the environment. This Thesis describes the process of environmental impact assessment (so called EIA) and its specifics, as well as its relevance for further administrative proceedings. Other subject of analyses is the integrated permit, a document that substitutes selected individual administrative deeds, and also the very permits, consents and statements intended to protect the individual environmental departments (such as air, water, landscape) or to regulate environmentally relevant activities (e. g. waste treatment). Subject of analyses are also the permission procedures pursuant to the Construction Act that ensure the protection of the <b>common</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> on environment protection by the means of so called binding opinions of environmental protection authorities necessary in the land-use and construction permit issue proceedings as well as in other land-use planning activities. The aim of this Thesis is to describe specific aspects of the individual approval proceedings and their mutual procedural and factual correlation in order to eliminate interpretation difficulties caused by the fragmented legal regulation in the area of environmental protection legislation...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the non-author approach to urbanistic and planning projects. The project leader guides the entire project team, yet particular coordinators are also important. Contrary to authorship in architectural projects, in physical planning authorship is often or even always completely shared. Not only because planning projects can change significantly during adoption procedures, but mainly {{because there are}} many participating actors (designers, planners, commissioners and/or investors etc.) that are involved in any project’s undertaking. Experience proves that the non-author approach is beneficial for good project management and creation of conditions for constructive cooperation within an interdisciplinary working group and with all the other contributing parties. Two tested examples are presented. Their comparison is very interesting, since the first example shows a project where good cooperation between the client, investor and designers, as well as willing interested public, conditioned quality improvements, while the second (because of the public and consequently against its interests) diminished its quality significantly. Our judgement is that the quantity of the often mentioned necessity of public involvement is actually sufficient. There are no obstacles for public participation in urbanistic and physical planning, as long as the public is interested. Troubles are often triggered elsewhere – how to safeguard the <b>common,</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> before particular publics (e. g. neighbours, the immediately affected etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This master thesis investigates how five Danish {{national}} newspapers {{covered the}} Gaza-Israel-conflict from the 8 th of July to the 26 th of August 2014. While {{three of the}} five examined newspapers – Berlingske, Politiken and Jyllands-Posten – cover a broad range of topics of <b>common</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> the other two of the five examined newspapers – Kristeligt Dagblad and Information – are smaller, niche news outlets, each with their own special focus. The analysis, based on Professor Maxwell McCombs theory about agenda setting, was divided into two sections. First, a quantitative analysis of 294 journalistic articles was conducted with the primarily goal of assessing {{the extent to which the}} Gaza-Israel-conflict was central to the media agenda at the time. Second, a qualitative analysis of 138 articles was performed to ascertain the importance of field correspondents and their assignments during the coverage The analyses lead me to several noteworthy conclusions. First of all, the five examined newspapers featured extensive coverage of the Gaza-Israel-conflict. Specifically, during the 50 -day period of interest, there were 33 editorials and 59 front- page stories on the topic. Further, coverage of the conflict was not only highly visble in the newspapers’ international sections, but also in the national, cultural and sports sections. Secondly, the role of field correspondents was central to the coverage, as they provided 56 percent (164 out of 294 journalistic articles) of the total news output on the conflict, and thus produced more analysis and reportage on the topic than the local Danish and foreign news agencies and journalists combined. The field correspondents also quoted sources who were directly involved in the conflict more than they quoted experts on foreign affairs. Finally, the correspondents were fair to both sides of the conflict as both pro- Palestinian and pro-Israeli sources were given equal attention...|$|E
40|$|Communal {{violence}} - {{or violence}} between groups which define themselves by their differences {{from each other}} 2 ̆ 7 - {{is one of the}} fore- most human rights problems today. 2 But the violence of the past 20 years differs from that of previous decades. Responsibility for current sectarian violence lies not with specific extremist groups but with gov- ernments which leverage inter-group hatred to gain power. 3 Such sys- temic sources of communal violence threaten basic principles of democratic government and non-discrimination. 4 Present-day communal violence originates in identity politics. 5 Identity politics stress the group nature of rights, experience and iden- tity, whether based on race, sex, caste, class, language, religion or na- tional or regional origin. 6 In many cases, the political-cultural movements which engage in identity politics seek fundamental juridi- cal changes, political power and, sometimes, cultural hegemony. 7 Minority and women 2 ̆ 7 s rights advocates embrace identity politics because it has increased awareness of the legitimacy and unique expe- rience of different groups such as women or Asian-Americans. 8 In contrast, however, the sectarian strife that has repeatedly torn India, Ireland, Sri Lanka and Pakistan illustrates its potential dangers. The experience of these countries demonstrates that identity politics not only fragments groups but also may render them 2 ̆ 2 autistic. 2 ̆ 29 The rhetoric of identity politics allows groups to enclose themselves in their own myths of self-righteous victimhood so that they cannot hear or learn from anyone other than themselves. 10 By over-valuing their own identity, group members distort the identity of non-group mem- bers 2 ̆ 2 and lose recognition of the <b>common</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> which they share with those non-group members. 12 This perceived lack of com- mon ground undermines civic values, frustrates dialogue and facili- tates inter-group hostility.

40|$|Focal {{point of}} plastic-aesthetic {{operations}} is the cosmetic correction {{of the female}} breast with silicone implants. Main part of them are breast augmentations. Beside the <b>common</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> {{is the use of}} silicone imlants in reconstructive plastic intervention and tumor aftercare. The implant material silicone, considered as inert material for lots of years, causes problems and its degradation could not be explained sufficently up to now. Implantation of a silicone implant can cause the formation of a fibrous capsule as answer of the organism to the foreign material, emersion of silicone filling material into the body (silicone bleeding) or even the total collapse of the implant (rupture). The described reactions require with every third woman an additional surgical intervention. Studies of the implant ageing are often limited to the evaluation of the implant state in vivo or at the point of explantation (ruptures or rate of fibrose capsules) without further analysis. Cause studies concerning the degradation are seldom. Furthermore research is restricted and hindered in comparability and actuality by small sample volumes, short implantation times or concentration on the implants of a single manufacturer. Mechanical ageing of explants was studied only for implants of the US-americain market. They are limited in disposability by the ban of the US-americain health administration FDA since 1992 and are restricted to selected patient panels. The study presented here arised from the question about the material causes for the ageing of 110 of the department for plastic surgery of the Klinikum rechts der Isar, München, explanted silicone implants during the years 2002 to 2005. Compared to hitherto published studies implants with implantation times of 2 weeks up to 31 years were included, containing 16 of the eldest ever studied explants. Main focus of the study was the mechanical, chemical and biological degradation of the mostly silicone filled implants with increasing implantation times. Changes of basic material properties in vivo could be shown by uniaxial tensile tests according to the americain standard ASTM 703 - 96. Tensile stress and elongation at break of the silicone explants decreased with increasing implantation times, whereas the module of elasticity proves itself independent of long invivo-times. Degredation of tensile stress and elongation at break could be already seen after short implantation times of about 1 year, reaching a limit after an implantation period of 10 years combined to a total loss of strength of about 30 % compared to native implants. Chemical analysis of the explants exhibits diffusion processes of non crosslinked residual monomers – or oligomers of the filling material with all studied silicone filled explants, resulting in an accumulation of silicone oils in the implant shells. Extraction with the solvent Hexane showed an increase within a period of 10 years of implantation of about 8 weight per cent to a saturation value of about 18 weight per cent. Furthermore a higher silicone content of the implant shells frequently was accompanied by the incidence of higher fibrous capsule degrees. Irrespective of the implantation time fibrous capsules of baker degrees II – IV could be seen cumulatively with a silicone accumulation of ³ 15 weight per cent silicone oils in the shells. Colonisation tests demonstrated an affinity of characteristic cells of the immune system to silicone gel, but a stronger immun response in general to implants with long implantation times could not be shown. The study of the explants exhibited the role of the enrichment of the implant shells with lightly crosslinked silicone oils as reason for the biodegradation of the implants. The accumulation independent of implant typ or manufacturer showed an impact to the overall ageing of the implants. The measured degradation of strength could be concluded by a preceding elongation of the material, but did not lead to an impairment of the structure {{in the form of a}} softener. The biggest influence can be seen in the biological reaction on the implant material, expressing in a higher risk for the forming of high-grade fibrous capsules...|$|E

40|$|Higher {{education}} governance {{refers to}} the legal appropriation of decision making power within universities between the various governance structures (faculty, academic committees, senates, and boards) and administrative structures (departments, programs, presidents, and vice presidents). The purpose of higher education governance is to articulate <b>common</b> <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> and to realize their goals while determining the limits of authority in theory and in practice – who shall decide and what is at the focus of decisions. From the late 19 th century until the early 1950 s, university governance followed the principle of administrative autonomy, meaning that they were free to act and conduct themselves {{according to their own}} standards without bowing to the needs or demands of a funding government. However, the transition to a capitalist economy and society, in addition to the rapid {{rise in the number of}} students and the transformation of higher education into a mass commodity, required countries worldwide to seek new models of governance, with the aim of increasing academic order and efficiency. The different styles of governance can be charted along three main models, based on the mutual relations between market forces, the state, and higher education. The current paper reviews the various models of higher education governance and portrays the Israeli model. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of each model are discussed, as well as the future of Israeli governance in light of local winds of change and global trends...|$|R

50|$|The idea of {{a common}} good {{plays a role in}} Confucian {{political}} philosophy, which on most interpretations stresses the importance of the subordinination of individual interests to group or collective interests, or at the very least, the mutual dependence between the flourishing of the individual and the flourishing of the group. In Islamic political thought, many modern thinkers have identified conceptions of the common good while endeavoring to ascertain the fundamental or universal principles underlying divine shari‘a law. These fundamentals or universal principles have been largely identified with the “objectives” of the shari‘a (maqāṣid al-sharī‘a), including concepts of the <b>common</b> good or <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> (maṣlaḥa ‘āmma, in modern terminology). A notion of the common good arises in contemporary Islamic discussions of the distinction between the fixed and the flexible (al-thābit wa-l-mutaghayyir), especially as it relates to modern Islamic conceptions of tolerance, equality, and citizenship: according to some, for instance, universal principles carry greater weight than specific injunctions of the Qur’an, and in case of conflict, can even supersede or suspend explicit textual injunctions (naṣṣ) if this serves the common good.|$|R
