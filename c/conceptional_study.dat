This sen-sitivity is elaborated in this <b>conceptional</b> <b>study</b> by inves-tigating the dependency of characteristic quantities on the particle type, using parameterization assumptions of the Kessler-type. These quantities are the mean effec-tive size, which is an important parameter in radiative transfer calculations, the precipitation flux, the riming and accretion rate, and the steady state vertical distri-bution of precipit,ation concentration under the impact of sedimentation and riming or accretion. The sensitivity studies show that the,particle type substantially influences {{the values of the}} mentioned quan-tities: The mean effective sizes vary by about 30 %, the riming/accretion rates and the sedimentation fluxes by a factor of at least 3 under otherwise equal condi-tions. Furthermore, the particle type affects structural characteristics. Concerning the steady state profile of precipitation concentration, flat ice particle types are basically connected with a much more intense increase in mass concentration with decreasing height than e. g. spherical-like types, and even an infinite value may be reached already after a finite fall distance. Serious prob-lems in determining the concentration profile on the ba-sis of the steady state assumption are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the {{possibility}} of a biometric on-pen matching for dynamic handwriting-based user authentication is pro-posed. The approach is based on a digitizer pen originally designed to sample handwritten notes. In a first step the general ability with respect to recognition accuracy is stud-ied to use the digitizer pen (also de-noted as smart pen) for biometric dynamic handwriting acquisition. The evaluation show that the digitizer pen results in similar outcomes as special online signature tablets regarding the chosen meas-urement, the equal error rate (EER). The second step con-siders a <b>conceptional</b> <b>study</b> of embedding an authentication algorithm within smart cards, which could be integrated into the pen hardware, thus allowing for on-card matching. In this second analysis, the focus is to study the feasibility of implementing a reference verification algorithm on-card with respect to its computational complexity. The suggested approach will further allow future authentication scenarios, whereby biometrics, secret knowledge and personal posses-sion can be combined. While the possession aspect is main-tained {{due to the fact that}} the entire authentication system is integrated in the smart pen and remains in ownership of users, the factor of secret knowledge can be integrated by alternative handwritten contents such as personal identifica-tion numbers, generally called semantics...|$|E
40|$|In the Institut fuer Kernphysik I <b>conceptional</b> <b>studies</b> for a {{possible}} succession project for the KARMEN-#nu#-detector are performed. This design studies propose to build a large volume 1300 t imaging water Cerenkov detector. The main goal of this experiment will be the investigation of #nu#-e" [...] scattering in the medium energy range up to 50 MeV. The sensitive surface of this detector will be instrumented with about 3000 8 -inch photomultiplier tubes (PMT) providing a coverage of 20 %. In the framework of this detector design, studies of the properties of hemispherical 8 -inch phototubes have been investigated in this work. The topic was to optimise {{the quality of the}} important PMT properties like time- and energy-resolution which are crucial to achieve the required spatial and angular resolutions. A second task of this work was to construct a test facility for the PMT, with the possibility to test large quantities. Monte Carlo calculations show that the required detector resolutions of #sigma#_E/E(E_e#<=# 50 MeV) = 5. 2 %+ 47 %/#sq root#E, #sigma#_t(E_e#approx# 30 MeV) = 0. 6 ns, #sigma#_x(E_e#approx# 30 MeV) = 13 cm, #sigma#_#THETA#(E_e#approx# 30 MeV) = 20, can be achieved if the phototubes have a transit-time spread less than 1 ns. Up to now, two different 8 -inch tubes are available and have been tested, the HAMAMATSU R 5912 and the EMI 9353. (orig.)

40|$|We <b>study</b> <b>conceptional</b> {{problems}} of a photo-electron emission (PEE) process from a free exciton in insulating crystals. In this PEE process, only the electron constituting the exciton is suddenly emitted out of the crystal, while the hole constituting the exciton is still left inside and forced to be recoiled back to its original valence band. This recoil on the hole is surely reflected in the spectrum of the PEE with a statistical distribution along the momentum-energy curve of the valence band. This distribution is nothing but {{the square of the}} exciton wave function amplitude, since it shows how the electron and the hole are originally bound together. Thus, the momentum-resolved PEE can directly determine the exciton wave function. These problems are clarified, taking the Γ and the saddle point excitons in GaAs, as typical examples. New PEE experiments are also suggested. Comment: to appear in Int. J. Mod. Phys. ...|$|R
40|$|Brainstem {{auditory}} evoked potentials (BAEPs) of nine 'healthy' preterm infants {{were recorded}} at weekly intervals between 32 and 36 weeks <b>conceptional</b> age to <b>study</b> the relationship between stimulus intensity and central transmission time through the subcortical auditory pathway (i. e. the interval latency between peak I and peak V) {{as a function of}} conceptional age. Stimulus intensities of 70, 80 and 90 dB nHTL were used. Changes in click intensity produced changes in the absolute latency of all BAEP peaks, but the interval latency I to V remained constant. The absolute latencies and interval latencies reflected maturity, but varied widely between these preterm infants. The peak V latency and the I to V interval latency decreased with increasing conceptional age. Exponential regression analysis suggested that, above 70 dB nHTL, the time-constant of the calculated exponential function most likely represents maturation and function of the central subcortical pathway, and may give an indication of the infants' development. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Cooperation between organisms of {{different}} species {{is a widely}} observed phenomenon in biology, ranging from large scale systems such as whole ecosystems to more direct interactions like symbiotic relationships. In the present work, we explore inter-species cooperations {{on the level of}} metabolic networks. For our analysis, we extract 447 organism specific metabolic networks from the KEGG database [7] and assess their biosynthetic capabilities by applying the method of network expansion [5]. We simulate the cooperation of two organisms by unifying their metabolic networks and introduce a measure, the gain Γ, quantifying the amount by which the biosynthetic capability of an organism is enhanced due to the cooperation with another species. For all theoretically possible pairs of organisms, this synergetic effect is determined and we systematically analyze its dependency on the dissimilarities of the interacting partners. We describe these dissimilarities by two different distance measures, where one is based on structural, the other on evolutionary differences. With the presented method, we provide a <b>conceptional</b> framework to <b>study</b> the metabolic effects resulting from an interaction {{of different}} species. We outline possible enhancements of our analysis: by defining more realistic interacting networks and applying alternative structural investigation methods, our concept can be used to study specific symbiotic and parasitic relationships and may help to understand the global interplay of metabolic pathways over the boundary of organism specific systems...|$|R
40|$|Fachdidaktiken sind die Wissenschaften für das Lernen und Lehren im Fach. Ihre Spezifik besteht zum einen in ihrer interdisziplinären Konstitution: Fachdidaktiken brauchen den Anschluss sowohl an die Fachwissenschaften als auch an die Erziehungswissenschaft und ihre konzeptionellen wie ihre empirischen Studien sind konstitutive Elemente der Lehr-Lern-Forschung. Zum anderen sind die Fachdidaktiken mit den Bedürfnissen der Praxis konfrontiert, wobei umsetzbare und Erfolg versprechende Konzepte als Orientierungshilfen für die Gestaltung von Unterricht erwartet werden. Der Beitrag diskutiert die Stärken und Herausforderungen, die sich damit für die Fachdidaktiken ergeben. Am Beispiel der Deutschdidaktik werden zudem zentrale Fragen genannt, mit denen sich die deutschdidaktische Forschung in vom Schweizerischen Nationalfonds akkreditierten Projekten beschäftigt. Subject-specific pedagogies, {{also called}} subject didactics in some countries, are the {{sciences}} {{of learning and}} teaching in a specific subject. Their specificity consists, on the one hand, in their interdisciplinary constitution. Subject pedagogies need the connections to both their specific disciplines and to the educational sciences. Furthermore, the <b>conceptional</b> and empirical <b>studies</b> delivered by subject didactics are constitutive elements of research on teaching and learning. On the other hand, subject pedagogies face the needs of practice. Didactic concepts are expected that can be concretely applied and that promise success. In addition, these concepts must assist in orienting the shaping of instruction. This contribution discusses the strengths and challenges that thereby arise with subject didactics. The example of didactics of German is used to furthermore name central questions which occupy research on German teaching and learning in projects accredited by the Swiss National Science Foundation...|$|R
40|$|With view to {{potential}} future space launchers or other hypersonic vehicles {{the demonstration of}} high speed airbreathing propulsion, and especially of the dual mode ramjet combining subsonic and supersonic combustion, is still of great interest. After the national hypersonic research and technology programs in Germany and France (German Hypersonic Technology Program and French Research and Technology Program for Advanced Hypersonic Propulsion - PREPHA (1), the mastery of high-speed airbreathing propulsion technologies {{is not sufficient to}} allow the development of an operational vehicle. Therefore, ONERA and DLR decided to join in a common research program that investigates an airbreathing propulsion system operating from Mach 4 to Mach 8. The general goal of this project, named JAPHAR (Joint Airbreathing Propulsion for Hypersonic Application Research), is to demonstrate the feasibility of the dual mode ramjet and to develop a methodology for on-ground and in-flight performance demonstration. Concurrently with engine studies, the project includes <b>conceptional</b> design <b>studies</b> to define an experimental vehicle for dual mode ramjet testing between Mach 4 and Mach 8 and to find a methodology to evaluate its in-flight performances. Furthermore, this vehicle is the leading configuration for the different component studies within the project and it is used for the global synthesis of the obtained results. In {{order to be able to}} obtain results at different Mach numbers between Mach 4 and 8, even if the scramjet thrust should be lower than expected, the vehicle is boosted up to Ma*= 8 and then performs a few combustion periods on a decelerating trajectory. In order to be representative for a full scale scramjet operation, the engine height was chosen equal to 100 mm. This results in a global vehicle length of 11. 5 m and a weight of about 2 tons. The vehicle is not reusable. During the first design cycle ONERA provided a first definition of the vehicle engine and the associated propulsion dataset. Using this engine ONERA studied a preliminary definition of a vehicle based on the wing-body concept (Fig. 1). Based on the given propulsion geometry DLR additionally defined a waverider configuration (Fig. 2). Using the experiences of former waverider studies (2), (3) which showed that waveriders are excellent designs for TSTO missions the aim is to reduce the required thrust for a horizontal flight at M*= 8. In order to choose the best solution for the project continuation both configurations were compared in detail. Trajectories were defined to compare the global performances. The goal was to obtain significant acceleration to demonstrate the dual mode ramjet thrust and the positive vehicle propulsion balance. The comparison of both vehicles included aerodynamic performances, weight estimations, vehicle global and structural design and trim calculations along the considered trajectories. Based on Navier-Stokes calculations special attention was paid to the flowfield at the entrance of the air intake. The proposed paper will present the details of this comparison...|$|R
