5|$|The Morris Academy is {{entitled}} {{to be called a}} pioneer institution because of its 'open door' policy in <b>coeducation.</b> It was not the first in the United States, not even in Connecticut, but none of the other early academies opened their doors as wide and kept them open as long. No other coeducational academy spread its influence so far.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the student}} press have contributed to activist causes on several notable occasions. At the height of debate on <b>coeducation</b> in 1880, The Varsity {{published}} an article in its inaugural issue voicing in favour of admitting women. In 1895, the university suspended the editor of The Varsity for breach of collegiality, after he published a letter that harshly criticized the provincial government's dismissal of a professor and involvement in academic affairs. University College students then approved a motion by Varsity staff member and future Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and boycotted lectures for a week. After Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau decriminalized homosexuality throughout Canada in 1969, a medical research assistant placed an advertisement in The Varsity seeking volunteers to establish the first university homophile association in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in late 2004 {{the debate}} {{concerning}} <b>coeducation</b> resurfaced when, citing decreased enrollment, Wells College {{announced that it}} would adopt <b>coeducation.</b> In response, there were student protests on campus. Parents of students also became involved in the protests, as did many alumnae. Some of the students stated that their protests were patterned after those at Mills College in the early 1990s. A website called Wells for Women was also established. When the decision to adopt <b>coeducation</b> was approved, students filed a lawsuit that was eventually rejected. Wells became coeducational in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Atatürk was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of <b>coeducation</b> and the education of girls. <b>Coeducation</b> was established as the norm throughout the educational system by 1927. Centuries of sex segregation under Ottoman rule had denied girls equal education, Atatürk thus opposed segregated education as a matter of principle. The matter of <b>coeducation</b> was first raised {{as a result of a}} controversy in Tekirdağ in 1924, where, due to the lack of a high school for girls, girls requested enrollment in the high school for boys. Upon this, works on <b>coeducation</b> began and the Minister of Education declared that both sexes would follow the same curriculum. In August 1924, it was decided that <b>coeducation</b> would be introduced to primary education, giving boys the right to enroll in girls' high schools and vice versa. Atatürk declared in his Kastamonu speech in 1925 that <b>coeducation</b> should be the norm. Whilst the educational committee had agreed in 1926 to abolish single-sex education in middle schools that were not boarding schools, segregation persisted in middle and high schools, and statistics in the 1927–28 educational year revealed that only 29% of those enrolled in primary schools were girls. This figure was 18.9% for middle schools and 28% for high schools. Acting on these figures, 70 single-sex middle schools were converted to coeducational schools in 1927–28 and new coeducational middle schools were established. This was despite the opposition of Köprülüzade Fuat Bey, the Undersecretary for Education. Whilst the policy was transition to coeducational high schools based on the success in middle schools from 1928–29 onwards this policy could only be implemented effectively from 1934–35 onwards.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Yale began {{discussions with}} its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster <b>coeducation</b> at the {{undergraduate}} level. Vassar, then all-female {{and part of}} the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when the Ivy League still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced <b>coeducation</b> independently in 1969. Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate; she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year; at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall {{at the south end of}} Old Campus.|$|E
25|$|The {{trend toward}} <b>coeducation</b> {{continued}} in the 21st century. Notre Dame College in Ohio admitted its first men in 2001.

25|$|A few {{historically}} black women's colleges became coeducational: Barber-Scotia College adopted <b>coeducation</b> in 1954; Tillotson College (a women's college from 1926 to 1935) is now coeducational Huston-Tillotson University; Hartshorn Memorial College merged with Virginia Union University in 1932; and Mary Allen Seminary became coeducational in 1933. Bennett College, founded as a coeducational school, became a women's college in 1926.|$|E
25|$|A {{few other}} colleges became coeducational in this period. Immaculata University and Lesley College also {{announced}} that they would adopt <b>coeducation</b> around this time and became coeducational in 2005. In 2006, H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College was dissolved {{as part of the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina (it is now a part of Tulane University). In 2007, Douglass College of Rutgers University merged with the coed Rutgers College, changing its name to the Douglass Residential College. While a part of Rutgers, it will offer dormitories and classes exclusively for women. Regis College became coeducational in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Vassar adopted <b>coeducation</b> in 1969. However, {{immediately}} following World War II, Vassar accepted {{a very small}} number of male students on the G.I. Bill. Because Vassar's charter prohibited male matriculants, the graduates were given diplomas via the University of the State of New York. These were reissued under the Vassar title after the school formally became co-educational. The formal decision to become co-ed came after its trustees declined an offer to merge with Yale University, its sibling institution, in the wave of mergers between the historically all-male colleges of the Ivy League and their Seven Sisters counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Originally named Valparaiso Male and Female College, Valparaiso University {{was founded}} in 1859 {{as one of the}} first <b>coeducation</b> colleges in the United States. Due to reverses brought about by the Civil War, the college was forced to close its doors in 1871. Two years later it was revived by {{educator}} Henry Baker Brown and named Northern Indiana Normal School and Business Institute. At the turn of the 20th century, Brown changed the college's name to Valparaiso College, and shortly after it was rechartered as Valparaiso University. Initially founded by Methodists, in 1925 the school was purchased by the Lutheran University Association, which continues to operate it today.|$|E
25|$|Thirty years later, the 1960s {{ushered in}} a {{turbulent}} period for St. Paul's. In 1968, students wrote an acerbic manifesto describing the school administration as an oppressive regime. As {{a result of this}} manifesto, seated meals were reduced from three times a day to four times a week, courses were shortened to be terms (rather than years) long, Chapel was reduced to four times a week, and the school's grading system was changed to eliminate + and- grades and given its current High Honors, Honors, High Pass, Pass, and Unsatisfactory labels instead of A–F. By the end of the sixties, St. Paul's had begun to admit sizable numbers of minorities in every class, had secularized its previously strict religious schedule considerably, expanded its course offerings, and was poised to begin <b>coeducation.</b> It admitted girls {{for the first time in}} 1971.|$|E
25|$|Academic hoods in the United States are {{traditionally}} lined {{with the official}} colors of the school, in theory so watchers can tell where the hood wearer earned his or her degree. Amherst's hoods are purple (Williams' official color) with a white stripe or chevron, said to signify that Amherst was born of Williams. Amherst records {{one of the first}} uses of Latin honors of any American college, dating back to 1881. The college was an all-male school until the late 1960s, when a few female students from nearby schools in the Five-College Consortium attended on an experimental basis. In October 1974, the faculty voted in favor of <b>coeducation</b> and in November 1974 the board of trustees voted to admit female students starting in the 1975-1976 school year. In 1975, nine women who were already attending classes as part of an inter-college exchange program were admitted as transfer students. In June 1976, they became the first female graduates of the college.|$|E
25|$|Bedouin girls face {{additional}} {{obstacles to}} their education. Among {{the biggest problems}} {{is the nature of}} the schools. Most Bedouin schools are co-ed, meaning that boys and girls study together. For many families (especially the more traditional ones), this is unacceptable, particularly because of the presence of boys from other tribes. The drop out rate for Bedouin girls is much higher than that of Bedouin boys (85% vs. 71%, respectively). The fact that boys and girls study together is arguably a driving force behind this incredibly high rate. A study conducted by Abu-Rabia-Queder found that the most important factor in whether girls remained in schools was the decision of her father. In other words, if the girl’s father did not agree with her education, there was little chance of her remaining in school. Generally, men who were themselves educated and/or employed were much more likely to support their daughters' educations. However, of the fathers surveyed by the study, none approved of <b>coeducation.</b> Those who disapproved most strongly were more likely to pull their daughters out of school, even if they recognized the benefits education could bring for their daughters.|$|E
25|$|The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), {{adopted in}} 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from {{discrimination}} and equality under the law. CEDAW has realized {{the rights and}} equality of woman is also {{the key to the}} survival and development of children and to building healthy families, communities and nations. Article 10 pinpoints nine changes that must be changed in order to help Nigerian women and other women suffering from gender disparity. It first states, their must be the same conditions for careers, vocational guidance, and for the achievement of diplomas in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as in urban areas. This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training. Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality. Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by <b>coeducation</b> and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programs of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programs, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programs for girls and women who have left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure {{the health and well-being of}} families, including information and advice on family planning.|$|E

Rather than merge Briarcliff with Pace, the trustees attempted to reach a collaboration agreement with Bennett College, a junior women's college in nearby Millbrook which was also struggling with low enrollment. The plan did not work, however, and Briarcliff College was sold to Pace in April 1977 for $5.2 million ($ in [...] ) after both Briarcliff and Bennett entered bankruptcy.|$|E

500|$|<b>Coeducation</b> at Syracuse traced {{its roots}} {{to the early}} days of Genesee College where {{educators}} and students like Frances Willard and Belva Lockwood were heavily influenced by the Women's movement in nearby Seneca Falls, NY. However, the progressive [...] "co-ed" [...] policies practiced at Genesee would soon find controversy at the new university in Syracuse. Colleges and universities admitted few women students in the 1870s. Administrators and faculty argued women had inferior minds and could not master mathematics and the classics. Dr. Erastus Otis Haven, Syracuse University chancellor and former president of the University of Michigan and Northwestern University, maintained that women should receive the advantages of higher education. He enrolled his daughter, Frances, at Syracuse where she joined the other newly admitted female students in founding the Gamma Phi Beta sorority. The inclusion of women in {{the early days of}} the university led to the proliferation of various women's clubs and societies.

500|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, College administrators {{introduced}} {{new initiatives}} {{to hold the}} Greek organizations on campus more accountable for their actions and to offer more social alternatives to the predominantly single-sex Greek system. [...] In 1982, the administration announced that Greek organizations would have {{to comply with a}} set of [...] "minimum standards", enforced through annual reviews, in order to remain in good standing with the college. [...] These standards included not only health and safety regulations regarding the conditions of the Greek houses, but requirements for Greek-sponsored activities deemed beneficial to the college community at large. [...] The College introduced Undergraduate Societies to campus in 1993, as a residential and social alternative to Greek organizations. [...] Similar to the Greek houses in many respects, Undergraduate Societies were required to have open, coeducational membership policies. [...] Panarchy voted to change its status to an undergraduate society and was joined the following year by a newly formed society, called Amarna. [...] In the fall of 1993, Student Assembly President Andrew Beebe, class of 1993, argued in favor of the <b>coeducation</b> of the entire Greek system in his remarks at fall Convocation.

500|$|<b>Coeducation</b> would {{dramatically}} {{change all}} social life at Dartmouth College, including the fraternity system. [...] The college first began admitting women as full-time students in 1972. [...] By {{the fall of}} 1973, five local fraternities (Alpha Theta, Foley House, The Tabard, Phi Tau, and Phi Sigma Psi) had all decided to adopt a coeducational membership policy and admit women as full members. [...] The first sorority on campus, Sigma Kappa, was founded in 1977. [...] Many alumni expressed strong concerns {{that the need for}} housing for new sororities would inevitably lead to financial pressure and the possible dissolution of existing fraternities at the college. [...] In response, the Trustees imposed a moratorium limiting the campus to no more than six recognized sororities. Converting from an all-male to a coeducational membership policy was not enough to save at least one Greek organization on campus. [...] In 1981, the Harold Parmington Foundation reorganized itself as a new coeducational fraternity Delta Psi Delta, but the organization never attracted many new members and was finally forced to dissolve in the spring of 1991. [...] In addition, Foley House disassociated from the Greek system in fall 1984, transitioning into an affinity house as part of the college's residential living programs. [...] It moved off Webster Avenue to a new location on West Street (where it is still in operation [...] ).|$|E
500|$|Early in {{the history}} of the university, female {{students}} were separated from male students in many ways. [...] For example, they had a separate entrance and lounges in Willard Straight Hall, a separate student government, and a separate page (edited by women) in the Cornell Daily Sun. [...] The male students were required to take [...] "drill" [...] (a precursor to ROTC), but the women were exempt. One account of the history of <b>coeducation</b> at Cornell claims that in the very beginning, [...] "ale students were almost unanimously opposed to co-education, and vigorously protested the arrival of a group of 16 women, who promptly formed a women's club with a broom for their standard, and 'In hoc signo vinces' as their motto." [...] In the 1870s and 1880s, female Cornell students on campus were generally ignored by male students. [...] Women did not have a formal role in the annual commencement ceremony until 1935, when the student government selected a woman to be Class Poet. In 1936, the Willard Straight Hall Board of Managers voted to allow women to eat in its cafeteria. Until the 1970s, male students resided in west campus dormitories while women were housed in the north campus. [...] As of 2010, the only remaining women's dormitory is Balch Hall, due to a restriction in the gift that funded it. Lyon Hall (which for most of its history was a men-only dormitory), also currently disallows male residents on its lower floors. All other dormitories were converted to co-educational housing in the late 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|With several Supreme Court {{cases in}} the 1950s on the appellate court level {{determining}} that public single-sex universities violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, many women's colleges have decided to accept males. Two of the Seven Sister colleges made transitions {{during and after the}} 1960s. The first, Radcliffe College, merged with Harvard University. Beginning in 1963, students at Radcliffe received Harvard diplomas signed by the presidents of Radcliffe and Harvard and joint commencement exercises began in 1970. The same year, several Harvard and Radcliffe dormitories began swapping students experimentally and in 1972 full co-residence was instituted. The departments of athletics of both schools merged shortly thereafter. In 1977, Harvard and Radcliffe signed an agreement that put undergraduate women entirely in Harvard College. In 1999 Radcliffe College was dissolved and Harvard University assumed full responsibility over the affairs of female undergraduates. Radcliffe is now the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Women's Studies at Harvard University. The second, Vassar College, declined an offer to merge with Yale University and instead became coeducational in 1969. The remaining Seven Sisters decided against <b>coeducation.</b> Mount Holyoke College engaged in a lengthy debate under the presidency of David Truman over the issue of <b>coeducation.</b> On November 6, 1971, [...] "after reviewing an exhaustive study on <b>coeducation,</b> the board of trustees decided unanimously that Mount Holyoke should remain a women's college, and a group of faculty was charged with recommending curricular changes that would support the decision." [...] Smith College also made a similar decision in 1971. In 1969, Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College (then all-male) developed a system of sharing residential colleges. When Haverford became coeducational in 1980, Bryn Mawr discussed the possibly of <b>coeducation</b> as well, but decided against it. In 1983, Columbia University began admitting women after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College for a merger along the lines of Harvard and Radcliffe (Barnard has been affiliated with Columbia since 1900, but it continues to be independently governed). Wellesley College also decided against <b>coeducation</b> during this time.|$|E
