5|$|During the Ice Age a vast, {{cold and}} dry mammoth steppe {{stretched}} from the Arctic islands southwards to China, and from Spain eastwards across Eurasia {{and over the}} Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon, where it was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. The land bridge existed because sea levels were lower due to more of the planet's water being locked up in glaciers compared with today. Therefore, {{the flora and fauna}} of Beringia were more related to those of Eurasia rather than to those of North America. In eastern Beringia from 35,000 YBP the northern Arctic areas experienced temperatures 1.5°C (2.7°F) warmer than today, but the southern sub-Arctic regions were 2°C (3.5°F) <b>cooler.</b> <b>In</b> 22,000YBP, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the average summer temperature was 3-5°C (5.4-9°F) cooler than today, with variations of 2.9°C (5.2°F) cooler on the Seward Peninsula to 7.5°C (13.5°F) <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> the Yukon.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{are most}} likely in the spring. Major tornado {{outbreaks}} affected parts of eastern North Carolina on March 28, 1984, and April 16, 2011. The month of May experiences the greatest rise in temperatures. During the spring, there are warm days and cool nights in the Piedmont. Temperatures are somewhat <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> the mountains and warmer, particularly at night, near the coast. North Carolina's humidity is lowest in the spring.|$|E
5|$|The {{homes were}} reached through tunnels. Other {{examples}} of subterranean, semi-subterranean or cliff-based dwellings in both {{hot and cold}} climates are found in Turkey, northern China and the Himalayas, and the southwest USA. A number of Buddhist monasteries built from earth and other materials into cliff sides or caves in Himalayan areas such as Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and northern India are often perilously placed. Starting in the 1970s, interest in the technique has revived in developed countries. By setting an earth house into the ground, {{the house will be}} <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> the warm season and warmer in the cool season.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of Herr and Mohl[1] {{is used as}} a basis for a discussion of bunched beam <b>cooling</b> <b>in</b> the Fermilab recycler and the Tevatron.

5|$|Minnesota has a {{continental}} climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Minnesota's {{location in the}} Upper Midwest allows it to experience some of the widest variety of weather in the United States, {{with each of the}} four seasons having its own distinct characteristics. The areas near Lake Superior in the Minnesota Arrowhead region experience weather unique {{from the rest of the}} state. The moderating effect of Lake Superior keeps the surrounding area relatively <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> the summer and relatively warmer in the winter, giving that region a smaller yearly temperature range. On the Köppen climate classification, much of the southern third of Minnesota—roughly from the Twin Cities region southward—falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa), and the northern two-thirds of Minnesota falls in the warm summer great continental climate zone (Dfb).|$|E
5|$|The East Riding {{generally}} has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary {{from day to}} day as well as from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter, anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought, particularly on the Wolds. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. The temperature is usually lower at night, and January is the coldest time of the year. The two dominant influences on the climate of the area are the shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the Pennines and the proximity of the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|The ancestral origins {{for this}} species stem from eastern North America, where species {{richness}} of ambystomatids are highest. The following biogeographic interpretation on {{the origins of}} A.macrodactylum into western North America is based on a descriptive account of fossils, genetics, and biogeography. The long-toed salamander's closest living sister species is A.laterale, a native to northeastern North America. Ambystomatidae was isolated to the southeast of the mid-Continental or Western Interior Seaway during the Cretaceous (~145.5–66 Ma). While three other species of the Ambystomatidae (A.tigrinum, A.californiense, and A.gracile) have overlapping ranges in western North America, the long-toed salamander's closest living sister species is A.laterale, a native to northeastern North America. It has been suggested that A.macrodactylum speciated from A.laterale after the Paleocene (~66–55.8 Ma) with the loss of the Western Interior Seaway opening an access route for a common ancestor into the Western Cordillera. Once situated in the montane regions of western North America, species had to contend with a dynamic spatial and compositional ecology responding to the changes in altitude, as mountains grew and the climate changed. For example, the Pacific Northwest became <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> the Paleocene, paving the way for temperate forest to replace the warmer tropical forest of the Cretaceous. A scenario for the splitting of A.macrodacylum and other western temperate species from their eastern counterparts involves Rocky Mountain uplift in the late Oligocene into the Miocene. The orogeny created a climatic barrier by removing moisture from the westerly air stream and dried the midcontinental area, from southern Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} {{annealing}} process, the metal {{is left in}} the oven at 700 °C (or 1,300 °F) for 2 hours then slowly <b>cooled</b> <b>in</b> lime powder. The metal is hammered out and machined {{in the shape of}} screw. Then the screw is put in the quench hardening process, kept at 850 °C (or 1,560 °F) for 1.5 hours, and is <b>cooled</b> <b>in</b> oil. In the last thermal normalizing process, the screw is put in 180 °C (or 356 °F) hot oil for 2 hours, then is left <b>cooling</b> <b>in</b> the air.|$|R

25|$|Although Thompson {{acknowledges}} {{similarities between}} African and European <b>cool</b> <b>in</b> shared notions of self-control and imperturbability, {{he finds the}} cultural value of <b>cool</b> <b>in</b> Africa which influenced the African diaspora {{to be different from}} that held by Europeans, who use the term primarily as the ability to remain calm under stress.

While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge lake freighters use the city's Lake Calumet Harbor on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect, moderating Chicago's climate; making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> summer.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} this vast region varies {{considerably}} from area to area from tropical monsoon {{in the south}} to temperate in the north. The variety is influenced by not only the altitude, but also by factors such as proximity to the sea coast and the seasonal impact of the monsoons. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon periods. The northern belt of Indo-Gangetic plains also is hot in summer, but <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalayan ranges.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} each store had the {{following}} departments: dairy, bacon and hams, poultry and game, cooked meats, and fresh meats. Groceries {{were introduced in}} 1903, when John James purchased a grocer's branch at 12 Kingsland High Street, Dalston. Home delivery featured in every store, as there were fewer cars in those days. Sites were carefully chosen, with a central position in a parade selected in preference to a corner shop. This allowed a larger display of products, which could be kept <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> summer, which was important as there was no refrigeration.|$|E
25|$|Common {{ostriches}} are homeothermic endotherms; they regulate {{a constant}} body temperature via regulating their metabolic heat rate. They closely regulate their core body temperature, but their appendages may be <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> comparison as found with regulating species. The temperature of their beak, neck surfaces, lower legs, feet and toes are regulated through heat exchange with the environment. Up to 40% of their produced metabolic heat is dissipated across these structures, {{which account for}} about 12% of their total surface area. Total evaporative water loss (TEWL) is statistically lower in the common ostrich than in membering ratites.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} United Kingdom, the Vale of Pickering {{generally}} has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary {{from day to day}} as well as from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the northern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone {{but the reason}} for that is a little harder to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable <b>cooler</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E
25|$|As part of Great Britain, the Vale of York {{generally}} has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary {{from day to}} day as well as from season to season.

The temperature is usually lower at night and January is the coldest time of the year. The vale is in the rain shadow of the Pennines so has a lower rainfall total than areas to the west. It is also subject to more fog and frosts in winter than other areas because of the tendency of cold air to drain into the vale from surrounding higher ground.|$|E
