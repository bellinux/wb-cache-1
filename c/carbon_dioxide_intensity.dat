40|$|It is {{exclusively}} the new Federal {{countries which}} {{contributed to the}} reduction in CO 2 emissions in Germany between 1990 and 1995. As the cross-sector and sector specific analyses have shown, however, this is attributable {{not only to the}} drastic economic downturn which occurred in that region. It should be noted, rather, that contributing factors not only include the lasting changes in fuel structure which were effected in Eastern Germany in favour of fuels which are less emission-intensive, but, above all, the reduction in energy intensity in nearly all relevant sectors. This means that energy use in the new Federal countries has already become considerably more rational {{in the course of the}} 1990 s to date. Nonetheless, it cannot be overlooked that Eastern Germany still lags behind Western Germany in this area: For example, in 1995 overall economic energy intensity was nearly 80 percent greater in the new Federal countries than in the old Federal countries, overall economic <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>intensity</b> was even 140 percent higher.

Historically, energy intensity has declined, although more recently energy intensity seems to have stabilized with the gains. Coal and coke are currently the primary fuels for the sector, supplanting the dominance of natural gas in the 1970 s. A variety of waste fuels, including tires, steadily increase their share in fuel use. Between 1970 and 2010, primary physical energy intensity for cement production dropped 1. 2 % per year from 7. 3 MBtu/short ton to 4. 5 MBtu/short ton. <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>intensity</b> due to fuel consumption and raw material calcination dropped 24 %, from 610 lb C/ton of cement (0. 31 tC/tonne) to 469 lb C/ton cement (0. 23 tC/tonne). Despite the historic progress, there is ample room for energy efficiency improvement. The share of wet-process plants decreased from 60 % in 1970 to about 7 % of clinker production in 2010 in the U. S. The remaining plants suggest the existence of a considerable potential, when compared to other industrialized countries. We examined over 50 energy-efficient technologies and measures and estimated energy savings, carbon dioxide emission savings, investment costs, and operation and maintenance costs for each of the measures.

40|$|Emissions trading {{programmes}} {{have grown}} in number and scope over the last forty years, {{and in the last}} decade they have become a centrepiece of global climate change policy. Emissions trading can in principle offer policy makers a flexible mechanism to reduce harmful emissions - polluters can choose their own emissions abatement strategy, and the trading mechanism can reduce overall abatement cost by flexibly redistributing emissions permits to those polluters that find abatement costliest. In the context of climate policy, though, it is the potential to stimulate innovation and technological change that is most alluring. Without transforming production, the quantity of emissions abatement will be insufficient; without technological change, the cost will be prohibitive. Emissions trading programmes are clearly not the only policy that affect technological change, but {{the extent to which these}} programmes encourage low-carbon technological change is perhaps still the most important criterion on which to judge their success or failure. Advances in monitoring, greater data availability, and improvements in statistical and computational techniques have only recently made it possible to systematically study the impacts of emissions trading on a large scale. In recent years, researchers have studied the impact of emissions trading programmes on company profitability, on employment, and on capital investment. This thesis aims to advance this research programme by contributing a systematic analysis of how emissions trading affects technological change. This thesis comprises four essays. The first essay examines past emissions trading programmes and the extent to which these experiences provide guidance on the ability of emissions trading programmes to affect low-carbon technological change in the future.

40|$|Fuel supply {{issues are}} a major concern in remote island {{communities}} {{and this is an}} engineering field that needs to be analyzed in detail for transition to sustainable energy systems. Power generation in remote communities such as the islands of the Maldives relies on power generation systems primarily dependent on diesel generators. As a consequence, power generation is easily disrupted by factors such as the delay in transportation of diesel or rises in fuel price, which limits shipment quantity. People living in remote communities experience power outages often, but find them just as disruptive as people who are connected to national power grids. The use of renewable energy sources could help to improve this situation, however, such systems require huge initial investments. Remote power systems often operate with the help of financial support from profit-making private agencies and government funding. Therefore, investing in such hybrid systems is uncommon. Current electrical power generation systems operating in remote communities adopt an open loop control system, where the power supplier generates power according to customer demand. In the event of generation constraints, the supplier {{has no choice but to}} limit the power supplied and this often results in power cuts. Most smart grids that are being established in developed grids adopt a closed loop feedback control system. The smart grids integrated with demand side management tools enable the power supplier to keep customers informed about their daily energy consumption. Electric utility companies use different demand response techniques to achieve peak energy demand reduction by eliciting behavior change. Their feedback information is commonly based on factors such as cost of energy, environmental concerns (<b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>intensity)</b> and the risk of black-outs due to peak loads. However, there is no information available on the significant link between the constraints in resources and the feedback to the customers. In resource-constrained power grids such as those in remote areas, there is a critical relationship between customer demand and the availability of power generation resources. This thesis develops a feedback control strategy that can be adopted by the electrical power suppliers to manage a resource-constrained remote electric power grid such that the most essential load requirements of the customers are always met. The control design introduces a new concept of demand response called participatory demand response (PDR). PDR technique involves cooperative behavior of the entire community to achieve quality of life objectives. It proposes the idea that if customers understand the level of constraint faced by the supplier, they will voluntarily participate in managing their loads, rather than just responding to a rise in the cost of energy. Implementation of the PDR design in a mini-grid consists of four main steps. First, the end-use loads have to be characterized using energy audits, and then they have to be classified further into three different levels of essentiality. Second, the utility records have to be obtained and the hourly variation factors for the appliances have to be calculated. Third, the reference demand curves have to be generated. Finally, the operator control system has to be designed and applied to train the utility operators. A PDR case study was conducted in the Maldives, on the island of Fenfushi. The results show that a significant reduction in energy use was achieved by implementing the PDR design on the island. The overall results from five different constraint scenarios practiced on the island showed that during medium constrained situations, load reductions varied between 4. 5 kW (5. 8 %) and 7. 7 kW (11. 3 %). A reduction of as much as 10. 7 kW (15 %) was achieved from the community during a severely constrained situation...|$|E

5000|$|Relationship between {{atmospheric}} <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> {{levels and}} temperature change. The film asserts that <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> levels {{increase or decrease}} {{as a result of}} temperatures increasing or decreasing rather than temperatures following <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> levels, because as the global climate cools the Earth's oceans absorb <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> and as the climate warms the oceans release <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide.</b>|$|R
40|$|The oxygen {{production}} of a photosynthetic gas exchanger containing Chlorella pyrenoidosa (1 % packed cell volume) was measured when various concentrations of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> were present within the culture unit. The internal <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> concentrations were obtained by manipulating the entrance gas concentration and the flow rate. <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> percentages were monitored by means of electrodes placed directly in the nutrient medium. The concentration of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> in the nutrient medium which produced maximal photosynthesis was {{in the range of}} 1. 5 to 2. 5 % by volume. Results were unaffected by either the level of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> in the entrance gas or the rate of gas flow. Entrance gases containing 2 % <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> flowing at 320 ml/min, 3 % <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> at 135 ml/min, and 4 % <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> at 55 ml/min yielded optimal <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> concentrations in the particular unit studied. By using <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> electrodes implanted directly in the gas exchanger to optimize the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> concentration throughout the culture medium, {{it should be possible to}} design more efficient large-scale units...|$|R
