Housing supply {{is assumed to be}} price-elastic, in a way that can vary for each location and each dwelling type. Household housing demand is disaggregated on the basis of employment area, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> income and household size. The market equilibrium is characterized by a set of primal-dual conditions, then by a variational inequality whose continuity guarantees the existence of an equilibrium. In the monocentric case, the primal-dual conditions are the saddle point conditions of a constrained maximization program the concavity of which implies the uniqueness of the equilibrium. We propose a resolution algorithm that is derived from traffic assignment on a transportation network. Last, we explore the outcomes of the model in a demonstration application and analyze the sensitivity of the equilibrium to our supply and demand hypotheses...|$|E

The same tests on intra-industry ratios and total volumes {{that were used}} to demonstrate that a substantial part of trade is explained by factor proportions and income similarities rather than differences are applied to affiliate sales with surprisingly similar results. Some support for the factor proportions hypothesis is derived by comparing affiliate production destined for export to the parent's market, which is the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> most likely to be motivated by factor proportions considerations, with that destined for sale in the local market. Affiliate production destined for export home is moderately more responsive to factor proportions differences.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were systematically searched for studies up to May 2015. Reference lists of published articles were hand searched and study authors were contacted to provide additional data. Those in the lowest <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in each study were compared with all other participants to assess the association between physical activity and both early and late AMD using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine studies (subject age range 30 - 97 years) {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. Physical activity was found to have a protective association with both early AMD (8 studies, n = 38 112, odds ratio (OR) 0. 92, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 86 - 0. 98) and late AMD (7 studies, n = 28 854, OR 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 49 - 0. 72). CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity is associated with lower odds of early and late AMD in white populations. These findings have important implications, reinforcing the public health message of staying active throughout life. However, further longitudinal studies are required to confirm and further characterize a protective effect of physical activity on the onset and/or progression of AMD...|$|E
40|$|This {{population-based}} {{cross-sectional study}} describes social participation expressed as {{the accomplishment of}} social, cultural, and leisure activities resulting from informal support given by relatives or friends, formal support given by the municipality or county, {{or a combination of}} the two, among 452 individuals aged 60 - 93 years suffering from osteoporosis-related fractures. A fourth group of individuals with fractures without any support was used as a reference group. Fractures included were humeral, wrist, vertebral, hip, pelvic and ankle fractures. Questionnaires were used to collect sociodemographic data and information on social participation, social support, and covariates. The results showed that a smaller proportion of those with only formal support took part in social, cultural, or leisure activities, compared to participants with informal support alone, both informal and formal support or those without any kind of support. The associations between categories of activity and kind of support were further tested in a logistic regression model adjusting for possible confounders. Odds ratios (ORs) for taking part in social, cultural, and leisure activities were significantly lower for participants with formal support and a combination of informal and formal support, while participants receiving informal support did not show a significantly reduced OR for taking part in any <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> compared to the reference group. In conclusion; informal support of older people with fractures is an important means of facilitating social participation and an active lifestyle.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{consequences}} of aging and the wellbeing of deaf sign language users. This thesis contributes to filling this knowledge gap. The overarching aim was to gain further understanding and to increase the knowledge about quality of life, in terms of subjective wellbeing and health, activity and social contacts, among older deaf sign language users. After having established the prevalence (0. 7 per thousand) of deaf sign language users living in a defined geographical district (Scania, Sweden), it targeted those deaf sign language users that were 65 years or older. The data collection was based on a combination of interviews in sign language - a unique feature of this thesis - with 45 deaf sign language users and established assessment instruments. This sample reported high levels of subjective wellbeing despite many ill-health symptoms and functional limitations. Furthermore, this sample reported more depressive and tension symptoms and was more dependent in daily activities than older hearing people, at the same time as they reported higher values on perceived health. Within the sample, there was a negative relationship between ill-health and productive activities, but a positive one between leisure activities and subjective wellbeing. Social activities at the deaf club were the sole <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> that was related to subjective wellbeing. The results of this thesis point to the importance for older deaf sign language users' wellbeing of being able to relate to the deaf community and a sign-language-speaking environment. Such an interpretation has implications for health care providers and for occupational therapy practice. According to this view, older deaf sign language users should, if such measures are needed, reside together and encounter personnel with sign-language-speaking competence...|$|E
40|$|A {{sedentary}} lifestyle, obesity, and a Westernized diet {{have been}} implicated in the aetiology of both colorectal cancer and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, leading to the hypothesis that hyperinsulinaemia may promote colorectal cancer. We prospectively examined the association between colorectal cancer risk and factors related to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, including BMI, physical activity, diabetes mellitus, and blood glucose, in a cohort of 75   219 Norwegian men and women. Information on incident cases of colorectal cancer was made available from the Norwegian Cancer Registry. Reported P values are two-sided. During 12 years of follow up, 730 cases of colorectal cancer were registered. In men, but not in women, we found a negative association with leisure-time physical activity (P for trend = 0. 002), with an age-adjusted RR for the highest versus the lowest <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> of 0. 54 (95 % CI = 0. 37 – 0. 79). Women, but not men, {{with a history of}} diabetes were at increased risk of colorectal cancer (age-adjusted RR = 1. 55; 95 % CI = 1. 04 – 2. 31), as were women with non-fasting blood glucose ≥ 8. 0 mmol l− 1 (age-adjusted RR = 1. 98; 95 % CI = 1. 31 – 2. 98) compared with glucose < 8. 0 mmol l− 1. Overall, we found no association between BMI and risk of colorectal cancer. Additional adjustment including each of the main variables, marital status, and educational attainment did not materially change the results. We conclude that the inverse association between leisure-time physical activity and colorectal cancer in men, and the positive association between diabetes, blood glucose, and colorectal cancer in women, at least in part, support the hypothesis that insulin may act as a tumour promoter in colorectal carcinogenesis. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to observe, identify, and describe, in a {{systematic}} fashion, the pattern of activities which comprise the daily work of selected regional high school principals in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Four principals were observed for a total period of 16 days. The primary method used to collect data was direct, non-participant observation. A pilot study provided an opportunity to use the observational and recording techniques, and to make adjustments where necessary. – Data were collected on the ongoing sequence of activities for each principal. Composite scores were developed to show the proportion of total working time devoted to each category of in-school activity. Descriptive and analytical information concerning each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> medium used, initiator, and location are also included. – The findings from the study indicated that the principal deals with a large number and variety of issues and problems each day, each of short duration. His administrative behavior is not always planned and organized; rather, it is frequently interrupted, and as a result, his work tends to be characterized by abruptness and discontinuity. The multiplicity of demands on the principal’s time by teachers, students, parents, and other formal/informal interest groups are generally concerns requiring his immediate attention. The principal, therefore, has little time during the school day for long-term planning and contemplating decisions. – One of the main pressures of the principal’s job is that of planning and organizing his time. It is through the organization of his lower-level management and maintenance functions, efficiently handle the critical functions, and thus, have more time available for professionally-oriented functions. – Findings of this study have implications for pre-service and in-service programs offered by educational institutions and teaching groups for educational administrators. Implications also exist for replication of this study at other levels of educational administration...|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to examine the age and sex differences in friends 2 ̆ 7 activities and to examine how these activities were related to well-being. Seventy-four fourth graders, ninety-eight eighth graders and eighty twelfth graders completed a questionnaire about the frequency of, and satisfaction with, 20 activities with friends. Students also reported on their affect, life satisfaction, perceptions of competence, school adjustment and achievement, and friendship quality. The results of this study showed that participation in all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> varied dramatically with grade and by sex. However, participation in all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> with friends decreased by twelfth grade. Furthermore, boys more frequently participated in sports and entertainment activities with friends whereas girls more frequently participated in academic and socializing activities with friends. The results also established significant correlations between the specific <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> and measures <b>of</b> well-being. That is, although all categories were related to positive affect, not all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> were consistently related to the broad (e. g., life satisfaction) and specific (e. g., school adjustment) domains of well-being. Finally, although previous research suggested that moderate participation in sports activities would be related to higher well-being than either frequent or infrequent sports participation, strong evidence for this hypothesis was not found. These results are discussed in relation to changes in adolescents 2 ̆ 7 social networks from childhood to adolescence and changes in the nature <b>of</b> the specific <b>activities</b> themselves.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we will extend Smith's (1997) two-component aspect theory {{and develop a}} two-tiered model of {{situation}} aspect, in which situation aspect is modelled as verb classes at the lexical level and as situation types at the sentential level. Our two-tiered model of situation aspect was motivated by the deficiencies of Vendler (1967) and Smith (1997). Vendler (1967) proposes a four-fold division of verbs into states, activities, accomplishments and achievements. The Vendlerian taxonomy basically works at the lexical level (c. f. Verkuyl, 1993 : 33), though it also involves whole predicates rather than verbs alone. As such, Vendler has to put run and walk under the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and put run a mile and walk to school {{under the category of}} accomplishment, thus making the lexicon unnecessarily large. Smith (1997), on the other hand, focuses her aspectual classification directly on "idealised situations" at the sentential level. Smith (1997 : 54 - 55) also suggests a set of rules to govern the interaction between verbs and their arguments in the composition process of situation aspect. However, as she has not proposed an aspectual classification of verbs at the lexical level, these rules cannot be applied easily, if at all. The deficiencies inherent in Vendler (1967) and Smith (1997) explain the two-tiered approach taken to modelling situation aspect in this paper. The Vendlerian approach works well at the lexical level, but not at the sentential level. Conversely the approach of Smith works well at the sentential level but not at the lexical level. Our two-level approach to situation aspect seeks to bridge this gap, operating at both the lexical and the sentential levels. In our model, verbs are classified in neutral contexts (c. f. Lys and Mommer, 1986) based on a five-way classifier system which is composed of [+/-dynamic], [+/-durative], [+/-bounded], [+/-telic] and [+/-result]. Situation types are the composite result of the rule-based interaction between verb classes and their arguments/adjuncts at the lexical, core-sentence and full-sentence levels. The paper develops a more refined model of verbs and situation types, proposes a dozen of rules, which are tested using an English corpus and a Chinese corpus, and gives a detailed account of the individual roles played by verbs and arguments/adjuncts in the composition processes of situation types...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The thesis was {{concerned}} with differences in what individuals attend to {{as a function of}} domain knowledge. “Attention” in this thesis is premised on the construction of “meaning”: an active process driven by the quality of prior knowledge and underlying intention. It was argued, that observation of compositional behaviours (what the composer ‘does’), would be reflective of different qualities of internal decisions made as compositional goals are selected, implemented and evaluated. To access composer’s internal concerns, a unique multi-method design was developed. Concurrent verbal protocols made available current cognitive concerns in working memory while retrospective protocols were seen as accessing metacognitive dispositions and affective thoughts held in long-term memory. By triangulating videos and transcribed verbal protocols, seven categories of Attentional Foci were observed. The verbal categories were converted to step-graphs to visually represent the attentional processes of real-time composing. The resulting graphs provide two data sources – firstly, a measure of time devoted to each category before shifting to another <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> and secondly, the number of instances devoted to each category. Variations in Attentional Focus were argued to reflect different layers and qualities of intention. This in turn implied different qualities of knowledge use and strategic behaviours. Study 1 explored between group differences in the composing behaviours of five novice and two professional composers. Behaviours were coded and converted to step-graphs to give a profile of Attentional Focus for each composer. The graphs were grouped into three clusters. The graphs of Attentional Foci reflected differences along the novice-expert continuum. The professional composers shifted attention over all the categories, whereas the novice composer’s attention was limited to the central categories. Further analysis revealed differences in the underlying cognitive complexity driving the processing concerns of each group. Professional composers were able to draw on extensive prior knowledge and mindfully regulate the composing process. Novices with less developed schemas and regulated the composing task with less efficiency. Also noted were individual differences in patterns of Attentional Foci and individual differences in motivations of task engagement. Study 2 investigated individual differences within a common cohort of fourteen tertiary music students. Measures of individual differences of beliefs in control over task (Strategic Flexibility Questionnaire Cantwell & Moore, 1996); approach to task (Study Process Questionnaire Biggs, 1987) and beliefs in self-efficacy (developed by the author for this study) were linked to different patterns of Attentional Foci and in turn linked to quality of compositional outcome. Maladaptive dispositions were linked to central categories of Attentional Foci and low SOLO scores for their musical compositions. Adaptive dispositions were linked to a wider spread of Attentional Foci and high SOLO scores for their musical compositions. The implication of this thesis is that musical composition is conceptualised as much an intellectual process as a musical process. A metacognitive account of musical composition provides a necessary but not sufficient condition for an account of process in musical composition. The thesis implies that the process of musical composition is multi-dimensional. For example, even if there are special musical abilities that underpin the process of musical composition then how that ability is enacted can be explicated through metacognitive theory...|$|E
40|$|Background: Action {{plans are}} needed to promote health and to prevent {{diseases}} amongst older persons {{so that they can}} remain with good health in their homes for as long as possible. One method which has been tried in many countries is preventive home visits. In Sweden, the Executive Board of The County Council of Stockholm decided to implement such visits for 75 - year-old persons by the district nurse (DN). However there were questions about how to structure these preventive home visits so that they should benefit older persons’ health and health conditions. General aim: The general aims of this thesis were to describe 75 -year old person’s self-reported health and health conditions and to analyse the changes and effects on their health after a preventive home visit by the DN. Method: In study 1, the 75 -year-old person’s self-reported health conditions were described (n= 583). In study II, eight health care centres (HCCs) were randomized into a study group (SG) and eight HCCs were randomized into a control group (CG). The 75 -year-old persons who were registered at these HCCs, SG (n= 176) and CG (n= 262) filled in a questionnaire in 2006 and 2007. The SG received a preventive home visit by the DNs and the CG was treated as usual. The 75 -year-old person’s self-reported health conditions, knowledge about the county council and local community and use of medication were analysed. Result: Most 75 -year-old persons reported their health as good or very good, but they also reported health problems such as: pain, in sleeping, memory failure, fatigue, poor understanding of their own health and illnesses, elimination patterns, underweight and overweight. Those living alone, those with elementary school education and women reported worse health and well-being than other groups (study I). At follow-up both the SG and the CG reported a decrease in health and well-being and an increase in medication. However, within the SG, health and well-being were stable regarding pain, vertigo, fatigue and mobility compared with the CG. The SG also increased their knowledge regarding the local community and county council facilities. The CG reported significantly more health problems in the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in daily life. A majority, 84 %, of the 75 -year-old persons reported that the preventive home visit was useful (study II). Conclusion: The 75 -year-old persons experienced good or very good health and well-being {{at the same time as}} they self-reported many health problems. The study contributes to the knowledge about health issues that concern persons of this age group and what the DN should be aware of when performing preventive home visits. It also suggests how to educate DNs regarding such visits (study I). Preventive home visits following a predetermined structure might identify health problems (of which some of the 75 -year-old persons wanted help with), like ADL, pain, vertigo, fatigue, mobility as these health issues were stable in the SG compared to the CG. However it did not have any effect on health behaviour or reduced the use of medication but it increased knowledge about the services and resources offered by the local county council and local community. Both health promotion and disease prevention strategies are necessary when working with preventive home visits as many participants were healthy at the same time as they had many health problems. The preventive home visit was seen as useful by a majority of the 75 -year-old persons and made them feel secure (study II) ...|$|E
