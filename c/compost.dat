Experimental in-vessel biowaste <b>composts</b> were used to study the survival of seeded Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. Four organic waste mixtures, containing various proportions of paper and cardboard, fruits and vegetables, and green waste, were <b>composted</b> in laboratory reactors with forced aeration. The physicochemical and microbiological parameters were monitored for 12 weeks during <b>composting.</b> The survival of bacteria over a 3 -month period at 25 °C was assessed with samples collected after different experimental <b>composting</b> times. Strain survival was also monitored in mature sterilized <b>composts.</b> Nonsterile <b>composts</b> did not support pathogen growth, but survival of seeded pathogens was observed. Salmonella serovar Enteritidis survived in all <b>composts,</b> and longer survival (3 months) was observed in mature <b>composts</b> (8 and 12 weeks of <b>composting).</b> Mature biowaste <b>composts</b> may support long-term survival of Salmonella serovar Enteritidis during storage at room temperature. E. coli and L. monocytogenes survival was observed only in 4 -week-old <b>composts</b> and never in older <b>composts.</b> Proper <b>composting</b> may prevent long-term survival of E. coli and L. monocytogenes. These results suggest that like <b>composted</b> sewage sludge or manure, domestic waste <b>composts</b> may support pathogen survival.

40|$|Introduction: Food waste poses {{a threat}} to environmental, economic, and human health. <b>Composting</b> can reduce the threat, yet there is a dearth of {{research}} on household-level <b>composting</b> participation.

Self-reported weekly trash weights and <b>composting</b> attitudes were collected from 27 households who used three <b>composting</b> types over 14 weeks. Results: A mixed model ANOVA revealed a significant reduction in waste from baseline for all three <b>composting</b> types. Indoor and outdoor <b>composting</b> reduced waste more than off-site food scraps recycling.

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also <b>compost,</b> enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E

5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor natural enemies, a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. <b>Compost</b> piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|E
