5000|$|In the United States, {{there are}} {{actually}} several different rates charged to institutions borrowing at the Discount Window. In 2006, these were: the primary <b>credit</b> <b>rate</b> (the most common), the secondary <b>credit</b> <b>rate</b> (for banks that are less financially sound), and the seasonal <b>credit</b> <b>rate.</b> The Federal Reserve does not publish information regarding institutions' eligibility for primary or secondary credit. [...] Primary and secondary credit is normally offered on a secured overnight basis, while seasonal credit is extended up to nine months. The primary credit is normally set 100 basis points (or bp) above the federal funds target and the secondary <b>credit</b> <b>rate</b> is set 50 bp above the primary rate.

40|$|Background: No <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> {{methodology}} currently {{exists for}} any of South Africa’s sub nationals. Aim: To develop a generic, quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology for the Department of Health and the Department of Education combined, as well as specific quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies, for each department, individually. Setting: A comparison between generic and specific subnational <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies to assess which fits the South African subnational environment best. Studies and results obtained from other nations were used to construct the approach. Methods: In a typical <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology, both quantitative and qualitative information is considered. In South Africa (as a developing economy), the quantitative information equates to a smaller portion of the final <b>credit</b> <b>rating.</b> A generic quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology, as well as specific <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies, was developed. The appropriateness of these generic and specific models was tested with regards to prediction accuracies using Red, Amber or Green (RAG) statuses on a traffic light series. An illustration of the predicted versus actual ranks is provided, {{as well as an}} example to illustrate how model-predicted RAG statuses, based on quantitative information, may be overlaid with more recent qualitative information to derive a final ranking. Results: A generic, quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology for the Departments of Health and the Department of Education combined was developed, as well as specific <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies for each department separately. The specific subnational <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology outperformed the generic methodology considerably; more precisely, the generic models predicted a maximum of 50 % of the new cases correctly as opposed to the specific Health and Education models’ 78 %. Conclusion: The primary contribution {{of this study was to}} develop and compare generic and specific subnational <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies. A further contribution was to test the appropriateness of these models’ prediction accuracies using RAG statutes.

5000|$|On March 17, 2008, in {{response}} to the subprime mortgage crisis and the collapse of Bear Stearns, the Federal Reserve announced {{the creation of a new}} lending facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). Eligible borrowers include all financial institutions listed as primary dealers, and the term of the loan is a repurchase agreement, or [...] "repo" [...] loan, whereby the broker dealer sells a security in exchange for funds through the Fed's discount window. The security in question acts as collateral, and the Federal Reserve charges an interest rate equivalent to the Fed's primary <b>credit</b> <b>rate.</b> The facility was intended to improve the ability of broker dealers to access liquidity in the overnight loan market that banks use to meet their reserve requirements.|$|E
5000|$|The LIHTC {{provides}} {{funding for}} the development costs of low-income housing by allowing an investor (usually the partners of a partnership that owns the housing) to take a federal tax credit equal to a percentage (up to 70% or 30% of PV (Property Value) depending on the credit type) of the cost incurred for development of the low-income units in a rental housing project. Development capital is raised by [...] "syndicating" [...] the credit to an investor or, more commonly, a group of investors. To {{take advantage of the}} LIHTC, a developer will typically propose a project to a state agency, seek and win a competitive allocation of tax credits, complete the project, certify its cost, and rent-up the project to low income tenants. Simultaneously, an investor will be found that will make a [...] "capital contribution" [...] to the partnership or limited liability company that owns the project in exchange for being [...] "allocated" [...] the entity's LIHTCs over a ten-year period. The amount of the credit will be based on (i) the amount of credits awarded to the project in the competition, (ii) the actual cost of the project, (iii) the tax <b>credit</b> <b>rate</b> announced by the IRS, and (iv) the percentage of the project's units that are rented to low-income tenants. Failure to comply with the applicable rules, or a sale of the project or an ownership interest before the end of at least a 15-year period, can lead to recapture of credits previously taken, as well as the inability to take future credits. These rules are described in greater detail below.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "eligible basis" [...] of {{a project}} {{is the cost of}} {{acquiring}} an existing building if there is one (but not the cost of the land), plus construction and other construction-related costs to complete the project. (For example, the costs of obtaining permanent financing, or [...] "syndicating" [...] the credits to an investor are not included. Adjustments must be made for federal grants as well.). This is then multiplied by the percentage of the units that are [...] "low income", in accordance with the conditions described above, to determine the project's [...] "qualified basis" [...] that actually qualifies for the credit. For this reason, many developers agree to make 100% of the units low income in order to maximize the potential tax credits. Projects for (1) new construction and (2) the cost of rehabilitating an existing building, if not funded by tax-exempt bonds, can receive a maximum annual tax credit allocation based on a rate which is generally 9% of the project's eligible basis. The cost of acquiring an existing building (but not the land), and projects financed {{in whole or in part}} with tax-exempt bonds, are eligible for a credit of approximately 3% to 4% annually. The credit percentages are announced monthly by the Internal Revenue Service, but for buildings placed in service after July 30, 2008, the credit for new and rehabilitated buildings that are not financed with tax-exempt bonds is not less than 9%. Rules that provided a lower <b>credit</b> <b>rate</b> for [...] "below-market federal loans" [...] were repealed in 2008, applicable to buildings placed in service after July 30, 2008. Another rule that does not allow a credit for the acquisition cost of existing buildings, unless they were last placed in service more than ten years ago, no longer applies if the building was substantially financed pursuant to a large number of federal or state programs.|$|E
