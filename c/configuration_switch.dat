40|$|Thesis (MScEng) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{analysis}} and design of a broadband PIN diode switch. Pin diode switches are gaining popularity in RF and microwave applications today. This is due to their excellent switching and power handling capabilities, reliability, low cost and small size. An analysis and design procedure for broadband PIN diode switch design, using the series, shunt and compound topologies respectively, is presented. In order to do a proper switch design, accurate practical models for the components are required. Parameter extraction therefore formed an important consideration for this study. A parameter extraction procedure is presented, which enables the designer to very accurately extract the required models for the components in the environment they operate in. The designer can then do a proper design {{to ensure that the}} switch response when measured, closely corresponds to that simulated. A compound <b>configuration</b> <b>switch</b> was designed, built and measured to confirm the validity of the design procedure. The results illustrate that if the extracted models of the components are integrated into the design, the measured and simulated response compare remarkably well. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die doel van die tesis is die analise en ontwerp van 'n wyeband PIN diode skakelaar. PIN diode skakelaars is besig om meer populariteit te verwerf in hedendaagse RF en mikrogolf toepassings. Dit is as gevolg van die diode se goeie skakel- en drywing hantering vermoëns, betroubaarheid, lae koste en klein fisiese dimensies. 'n Analise en ontwerpsprosedure vir wye band PIN diode skakelaars in die serie, parallel en saamgestelde topologieë word getoon.

40|$|Hybrid {{simulation}} is {{an effective}} way of testing structures that combines {{the benefits of a}} computational analysis and experimental testing techniques. Innovative structures consists of state-ofthe-art components and assemblages whose function as a system needs to be tested experimentally. Often times, these components and assemblages push the controller and other testing equipment to its limits. Performing hybrid simulation with the controller in displacement control mode does not always suffice. Force control, switch control and mixed control methods in hybrid simulation are explored in order to overcome these limitations and provide robust ways of performing hybrid simulation. Force control hybrid simulation is a type of hybrid simulation where the control system is in force control mode. Switch control hybrid simulation is another type of hybrid simulation where the control system switches between displacement control and force control modes. Switch control hybrid simulation is applicable with setups that have only one control degree-of-freedom. Mixed control hybrid simulation is an extension of switch control hybrid simulation where multiple control degrees-of-freedom are switching between control modes independently of each other. Force control, switch control and mixed control hybrid simulation methods are developed, tested and verified. The motivation for the development of these methods is discussed. New methods are presented and explained. New OpenFresco classes and Simulink/Stateflow models are developed to implement these methods. Then these three alternative control methods are tested using the μ-NEES experimental setup at the nees@berkeley structural engineering lab using two different configurations. The first configuration is setup with one control degree-of-freedom which contains a relatively stiff specimen. The second configuration extends the first one with two control degrees-of-freedom. The performance of various time integration schemes with these methods are studied. These tests verify and validate the three alternative control methods as well as the new OpenFresco classes and Simulink/Stateflow models. The test results are evaluated to assess the performance of each control method by comparing them first to the numerical results, then to the displacement control results and finally to each other. The force control methods, in general, provides better results than the displacement control method for the second μ-NEES <b>configuration.</b> <b>Switch</b> control hybrid simulation methods provide better results than their force control counterpart for the one degree-of-freedom configuration but not better than the displacement control results. Mixed control hybrid simulation methods do not provide better results than the force control methods because of the interaction between the two actuator control modes. This dissertation concludes with a presentation on the direction of future research. Further validation of these methods is required with a very stiff experimental setup and an in-depth error analysis. New parameters for switching need to be explored. Continual development of mixed control methods is suggested. Simulink/Stateflow models using high order polynomials should be tested. Explicit and predictor-corrector time integration schemes should be implemented for the equilibrium force control method...|$|E

In addition, loadings placed {{at the corners of}} outer ring elements, forming a fan-like shape, with additional switches are shown to offer rather fine-tuning capability. A dual-layer FSS is also introduced to demonstrate a filter response over a larger frequency band, and also offers tunable dualband operation via switching. By using complementary SRR elements, a tunable band-pass response instead can be obtained using a similar <b>switching</b> <b>configuration.</b> Practical <b>switch</b> modeling is also examined in the paper along with the scanning performance of the SRR-FSS.
