Philosophers who strongly insist that morality must leave room for partiality have not made explicit their basis for this conclusion; the present paper comparatively assesses a variety of possible argument strategies which could be deployed in this regard. One promising strategy exploits the acknowledged force of the argument from “the personal point of view,” here interpreted as referring specifically to an agent’s projects. If moral demands must be tempered {{in light of the}} special significance to an agent of his own projects, then perhaps the agent’s partial attachments to other people should also receive a measure of protection from impartial moral claims. The case is bolstered by noting the ubiquity of plural or collective agency in contexts of close personal relations: often the two (or more) agents in such relationships together pursue joint projects and even constitute a plural agent. This approach does justify special moral treatment of one’s <b>co-agents,</b> although it does not match our initial conception of partiality in all respects...|$|R

Nevertheless, at a more qualitative level, few important <b>co-agent</b> properties were defined and a ranking of the use co-agents regarding their ability in inducing long chain branches is presented.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a security framework in distributed systems where an Intelligent Agent handles the security monitoring at each host. The agents are made responsible for alerting the system administrators about an attempted intrusion or misuse {{for a particular}} system. Recently, {{there has been an}} increase in the number of reports of the attacks, which are wide spread across the network and affecting a chain of systems before they attack the actual target system. To detect such attacks, the amount of information associated within a single isolated system is inadequate for an agent to confirm an intrusion. Therefore, the need for a framework that allows the agents to negotiate with their <b>co-agents</b> to share information about an intrusion, thereby aiding in effective handling of Intrusion Detection is emphasized. Our design aims at developing such a framework in the FIPA-OS (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents - Open Source) environment, which provides most of the source code for building agents on its platform.

40|$|The basic {{reaction}} scheme due to Han and co-workers for NR vulcanized with sulphur is adopted and modified {{taking into account}} the single contributions of the different accelerators, focusing in particular on some experimental data ad hoc obtained at Pirelli's laboratories, where NR was vulcanized at different temperatures (from 150 to 180 °C) and concentrations of sulphur, using TBBS and DPG in the mixture as <b>co-agents.</b> Typically, the chain reactions are initiated by the formation of macro-compounds that are responsible of the formation of the unmatured crosslinked polymer. This first reaction depends on the reciprocal concentrations of all components and their chemical nature. In presence of two accelerators, it was considered that the reactions between each single accelerator and the NR raw material occur in parallel, making the reasonable assumption that there are no mutual reactions between the two accelerators. From the kinetic scheme adopted, a closed form solution was found for the crosslink density, with the only limitation that the induction period is excluded from computations. Even kinetic constants are evaluated in closed form, avoiding a numerically demanding least-squares best fitting on rheometer experimental data. Two series of experiments available, relying into rheometer curves at different temperatures and different concentrations of sulphur and accelerator, are utilized to evaluate the fitting capabilities of the mathematical model.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} an Actor Network Theory inspired {{approach to}} the study of rock climbing to argue that climbers are more-than-human fusions comprised of the human and non-human. The research explores this notion of hybrid climbers, which I term the ‘hybrid climbing assemblage’. The complicated relationships between these human and technological <b>co-agents</b> of climbing are durable but dynamic, although technological developments aid climbers, the benefits of these fusions cannot be reduced to physical, technical and mental elements. Rather, each piece of technology worn or carried by the climber has its own situated set of relations which are interwoven into the complex socio-technical assemblage that co-constitutes the present day climber. Empirical data to support this study has been collected via participant observation, and interviews with 40 rock climbers based in northern England. Although some of these voices debate the roles of these technologies and their experiential impacts upon climbing, these developments are not necessarily damaging to the experience. Indeed, climbers are careful to retain the ‘desirable’ and ‘essential’ experiential aspects of the activity – notably the risk and uncertainty climbing entails. Finally, the thesis also adds to debates concerning the materially mediated experience of places, and how places are also involved in the development of socio-technical assemblages and their practices. In these ways this research aims to help us rethink our activities as implicitly mediated by technology. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Peroxide {{vulcanisation}} is {{a widely}} used cure system for elastomers and offers many possibilities for use, {{mainly because of the}} availability of co-agents and scorch retarders. The range of applications of peroxide cure could significantly be widened, if certain mechanical properties could be improved, to reach the level attained with sulphur curing, yet maintaining the good high temperature properties typical of peroxide vulcanisates and providing a system with proper scorch safety. In order to achieve this synergistic combination of sulphur and peroxide properties in a peroxide cure system, co-agents {{play a key role in}} the compound formulation. The use of commercially available co-agents in peroxide vulcanisation boosts the cure efficiency and provides an improvement in mechanical properties. However, a step forward is still needed in order to bring several mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, to the level achieved with sulphur curing. The development of new co-agents which are able to improve the mechanical properties of peroxide vulcanisates to reach the level of sulphur vucanisates, yet maintaining the excellent high temperature properties typical for peroxide cured articles, can be the way of achieving the synergistic system aimed for. These new co-agents should, at the same time, provide scorch safety. The work described in this thesis is dedicated to seek this synergistic combination of sulphur and peroxide cure by using new co-agents. Further, the understanding of the <b>co-agent</b> reaction mechanism during vulcanisation is also addressed, in order to comprehend the chemistry that takes place and therefore to be able to tune the <b>co-agent</b> system to obtain optimal properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of evaluation has {{in recent years}} been explored through a wider backdrop of conversations regarding the professionalization of evaluation practice. The discourse on professional evaluation has been largely circumscribed around two models of professionalism – social trusteeship and technocratic professionalism. Drawing on the works of Albert Dzur, Thomas Schwandt identifies a third model of democratic professionalism which promises a more purposeful discourse; a means of rendering the {{usefulness of}} evaluation {{as part of a}} civic professionalism in terms of what Henry Boyte calls ‘public work’. Whereas mainstream democratic professionalism emphasises the need for deliberation, the idea of public work emphasises the democratizing ideal of co-creativity with the active involvement of evaluators and citizens as <b>co-agents</b> of change. According to Schwandt, what is missing is an appropriate framework for justifying democratic professionalism as the ethos for professional evaluation practice; an ethos that relates to elements of ethics and legitimacy. Such a framework, Schwandt claims, might be appropriated from systems thinking and the tool of critical systems heuristics as used and developed in evaluation practice by Martin Reynolds. This paper explores the usefulness of evaluation through systems thinking in practice as a mediating device; a purposeful model that converses between the use of evaluation amongst citizens (including commissioners of evaluations) in an evaluand, and the usability of evaluation amongst evaluators and citizens as co-creating agents. The triangulation can be expressed through the praxis of evaluation; a praxis that at best might constitute a civic professionalism based on an ethos of evaluation as public work...|$|R

[...] Len Buerton himself returned to Britain, traveling via neutral Portugal, in July 1942, using a passport he had obtained from somewhere in the name of [...] "John Miller". For the rest of the 1940s he would live with his wife at a succession of addresses in Oxfordshire, where on 8 September 1943 Ruth Beurton (as the neighbours knew her) [...] gave birth to their son, Peter John Beurton.|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{design of}} {{hospital}} environments {{is determined by}} functional requirements and technical regulations, as well as numerous protocols, which define the structure and system characteristics that such environments need to achieve. In order to improve people's well-being {{and the quality of}} their experience within public hospitals, design elements (soft qualities) are added to those 'necessary' features. The aim of this has been to experiment a new design process so as to create health care spaces with high environmental quality and capable of meeting users’ emotional and perceptual needs. Methods. Such needs were investigated with the help of qualitative research tools and the design criteria for one of these soft qualities – colour – were subsequently defined {{on the basis of the}} findings. The colour scheme design for the new San Paolo Hospital Accident and Emergency Department in Milan was used as case study. Focus groups were fundamental in defining the project’s goals and criteria Results. The issues raised have led to the belief that the proper procedure is not the mere consultation of the users in order to define the goals: they should rather be involved in the whole design process and become <b>co-agents</b> of the choices that determine the environment characteristics, so as to best meet the quality requirements identified by the users themselves. Conclusions. The case study has shown the possibility of developing a designing methodology in three steps (or operational tools) in which users’ groups are involved in the choices, therefore leading to the planning of environments where compliance with expectations is already implied and verified by means of the process itself. Thus, the method leads to the creation of participated spaces...|$|R
