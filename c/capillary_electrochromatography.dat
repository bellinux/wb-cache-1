50|$|<b>Capillary</b> <b>electrochromatography</b> (CEC) is a chromatographic {{technique}} {{in which the}} mobile phase is driven through the chromatographic bed by electroosmosis. <b>Capillary</b> <b>electrochromatography</b> {{is a combination of}} two analytical techniques, High performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis aims to separate analytes {{on the basis of their}} mass to charge ratio by passing a high voltage across ends of a capillary tube, which is filled with the analyte. High performance liquid chromatography separates analytes by passing them, under high pressure, through a column filled with stationary phase. The interactions between the analytes and the stationary phase and mobile phase lead to the separation of the analytes. In <b>capillary</b> <b>electrochromatography</b> capillaries, packed with HPLC stationary phase, are subjected to a high voltage.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the development, evaluation, features and applications of Chromophoreasy, an alternative Excel-based program for recognition {{and integration of}} chromatographic and electrophoretic peaks. The proposed recognition is made according to parameters adjustable by the analyst, such as time range, noise smoothing window size and slope/curvature sensitivity. During integration, retention/migration time, area, height, half-height width, plate numbers, asymmetry factor, US Pharmacopeia tailing factor, resolution and statistical moments are determined. A chromatogram/electropherogram is plotted along with the found baselines. The effect of peak shape (heights and symmetries) and baseline slope over accuracy was evaluated and the precision of recognition/integration was investigated under several simulated conditions, with varied signal-to-noise levels, smoothing modes and smoothing window sizes.

40|$|The chromatographic {{performance}} {{with respect to}} the flow behavior and dispersion in fixed beds of nonporous and macroporous particles (having mean intraparticle pore diameters of 41, 105, and 232 nm) has been studied in <b>capillary</b> HPLC and <b>electrochromatography.</b> The existence of substantial electroosmotic intraparticle pore flow (perfusive electroosmosis) in columns packed with the macroporous particles was found to reduce stagnant mobile mass transfer resistance and decrease the global flow inhomogeneity over the column cross-section, leading to a significant improvement in column efficiency compared to capillary HPLC. The effect of electroosmotic perfusion on axial dispersion was shown {{to be sensitive to the}} mobile phase ionic strength and mean intraparticle pore diameter, thus, on an electrical double layer interaction within the particles. Complementary and consistent results were observed for the average electroosmotic flow through packed capillaries. It was found to depend on particle porosity and distinct contributions to the electrical double layer behavior within and between particles. Based on these data an optimum chromatographic performance in view of speed and efficiency can be achieved by straightforward adjustment of the electrolyte concentration and characteristic intraparticle pore size.

40|$|The {{influence}} of Joule heating on electroosmotic flow velocity, the retention factor of neutral analytes, and separation efficiency in <b>capillary</b> <b>electrochromatography</b> was investigated theoretically and experimentally. A plot of electrical current against the applied electrical field strength {{was used to}} evaluate the Joule heating effect. When the mobile phase concentration of Tris buffer exceeded 5. 0 mM in the studied <b>capillary</b> <b>electrochromatography</b> systems using particulate and monolithic columns (with an accompanying power level of heat dissipation higher than 0. 35 W/m), the Joule heating effect became clearly noticeable. Theoretical models for describing the variation of electroosmotic flow velocity with increasing applied field strength and the change of retention factors for neutral analytes with electrical field strength at higher Tris buffer concentrations were analyzed to explain consequences of Joule heating in <b>capillary</b> <b>electrochromatography.</b> Qualitative agreement between experimental data and implications of the theoretical model analysis was observed. The decrease of separation efficiency in <b>capillary</b> <b>electrochromatography</b> with macroporous octadecylsilica particles at high buffer concentration can be also attributed to Joule heating mainly via the increased axial diffusion of the analyte molecules and dispersion of solute bands by a nonuniform electroosmotic flow profile over the column cross-section. However, within a moderate temperature range, the contribution of the macroscopic velocity profile in the column arising from radial temperature gradients is insignificant. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.
