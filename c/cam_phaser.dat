40|$|The {{ability to}} control engine valve timing has the {{potential}} to alter the engine performance over the entire operating range. The outcome of valve timing technology enables the possibility to increase efficiency, lowering emissions, increase engine torque, etc. One of the simplest ways to obtain a variable valve timing is to use cam phasers. The dynamics of a hydraulic <b>cam</b> <b>phaser</b> has been studied, three concepts with the purpose to control such an element has been developed using simulation driven product development. Focus have been on robustness, simplicity and implementation. A final concept using on/off solenoids to control a torque driven <b>cam</b> <b>phaser</b> has been designed and simulated in GT-SUITE which validated its performance and functionality. A dynamic model was built in Simulink which simulated the behaviour of the <b>cam</b> <b>phaser</b> and provided tools for optimizing the rotor design. By combining the knowledge of mechanical- and control engineering at Scania, the development process of such machine elements was effective. The outcome of this thesis has given a new perspective in understanding these components and their potentials...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} Nonlinear Generalised Minimum Variance (NGMV) {{controller}} {{in order to}} improve the robustness of its control or set-point tracking performance. This is achieved by replacing the Kalman filter included in the original NGMV controller with an observer whose gain is obtained to minimise the effect of uncertainty, which includes unknown disturbance, modelling error, and faults. The performance of the extended controller is assessed and compared with the original controller by application to a nonlinear tank model and a <b>cam</b> <b>phaser</b> dynamics model, and simulation results are presented in this paper demonstrating improvements that can be achieved by the extended controller over the original controller...|$|E
5000|$|The F160 is a 60Â° V6 {{gasoline}} engine that displaces [...] It utilizes a turbocharger for each cylinder bank, twin intercoolers and direct injection. The engine is designed by Ferrari (loosely based on Pentastar engine block) and assembled by Ferrari; specifically, the engine blocks are cast and machined to Ferrari's approved specifications respectively in Chrysler's Kokomo, Indiana and Trenton Engine Plant, then shipped to Modena, Italy for assembly by Ferrari. This engine shares bore and combustion chamber design, the same valves control technology (i.e. roller finger followers and four <b>cam</b> <b>phasers),</b> the same twin turbocharging approach and direct injection-ignition system with Ferrari F154 engine. The engine auxiliaries are identical (alternator, starter motor and power steering pump) or very similar (variable displacement oil pump). The difference of F160 from F154: F160 engine block {{is made by}} high pressure die cast (HPDC) process which is extremely suitable for high volume production. However, it is open deck type and can't endure to high specific power in HP/liter. F160 doesn't have an overboost function and is not used in Ferrari cars either (both F136 and F154 engines are used in Ferrari cars as well). Ferrari was responsible for design and bench testing of this engine.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of a simple variable valve timing (VVT) system has been investigated. This system {{has been designed to}} update a small displacement engine pursuing the objective of optimizing both engine performance and, particularly, fuel consumption at part load operation. A continuously variable <b>cam</b> <b>phaser</b> (CVCP), able to produce a reverse Miller cycle effect during the intake phase and a significant internal EGR generation {{at the end of the}} exhaust stroke, has been introduced. A numerical approach, based on both 1 -D and 3 -D computational models, has been adopted in order to evaluate the engine performance when load is controlled by the VVT system and to deeply investigate the influence, on in-cylinder phenomena, of the valve timing variation. In this way, the VVT system here analyzed revealed as an effective tool in reducing the pumping losses, hence the specific fuel consumption, at partial load.

40|$|The use of {{biofuels}} {{for internal}} combustion engines has several well published advantages. The biofuels, made from biological {{sources such as}} corn or sugar cane, are renewable resources that reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. Fuels from agricultural sources can therefore reduce a countries energy dependency on other nations. Biofuels also {{have been shown to}} reduce CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere compared to traditional fossil based fuels. Because of these benefits several countries have set targets for the use of biofuels, especially ethanol, in their transportation fuels. Small percentages of ethanol are common place in gasoline but are typically limited to 5 to 8 % by volume. Greater benefits are possible from higher concentrations and some countries such as the US and Sweden have encouraged the production of vehicles capable of operating on E 85 (85 % denatured ethanol and 15 % gasoline). E 85 capable vehicles are normally equipped to run the higher levels of ethanol by employing modified fuel delivery systems that can withstand the highly corrosive nature of the alcohol. These vehicles are not however equipped {{to take full advantage of}} ethanol's properties during the combustion process. Ethanol has a much higher blend research octane number than gasoline. This allows the use of higher engine compression ratios and spark advance which result in more efficient engine operation. Ethanol's latent heat of vaporization is also much higher that gasoline. This higher heat of vaporization cools the engine intake charge which also allows the engine compression ratio to be increased even further. An engine that is optimized for operation on high concentrations of ethanol therefore will have compression ratios that are too high to avoid spark knock (pre-ignition) if run on gasoline or a gasoline/ethanol blend that has a low percentage alcohol. An engine was developed during this project to leverage the improved evaporative cooling and high octane of E 85 to improve fuel economy and offset E 85 's lower energy content. A 2. 0 L production Direct Injection gasoline, (DIg) engine employing Dual Independent Cam Phasing, (DICP) and turbo charging was used as the base engine. Modified pistons were used to increase the geometric compression ratio from 9. 2 : 1 to 11. 85 : 1 by modifying the pistons and adding advanced valvetrain to proved control of displacement and effective compression ratio through valve timing control. The advanced valvetrain utilized Delphi's two step valvetrain hardware and intake <b>cam</b> <b>phaser</b> with increased phasing authority of 80 crank angle degrees. Using this hardware the engine was capable of operating knock free on all fuels tested from E 0 -E 85 by controlling effective compression ratio using a Late Intake Valve Closing, (LIVC) strategy. The LIVC strategy results in changes in the trapped displacement such that knock limited torque for gasoline is significantly lower than E 85. The use of spark retard to control knock enables higher peak torque for knock limited fuels, however a loss in efficiency results. For gasoline and E 10 fuels, full effective displacement could not be reached before spark retard produced a net loss in torque. The use of an Early Intake Valve Closing, (EIVC) strategy resulted in an improvement of engine efficiency at low to mid loads for all fuels tested from E 0 - E 85. Further the use of valve deactivation, to a single intake valve, improved combustion stability and enabled throttle-less operation down to less than 2 bar BMEP. Slight throttling to trap internal residual provided additional reductions in fuel consumption. To fully leverage the benefits of E 85, or ethanol blends above E 10, would require a vehicle level approach that would take advantage of the improved low end torque that is possible with E 85. Operating the engine at reduced speeds and using advanced transmissions (6 speeds or higher) would provide a responsive efficient driving experience to the customer. The vehicle shift and torque converter lockup points for high ethanol blends could take advantage of the significant efficiency advantage of down-speeding and operating at higher loads to deliver the required power...|$|E
