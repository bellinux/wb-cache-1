50|$|The 2006 Mitsubishi Pajero {{utilizes}} built-in frame {{monocoque body}} with crumple zones around {{the engine to}} absorb impact energy. Measures taken to boost body stiffness include more spot welds, a stiffer <b>cowl</b> <b>top,</b> switching from 270 MPa grade to 440 MPa grade high tensile strength steel, and the strategic use of structural adhesives. It features stiffer body joins and use of more plated steel sheet for improved durability and reliability. Switching to aluminum has lowered {{the weight of the}} engine hood by approximately 9 kg.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, South African Statesman, South African Seafarer, and South African Shipper {{joined the}} fleet. They were {{designed}} for carrying general dry cargo, and were built in Scotland in the 1950s for the Clan Line then the Springbok Shipping Co. These ships had a distinctive <b>cowl</b> <b>top</b> on the funnel and were fitted with Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers and three Parson type turbines geared down to a single shaft, giving approximately 10,000shp and a speed of 17 kn. Electrical power came from generators driven by three Ruston Hornsby diesel engines.|$|E
40|$|Based on two {{surveys of}} manufacturers, this report {{summarizes}} several automotive body die tryout buyoff criteria, rework processes, and 3 D non-contact measurement strategies. Relative to historical die tryout performance levels, {{a significant reduction}} in the number of iterations is clearly achievable through the following: Improved ability to create die compensation models to create new machine files to rework parts closer to nominal without significant unintended consequences. Changes to existing die and production source part approval processes to make better decisions about when rework is needed to produce a dimensionally acceptable body. Related to these improvements is the need for an effective business process integrating 3 DNC measurement with new part approval processes to help manufacturers reduce the number of die rework iterations. A <b>cowl</b> <b>top</b> case study demonstrates the application of this process in effective use of 3 DNC measurement to reduce the number of tryout iterations to only one rework loop. 17.

25|$|Breda-proposed {{modification}} with a Piaggio P.XIX R.C.45 engine producing 880kW (1,180hp) at 4,500m (14,800ft). Converted from {{an early}} production C.200: first flight 11 April 1942 from Milano-Bresso flown by Luigi Acerbi. The aircraft was then fitted with a larger propeller and a revised engine <b>cowling.</b> <b>Top</b> speed in trials was 535km/h (332mph). It did not enter production as the C.200 {{had been replaced by}} more advanced designs.|$|R

25|$|The Royal Navy {{classified}} {{these ships}} as frigates, as they lacked the torpedo tubes {{needed for a}} destroyer classification. For those used to Admiralty-designed ships the Captains were unfamiliar: they had no break forward of the forecastle but instead had a graceful shear to deck-line from the forecastle to midship, and the Evarts had rakish <b>cowls</b> on <b>top</b> of the funnels. Those who served on these ships came to view these features as being very handsome. Amongst the differences with British-designed vessels were using bunks instead of hammocks and welds instead of rivets.|$|R
2500|$|The Š-3's upright inline {{engine was}} {{completely}} enclosed within a <b>cowling,</b> with its <b>top</b> {{just below the}} pilot's eye line. It drove a two-blade propeller with a domed spinner. [...] The BMW was cooled with Lamblin cylindrical radiators placed between the undercarriage legs, though a diagram shows it with narrow, fuselage-hugging (cheek) radiators. The oval cross-section fuselage tapered rearwards behind the cockpit to a straight tapered tailplane and divided elevators with a cutout for rudder movement; the latter was mounted on a circular-edged fin and had its bottom cropped for elevator clearance. [...] The Š-3 had a fixed, single-axle conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on cross-braced V-struts.|$|R
50|$|On 21 March 1918, {{the day of}} {{his ninth}} {{credited}} victory, Greim became Commanding Officer of Jagdgruppe 10. He flew with them until at least 18 June, when he notched up his 15th success. On 27 June 1918, while Greim was engaging a Bristol Fighter, his aircraft lost its cowling. The departing <b>cowling</b> damaged his <b>top</b> wing, along with the lower left interplane strut, but Greim managed to land the machine successfully. By 7 August 1918 he was commanding Jagdgruppe 9, and scored his 16th victory. On 23 August, he cooperated with Vizefeldwebel Johan Putz in what was arguably the first successful assault by aircraft on armored tanks. On 27 September, he scored kill number 25 while flying with Jagdgruppe 9.|$|R
50|$|Super Highway Buster (Sūpā Haiwei Basutā): The {{combination}} of the Highway Buster and the Junction Rifle. To form the Super Highway Buster, the Road Saber portion of Highway Buster pushes the <b>top</b> <b>cowl</b> of the Junction Rifle forward while the blades of the Bridge Axe fold up. Like the Highway Buster, an Engine Soul-powered Racing Bullet is fired, stopping {{for a split second}} to take on Go-on Black's cowl. Once combined, they unleash the destructive power of the Soul's respective Engine on the target. With the Go-on Wings, the Go-ongers use their Engineken to perform the Super-Super Special Highway Buster (Chō Chō Supesharu Haiwei Basutā) finishing move. With the Wing Boosters with Bus-on and Bearrv's Engine Souls, it can perform the Go-on Bond Special (Gōon Kizuna Supesharu) finishing move with Speedor's Engine Soul.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{problems}} were encountered during early carrier trials. The combination of an aft cockpit and the Corsair's long nose made landings hazardous for newly trained pilots. During landing approaches {{it was found}} that oil from the hydraulic cowl flaps could spatter onto the windscreen, badly reducing visibility, and the undercarriage oleo struts had bad rebound characteristics on landing, allowing the aircraft to bounce out of control down the carrier deck. The first problem was solved by locking the <b>top</b> <b>cowl</b> flap down permanently, then replacing it with a fixed panel. The undercarriage bounce took more time to solve but eventually a [...] "bleed valve" [...] incorporated in the legs allowed the hydraulic pressure to be released gradually as the aircraft landed. The Corsair was not considered fit for carrier use until the wing stall problems and the deck bounce could be solved.|$|R
50|$|The Borel hydro-monoplane, {{which was}} {{developed}} from the 1911 Morane-Borel monoplane, was a tractor monoplane powered by an 80 hp Gnome Lambda rotary engine. The rectangular section fuselage tapered to a vertical knife-edge at the rear: at the front the longerons on each side were curved inwards, meeting at the front engine bearer. A curved aluminium <b>cowling</b> covered the <b>top</b> of the engine, and {{the sides of the}} fuselage were covered with aluminium as far aft as the rear of the cockpit. The two seats were arranged in tandem, with the pilot sitting in front. Dual controls were fitted. Tail surfaces consisted of a narrow-chord fixed horizontal surface with a much broader elevator with horn balances hinged to the trailing edge and a balanced rudder which extended below the sternpost and carried a small float. The main undercarriage consisted of a pair of unstepped flat-bottomed floats. Lateral control was by wing warping.|$|R
40|$|This {{supplement}} to NASA TM 109152 shows the Schlieren video (10 min. 52 sec., color, Beta and VHS) {{of the external}} flow field and {{a portion of the}} internal flow field of a two-dimensional scramjet inlet model in the NASA Langley 20 -Inch Mach 6 Tunnel. The intent of the overall test program is to study (both experimentally and computationally) the dynamics of the inlet unstart; this (phase I) effort examines potential wind-tunnel blockage issues related to model sizing and the adequacy of the actuation systems in accomplishing the start and unstart. The model is equipped with both a moveable cowl and aft plug. Windows in the inlet sidewalls allow limited optical access to the internal shock structure. In the video, flow is from right to left, and the inlet is oriented inverted with respect to flight, i. e., with the <b>cowl</b> on <b>top.</b> The plug motion is obvious because the plug is visible in the aft window. The cowl motion, however, is not as obvious because the cowl is hidden from view by the inlet sidewall. The end of the cowl actuator arm, however, becomes visible above the inlet sidewalls between the windows when the cowl is up (see figure 1 b of the primary document). The model is injected into the tunnel and observed though several actuation sequences with two plug configurations over a range of unit freestream Reynolds number at a nominal freestream Mach number of 6. The framing rate and shutter speed of the camera were too slow to fully capture the dynamics of the unstart but did prove sufficient to identify inlet start and unstart. This series of tests indicated that the model was appropriately sized for this facility and identified operability limits required first to allow the inlet to start and second to force the unstart...|$|R
50|$|This section {{deals with}} the {{traditional}} cowls found on oasts, with particular reference to the South East. From the outside, a cowl appears to just sit {{on the roof of}} the kiln. High in the roof of the kiln is a beam spanning the centre, called the sprattle beam, this carries a bearing which the pintle on the bottom of the centre post sits in. At the top of the kiln, the centre post passes through a two or three armed top stay iron. At the top of the centre post is carried the back board which carries an elm curb ring at the bottom, and one or two curb rings higher up on all except the smallest of cowls. A tie beam could also be carried, either at each curb level, or just the bottom curb level, spanning the width of the <b>cowl.</b> The <b>top</b> of the backboard carries a shaped top plate to which the weatherboards were affixed. The whole is covered in tapered weatherboards, widest at the bottom and narrowest at the top. Slotted through the centre post and attached to the back board is the distinctive finger which sometimes carried a motif. The finger assisted the turning of the cowl in light winds. Weatherboards would be attached to the cowl with nails made from copper. Cowls were usually painted white, although some were cream. The cowl is constructed so that when looking down vertically on a kiln, it covers the whole of the opening. It also covers some ⅔ to ¾ of the circumference of the kiln opening, the remaining section being open to allow air to vent from the kiln. An illustration of a cowl and the cross-section of a kiln can be seen here.|$|R
