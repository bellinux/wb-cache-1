5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient <b>church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named. Much of the early history of the church must remain speculative rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence. However, there are certain elements which are reasonably clear.|$|E

5|$|From the 1990s, {{the issue}} of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy and other church members has become the subject of civil litigation, {{criminal}} prosecution, media coverage and public debate in countries around the world. The Catholic <b>Church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> criticised for its handling of abuse complaints when it became known that some bishops had shielded accused priests, transferring them to other pastoral assignments where some continued to commit sexual offences.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rastrelli's {{original}} {{plans for}} the building were found in Vienna, Austria. This {{made it possible to}} reconstruct the original images on the building. The plan of restoration was carried out in the 1970s, overlooked by the main architect-restorer, V. Korneyeva. Since 1968, the <b>church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> opened as a museum to tourists and visitors. The church is now owned by the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.|$|E

It {{is part of a}} four-parish benefice, and is in the archdeaconry of Cleveland, and the diocese of York. Notably, the future Archbishop of Canterbury and {{chaplain}} to King CharlesII, John Tillotson, preached his first sermon at the church in 1661. Major restoration work was done to the church in 1886, and a large amount of the Chancel woodwork dates from this period. The <b>church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a Grade II* listed building since 1955, and is the oldest building in the village by more than six centuries.|$|E
5|$|Of Salford's six Grade I listed buildings, {{three are}} churches. St Augustine's Church, in Pendlebury, {{was built in}} 1874 by George Frederick Bodley.

A <b>church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> on the site {{since at least the}} Norman period. St Mark's Church, in Worsley, was built in 1846 by George Gilbert Scott. The six Grade II* listed churches are the Church of St Andrew in Eccles, the Cathedral Church of St John, the Church of St Luke in Pendleton, Monton Unitarian Church in Monton, the Church of St Philip in Salford, and the United Reformed Church.|$|E

5|$|Since 1988 the <b>church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{the subject}} of {{recurring}} public controversy; anti-cult associations and organizations (UNADFI, CCMM and MILS – then MIVILUDES), former members {{and the vast majority}} of media presented it as a dangerous group, mainly because of its intensive missionary activities and healing practices. The church was eventually listed as a cult in the 1995 and 1999 parliamentary reports established by the French National Assembly. Protestant and academic circles, however, disagreed with this assessment, considering the church to be a genuine Pentecostal group. The latter responded to criticism through a defensive strategy, which included outreach to sociologists and historians and better ties with mainstream religions, local and national institutions.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican Church of St Mary the Virgin {{dates from}} the late 11th century and was rebuilt in the 15th century. The tower {{contains}} eight bells, of which two {{were made in the}} 1790s by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Cullompton. The three-stage tower has moulded string courses and an angle stair turret in the north-west corner. The <b>church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. There is a church room, built in 1827. The Baptist Church in Holyrood Street was built in 1842.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St Peter in Staple Fitzpaine was {{originally}} {{built in the}} Norman style, and has a Norman doorway reset in the south aisle. The chancel dates from the 14th century; the north aisle was added and the church refenestrated in the 15th century. The tower dates from about 1500. The south porch and the vestry are much more recent, dating from 1841. The crenellated 3-stage tower, has merlons pierced with trefoil headed arches set on a quatrefoil pierced parapet. The <b>church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.|$|E

5|$|The city {{is nearly}} 99% Muslim, and {{although}} many ancient churches {{can be found}} in the district, there are no weekly Christian services. In 2006, a German language Protestant church with seasonal service opened with much fanfare, after receiving permission to do so in 2003, a sign of the growing European population in the city. In 2015, the town began renovations of the Greek Orthodox Agios Georgios Church in the village of Hacı Mehmetli, and the <b>church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used for a monthly Russian Orthodox service. Alanya also provides the Atatürk Cultural Center to Christian groups on a regular basis for larger religious ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Although little {{trace of}} the 10th-century <b>church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> discovered, save {{possibly}} some Saxon masonry found during a 1997 excavation of the nave, there is much evidence of the monastery of 1093. This work in the Norman style {{may be seen in}} the northwest tower, the north transept and in remaining parts of the monastic buildings. The abbey church, beginning with the Lady Chapel at the eastern end, was extensively rebuilt in Gothic style during the 13th and 14thcenturies. At the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, the cloister, the central tower, a new south transept, the large west window and a new entrance porch to the south had just been built in the Perpendicular style, and the southwest tower of the façade had been begun. The west front was given a Tudor entrance, but the tower was never completed.|$|E
5|$|For {{over fifty}} years, the Holy Name Society of Mt. St. Peter <b>Church</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> working to inspire love, honor, and {{reverence for the}} holy name of Jesus Christ. The society also works to promote respect for the Catholic Church, loyalty to Mt. St. Peter Parish, and a life filled with good spiritual values that can be carried {{throughout}} family, education, and work. The Holy Name Society is strictly for Catholic men and was begun by Monsignor Fusco, who started the group in hopes of uniting men of the parish through service to others. Members of the society host a Mass and breakfast on the Sunday prior to Palm Sunday every year and an annual Golf Outing during the summer. Money raised at this these two events is donated to the parish to help aid in the costs of parish projects.|$|E
