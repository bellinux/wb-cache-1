Twenty-five Chinese students attending the B. Ed. programme at the University of Hong Kong were asked to rank order six <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> Results revealed an interesting multidimensional structure, suggesting that memoris-ing was seen as clearly distinct from knowledge and understanding. Contrasting <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> (such as memorisation vs changing as a person) were identified, similar to the previous distinction made between conceptions lacking, or being concerned with, constitutive meaning. These findings suggest multidimensional aspects to <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> for Chinese students that extend the notion of memorisation–understanding relations. Further inquiry in the areas of context, awareness, and types of memorisation would shed light on Chinese students’ <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> It is suggested that quantitative methodologies ideally suited to categorical data analysis with small samples could be used to supplement the results of qualitative phenomenographic methodologies on student <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In Hermeneutic Pedagogy, Loewen [...] "aims to expound the {{educational}} process in the hermeneutical tradition, but is also an essay on {{the educational}} model the author calls the hermeneutical circle of experiential pedagogy. Loewen elaborates a <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> which considers the dynamic relations between the conservative, the technical and the moral dimensions of education." [...] The book defines the relationships amongst hexis, or custom, praxis, or applied theory, and phronesis, the Aristotelian understanding of practical wisdom, to which the critical interpretive process of learning ultimately aims. [...] "Custom is only {{a first step in}} the dialectical process of learning. Not only do we forget and alter what we are taught, but also come to contest. Customs are reinterpreted, theory adjusted to suit reality, the social reality of tradition is reshaped, and the episteme of the serious business of constructing knowledge takes on its new historical task." [...] The second step of a learning process is praxis applied theory. Its aim is to expand knowledge, to use it for progressive purposes. The institutions, says Loewen, are now the medium through which a paradigm comes into being. While 'repetition' is the key word for hexis and 'extension' for praxis, the process of learning fulfils itself in phronesis or practical knowledge. [...] "While custom presents a ready-made reality for our consumption and oblation, and theory presents to us the revolution of consciousness that overturns that world, practical wisdom shines upon the light of worldliness, {{the way in which the}} world worlds itself." [...] Through phronesis the hermeneutical circle of experiential pedagogy, as Loewen calls it, closes and accomplishes itself. It enlightens the other two constitutive dimensions, it puts them into question and reveals the abilities they do not capture, but which are central to the human being as a learning being. Phronesis names the radical learning experience that one individual has, experience which cannot be taught." [...] Loewen's (2003, 2004, 2012) studies of educational processes expose the tacit expectations and latent functions of institutions and discourses, and owe much to the pioneering works of Bourdieu and Passeron. But Loewen balances critique that is found within the dialectic with an attempt at reconstructing learning through the dialogue of hermeneutics.|$|E

In contrast, the "student approaches to learning" perspective tends to assume that approaches to studying are contextually driven.

First, the evidence that students' perceptions of their context determine their approaches to studying is open to other interpretations. Second, students' approaches to studying depend as much on their <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> as on contextual factors.

40|$|Learning {{clinical}} skills {{presents a}} novel experience for undergraduate students, {{particularly when it}} comes to preparing for skill assessment. Compared with the thousands of hours of practice believed to be necessary for the development of motor skill expertise (1), these students have significantly limited exposure time. Furthermore, effective clinicians combine procedural skills expertise with the flexibility required to implement these in the real-world environment in which clients and situations can change. Therefore, unlike the learning of theory (such as solving a physics problem), rote learning and repetition may not maximize learning outcomes for the development of new clinical skills. There is a substantial body of research that shows that <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> influences the learning outcomes in university students, and much of this research has been conducted in undergraduate science cohorts (3, 5, 6, 9, 11). For instance, when first-year physics students approached learning with a focus on understanding (a deep conception and approach), their learning outcomes were superior to those who intended to merely complete the task requirements and associated learning with memorization and reproduction (a surface conception and approach) (4). Yet it is unclear whether <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> influences outcomes for clinical skill development. <b>Conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> varies with the academic task (7), and it could be argued that, unlike theory-focused learning (e. g., physics), a deep conception and approach may not lead to superior learning of hands-on clinical skills. Arguably, a <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> that emphasizes memorization and procedural skill reproduction (characteristics of surface learning) may be ideal for undergraduate students preparing for clinical skill assessment, particularly given the limited preparation time available in the context of a 10 - to 13 -wk unit of study. Students have a tendency to identify for themselves what counts for assessment (or at least what they perceive counts) and orientate their efforts in study in preparation for assessment accordingly (2). This pilot study reports the level of clinical skill mastery in undergraduate exercise science students who were learning and being assessed on clinical skills for the first time. In this unit, we provided the students with a variety of learning experiences (delivery modes: videos, face-to-face tutorials, printed handouts, and lectures) from which to prepare for a skills examination that assessed their accuracy of implementing clinical techniques with real human subjects. The purpose of this investigation was to examine whether student performance in the skills assessment was related to their <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning,</b> which was inferred from responses to a voluntary survey. To gain some insight into student approaches to the learning of clinical skills and to inform future teaching and learning approaches, we also sought to examine student engagement with the learning material and the possible interaction between clinical skill mastery and conceptions of learning...|$|E

40|$|Background: Representations {{regarding}} {{learning at}} the university have been investigated from two different theoretical frameworks: one focused on the knowledge (epistemic beliefs) and the other focused on the <b>learning</b> (<b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning).</b> Conceptual issues (dimensions and boundaries of each construct) as well as methodological issues (method for capture the complexity of each construct) {{are at the heart}} of the current debate in this field of research. Aim: This research aims at examining the relationships between <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> and epistemic beliefs. A special focus on the conceptual and methodological dimensions will be consider, in particular by using an alternative qualitative analysis (Alceste Lexicometric approach). Sample: Participants were 55 freshmen enrolled in physics (13), engineering (11), communication (16) and psychology (15) of Universidad Catolica del Norte, Chile. Method: <b>Conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> were gathered by using a semi-structured interview covering the definition, the process and the outcome <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> Epistemic beliefs were gathered based on the Reflective Judgment Model (Kitchener & King, 1994), specifically by using the dilemma that concerns the way in which Egyptian Pyramids were built. Analysis was carried out by means of Alceste approach. A key notion of this approach is that discourse involves the lexical traces of the representations. Thus, by analyzing the vocabulary this approach suggests an organisation of the empirical material in categories from which we can infer the meaning. Results: <b>Conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> range from reproduction in the examinations to relate theory and practice. Likewise, epistemic beliefs range from knowledge is a matter of "verified facts" that need be acquired to knowledge is a matter of interpretation that need be developed. On the whole a correspondence can be observed between the <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> and epistemic beliefs. Thus, <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> more reproductive are more likely to be associated with a vision of knowledge implying acquisition <b>of</b> facts and <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> more elaborative are more probably to be associated with a vision of knowledge implying interpretation of facts.
