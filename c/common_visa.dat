As {{a result of a}} long, institutionalized and a sophisticated integration process over almost 60  years, the European Union (EU) has its own migration, asylum and border policies. To manage these policies, the EU has many sophisticated tools such as a <b>common</b> short-term <b>visa</b> (the Schengen visa), various virtual databases to improve information exchange, agencies and centres, regulations and directives on different aspects of migration such as family reunification, carriers’ liability, seasonal workers and sanctions for employers. These instruments help EU to filter out undesirable persons, preventing irregular migrants and individuals who might pose a risk to any one of the Member States, yet also aim to facilitate the mobility of students, academics and tourists (Genç 2013). These developments have affected Turkey and Turkish citizens negatively. Since 2001 Turkey has been on the black/negative list of countries, 2 nationals of whom must acquire a visa before entering EU’s internal border-free Schengen Area.|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} {{mechanism}} by which Staphylococcus aureus gains resistance to vancomycin is by adapting its physiology and metabolism to permit growth {{in the presence of}} vancomycin. Several studies have examined the adaptive changes occurring during the transition to vancomycin-intermediate resistance, leading to a model of vancomycin resistance in which decreased cell wall turnover and autolysis result in increased cell wall thickness and resistance to vancomycin. In the present study, we identified metabolic changes common to vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) strains by assessing the metabolic and growth characteristics of two VISA strains (vancomycin MICs of 8 μg/ml) and two isogenic derivative strains with vancomycin MICs of 32 μg/ml. Interestingly, we observed the parental strains had impaired catabolism of nonpreferred carbon sources (i. e., acetate), and this impairment became more pronounced as vancomycin resistance increased. To determine if acetate catabolism impairment is <b>common</b> to <b>VISA</b> strains, we assessed the ability of VISA and vancomycin-sensitive S. aureus (VSSA) clinical isolates to catabolize acetate. As expected, a significantly greater percentage of VISA strains (71 %) had impaired acetate catabolism relative to VSSA (8 %). This is an important observation because staphylococcal acetate catabolism is implicated in growth yield and antibiotic tolerance and in regulating cell death and polysaccharide intercellular adhesin synthesis...|$|R
25|$|Until 1958, no one {{had been}} able to {{successfully}} establish a revolving credit financial system in which a card issued by a third-party bank was being generally accepted by a large number of merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. There had been a dozen attempts by small American banks, but none of them were able to last very long. In September 1958, Bank of America launched the BankAmericard in Fresno, California, which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not want to use a card that few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept a card that few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card. It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the <b>common</b> brand <b>Visa.</b> In 1966, the ancestor of MasterCard was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when Citibank merged its own Everything Card, launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.|$|R

However, the genetic mechanisms responsible for the reduced vancomycin susceptibility in VISA are varied.

40|$|As an {{aggressive}} pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus poses a significant public health threat and {{is becoming increasingly}} resistant to currently available antibiotics, including vancomycin, the drug of last resort for gram-positive bacterial infections. S. aureus with intermediate levels of resistance to vancomycin (vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA]) was first identified in 1996. The resistance mechanism of VISA, however, {{has not yet been}} clarified. We have previously shown that cell wall thickening is a <b>common</b> feature of <b>VISA,</b> and we have proposed that a thickened cell wall is a phenotypic determinant for vancomycin resistance in VISA (L. Cui, X. Ma, K. Sato, et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 41 : 5 - 14, 2003). Here we show the occurrence of an anomalous diffusion of vancomycin through the VISA cell wall, which is caused by clogging of the cell wall with vancomycin itself. A series of experiments demonstrates that the thickened cell wall of VISA could protect ongoing peptidoglycan biosynthesis in the cytoplasmic membrane from vancomycin inhibition, allowing the cells to continue producing nascent cell wall peptidoglycan and thus making the cells resistant to vancomycin. We conclude that the cooperative effect of the clogging and cell wall thickening enables VISA to prevent vancomycin from reaching its true target in the cytoplasmic membrane, exhibiting a new class of antibiotic resistance in gram-positive pathogens...|$|R
40|$|M) any VISA (vancomycin intermediately {{resistant}} Staphylococcus aureus) strains {{are characterized}} by increased cell wall biosynthesis and decreased cross-linking of the peptide side chains, leading to accumulation of free D-alanyl-D-alanine termini in the peptidoglycan, which act as false target sites for vancomycin. A spontaneous mutant of methicillin-resistant VISA strain SA 137 / 93 A (vancomycin MIC [E-test], 8 mug/ml), called SA 137 / 93 G, showed increased resistance to vancomycin (MIC [E-test], 12 mug/ml). Analysis of the resistance profile of the mutant revealed a loss of beta-lactam resistance with a concomitant increase in resistance to glycopeptides. In both strains, cell wall thickness was 1. 4 -fold {{greater than that of}} control isolates. However, cross-linking of the cell wall was drastically lower in SA 137 / 93 A than in SA 137 / 93 G. The sensitivity of strain SA 137 / 93 G to beta-lactams was due to loss of the beta-lactamase plasmid and a deletion that comprises 32. 5 kb of the methicillin resistance cassette SCCmec, as well as 65. 4 kb of chromosomal DNA. A spontaneous mutant of SA 137 / 93 G with higher sensitivity to vancomycin displayed a cell wall profile similar, in some respects, to that of an fmhB mutant. Results described here and elsewhere show that the only feature <b>common</b> to all <b>VISA</b> strains is a thickened cell wall, which may {{play a central role in}} the vancomycin resistance mechanism...|$|R
