Although dayside imaging in the dayside polar cap {{is very limited}} by sunlight and clouds, the AGO imagers have multi-years of records in low cloudiness (~ 10  %). While radar backscatter echo regions are generally not sufficiently large to investigate flow structures around polar cap patches (including the events studied here), low-altitude satellite observations can provide both density and velocity over a wider region along their trajectories, and their <b>conjunctions</b> <b>with</b> imagers occur routinely, allowing us to perform a statistical study of airglow patches and related flow structures in the dayside polar cap.

40|$|Quite recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the interaction of the solar wind with Mercury results in the variation in the solar wind velocity in the Earth’s neighborhood during inferior <b>conjunctions</b> <b>with</b> Mercury. This suggestion has important implications both on the plasma physics of the interplanetary space and on the space weather forecast. In this study we have attempted to answer a question of whether the claim is properly tested. We confirm that there are indeed ups and downs in the profile of the solar wind velocity measured at the distance of 1 AU from the Sun. However, the characteristic attribute of the variation in the solar wind velocity during the inferior <b>conjunctions</b> <b>with</b> Mercury is found to be insensitive to the phase of the solar cycles, contrary to an earlier suggestion. We have found that the cases of the superior <b>conjunctions</b> <b>with</b> Mercury and of even randomly chosen data sets rather result in similar features. Cases of Venus are also examined, where it is found that the ups and downs with a period of 10 to 15 days can be also seen. We conclude, therefore, that those variations in the solar wind velocity turn out to be a part of random fluctuations and have nothing to do with the relative position of inner planets. At least, one should conclude that the solar wind velocity is not a proper observable modulated by inner planets at the distance of 1 AU from the Sun in the Earth’s neighborhood during inferior conjunctions...|$|R

40|$|Derelict satellites, rocket bodies, {{and pieces}} thereof {{have been left}} on orbit. These space debris have been {{increasing}} in numbers and simulations of their future evolution have shown that this increase might continue due to collisions between objects. It {{has been suggested that}} active debris removal (ADR), i. e. removing objects from orbit by technological means rather than by their natural decay due to drag, might be necessary in order to prevent an excessive increase of the number of debris. Selection of objects to be targeted by ADR is considered important because removal of non-relevant objects will unnecessarily increase the cost of ADR. Collision probability of every object should form part of the metric to select appropriate ADR targets. This work examines how the collision probabilities of all the objects in orbit depend on particular conjunctions, which cannot be forecast far in advance due to increasing orbit propagation uncertainty and variations in solar activity. It is found that <b>conjunctions</b> <b>with</b> high collision probabilities contribute more to the collision probabilities accumulated by objects {{over a period of time}} than other close approaches. Objects that are not large in mass and size are found to take part in <b>conjunctions</b> <b>with</b> high collision probabilities. Such objects are not likely to be removed from orbit when using existing ADR target selection schemes, and collisions involving them might not be prevented. Thus, the growth of the number of debris might continue in spite of ADR because collision fragments will continue to be generated. A complementary solution to constraining the number of debris in orbit, i. e. prevention of collisions between derelicts (just in-time collision avoidance, JCA), is thus investigated. It is found that fewer than ten JCA actions per year could constrain the number of objects in orbit. However, certain objects will repetitively take part in <b>conjunctions</b> <b>with</b> high collision probabilities. Permanently removing such objects from orbit via ADR may be more cost-effective than mitigating their collision risk via JCA. The finding that <b>conjunctions</b> <b>with</b> relatively high collision probabilities are the reason why ADR may be insufficient to constrain the number of debris, and analysis of JCA using an evolutionary debris model are the main novel contributions of this work...|$|R
