The results and discussion show that, at full power load of the gas turbine, the CCHP relative cold output Qrc varies from 0 ∼ 1. 2, and the corresponding relative heat output Qrh from 1 ∼ 0. The CCHP system supplies 23. 7 % of the design cold capacity or 22. 7 % of the design heat capacity at empty power load. CCHP economic exergy efficiency and thermal efficiency both rise {{with the increase of}} power output, and trend towards a slight decline at a near-full cooling load of chiller.

40|$|Use {{of extreme}} {{temperature}} {{seems to be}} one of the promising methods of rapid and residue free disinfestation of grains. A heat disinfestation system can be designed and developed which will balance the workable window between heat dosage, insect mortality and damage to the commodity or grain quality. The phasing out of methyl bromide, insect resistance to phosphine and market demands for residue free grain have once again increased the importance of heat disinfestation. The system needs to be simple, easy to use and operate and cost effective. Two approaches are being considered. The first is a low-cost spouted bed system capable of disinfesting at 10 t h – 1. This capacity is acceptable for farm use. For higher throughput, the number of cells can be increased to suit one’s need. The second is a system capable of disinfesting partially sealed farm silos up to 50 t without moving the grain. This has been designed and is being tested.

40|$|Boiling has for a {{long time}} been {{regarded}} as a promising option {{in a wide range of}} applications such as electronic <b>cooling,</b> <b>steam</b> generation in boiler or solar concentrators, space applications etc. In order to make boiling a more attractive option for various applications many surface enhancements have been developed to improve the heat transfer performance during boiling. Recent literature indicates that boiling performance can be significantly improved by using evaporation momentum force to control the trajectory of a bubble. This approach merits a detailed investigation into evaporation momentum force, its effect on bubble growth, bubble trajectory and heat transfer. The objective of the current work is to theoretically determine and experimentally observe the effect of evaporation momentum force on the trajectory of a bubble. An expression for evaporation momentum pressure resulting from the evaporation momentum force experienced by a bubble is determined. The expression is incorporated into a well established bubble growth models to evaluate the effect of evaporation momentum pressure on bubble growth rate. The effect of evaporation momentum force on a bubble growing in asymmetric temperature field is then studied and the resultant trajectory is evaluated. The results are compared with experimental data of bubble trajectory subjected to an asymmetric temperature condition obtained using a high speed camera. The final results suggest that the evaporation momentum pressure in the vicinity of contact line can significantly change the bubble trajectory, and surfaces designed to exploit this effect seem to be promising for boiling enhancement...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{behavior}} of heat and mass transfer during hydrogen generation {{in the core of}} the boiling water reactor (BWR). The core of the BWR is a system highly heterogeneous where the transport processes are complex. The core is considered as an average channel of the fuel assembly, which consists of arrays of in-line fuel rod. This study considers diffusion and reaction due to generation of hydrogen during severe accident in a nuclear power plant with reactor type BWR. The temperature distribution in the nuclear fuel is obtained with a normal diffusion model, whereas that of the distribution of the hydrogen concentration is obtained with a time-fractional telegraph equation (TFTE). The TFTE allows consider the anomalous diffusion processes (non-Fickian effects), which govern the transport in heterogeneous systems. The numerical experiments were performance in an averaging channel that represents a core reactor with the fuel rod with its gap and cladding and <b>cooling</b> <b>steam,</b> in order to establish the importance of the effects of hydrogen diffusion in a severe accident scenario. The initial conditions of this scenario correspond to 100 % of rated power, with scram of the reactor, and without cooling flow. The temperature of the fuel is incremented due to decay heat, and due to lack of cooling the fuel temperature increases, which eventually causes fuel cladding oxidation and hydrogen generation. The hydrogen concentration results in a reaction due to oxidation for different values of fractional coefficient, at t= 0 and short times were obtained. The physical meaning is discussed when the fractional coefficient tends to a value of 1 and when it tends to a value of 0. 5, i. e., within the limits of validity of the fractional model proposed. According to the results obtained the hydrogen concentration is inversely proportional to the fractional coefficient. These results are relevant for decision making in terms of risk analysis in nuclear power plant with BWR...|$|E

40|$|The {{economical}} {{usage of}} natural resources and the reduction of polluting gas emissions are the most important challenges facing the designers of the next generation power plants. For this purpose a substantial contribution can be made through an increase of the thermal efficiency. Currently in modern natural gas fired combined cycle power plants thermal overall efficiencies of 58 % can be achieved with maximum inlet temperatures inside the steam turbine of 600 °C. The goal of the Collaborative Research Center 561 “Thermally Highly Loaded, Porous and Cooled Multi-Layer-Systems for Combined Cycle Power Plants” was to establish the technical and scientific basis for a thermal overall efficiency of 65 % in gas fired combined cycle power plants of the future. To this end the process parameters temperature and pressure have to be increased significantly. This means for the steam turbine that a main steam temperature of 690 °C in combination with a pressure of 300 bar is required. Since typical power plant materials have presently reached their operation limit with higher steam temperature, the application of a new cooling system could reduce the material temperature to tolerable conditions. In the context of this dissertation a new sandwich structure was investigated comprising a woven wire mesh interlayer between two plane sheets. This cooling structure is planned to be applied to the steam turbine casing as a wall cladding to cool down the casing to sustainable temperatures. Due to constant overpressure of <b>cooling</b> <b>steam</b> in combination with high temperature loads during operation, the structures are primarily subjected to creep deformation. Furthermore steam temperature fluctuations as well as starts and shutdowns of the steam turbine cause a superimposed fatigue process. Overall the structures are stressed during operation by a combined creep-fatigue-interaction with loads perpendicular and parallel to the intermediate layer. The task of this thesis was to characterise and to simulate with the Finite Element Method (FEM) the mechanical high temperature behaviour of the cooling structures in the regime of creep-fatigue-interaction. For this purpose the flow, creep and fatigue behaviour of cooling structure specimen manufactured from the nickel base alloy Nicrofer 6025 HT was investigated. Additionally the influence of different wire mesh geometries on the mechanical behaviour was examined. To simulate the flow and creep behaviour of the cooling structures precisely quasistatic tensile tests and creep tests in dependency on the temperature were carried out on the constituents straight wire and cover sheet. Constitutive equations were derived from the test results and implemented in adequate user subroutines of the commercial FEM software Abaqus. To predict the service life of the cooling structures under quasistatic and creep loads new damage models were developed. This way the moments of failure of the cover sheet - wire mesh - joints could be well estimated...|$|E
40|$|In April 1999, three {{identical}} superheater test {{sections were}} installed into the Niles Unit No. 1 {{for the purpose}} of testing and ranking the coal ash corrosion resistance of candidate superheater alloys. The Niles boiler burns high sulfur coal (3 % to 3. 5 %) that has a moderate alkali content (0. 2 % sodium equivalents), thus the constituents necessary for coal ash corrosion are present in the ash. The test sections were controlled to operate with an average surface metal temperature from approximately 1060 F to 1210 F which was within the temperature range over which coal ash corrosion occurs. Thus, this combination of aggressive environment and high temperature was appropriate for testing the performance of candidate corrosion-resistant tube materials. Analyses of the deposit and scale confirmed that aggressive alkali sulfate constituents were present at the metal surface and active in tube metal wastage. The test sections were constructed so that the response of twelve different candidate tube and/or coating materials could be studied. The plan was to remove and evaluate one of the three test sections at time intervals of 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years. This would permit an assessment of performance of the candidate materials as a function of time. Test Section A was removed in November 2001 after about 24 months of service at the desired steam temperature set point, with about 15. 5 months of exposure at full temperature. A progress report, issued in October 2002, was written to document the performance of the candidate alloys in that test section. The evaluation described the condition of each tube sample after exposure. It involved a determination of the rate of wall thickness loss for these samples. In cases where there was more than one sample of a candidate material in the test section, an assessment was made of the performance of the alloy as a function of temperature. Test Sections B and C were examined during the November 2001 outage, and it was decided that, due to excessive wastage, certain tube samples needed to be removed and replaced {{in order to ensure that}} Test Sections B and C would have a chance of remaining in the boiler for their intended exposure period. These suspect tube samples were replaced and the two remaining test sections were put back into service. The tube samples that were removed from Test Sections B and C were set aside for later analysis at the end of the planned exposure period. Test Sections B and C were again examined approximately six months later. At that time, measured wall thickness losses raised concerns about additional tube samples. These suspect samples were also removed, set aside for later analysis, and replaced. The test sections then went back into service until the end of the second exposure period, which was concluded in May 2003 when, due to evidence of excessive wastage, the valves were opened increasing <b>cooling</b> <b>steam</b> flow and thereby effectively stopping corrosion. In August 2003, Test Sections B and C were removed for closer examination. Section C had experienced about 42 months of service at the desired team temperature set point with 28. 5 months at temperature at full temperature. Additional suspect samples were removed from Test Section B, then, it was re-installed into the boiler (at the location originally occupied by Section C), where it remained in service until the end of the program. Due to this removal history, the samples from Test Section B had a total service duration that varied from a minimum of 15. 5 months (for samples that performed poorly) to 37 months for samples the survived for the full intended service exposure for Section B. The figure below shows a schematic of Test Section B and indicates the length of service exposure for different locations. This report provides the results of the evaluation of Test Section B, including the samples that remained in the Test Section for the full exposure period as well as those that were removed early. This report also is intended to compare and summarize the results for all three test sections. The analysis of Test Section B followed much the same protocol that was employed in the assessment of the other two test sections. The focus was on determining and documenting the relative corrosion rates of the candidate materials; however, additional investigations were undertaken to better understand the wastage mechanism, and to characterize how selected candidate materials performed either well, or poorly, in the severe coal ash corrosion environment in the convection pass of Niles Unit No. 1. The detailed results of the investigation are included in this report as a series of twelve appendices. Each appendix is devoted to the performance of one of the candidate alloys. The table below summarizes metal loss rate for the worst case sample of each of the candidate materials in all three test sections.
