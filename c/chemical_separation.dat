5|$|After the war Cockcroft {{became the}} {{director}} of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO in 1948. Harwell was involved {{in the design of the}} reactors and the <b>chemical</b> <b>separation</b> plant at Windscale. Under his direction it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program. His insistence that the chimney stacks of the Windscale reactors be fitted with filters was mocked as Cockcroft's Folly until the core of one of the reactors ignited and released radionuclides during the Windscale fire of 1957.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} {{was on the}} table to protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a <b>chemical</b> <b>separation</b> method, instead.|$|E

5|$|In January 1944, workers {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for the first <b>chemical</b> <b>separation</b> building, T Plant located in 200-West. Both the T Plant and its sister facility in 200-West, the U Plant, were completed by October. (U Plant was used only for training during the Manhattan Project.) The separation building in 200-East, B Plant, was completed in February 1945. The second facility planned for 200-East was canceled. Nicknamed Queen Marys by the workers who built them, the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 80 feet high containing forty process pools. The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery. Even with massive concrete lids on the process pools, precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove their}} discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate {{polonium}} and radium in pure form. Pitchblende {{is a complex}} mineral; the <b>chemical</b> <b>separation</b> of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore. Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach. The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization. From a ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal. She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.|$|E
5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional <b>chemical</b> <b>separation</b> was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of plutonium {{was found to}} resemble uranium {{after a few months}} of initial study. Early research was continued at the secret Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. On August 20, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1microgram was isolated. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. On December 2, 1942, on a racket court under the west grandstand at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, researchers headed by Enrico Fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as CP-1. Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot <b>chemical</b> <b>separation</b> facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor. Information from CP-1 was also useful to Met Lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for Hanford. Construction at the site began in mid-1943.|$|E
5|$|The low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP, {{which stood}} for Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile, was {{designed}} by the Montreal Laboratory, {{and became the first}} nuclear reactor to operate in Western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO, a 6 MW research reactor designed by AERE, on 3 July 1948. Because heavy water was unavailable in Britain, BEPO was designed and built as a graphite-moderated reactor. Harwell was involved in the design of reactors at Windscale, and the <b>chemical</b> <b>separation</b> plant there. The passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946, {{made it clear that the}} UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States' atomic research. This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. Cockcroft helped negotiate a new, more informal and unsigned agreement with the Americans that was announced on 7 January 1948, known as the Modus Vivendi. The renewed cooperation that he hoped for under the agreement proved illusory. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate <b>chemical</b> <b>separation,</b> which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
