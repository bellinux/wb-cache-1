40|$|The {{adsorption}} of chitosan onto cellulose <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> introduces antimicrobial properties, mainly {{created by}} the amount and location of amino groups. Therefore, {{it is important to}} be able to analyze both parameters, especially in a heterogeneous system, namely <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> coated with chitosan. In this research, three different analytical techniques were applied to determine amino groups of <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> coated with chitosan. The number of positively charged groups was determined indirectly by the spectrophotometric method using Acid Orange 7 dye, and the use of polyelectrolyte titration. In addition, the chemical surface composition regarding non-modified, as well as modified <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> (coated with chitosan), was investigated using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The results from a combination of these methods show that chitosan treatment introduces more than 14 mmol/kg of accessible amino groups onto the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers.</b> The results were in good agreement with the results of XPS. The use of spectrophotometric and titration methods in combination with XPS appears to be a very useful tool for identifying the formation of amino groups in modified <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> and their surfaces...|$|R
30|$|In this {{research}} the second method was adopted where the blank <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> before making into textiles was soaked into copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide mixture, {{and then the}} mixture was sonicated in one-step reaction. The CuO nanoparticles were impregnated and deposited on/into <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> by irradiation of ultrasound vibrations. Most of the literature was concerned with ZnO nanoparticles-coated cotton and only few articles are concerned with copper and other metal oxides nanoparticles coated onto <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{expansion}} {{was motivated}} by Russia's economic interests and was connected with the American Civil War in the early 1860s, which severely interrupted the supply of <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> to the Russian industry and forced Russia to turn to Central Asia as an alternative source of cotton supply {{as well as a}} market for Russian made goods. The Russian regime in the 1870s attempted to switch cultivation in the region from grain to cotton (a strategy later copied and expanded by the Soviets). By 1885 Tajikistan's territory was either ruled by the Russian Empire or its vassal state, the Emirate of Bukhara, nevertheless Tajiks felt little Russian influence.|$|E
25|$|One {{other way}} to use {{feathers}} {{was the creation of}} garments either decorated with feathers or with thread which was created by spinning cotton and feather shreds. The garments of eagle warriors were completely covered in feathers. Fabric made of the latter was favored by the nobility, both men and women which distinguished them from commoners. Little is known how feathers were incorporated into fabric in the Mesoamerican period. The only vestige of this practice is the making of wedding huipils in the town of Zinacant√°n in Chiapas. Although research has shown this practice is descended from the Mesoamerican one, it is still different. The Mesoamerican feathered cloth was made with thread made of <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> and feathers done on a backstrap loom, which the current wedding huipils incorporate feathers into commercially spun cotton thread.|$|E
25|$|Cotton {{production}} {{is an important}} economic factor in the United States as the country leads, worldwide, in cotton exportation. The United States is ranked third in production, behind China and India. Almost all of the <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> growth and production occurs in southern and western states, dominated by Texas, California, Arizona, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana. More than 99 percent of the cotton grown in the US is of the Upland variety, with the rest being American Pima. Cotton {{production is}} a $25billion-per-year industry in the United States, employing over 200,000 people in total, as against growth of forty billion pounds a year from 77 million acres of land covering more than eighty countries. The final estimate of U.S. cotton production in 2012 was 17.31 million bales, with the corresponding figures for China and India being 35 million and 26.5 million bales, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{animal studies}} {{demonstrated}} that these fibers {{do not possess}} skin sensitization properties [11]. There were three general routes to impregnate metal oxides nanoparticles onto the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers.</b> In the first route, the prepared CuO nanocrystals were coated onto <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> simply by pad-dry-cure process [12, 13]. The second route was to use the ultrasonic irradiation as an effective method for the deposition of nanomaterials {{onto the surface of}} <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> and other substrates [4, 5, 14, 15]. The third route was using thermal chemical treatment [3].|$|R

40|$|Cotton {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} raw materials for textile and clothing production. Compared with some synthetic polymer fibers, the main drawback of <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> is its poor mechanical properties and its high flammability, and therefore it can not be used for special textiles. Cotton fabrics treated with modern flame-retardant and reinforcement finishes often can not meet rigid military specifications. In this paper, we show the functionalization of common <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNT network armors have been fabricated on the surface of <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> using a simple dipping coating method. Due to the reinforcement and protection of CNTs, the cotton textiles exhibit enhanced mechanical properties, extraordinary flame retardancy, improved UV-blocking and super water repellent properties. Considering the exceptional electronic properties of CNTs, these CNTs functionalized <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> will find a variety of applications in high performance fabrics and smart textiles.

40|$|Due to poor {{mechanical}} properties and high water uptake of thermoplastic starch (TPS), this research focused on property improvement of thermoplastic cassava starch (TPCS) using natural compatible polymers, i. e. pectin particles and <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers.</b> Different TPCS composites, {{reinforced by the}} pectin particles and/or the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers,</b> were compounded and shaped using an internal mixer and a compression molding machine, respectively. It was found from infrared (IR) spectra that the peak position of O-H stretching of the TPCS polymer clearly shifted to lower wavenumber {{by the addition of}} the pectin particles and/or the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers.</b> Moreover, the significant increase of stress at maximum load and Young‚Äôs modulus of the TPCS/pectin particle and the TPCS/cotton fiber composites was observed. The drop of water uptake was also found when the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> were incorporated into the TPCS matrix with/without pectin particles.

30|$|Through {{ultrasonic}} irradiation, CuO nanoparticles were deposited onto natural <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers.</b> The morphology {{and structure}} were examined by XRD and SEM/EDX. The {{analysis revealed that}} CuO nanoparticles coated onto <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> are in crystalline form of monoclinic phase. The estimated crystallite size of the CuO nanoparticles was found ca. 10 [*]nm {{which is consistent with}} the reported values. These particles were developed onto the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> and may be dependent on the chemical conditions and physical environment during the growing process. These materials can be used as antibacterial fabrics in the form of medical cloths, protective garments and bed spreads, and many other purposes to minimize the chance of nosocomial infections.

40|$|I {{measured}} positron lifetime {{in natural}} polymer-cotton fibers {{as a function}} of isochronal annealing temperature in the range 27 - 290 degreesC. The variations in the positron results indicated structural changes occurring in the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> and determined the glass-transition temperature as 80 degreesC. Activation energies were measured separately for the crystalline and amorphous regions, indicating the versatility of the technique. These values were close to the O-H bond dissociation energy, suggesting O-H bond dissociation, the most probable process occurring under thermal treatment. As an extension of the positron results, the molecular weight of the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> was determined to be 1, 200, 000 based on free volume, which was within the range suggested for cotton. There seemed to be an indication that crosslinking changed the spiral structure of <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> to the network type. However, this needs to be validated by other measurements.
