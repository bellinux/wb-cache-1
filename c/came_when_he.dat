5|$|While in college, Johnson earned {{money as}} a {{door-to-door}} handyman. His success in that industry encouraged him {{to start his own}} business, Big J Enterprises, in 1976. When he started the business, which focused on mechanical contracting, Johnson was its only employee. His firm's major break <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> received a large contract from Intel's expansion in Rio Rancho, which increased Big J's revenue to $38 million.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's bowling method {{relied on}} {{accuracy}} and conceding few runs; {{several of his}} best performances <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> took wickets in quick succession to devastate the opposition. He was particularly successful against leading batsmen. From 1995, Ambrose was increasingly affected by injury, and several times critics claimed {{that he was no}} longer effective. However, he continued to take wickets regularly up until his retirement, although he was sometimes less effective in the early matches of a series. In his final years, the West Indies team was in decline and often relied heavily on Ambrose and Walsh; both men often bowled with little support from the other bowlers. Following his retirement, Ambrose has pursued a career in music as the bass guitarist in a reggae band.|$|E
5|$|Another similar rags-to-riches {{story is}} Pang Lim, {{who was an}} illegal fruit hawker in Sungei Road in the 1970s. His big break <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saved enough money to rent a coffee shop in 1990 with his younger brother and uncle. They rented the stalls out to other hawkers and managed the drinks stall themselves. The {{business}} took off and from one coffee shop, Pang is now the managing director of Koufu, which operates 20 foodcourts, five coffee shops and five cafes around the island.|$|E

5|$|He practiced at the Bhiwani Boxing Club, where former national-level boxer and Jagdish Singh {{recognised}} his talent. Working part-time, he {{even tried}} {{his hand at}} modelling to financially support his coaching. The first recognition for Vijender <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> won a bout in the state level competition. Vijender won a silver medal in his first sub-junior nationals in 1997 {{and went on to}} bag his first gold medal at the 2000 Nationals. In 2003, he became the all-India youth boxing champion. The turning point, however, came in the 2003 Afro-Asian Games. Despite being a junior boxer, Vijender took part in the selection trials and was picked for the meet where he fought valiantly to win a silver medal.|$|E
5|$|Hextall's first {{international}} recognition <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was named {{as part of}} Team Canada's squad for the 1987 Canada Cup. During a practice session, he chopped Sylvain Turgeon's arm with his stick during a scrimmage, claiming that the left wing {{was too close to}} the goal. Turgeon missed the tournament with a fractured arm; Hextall was back-up to Grant Fuhr and did not play a single game. He later represented Canada in the 1992 World Championships, playing five games to record one win and a GAA of 2.86 as Canada were eliminated in the quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{earliest}} public controversy <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was linked}} to alleged Nigerian drug trafficker Pius Ailemen. Ailemen {{was supposed to be}} Jackson's best man at his 1991 wedding, but canceled at the last minute due to supposed passport-related issues. Jackson and Aileman were investigated by the FBI; the investigation and court proceedings extended for several years. A wiretap recorded many conversations between the two, and financial records indicate that Ailemen had purchased an Alfa Romeo using a $13,000 charge on Jackson's credit card. Ailemen was sentenced to 24 years and four months in jail. In 2003, Ailemen was denied petition for a writ of certiorari. Ailemen's current motion questions Jackson's activities as a government informant {{at the time of his}} testimony in Ailemen's trial.|$|E

5|$|Newsom's first {{political}} experience <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> volunteered for Willie Brown's successful campaign for mayor in 1995.

In 1997, Brown appointed him to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors seat vacated by Kevin Shelley. At the time, he became the youngest member of San Francisco's board of supervisors and also, like Shelley before him, the board's only heterosexual Caucasian male.|$|E

5|$|Siddiqui's first {{breakthrough}} in research <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> successfully isolated an antiarrhythmic agent in 1931 from {{the roots of}} Rauwolfia serpentina. He named the newly discovered chemical compound as Ajmaline, after his mentor Hakim Ajmal Khan {{who was one of}} the illustrious practitioners of Unani system of medicine in South Asia. Later on, Siddiqui also extracted other alkaloids from Rauwolfia serpentina that included Ajmalinine, Ajmalicine (C21H24N2O3), Isoajmaline, Neoajmaline, Serpentine and Serpentinine. Many of these are still used worldwide for treatment of mental disorders and cardiovascular ailments, especially as antiarrhythmic agents in Brugada syndrome.|$|E
5|$|McBreen's debut for the Glory <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{entered a}} 6–2 away loss to Melbourne Victory as a 38th-minute {{substitute}} for Chris Coyne on 16 January 2010. He started and {{scored in the}} next match three days later, a 3–2 away win over Adelaide United, with the winning goal in the 77th minute. This marked {{the start of a}} run of five goals from four matches, helping the Glory finish fifth in the 2009–10 A-League table and thus qualify for the finals series. McBreen played in their 4–2 penalty shoot-out defeat to Wellington Phoenix in the fourth v fifth semi-final on 21 February 2010, which followed a 1–1 draw after extra time. He had scored five goals in seven appearances for the Glory, and with eight goals altogether he was the 2009–10 A-League's eighth highest scorer.
