40|$|A {{model for}} {{optimizing}} milling process is presented. It {{is based on}} time and frequency domain simulations by means of Matlab SimulinkTM, that constitutes an accurate approach to cutting conditions -forces, vibration phenomena, stability, etc. -. The main feature of this software compared to others {{is the use of}} advanced strategies to plan chatter avoidance -variable pitch <b>cutter</b> and variable <b>spindle</b> speed- including complex modelling (3 D) ...|$|R
40|$|To date, flux {{switching}} {{permanent magnet}} (FSPM) machines {{have been treated}} due to their high torque capability. This paper investigates the suitability of FSPM for servo applications in terms of acceleration, stall torque and thermal overloading capability. The effect of different design parameters is investigated on a 3 -phase 12 / 10 FSPM. Based on the determined key design parameters, a prototype is constructed and its dynamic performance is experimentally verified for the motion profile of a <b>spindle</b> <b>cutter</b> in comparison to a benchmark nonsalient industrial brushless servomotor...|$|R
40|$|Sculptured {{surfaces}} used in {{the design}} and manufacture of molds, dies are machined on 3 or 5 -axis milling machines. Generally, the final part is obtained in three stages: roughing, semi- roughing and finishing. In the roughing stage, the goal is to remove the most material from the initial workpiece as rapidly as possible by using generally a large flat end mill tool. In the classical approach, the NC part programmer, based on his experience, chooses the number of tools with their dimensions and fixes the cutting conditions from existing tables. In this paper, we present a systematic methodology that permits, from the NURBS surfaces to rough on 3 -axis CNC milling machines, firstly to select automatically for each cutting plane the optimal flat end mill tool from a database of tools, and secondly to calculate the optimal feedrate for each tool movement by considering the removed volume, tool dimensions, allowable <b>cutter</b> deflection, <b>spindle</b> speed and material of the workpiece...|$|R
40|$|Tool {{geometry}} optimization, {{workpiece material}} characterization, process monitoring and optimization {{are based on}} the measurement of cutting forces by using machining dynamometers. Commercial dynamometers cover a wide range of machining applications, nevertheless {{there is a lack of}} measuring devices suitable for investigating milling and drilling applications with relatively small <b>cutters</b> and high <b>spindle</b> speeds. In this work, the development and testing of an innovative plate dynamometer designed for this purpose is discussed. The new measuring system was based on three high-sensitive triaxial piezoelectric force sensors arranged in a novel triangular configuration. Component design was optimized by using FE numerical approaches, according to the general guidelines derived from mathematical modeling of sensor dynamics. The prototype of the proposed device was manufactured and experimentally tested against two high-end commercial plate dynamometers by performing static calibration, modal analysis and cutting tests. Experimental results proved the excellent characteristics of the new device and its effectiveness for investigating advanced machining applications...|$|R
