50|$|An {{impact socket}} wrench is a {{cylindrical}} shaped tool {{with a female}} opening to fit over a nut or bolt head, and is most commonly 6-point hexagonal shaped; generally used with the assist of a power tool such as an Impact wrench or hydraulic torque wrench. Sizes range from the very small, to massive sizes weighing hundreds of pounds each. Impact sockets typically connect with the driving tool {{by way of a}} male to female square drive connection (or less commonly a spline drive connection). The use of power tools and ratchet wrenches with sockets makes tightening and removing bolts incredibly easy over alternative methods like <b>combination</b> <b>wrenches</b> and other manual methods.|$|R
40|$|Robot {{platforms}} and applications {{are becoming more}} autonomous and complex. Many of these robots, and in particular service robots, evolve from a highly structured, human-shielded environments to a less structured, human- populated environments. Moreover, these robots are increasingly expected to interact physically and cognitively with humans and their environment. The overall complexity of these robot systems requires the integration of knowledge of many domains and from multiple experts. Dealing with this integration challenge requires a systematic approach and knowledge-driven, flexible, reusable, and adaptable software. This dissertation makes two complementary contributions: firstly, it provides a systematic approach {{to deal with the}} complexity of robot systems in general; and secondly, it provides a way to integrate force-sensorless wrench control in service robots. As its first contribution, this dissertation introduces the Composition Pattern as a uniform and easy-to-grasp systematic approach to deal with complexity, from software architecture to behavior composition. The Composition Pattern defines a Composite Functional Entity as first-class citizen of system design. This Composite Functional Entity separates Coordinator, Composer, Scheduler, Configurator(s), Monitor(s), Communicator(s) and Functional Entities. Each Functional Entity can be in itself a Composite Functional Entity, hence can lead to a hierarchy of interacting entities. The Composition Pattern builds on the metamodeling concept, which considers all entities to be models, not objects. The former forms a constructive way to implement the 5 Cs approach of separation of concerns; the latter separates concepts of the domain from implementation details, which makes the models more portable to other robot platforms. Concretely, the Composition Pattern is applied as an architectural pattern to refactor the iTaSC constraint-based programming software framework. This resulted in a framework of more reusable, flexible, robust, and adaptable entities. Furthermore, the Composition Pattern is used to structure and formalize constraint-based programming in a domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL enables developers and users to easier (and hence faster) understand and (re) program constraint-based programming applications, since (i) it provides a template of the system, (ii) it enables automatic model verification, and (iii) it enables manual or automatic code generation to the software framework ecosystem of choice. As its second contribution, this dissertation presents a novel force-sensorless wrench control scheme for velocity controlled robots. This control scheme does not require a precise dynamic model of the robot, environment, or contact point; nor does it require an expensive and complex force sensor. Furthermore, it allows the <b>combination</b> of the <b>wrench</b> control constraints with other constraints, and it features a reference adaptation factor, which can be applied to impose a desired transient behavior on the appliedwrench. Experimental validation of the control scheme, through the integration in the resolved-velocity iTaSC approach and software framework, proves that a stable, constant contact wrench can be reached in a repeatable way, and with an accuracy that fits service robot tasks. In addition, this dissertation integrates both contributions in a force-sensorless and bimanual human-robot comanipulation application. The application shows complex behavior emerging from the composition of constraints to instantaneously and concurrently (i) keep the robot grippers parallel, (ii) null wrenches applied to the grippers, (iii) avoid obstacles, (iv) maintain visual contact with a person, (v) avoid joint limits, and (vi) optimize joint configuration. These constraints are expressed in multiple and different generalized task spaces. The software implementation of the DSL, the iTaSC software framework, the wrench control schemes, and the comanipulation application are all made publicly availabe under an open-source license.

40|$|A {{telemanipulation}} system lets a {{human operator}} manipulate an environment on distance, using a master and a slave device, which are {{connected by a}} bilateral controller that controls the master and the slave device and provides the communication between these devices. The master device is manipulated by the operator and these actions are transferred to the slave device, using the bilateral controller. The interaction forces between the slave device and the remote environment are fed back to the operator, which provides awareness and allows a task to be executed efficiently and safely. Currently, one {{of the limitations of}} telemanipulation systems is that interaction forces are typically indirectly transferred to the human operator. Firstly, a commonly used concept to determine the feedback forces, is by coupling the master and slave position, using a proportional controller. Secondly, feedback forces are generally applied on the master device, which then transfers these forces to the operator through its end effector. Because of the dynamics of the master device, these forces are distorted as they are transferred to the operator. This reduction in force feedback quality decreases awareness of the operator and thereby likely reduces his or her task performance. To minimize the distortion of the feedback forces by the dynamics of the master device, often a parallel manipulator is used as master device. Compared to a serial manipulator, a parallel manipulator has the advantage that the moving masses are small, because the actuators are positioned at the base. However, the difficulty of parallel manipulators is the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the device, which is much more complex than the modeling of serial manipulators. The goal of this research is to improve force feedback quality. This is achieved through the design of a local admittance controller for a parallel master device, which will cancel out the dynamics of the parallel master device and allows them to be replaced by desired dynamics (desired mass, damping and stiffness). Using this approach, the feedback quality will not only be of higher quality, but will also enable a more complete and intuitive method to design the force feedback. However, generally an admittance controller requires the external force applied by the operator as input. Force sensors are expensive and fragile. As a more cost-effective solution, in this thesis the external force will be obtained by force estimation using a model based observer. The model based observer only requires the position measurements, and control <b>wrench</b> (<b>combination</b> of force and torque) at the end effector, as input. The admittance controller for the parallel master device, without the use of a force sensor, is configured by combining insights from different fields of robot analysis and control. The control algorithm will be build up by a computed torque controller, the desired dynamics to shape desired acceleration, an observer, an observer based force estimator and methods to derive a kinematic and a dynamic model of a parallel manipulator. The control method is tested on a three degrees of freedom planar parallel device: the Munin. The tests show that the algorithm is able to replace the dynamics of the master device with desired dynamics, such that the device admits a certain motion, with respect to the desired dynamics and the external force applied by the human operator. The limits of the range of desired stiffness, damping and mass, that can be projected on the manipulator’s end effector by the control algorithm, are explored. This range is large enough to conclude that the algorithm is suitable to be used on parallel master devices, to project desired dynamics on the end effector of the device, without the use of a force sensor. The control algorithm is designed to control the master device of a telemanipulation system. This enables a intuitive configuration of force feedback. The desired dynamics can be shaped, which can be beneficial to advanced control concepts, such as haptic shared feedback and model mediated control, on top of the feedback directly available form the measurements at the slave device. Furthermore, the control algorithm could also be beneficial for the safe operation for all kinds of devices that cooperate with a human, because of the force estimation, instead of force measurement on one point of the device, will react to all forces applied anywhere on the device.
