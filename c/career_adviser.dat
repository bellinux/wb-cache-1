That said, the paper goes on to highlight tensions apparent in the career advisers' perceptions of, and subsequent advice-giving practices regarding VETiS - particularly in terms of the potential benefits it affords all students. It becomes clear that <b>careers</b> <b>advisers</b> have different agendas for advising different students - academic and non-academic students - to undertake VETiS as a course of study. Finally, the paper demonstrates the ways in which <b>career</b> <b>advisers</b> become complicit in the marginalisation of VETiS programs and the status of VET...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{consisted}} of two initiatives. The first initiative was to qualitatively explore the perceptions and attitudes of <b>Career</b> <b>Advisers</b> in New South Wales secondary schools regarding health career pathways for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander secondary school students. The second initiative was to explore strategies for raising awareness and stimulating interest in health career pathways for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander secondary school students. Fifteen <b>Career</b> <b>Advisers</b> from fifteen secondary schools across metropolitan and regional New South Wales participated in the study. At three separate data collection sites, and at the express request of the participant, the school Aboriginal Education Assistant also contributed primary data to the study. It was the express wish of <b>Career</b> <b>Advisers</b> at these schools that an Indigenous perspective {{be included in the}} study. At one data collection site, the Deputy School Principal also expressed the wish {{to be included in the}} study. In total nineteen participants contributed toward the study. Findings from the current study suggest that <b>Career</b> <b>Advisers</b> work within a challenging world-of-work context which is constantly changing in order to meet the demands of globalisation. Furthermore, it is evident that within this world-of-work context Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students face significant barriers and socio-economic disadvantage. This disadvantage severely impacts upon and restricts these students’ access to career education within the schooling environment. Additionally, the opportunity to engage with and foster lifelong learning in conjunction with ongoing career development is also negatively impacted upon. Other than with medicine and nursing, <b>Career</b> <b>Advisers</b> were found to have limited knowledge regarding both the diversity and range of allied health careers that are currently available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. <b>Career</b> <b>Advisers</b> noted they work collaboratively with Aboriginal Education Assistants, who are a core component of the learning and teaching environment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. In spite of the critical role they play in holistically integrating the schooling environment and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, it was noted that of those schools that did employ Aboriginal Education Assistants, did so on a part-time or casual basis. It was also noted by some participants that despite the necessity for Aboriginal Education Assistants to be on staff in their school, and to be available to themselves and to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, there was no Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person employed in that capacity. Notwithstanding these significant challenges, research outcomes from the current study will recommend that <b>Career</b> <b>Advisers</b> and Aboriginal Education Assistants be supported in their roles. This is particularly important if they are to raise awareness and stimulate interest in health career pathways for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Furthermore, it is recommended that additional research be conducted in order to determine how the Commonwealth Department of of Education Science and Training can best provide this support...|$|R

The study will examine three levels: first, the existing institutional infrastructure and its modus operandi taking into account that some key institutions are missing; second, the legal infrastructure and how it regulates the functioning of existing institutions and of the advisers involved in specialty practice; third, ethics infrastructure and how it regulates the functioning of institutions and practice advisers when only proposals for a code of ethics exist, which have not been yet legally and institutionally legitimized.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the ways in}} which some career advisors perceive and experience working in secondary schools in New Zealand in 2001. Secondary schools are being increasingly seen as the initial stepping stone in which students develop the capacity to foster realistic and productive career pathways. Career development is perceived as a social and personal process, which ultimately should prepare the students to manage career transactions throughout their life. My interest lies in the personal viewpoint of the career advisors. The focus of this research is on the unique way in which he/she perceives the world they work in. A qualitative research method was chosen in an effort to understand situations in what Patton (1985) describes as situations in their uniqueness as part of a particular context, and case studies were used to collect and analyse data. From the group of five career advisors, whom I interviewed, a 'snapshot' that represents each person's different experiences of providing career advice was developed. By connecting the pieces of each person's story this research investigates the realities of working as a <b>career</b> <b>adviser</b> in New Zealand secondary schools. The first chapter explores through the literature review different aspects of past research in relation to career information and guidance. Chapter two outlines the methodology of the research including the evolution of the project. Case studies and photographs were important components in this process. The third chapter {{describes the}} history of the project and the processes that were worked through to gather information and analyse the data. In chapter four the findings are analysed in five categories. Each of the five career advisors is introduced and gives an overview of a typical day. This is followed by four categories, which describe different aspects of the experience of providing career advice for these five people. This information is interpreted in chapter five. The key conclusions are that there is no formal policy or planning that is used by any of the five schools and that provision for information and guidance from year 9 is often minimal. The focus in all five schools was year 13 students and students who were thought to be "at risk" of having no post secondary school plan to follow. Limitations of the research include the small number of participants, and the time of year the research was conducted. Recommendations for future lines of research include the school management teams, year 9, 10 and 11 students and the use of Career Services in secondary schools...|$|E
