50|$|A {{set of four}} stamps on 1 May 1960 commemorated the 60th {{anniversary of}} the {{discovery}} of phosphate at Ocean Island. The definitive series of 1965 depicted daily activities of the natives, but a decimal <b>currency</b> conversion necessitated <b>surcharges</b> in 1966 and a reissue of the stamps in 1968.
