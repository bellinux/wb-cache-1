40|$|Discriminant {{analysis}} {{has been applied}} to organochlorine contaminant data from a small number (ca 3 - 25) of 12 different marine mammal species to discriminate between the species {{on the basis of the}} <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> (<b>CB)</b> patterns in blubber and account for the effects of age, sex, condition and location of the mammals. The raw data are normalised to a single congener, CB 153, to reduce the effects of life history and sex, after which the discriminant factors are plotted to display the differences between species in relation to the intake and the metabolism of chlorobiphenyls. An understanding of these differences gives a better knowledge of the relative sensibility of these species. The sperm whales were found to have the least ability to metabolise CBs when compared with other cetaceans, although the concentration range observed for total CB was relatively low (265 - 6, 313 µg/kg lipid weight) ...|$|R
40|$|Excretion {{and tissue}} {{retention}} of a coplanar and a non-coplanar hexachlorobiphenyl (HxCB) were determined 48 h after a single intraperitoneal (ip) dose of 8 mg/kg radiolabeled [14 C]-HxCBs to weanling {{male and female}} Long-Evans rats. The objective {{was to understand the}} involvement of initial target organs of <b>chlorobiphenyl</b> (<b>CB)</b> accumulation following acute exposure in immature animals. During the short interval, both HxCBs remained sequestered predominantly in mesenteric fat (compared to subcutaneous fat) and less than 1 % of the doses were excreted. Excretion was 4 -to 8 -fold lower than adult rats. Coplanar CB 169 (3, 3 �, 4, 4 �, 5, 5 �-HxCB) did not accumulate appreciably in the brain, but was retained at 3 -fold higher levels in the liver than was non-coplanar CB 153 (2, 2 �, 4, 4 �, 5, 5 �-HxCB). Accumulation of 14 C-CB 153 in brains was 4 - to 9 -fold higher than that of 14 C-CB 169 and was adequate to detect non-uniform distribution in serial cryosta...|$|R
40|$|The mono-ortho <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> (<b>CBs)</b> 60, 74, 114, 123, 157, 167 and 189 were {{determined}} in Aroclor mixtures and aquatic organisms by multidimensional gas chromatography with electron capture detection (MDGC/ECD), {{using a combination}} of an Ultra 2 and an FFAP column. MDGC/ECD is recommended as the most suitable technique for direct determination of these CBs, without a liquid chromatographic (LC) pre-separation of mono-ortho CBs from the other CBs. Dependent, to some extent, on the stationary phase used, single-column determinations of these CBs easily yield too high results due to the presence of interferences. The contribution of the mono-ortho CBs studied to the total 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents (TEQs) from CBs in fish is highly dependent on the toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) used and varies between 0. 02 and 22 %. This contribution is mainly due to CBs 74, 114, 157 and 167 which may easily be determined by taking three heart-cuts and combining them into one MDGC/ECD run. The analytical error is negligible compared with the huge uncertainty of the TEFs. A need for more precise TEFs is emphasized. © 1995...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bone {{toxicity}} {{has been}} linked to organochlorine exposure following a few notable poisoning incidents, but epidemiologic studies in populations with environmental organochlorine exposure have yielded inconsistent results. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether organochlorine exposure was associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in a population 60 – 81 years of age (154 males, 167 females) living near the Baltic coast, close to a river contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). METHODS: We measured forearm BMD in participants using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; and we assessed low BMD using age- and sex-standardized Z-scores. We analyzed blood samples for five dioxin-like PCBs, the three most abundant non-dioxin-like PCBs, and p,p´-dichlorophenyldichloroethylene (p,p´-DDE). RESULTS: In males, dioxin-like <b>chlorobiphenyl</b> (<b>CB)</b> - 118 was negatively associated with BMD; the odds ratio for low BMD (Z-score less than – 1) was 1. 06 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 01 – 1. 12) per 10 pg/mL CB- 118. The sum of the three most abundant non-dioxin-like PCBs was positively associated with BMD, but not with a decreased risk of low BMD. In females, CB- 118 was positively associated with BMD, but this congener did not influence the risk of low BMD in women...|$|R
40|$|Grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) pups {{can receive}} {{substantial}} doses of organochlorine contaminants during lactation. This exposure may cause immunosuppression. We studied {{the effect of}} exposure to individual <b>chlorobiphenyl</b> (<b>CB)</b> congeners on grey seal pups at the Isle of May in the Firth of Forth, Scotland, by monitoring the prevalence of non-specific infection in pups, and by measuring perturbations in various haematological and biochemical blood parameters. There was no relationship between the prevalence of infection in pups, {{as a sign of}} immunosuppression, and the cumulative lactational dose of CB congeners. There was also no relationship between age at diagnosis of infection and CB dose, thus pups receiving relatively higher doses of contaminants early in life were no more likely to succumb to infection than those receiving lower doses. There was also no relationship between age-related changes in haematological and biochemical blood parameters and exposure to CB contaminants. Although pups which became infected with non-specific pathogens had received higher cumulative doses of CB on a toxicity equivalence basis than those which did not, this effect disappeared when results were corrected for the effect of pup age...|$|R
40|$|Individual <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> (<b>CBs)</b> and p,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDE were {{determined}} in solution and suspension in surface transects {{of the open}} Mediterranean Sea in 1987. Large volumes of sea water (1400 — 1700 dm 3) were analyzed. Concentrations of CBs were low in solution (< 5 pg/dm 3) and in suspension (< 60 pg/dm 3). Values for their sum (XCB) were 1. 7 - 43. 9 and 190 - 615 pg/dm 3, respectively. Compositions of the CB mixtures in solution {{as well as those}} in suspension were very similar in the various transects, but considerable differences were present between solution and suspension in each transect. It was attempted to interpret these differences in terms of molecular characteristics (octanol-water distribution coefficients, Kaw). The resulting plots of log Kovl vs. the apparent distribution coefficient (log K&) gave evidence for the uptake of CBs by suspended particles, followed by sedimentation out of the surface layer. Concentrations in solution were much lower (1 - 2 orders of magnitude) than those reported before. This may result from improvements in the sampling and analytical techniques. No clear evidence for significant local sources of these compounds was detected in the surface waters, as the levels in solution were very similar to the very low concentrations in the adjacent open Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the supply of {{chlorinated}} biphenyls by the river Oder into some adjacent areas of Baltic Sea was studied in nine sediment cores and in 10 suspended matter samples. Congener-specific analysis was carried out on 28 individual <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> (<b>CBs).</b> ∑CB concentrations in suspension ranged from 2. 4 pg dm- 3 in the southern Bornholm Basin to 986 pg dm- 3 in the Achterwasser. ∑CB contents in surface sediment decreased with increasing distance from the river mouth. Highest contents {{were found in the}} Oderhaff (18 ng g- 1 dw) decreasing to 2 ng g- 1 dw in the Bornholm Basin. The ∑CB contents generally decreased more or less regularly with increasing depth. The compositions of the CB mixtures in surficial sediment and suspension samples were rather similar, suggesting a common source. Compositions of the CB mixtures in the sediment cores showed distinct differences. These may reflect variations in source strength over time. Mass balance considerations {{on the basis of the}} 28 CBs resulted in an estimation of a total storage of approximate 733 ± 158 kg ∑CBs in the Oderhaff, Achterwasser, Greifswalder Bodden, Oder Rinne, Arkona Basin and Bornholm Basin in the past 65 years, covering the time period since CBs were first produced. Based on river data about 500 kg of ∑CBs were supplied during this time by river Oder, that may thus be the major source of these compounds for the southern Baltic Sea...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a sequence-based {{approach}} has been developed for the fast isolation and characterization of class II aryl-hydroxylating dioxygenase activities (S. Kahl and B. Hofer, Microbiology 149 : 1475 - 1481, 2003). It comprises the PCR amplification of segments of alpha subunit genes of unknown sequence that encode the catalytic center and their fusion with sequences of the bphA gene cluster of Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400. One of the resulting chimeric enzymes, harboring the core segment of a dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. strain B 4 -Magdeburg, has now been characterized {{with respect to the}} oxidation of <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> (<b>CBs).</b> Its substrate and product specificities differed favorably from those of the parental dioxygenase of strain LB 400. The hybrid possessed a higher regiospecificity and yielded less unproductive dioxygenations at meta and para carbons. It attacked ortho-, meta-, and para-chlorinated rings with comparable efficiencies. It gave significantly higher yields in ortho,meta-dioxygenation of recalcitrant congeners containing a doubly ortho-chlorinated ring. While the parental enzyme yielded mainly unproductive meta, para dioxygenation of 2, 5, 4 ′-CB, the hybrid predominantly converted this congener into an ortho,meta-dioxygenated product. The subsequent enzymes of the LB 400 catabolic pathway were able to transform most of the metabolites formed by the novel dioxygenase, indicating that the substrate ranges of these biocatalysts are not adapted to that of their initial pathway enzyme. Some of the catabolites, however, were identified as problematic for further degradation. Our results demonstrate that the outlined approach can successfully be applied to obtain novel dioxygenase specificities that favorably complement or supplement known ones...|$|R
40|$|All 209 <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> (<b>CBs)</b> {{theoretically}} {{possible and}} potentially present in relatively highly chlorinated types of technical CB formulations of Aroclor 1268, Chlorofen, Clophen T 64, KC- 600, and KC- 1000 have been quantified using isotope dilution techniques and high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). CB constituents of Aroclor 1268, Chlorofen, Clophen T 64, KC- 600, and KC- 1000 could be separated, detected, identified and quantified as "bulk CBs," using a capillary column (60 m length נ 0. 25 mm i. d.) coated by 8 % phenyl polycarborane-siloxane (HT- 8 PCB, SGE, Australia) liquid phase for GC coupled to HRMS, into 111, 78, 126, 137, and 148 peaks, respectively, which covered 140, 100, 158, 169, and 180 possible CB congeners. 87, 60, 99, 110, and 121 peaks represented single CB congeners in Aroclor 1268, Chlorofen, Clophen T 64, KC- 600, and KC- 1000, respectively, while 34, 18, 27, 27, and 27 peaks represented 53, 40, 59, 59, and 59 co-eluting CBs. After enrichment procedures using multilayer silica beds, alumina beds, and carbon-impregnated silica beds in glass columns, all four planar non-ortho CBs and all eight mono-ortho CBs (but {{with the exception}} of CB no. 123 in Chlorofen) could be quantified in all five technical CB formulations examined. The planar non- and mono-ortho CBs content of Aroclor 1268, Chlorofen, Clophen T 64, KC- 600 and KC- 1000 were 6. 2, 7. 0, 47, 120, 470 堧/g and 220, 410, 34, 000, 12, 000, 5900 堧/g, respectively, and their 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxicity equivalents (2, 3, 7, 8 -TeCDD TEQs) were 31, 390, 710, 260, 1900 ng-TEQ/g and 35, 99, 5900, 2600, 8900 ng-TEQ/g, and the total 2, 3, 7, 8 -TeCDD TEQs of planar CBs were 66, 490, 6600, 2900, and 11, 000 ng-TEQ/g.

40|$|Concentrations of 23 {{individual}} <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> (<b>CBs)</b> and 6 {{polyaromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) were determined in different water {{masses of the}} North Atlantic Ocean around Iceland. The study {{was carried out in}} the framework of the second Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) baseline studies of contaminants in the North Atlantic Ocean, involving trace organics and trace elements. Concentrations of individual CBs were extremely low. In solution, they varied between < 2 and 126 fg dm− 3 and in suspension between < 2 and 1400 fg dm− 3. The values for their sum (∑CB) were between 10 and 1048 in solution, and 286 – 11   241 fg dm− 3 in suspension. ∑PAHs were present in the < 5 – 65 pg dm− 3 range, p,p′-DDE and hexachlorobenzene were < 2 fg dm− 3. The concentrations of CBs and PAHs decreased from the surface towards the bottom at each station. The lowest concentrations were found in Norwegian Sea Deep Water (∑CB 10 fg dm− 3), concurrent with the lowest halocarbon concentrations found during the cruise. Values in near-surface waters were considerably lower than those determined at mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic. These findings reflect the mixing of water bodies with higher CB concentrations from the central North Atlantic with less contaminated waters from the Arctic Ocean. Concentrations in suspension exceeded those in solution in most samples, {{as a result of the}} relatively high suspended matter concentrations in the waters around Iceland. Particulate CB and PAH concentrations were positively correlated with particulate organic carbon concentrations. This suggests that suspended organic material is a carrier for these relatively apolar organic compounds in the water column. The data do not support the co-distillation concept suggested in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Bioaccumulation of non-, mono-, and di-ortho-substituted <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> (<b>CBs)</b> was {{investigated}} in four species of mustelids (weasel, stoat, polecat, and otter) and their preys, from a restricted area {{in the northern part}} of The Netherlands. Diets of these mustelids ranged from terrestrial (weasel, stoat, and polecat) to aquatic (otter). Diet-specific biomagnification factors (BMFs), CB in diet relative to CB in mustelids, were calculated for the sum of 28 congeners (&Sgr;CB), for the sum of the toxic equivalent concentration (&Sgr;TEQ) and on an individual congener basis. Biotransformation was studied in relation to structural CB properties (vicinal H-atom substitution). In addition, the methylsulphonyl CB-metabolites were determined. The concentration of &Sgr;CB on lipid weight basis increased in the order weasel < stoat < polecat < otter. On the basis of &Sgr;TEQ, the order changed to weasel < polecat < stoat < otter. Most of the differences in BMFs between the CBs could be explained by the vicinal H-atom structure-activity rules. For all mustelids, the lowest BMFs were found for congeners with vicinal H-atoms in the meta, para position. Indications were found that all mustelid species can metabolize these congeners. For some of the CBs, their methylsulphonyl-CB metabolites were determined and found to be present in concentrations up to 350 -fold higher than those of the parent compounds. In addition, the non-ortho CBs 126 and 169 are selectively retained in the liver of weasel, stoat, and otter. These CBs had the highest BMFs of all congeners. However, rather surprisingly, in polecat the highest BMFs were found for di-ortho-substituted CBs. This animal was able to metabolize all congeners with vicinal H-atoms in the ortho and meta position (non- and mono-ortho CBs). The information concerning the differences in bioaccumulation of CBs for closely related mustelid species increased the understanding of reported differences in PCB toxicity between mink and ferrets, and suggest that weasel, stoat, and otter are at least as sensitive to CBs as are mink, while polecats are less sensitive. As otter is exposed to much higher concentrations of CBs trough their diet than weasel and stoat, the toxic threat of CBs will be the greatest for this animal. VA:IB...|$|R
40|$|Processes {{affecting}} {{organic carbon}} distribution and composition {{can control the}} speciation of organic contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and ultimately determine their residence time in a particular environment. In marine systems, the microbial loop influences organic carbon dynamics by recycling a significant fraction of dissolved and particulate organic matter. The goal of this thesis was to understand how these recycling processes affect <b>chlorobiphenyl</b> (<b>CB)</b> cycling in marine systems by monitoring CB dynamics among organic carbon pools represented by dissolved organic matter, bacterial prey and phagotrophic protozoan grazers. Initially, I studied {{the extent to which}} a protozoan grazer (Uronema sp. - 10 [micro]m ciliate) equilibrated with aqueous PCBs within 2 - 3 hours. Initial calculations predicted rapid equilibration via passive diffusion. Experimentally, no difference in equilibration time was noted between grazing and non-grazing protozoa, indicating that diffusion was the primary uptake pathway for these organisms. The results were extended to determine the transition size of an organism where the rates of diffusive and ingested uptake are equivalent (100 - 500 [micro]m). Disassociation rate constants were estimated for complexes of CB congeners and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). CB-DOC complexes enhanced the diffusive uptake rate constant for Tenax resin and, by inference, protozoan grazers. In the second phase of this work, concentrations of surfactants, organic carbon and cells were monitored over time in protozoan cultures. The effects of bacterial growth substrate and protozoan species were examined. Surfactants increased during protozoan exponential growth while total DOC concentrations decreased. Production of(cont.) surface-active material in ciliate cultures was significantly higher than in flagellate cultures, and all protozoan cultures were higher than the bacterial control. Common headspace vessels were then used to compare and contrast the affinity of protozoan and bacterial culture filtrates (< 0. 2 [micro]m) for PCBs relative to a seawater control. Affinities were normalized to bulk DOC and surfactant concentrations to determine underlying relationships among these parameters. Values of equilibrium partition coefficients (K[oc]) ranged from 10 ⁴·⁶ in Vineyard Sound seawater to 10 ⁵·⁴ and 10 ⁵·⁵ in protist cultures, indicating that "grazer-enhanced" DOM was a better sorbent for PCBs than DOM in bacterial controls and Vineyard Sound seawater. by Elizabeth Belle Kujawinski.

40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) and <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> (<b>CBs)</b> in sediments is largely dependent on the freely dissolved concentration of these pollutants. However, measuring these is challenging, due to the low concentrations of lipophilic contaminants in the environment and their strong affinity for particles and for traditional sampling (filtration and centrifugation) equipment. An equilibrium passive sampling device made of silicone rubber was developed in this research to measure the freely dissolved concentrations of lipophilic contaminants and other parameters (water extractable proportions and sediment-water partition coefficients) that describe the availability of these contaminants in the environment. Equilibration between sampler and sediment for PAHs and CBs {{was found to be}} adequately achieved after 20 days shaking of a silicone rubber sampler in sediment slurry on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. The reproducibility of uptake was better than 5 %. Silicone rubber-water partition coefficients for 34 PAHs and 32 CBs were measured in the laboratory using a co-solvent method using methanol as co solvent. Strong linear correlations of log sr w K, with octanol-water partition coefficients (log ow K) (log 0. 97 log 0. 01; 2 0. 94, K = K − r = sr w ow & log 1. 17 log 1. 82; 2 0. 90, K = K − r = sr w ow) were found for PAHs and CBs, with a systematic difference in correlations observed for the different classes of compounds which was attributed to structural differences of the compounds. The silicone rubber samplers were then used to measure concentrations of PAHs in the pore water of sediments from the Fladen Ground of the North Sea, Loch Shell, Firth of Forth, Firth of Clyde, Loch Etive and Aberdeen Harbour in Scotland and the Vefsn fjord, Norway. A proportion of the PAHs were found to be unavailable for exchange into the aqueous phase, and this was reflected in the high log oc K measured in all the sediments studied. The sediment-water partition coefficients also correlated positively with the octanol-water partition coefficients. Accumulation of PAHs in Nereis virens from sediments was better predicted from literature bio concentration factors and pore water concentrations obtained using the silicone rubber samplers than from sediment concentrations traditionally used in risk assessments. Participation in an International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) passive sampling trial survey using silicone rubber in sediments and water is described, and demonstrated the potential of passive sampling in monitoring environmental pollution. The log BCF (bio concentration factor) for PAHs in mussels increased with increasing log ow K at both Loch Etive and Aberdeen Harbour locations, and could be used to estimate concentrations in mussels directly. The survey data also showed the use of silicone rubber in assessing the diffusive exchange of PAHs across sediment-water interfaces. Petroleum Technology Development Fund of Nigeria...|$|R
