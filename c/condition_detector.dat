40|$|The {{condition}} {{sensor system}} comprises a <b>condition</b> <b>detector</b> which produces a pulse when a parameter of the monitored condition exceeds a desired threshold. A resettable condition counter counts each pulse. A resettable timer is preset {{to produce a}} particular time frame. The counter produces a condition signal when the accumulated number of pulses within the time frame is {{equal to or greater}} than a preset count. Control means responsive to the incoming pulses and to the condition signal produce control signals that control utilization devices. After a suitable delay, the last detected pulse simultaneously resets the pulse counter and the timer, and prepares them for sensing another condition occurrence within the time frame. The invention has particular utility in the process of detecting rocking motions of blind people. A controlled, audible, bio-feedback signal is provided which constitutes a warning to the blind person that he is rocking...|$|E

40|$|The LHCb {{experiment}} {{produces a}} huge amount of data which has associated metadata such as run number, data taking <b>condition</b> (<b>detector</b> status when the data was taken), simulation condition, etc. The data are stored in files, replicated on the Computing Grid around the world. The LHCb Bookkeeping System provides methods for retrieving datasets based on their metadata. The metadata is stored in a hybrid database model, which is a mixture of Relational and Hierarchical database models and is based on the Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). The database access has to be reliable and fast. In order to achieve a high timing performance, the tables are partitioned and the queries are executed in parallel. When we store large amounts of data the partition pruning is essential for database performance, because it reduces the amount of data retrieved from the disk and optimises the resource utilisation. This research presented here is focusing on the extended composite partitioning strategy such as range-hash partition, partition pruning and usage of the partition wise joins.

40|$|More {{and more}} drivers {{nowadays}} enjoy the convenience brought by advanced driver assistances system (ADAS) including collision detection, lane keeping and ACC. However, many assistant functions are still constrained by weather and terrain. In the way towards automated driving, {{the need of}} an automatic <b>condition</b> <b>detector</b> is inevitable, since many solutions only work for certain conditions. When it comes to camera, which is most commonly used tool in lane detection, obstacle detection, visibility estimation is one of such important parameters we need to analyze. Although many papers have proposed their own ways to estimate visibility range, there is little research {{on the question of}} how to estimate the confidence of an image. In this thesis, we introduce a new way to detect visual distance based on a monocular camera, and thereby we calculate the overall image confidence. Much progresses has been achieved in the past ten years from restoration of foggy images, real-time fog detection to weather classification. However, each method has its own drawbacks, ranging from complexity, cost, and inaccuracy. According to these considerations, the new way we proposed to estimate visibility range is based on a single vision system. In addition, this method can maintain a relatively robust estimation and produce a more accurate result...|$|E
40|$|Debugging {{electronic}} circuits is traditionally done with bench equipment {{directly connected to}} the circuit under debug. In the digital domain, the difficulties associated with the direct physical access to circuit nodes led to the inclusion of resources providing support to that activity, first at the printed circuit level, {{and then at the}} integrated circuit level. The experience acquired with those solutions led to the emergence of dedicated infrastructures for debugging cores at the system-on-chip level. However, all these developments had a small impact in the analog and mixed-signal domain, where debugging still depends, to a large extent, on direct physical access to circuit nodes. As a consequence, when analog and mixed-signal circuits are integrated as cores inside a system-on-chip, the difficulties associated with debugging increase, which cause the time-to-market and the prototype verification costs to also increase. The present work considers the IEEE 1149. 4 infrastructure as a means to support the debugging of mixed-signal circuits, namely to access the circuit nodes and also an embedded debug mechanism named mixed-signal <b>condition</b> <b>detector,</b> necessary for watch-/breakpoints and real-time analysis operations. One of the main advantages associated with the proposed solution is the seamless migration to the system-on-chip level, as the access is done through electronic means, thus easing debugging operations at different hierarchical levels...|$|E

40|$|The ATLAS {{detector}} at the LHC {{consists of}} several sub-detector systems. Both data taking and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation rely on an accurate {{description of the}} <b>detector</b> <b>conditions</b> from every subsystem, such as calibration constants, different scenarios of pile-up and noise conditions, size and position of the beam spot, etc. In order to guarantee database availability for critical online applications during data-taking, two database systems, one for online access and another one for all other database access have been implemented. The long shutdown period has provided the opportunity to review and improve the Run- 1 system: revise workflows, include new and innovative monitoring and maintenance tools and implement a new database instance for Run- 2 <b>conditions</b> data. The <b>detector</b> <b>conditions</b> are organized by tag identification strings and managed independently from the different sub-detector experts.

This allows on-flight preservation of past conditions for data and MC and assure their sustainability with software evolution.

In this article, a Monte Carlo simulation chain for acoustic neutrino detection devices in water is presented. It is designed within the SeaTray/IceTray software framework. Its modular architecture is highly flexible {{and makes it}} easy to adapt to different environmental <b>conditions,</b> <b>detector</b> geometries, and hardware. The simulation chain covers the generation of the acoustic pulse produced by a neutrino interaction and the propagation to the sensors within the detector.

A pre-selection scheme for neutrino-like signals based on matched filtering is employed, as it can be used for on-line filtering. To simulate the whole processing chain for experimental data, signal classification and acoustic source reconstruction algorithms are integrated.

40|$|Travel time {{estimation}} and prediction on motorways {{has long}} been a topic of research. Prediction modeling generally assumes that the estimation is perfect. No matter how good is the prediction modeling- the errors in estimation can significantly deteriorate the accuracy and reliability of the prediction. Models have been proposed to estimate travel time from loop detector data. Generally, detectors are closely spaced (say 500 m) and travel time can be estimated accurately. However, detectors are not always perfect, and even during normal running <b>conditions</b> few <b>detectors</b> malfunction, resulting in increase in the spacing between the functional <b>detectors.</b> Under such <b>conditions,</b> error in the travel time estimation is significantly large and generally unacceptable. This research evaluates the in-practice travel time estimation model during different traffic conditions. It is observed that the existing models fail to accurately estimate travel time during large detector spacing and congestion shoulder periods. Addressing this issue, an innovative Hybrid model that only considers loop data for travel time estimation is proposed.

Results indicate that during non free flow <b>conditions</b> and larger <b>detector</b> spacing Hybrid model provides significant improvement in the accuracy of travel time estimation...|$|R
