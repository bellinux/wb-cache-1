25|$|The Maersk Group {{entered the}} airline {{industry}} when it established Maersk Air in 1979. Given {{the nature of the}} mother company, Maersk Air looked at the possibilities to operate the cargo segment. The airline started operation with three F27s, mounted with cargo doors for easy conversion to cargo configuration. Oriental Air Transport Services, a <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> <b>company</b> based at Kastrup, was bought in 1971.

40|$|Egyptian ports play a {{significant}} role at both the national and international levels. Nationally more than 90 % of the Egyptian foreign trade is transported via ports on the Mediterranean and Red seas. Moreover, the Egyptian ports are located strategically to link the world trade between the east and the west and as such with the development of their container handling terminals, they became today {{a major player in the}} world logistic network. However, to maintain their competitiveness, container terminals need to strike a balance between the potentially conflicting interests of a growing number of related stakeholders such as government, shippers, logistic companies, workers, shipping companies and agents. Here, the adoption of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) concept comes into play as an important notion to strategically manage the terminals to achieve the interests of not only shareholders but a wider range of stakeholders. Especially that some of these stakeholders such as container shipping companies are now paying much attention to CSR. Despite, the importance of the CSR concept for the sustainability of the container terminals and more widely the Egyptian ports and although, the last decade has seen many initiatives to investigate the CSR concept in various sectors of the Egyptian economy, the literature has totally ignored the container <b>handling</b> <b>companies.</b> This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the degree of adoption of the CSR concept in the Egyptian container and <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> <b>companies</b> through analyzing their mission and vision statements and their online CSR disclosures. The paper shows that the adoption of the CSR concept is still at its infancy and more attention is required to raise the CSR awareness amongst companies to enhance their CSR practices and respective disclosures...|$|R

40|$|Air {{transportation}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the agile and dynamic environment of contemporary supply chains. This industry is characterized by high air cargo demand uncertainty, making forecasting extremely challenging. An in-depth case-study has been undertaken in order to explore and untangle the factors influencing demand forecasting and consequently to improve the operational performance of an Air <b>Cargo</b> <b>Handling</b> <b>Company.</b> It has been identified that in practice, the demand forecasting process does not provide the necessary level of accuracy, to effectively cope with the high demand uncertainty. This has a negative impact on a whole range of air cargo operations, but especially on the management of the workforce, which is the most expensive resource in the air cargo handling industry. Besides forecast inaccuracy, a range of additional hidden factors that affect operations management have been identified. A number of recommendations have been made to improve demand forecasting and workforce management...|$|E
50|$|In 1960 {{the company}} Armement Deppe was acquired, and between 1975 and 1982 {{gradually}} also the tramp ship company Bocimar. The company entered the dry bulk trade in 1962 {{and continues to}} be a major dry bulk operator under its Bocimar banner. In 1975, the CMB group took a minority share in the dry bulk tramping company, Bocimar, which was increased to a majority share in 1982. In 1988, CMB bought Hessenatie, a large general <b>cargo</b> and container <b>handling</b> <b>company</b> in Antwerp. In July 1991 the Société Générale de Belgique, until then the main shareholder of the CMB, sold its shares to the holding Almabo and his shipping society Exmar, led by Marc Saverys. In 1995, half of CMB Transport was sold to Safmarine, a South African shipping company. In 1999, with the sale of the African network of AMI, CMB groups participation in the liner sector ceased and they focussed on the bulk carrier sector. In the same year, CMB gained full control of Euronav, an operator of crude oil tankers.|$|R

30|$|Non-aeronautical {{production}} per se is {{very complex}} {{due to the}} fact that airport is no longer just a place where people go travel by airplane. The non-aeronautical business, that is also known as commercial service usually consists of franchise-based operations and self-operations, such as ground handling agent service supplied for airliners, in-flight catering services, duty free and other retail shops in the terminals, leasing of advertising space inside and outside the terminals of the airport, provision of goods warehousing, <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> agent <b>companies</b> (Liu 2016; Adler and Liebert 2014; Oum et al. 2003, 2007; Oum and Yu 2004). The airport is rightly a place for airplane but the business expanded to non-aeronautical side due to the increase in air traffic globally. Studying financial statements for the airport and counseling with airport managers, among inputs for non-aeronautical business, top three contributing inputs were chosen: restaurant size, duty-free store size and parking lot capacity. Inefficiency occurs when aircraft movement is low given the non-aeronautical inputs. Aircraft movement is chosen as intermediate product as airports’ main focus is aircraft taking off and landing. From managerial perspective, decreasing the size of non-aeronautical inputs should be considered if aircraft movement is low; that is, not many people visit airport but excessive investment on building large airport should be reconsidered. For the second sub-process for the non-aeronautical production, if the small number of aircraft movement leads to higher non-aeronautical and the large number of passengers, it could be efficient. This could give us an insight that passengers visiting the airport might spend relatively more money than other airports or a number of visitors visit the airport or the schedule for the aircraft movement is tight. Overall, we want to see whether the inefficiency or efficiency for the sub-processes might have an impact upon the overall efficiency by calculating the overall efficiency.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were 1) to identify the tuna <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> conducted in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ, 2) to determine the main variables that affect the performance of tuna <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ, and 3) to determine what policies can be used to improve the performance of tuna <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ. This research was conducted by using the descriptive methodology i. e. a discrete simulation model of the process of tuna <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ by utilizing ARENA software. In the policy making of tuna <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> improvements, the Analytical Network Process, Benefit, Opportunity, Cost, and Risk (ANP BOCR) were also used. The simulation results point out that the existing conditions contribute to the delay level of tuna cargo delivery by 12 % with the quality level of 22, 934 %. Delays in tuna cargo delivery have led to an increase in operational costs by 1, 5 %. ANP BOCR results highlight that opening a special lane for perishable <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> will improve the performance of tuna <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ. Furthermore, the results of discrete model simulations on the improvement scenario of tuna <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> performance show that by opening a special lane for perishable <b>cargo</b> <b>handling,</b> it can ensure delivery schedule to be accurate indicated by the level of on time delivery reaching up to 100 %, with an average quality rate of 86. 013 %. By speeding up the processing period (with an average of 81. 519 minutes), the delay of cargo delivery up to 100 % will be reduced; therefore, the quality of tuna is maintained in a good condition with the histamine level of 6, 7 ppm.

The model considers the interaction between <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> elements of a timber terminal, that is forklifts, tractors, trailers and quay cranes, to investigate congestion points and how each element affects the other parts of the <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> system. The output of the model is the performance statistics of the <b>cargo</b> <b>handling</b> equipments of the terminal, the throughput of quay cranes and the forecast of the terminal's throughput capacity.
