5|$|In the U.S. National Championships, Richard Sears (1881–1887), William Larned (1901–1902, 1907–1911) and Bill Tilden (1920–1925, 1929) {{hold the}} record for most titles in the men's singles, with seven {{victories}} each. Four of Sears' wins and all of Larned's, came within the challenge round format, and they won respectively only thrice and twice after going through a complete draw. Sears also holds the all-time record for most consecutive titles, with seven from (1881 to 1887); the first win <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> event was closed to foreign participants. Without the challenge round, the record stands at six, and is held by Tilden (1920–1925).|$|E

5|$|The Tigers next {{faced the}} Canton Bulldogs, {{which would be}} the Bulldogs' first APFA opponent. The Tigers lost 7–0 before a crowd of 7,000 people. The Bulldogs' offense had 15 first downs, and the only score of the game <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Bulldogs' Ike Martin had a 7-yard {{touchdown}} run in the first quarter. Jim Thorpe of the Bulldogs, who would later be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, made his season debut in the game, coming in as a substitute in the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{most visible}} way for {{graduates}} of Texas A to recognize {{each other is}} by the Aggie Ring. The Aggie Ring is worn by current students and alumni, {{and is one of}} the most well-known symbols of the Aggie Network. The first Aggie Ring was designed by E. C. Jonas in 1894, and the design has remained relatively unchanged since- the only major change <b>came</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> school's name was changed from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas to Texas A University in 1963.|$|E

25|$|At {{some point}} during his term of {{military}} service, Tacfarinas deserted. Gathering around him a band of marauders, he carried out many minor raids on Roman territory.

At around 6:50 p.m., a milk cart went by the site; no collapse was noticed. Between 6:52 and 6:55 the clay stratum under the embankment gave way and collapsed. At approximately 6:55, the telegraph network that ran along the railway line came down.|$|E
