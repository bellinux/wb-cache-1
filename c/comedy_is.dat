5|$|Shakespeare wrote {{seventeen}} comedies {{that incorporate}} many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as jokes, puns, parody, wit, observational humor, or the unexpected effect of irony. One-liner jokes and satire {{are also used}} to comedic effect in literature. In farce, the <b>comedy</b> <b>is</b> a primary purpose.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Larris, who {{has also}} {{conducted}} an academic study of The Daily Show, disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, {{and that it would}} be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing The Daily Show and thinking or acting in a particular way. Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart's <b>comedy</b> <b>is</b> grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing low-key events, where he structures a new image for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that <b>comedy</b> <b>is</b> not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E
50|$|<b>Comedies</b> <b>are</b> plays {{which are}} {{designed}} to <b>be</b> humorous. <b>Comedies</b> <b>are</b> often filled with witty remarks, unusual characters, and strange circumstances. Certain <b>comedies</b> <b>are</b> geared toward different age groups. <b>Comedies</b> <b>were</b> {{one of the two}} original play types of Ancient Greece, along with tragedies. An example of a <b>comedy</b> would <b>be</b> William Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream, or for a more modern example the skits from Saturday Night Live.|$|R

50|$|The {{other two}} comedians are Philemon and Diphilus. Philemon was a comedian whose comedies dwelt on {{philosophical}} issues and Diphilus was a comedian whose <b>comedies</b> <b>were</b> noted for their broad comedy and farcical violence. Philemon's comedies survive only in fragments, but Diphilus' <b>comedies</b> <b>were</b> translated and adapted by Plautus. Examples of these <b>comedies</b> <b>are</b> Plautus' Asinaria and Rudens. Based on the translation and adaptation of Diphilus' comedies by Plautus, one {{can conclude that}} he was skilled {{in the construction of}} his plots.|$|R

50|$|Women are {{typically}} portrayed in chick flicks as sassy, noble victims, or klutzy twentysomethings. Romantic <b>comedies</b> <b>are</b> considered a subgenre of the chick flick.

25|$|Italian <b>Comedy</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} considered to have started with Mario Monicelli's I soliti Ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna Street, 1958) and derives {{its name from the}} title of Pietro Germi's Divorzio all'Italiana (Divorce Italian Style, 1961). For a long time this definition was used with a derogatory intention.|$|E
25|$|Roman <b>comedy</b> <b>is</b> {{represented}} by two Latin playwrights, Plautus (writing between c.205 and 184 BC) and Terence (writing c.166-160 BC). The works of other playwrights such as Livius Andronicus, Naevius and Ennius are now lost {{except for a}} few lines quoted in other authors. 20 plays of Plautus survive complete, and 6 of Terence.|$|E
25|$|To a {{considerable}} degree, in fact, the <b>comedy</b> <b>is</b> built upon {{a basis of}} class warfarea theme which was very familiar to British television audiences in the 1970s, a period of virtually continuous industrial strife in Britain. Whereas Bob, Thelma and Terry's sister Audrey have adapted to the various changes, Terry's five-year absence in the Army results in him being left behind, {{a relic of the}} attitudes of the mid-1960s.|$|E

25|$|Many of Arbuckle's films, {{including}} the feature Life of the Party (1920), survive only as worn prints with foreign-language inter-titles. Little or no {{effort was made}} to preserve original negatives and prints during Hollywood's first two decades. By the early 21st century, some of Arbuckle's short subjects (particularly those co-starring Chaplin or Keaton) had been restored, released on DVD, and even screened theatrically. Arbuckle's early influence on American slapstick <b>comedy</b> <b>is</b> widely recognised.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} African-Caribbean names in <b>comedy</b> <b>is</b> Lenny Henry, who {{began his career as}} a {{stand-up}} comedian but whose television sketch shows, where he often caricatured Caribbean émigrés, made him popular enough to headline numerous primetime comedy shows from, for instance, Lenny Henry in 1984 to The Lenny Henry Show in 2004. The highest professional achievement by a British African-Caribbean actor to date (2006) was Marianne Jean-Baptiste's 1996 nominations for an Academy Award (Oscar), Golden Globe and British Academy Award (bafta) for her feature-film debut role in Secrets & Lies.|$|E
25|$|Come Dine with Me is {{a popular}} Channel 4 cooking program shown in the United Kingdom. It was {{produced}} by ITV Studios (formerly known as Granada) until 2013, when Shiver Productions took over. First broadcast in January 2005, the show has either four or five amateur chefs competing against each other hosting a dinner party for the other contestants. Each competitor then rates the host's performance with the winner winning a £1,000 cash prize which is announced by the competitor who hosted the dinner party on Friday. An element of <b>comedy</b> <b>is</b> added to the show through comedian Dave Lamb, who provides a dry and bitingly sarcastic narration.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the Greek New Comedy of Menander and its similarities to Plautus, it is necessary to discuss, in juxtaposition with it, the days of Greek Old Comedy and its evolution into New Comedy. The ancient Greek playwright who best embodies Old <b>Comedy</b> <b>is</b> Aristophanes. A playwright of 5th century Athens, he wrote works of political satire such as The Wasps, The Birds, and The Clouds. Aristophanes' work is noted for its critical commentary on politics and societal values, which is the key component of Old Comedy: consciousness {{of the world in which}} it is written, and analysis of this world. Comedy and theater were means for the political commentary of the time—the public conscience.|$|E
25|$|One main {{theme of}} Greek New <b>Comedy</b> <b>is</b> the father–son relationship. For example, in Menander's Dis Exapaton {{there is a}} focus on the {{betrayal}} between age groups and friends. The father-son relationship is very strong and the son remains loyal to the father. The relationship is always a focus, even if it's not the focus of every action taken by the main characters. In Plautus, on the other hand, the focus is still on the relationship between father and son, but we see betrayal between the two men that wasn't seen in Menander. There is {{a focus on the}} proper conduct between a father and son that, apparently, was so important to Roman society at the time of Plautus.|$|E
25|$|Love, a theme {{throughout}} the Divine <b>Comedy,</b> <b>is</b> {{particularly important for}} the framing of sin on the Mountain of Purgatory. While the love that flows from God is pure, it can become sinful as it flows through humanity. Humans can sin by using love towards improper or malicious ends (Wrath, Envy, Pride), or using it to proper ends but with love that is either not strong enough (Sloth) or love that is too strong (Lust, Gluttony, Greed). Below the seven purges of the soul is the Ante-Purgatory, containing the Excommunicated from {{the church and the}} Late repentant who died, often violently, before receiving rites. Thus the total comes to nine, with the addition of the Garden of Eden at the summit, equaling ten.|$|E

25|$|The show falls {{somewhere between}} a cop show and a comedy show. Although superficially {{following}} the police drama format, the comedy derives from outrageous plots, the self-deprecating Canadian and the assertive American stereotypes, and the occasional fantasy elements such as the regular visits paid to the Mountie by his father's ghost, whose advice varies between helpful and absurdly useless. The tone of the show {{and much of the}} <b>comedy</b> <b>is</b> derived from Fraser's supernormal detective ability. For instance, in one episode, Fraser tracks down a suspect by smelling the breath of a rat to determine the brand of barbecued ribs it had been eating. Another recurring gag is Fraser standing guard motionlessly in front of the Canadian consulate, while a passerby attempts to make him move or speak.|$|E
25|$|Guido Guinizelli is {{considered}} {{the founder of the}} Dolce Stil Novo, a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. This new understanding of love, expressed in a smooth, pure style, influenced Guido Cavalcanti and the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, who established the basis of the modern Italian language; his greatest work, the Divine <b>Comedy,</b> <b>is</b> considered among the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the Middle Ages; furthermore, the poet invented the difficult terza rima. The two great writers of the 14th century, Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio, sought out and imitated the works of antiquity and cultivated their own artistic personalities. Petrarch achieved fame through his collection of poems, Il Canzoniere. Petrarch's love poetry served as a model for centuries. Equally influential was Boccaccio's The Decameron, {{one of the most popular}} collections of short stories ever written.|$|E
