40|$|In several European {{countries}} {{there is}} a demand that milk producers with automatic milking systems (AMS) must clean the milking system three times a day. Cleaning an AMS reduces possible milking {{time as well as}} consuming considerable amounts of hot water and detergents. Therefore, it is important to acquire greater knowledge during practical conditions to better understand the consequences of less frequent cleaning. This study was carried out on 9 Swedish farms during a period of 16 weeks. Three AMS brands were included in the study with three farms of each brand. The two investigated treatments were cleaning with 8 and 12 hours intervals. Milk quality was analysed for total bacterial count (TBC), coliform count (CC), psychrotrophic count (PC) and thermoduric count (TC). To ensure that milk cooling and cleaning have been done correctly during the sampling period, the temperature was monitored in the milk pipe and in the bulk tank. The difference for TBC was significant (p< 0. 05) with different <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequencies,</b> but no significant difference was obtained for the other groups of bacteria. Cleaning the system twice a day resulted in a TBC of log 4. 15 compared to log 3. 98 when cleaning the system three times a day. The milk in the bulk tank contained an acceptable average level of CC irrespective of farm and <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency.</b> However, the variation between farms and <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency</b> was high with the lowest value of 0 and the highest value of log 3. 9 CC.

From conventional milking several methods and procedures are known and applied to automatic milking systems. The diversity of the cleaning systems of automatic milking systems is given.

40|$|Nutrient {{management}} is an escalating concern for beef feedlots. Nitrogen volatilization {{to the atmosphere}} is a major concern, and nutritional and manure management programs {{can play a role}} in reducing N losses. Two experiments were conducted. In the first, two methods to increase manure N and decrease N losses were evaluated: (1) 30 % dietary corn bran inclusion and (2) monthly pen <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency.</b> Corn bran inclusion in finishing diets reduces diet digestibility and increases organic matter (OM) excretion onto the pen surface. Additional OM on the pen surface may “trap” N in manure via microbial immobilization and reduce N losses. More frequent pen cleaning may result in less exposure of manure N to surrounding air and subsequent volatilization. An interaction between diet and pen <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency</b> on N balance in the feedlot was observed. Pens cleaned monthly and cattle fed bran resulted in the greatest reduction in N volatilization losses; however, performance was depressed with corn bran inclusion. Regardless of pen <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency,</b> feeding corn bran resulted in more N recovered in composted manure. ^ The second experiment was designed to evaluate alfalfa hay (AH) and wet corn gluten feed (WCGF) combinations in dry-rolled corn-based diets for effects on performance and N balance. Three levels of AH (0, 3. 75, and 7. 5 %) and two levels of WCGF (0 and 35 %) were evaluated. Addition of intermediate levels (i. e., 20 – 50 %) of WCGF to finishing diets maintains cattle performance due to the combination of steep and bran, and reduced acidosis. Fiber addition to diets in the form of WCGF may reduce the need for conventional levels of roughage and reduce N losses by increasing OM excretion. Feed efficiency improved as AH was removed in diets containing 35 % WCGF, suggesting no value of AH in these diets. Manure and compost N was greater with WCGF addition to diets, likely as a result of greater OM excretion. More manure OM was removed from pens fed WCGF; however, N losses were not reduced, presumably as a result of greater N excretion and the effects of warm summer feeding months on NH 3 volatilization. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} summary of the full-scale demonstration efforts involved in the project ''Field Test Program for Long-Term Operation of a COHPAC{reg_sign} System for Removing Mercury from Coal-Fired Flue Gas''. The project took place at Alabama Power's Plant Gaston Unit 3 and involved the injection of sorbent between an existing particulate collector (hot-side electrostatic precipitators) and a COHPAC{reg_sign} fabric filter (baghouse) downstream. Although the COHPAC{reg_sign} baghouse was designed originally for polishing the flue gas, when activated carbon injection was added, the test was actually evaluating the EPRI TOXECON{reg_sign} configuration. The results from the baseline tests with no carbon injection showed that the <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency</b> in the COHPAC{reg_sign} unit was much higher than expected, and was above the target maximum <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1. 5 pulses/bag/hour (p/b/h), which was used during the Phase I test in 2001. There were times when the baghouse was cleaning continuously at 4. 4 p/b/h. In the 2001 tests, there was virtually no mercury removal at baseline conditions. In this second round of tests, mercury removal varied between 0 and 90 %, and was dependent on inlet mass loading. There was a much higher amount of ash exiting the electrostatic precipitators (ESP), creating an inlet loading greater than the design conditions for the COHPAC{reg_sign} baghouse. Tests were performed to try to determine the cause of the high ash loading. The LOI of the ash in the 2001 baseline tests was 11 %, while the second baseline tests showed an LOI of 17. 4 %. The LOI is an indication of the carbon content in the ash, which can affect the native mercury uptake, and can also adversely affect the performance of ESPs, allowing more ash particles to escape the unit. To overcome this, an injection scheme was implemented that balanced the need to decrease carbon injection during times when inlet loading to the baghouse was high and increase carbon injection when inlet loading and mercury removal were low. The resulting mercury removal varied between 50 and 98 %, with an overall average of 85. 6 %, showing that the process was successful at removing high percentages of vapor-phase mercury even with a widely varying mass loading. In an effort to improve baghouse performance, high-permeability bags were tested. The new bags made {{a significant difference in the}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency</b> of the baghouse. Before changing the bags, the baghouse was often in a continuous clean of 4. 4 p/b/h, but with the new bags the <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency</b> was very low, at less than 1 p/b/h. Alternative sorbent tests were also performed using these high-permeability bags. The results of these tests showed that most standard, high-quality activated carbon performed similarly at this site; low-cost sorbent and ash-based sorbents were not very effective at removing mercury; and chemically enhanced sorbents did not appear to offer any benefits over standard activated carbons at this site...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted {{to aid in the}} integration of crop and livestock systems. A study was initiated to evaluate the impact of spring corn residue grazing and tillage on subsequent crop yields in a corn-soybean rotation. Crop yields were evaluated for two different stocking rates. Normal stocking rates showed no detrimental impacts of grazing or tillage on subsequent crop yields. At higher stocking rates (2. 5 times normal) grazing increased soybean yields. However, corn yields were depressed under no-tillage 2 years post grazing. The results from this study suggest that producers can maintain livestock on crop acres in the spring if soybeans are planted the subsequent growing season. ^ Another study evaluated transgenic (Corn Rootworm protected and Roundup Ready®) corn and non-transgenic corn for residue grazing. Growth performance of steers grazing corn residue from transgenic corn or their respective non-transgenic control was not different. This demonstrates that the feeding value of corn residue does not differ between transgenic corn hybrids and their parental controls. ^ A trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of increasing levels of salt (NaCl) inclusion on animal performance and feed intake. Cattle were individually fed one of five treatments to include increasing levels of NaCl in the supplement from 0 to 0. 5 % of diet DM.

Esta infecção não é influenciada pelo sexo das aves, mas é significativamente afetada pelo tipo de recinto, contato com as fezes, uso de parasiticidas, tipo de alimentação e frequência de limpeza. Indicando que para a manutenção em cativeiro estes fatores devem ser observados...|$|R
40|$|Background. The Office Illness Project In {{northern}} Sweden, comprising both {{a screening}} questionnaire study of 4943 office workers and a case-referent study of facial skin symptoms in 163 subjects was recently completed. Previously published {{results from the}} survey showed that female gender, asthma/rhinitis, high psychosocial work load, visual display terminal (VDT) and paperwork were related to an increased prevalence of facial skin symptoms. Methods. The case-referent study {{presented in this paper}} used data from the questionnaire supplemented by information from a clinical examination, a survey of psychosocial factors at work, building data and VDT-related factors from inspection and measurements taken at the work site. Results. Psychosocial conditions and exposure to electromagnetic fields or conditions associated with such factors were related to an increased occurrence of skin symptoms. The results also Indicated that personal factors such as atopic dermatitis and physical exposure factors Influencing Indoor air quality, such as paper exposure and <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency</b> were related to an Increased prevalence of symptoms. Conclusions. The results suggest that skin symptoms reported by VDT users have a multifactorial background...|$|R
40|$|Two experiments, calves fed November to May (WINTER) and yearlings fed May to September (SUMMER), were {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of feeding {{a high level of}} wet distillers grains plus soluble (WDGS) and wheat straw or a corn control diet (CON) on average daily gain (ADG), feed-to-gain (F:G), manure nitrogen (N), and N losses. In both experiments, the CON treatment had greater dry matter intake(DMI), ADG hot carcass weight (HCW), marbling and fat depth. There was greater N intake and N excretion for both the WINTER and SUMMER experiments on the WDGS. However, for the WINTER experiment {{there was no difference in}} the amount of N in the manure due to diet or pen <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency.</b> In the SUMMER experiment, cleaning pens monthly almost doubled dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), and N removed in manure. There was a tendency for the WDGS treatment to have greater N loss than the control treatment in the WINTER experiment and a significant increase in N losses for the WDGS treatment in the SUMMER experiment, despite the greater amount of manure N removed...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{technology}} is being increasingly {{used in the}} treatment of waters and wastewaters. The two main costs associated with the adoption of membrane filtration are the membrane module cost and the energy cost. Tradeoffs between selection of membrane capital cost and energy cost are usually identified for process optimisation; however, environmental tradeoffs associated with different operating conditions have received less attention. In order to ensure the sustainable use of membrane filtration, environmental considerations should also influence the choice of operating conditions. Here, we report on application of the method of life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the environmental performance of different operating conditions of a microfiltration membrane (MF) process. Different membrane chemical cleaning options are compared in the sensitivity analysis component of the study. The results show that operating the MF process at a low flux with a high maximum transmembrane pressure (TMP max) offers the most environmentally favourable outcome. The sensitivity analysis results show that in the low flux range, the choice of chemical <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency</b> can affect the overall environmental performance of the process. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Black liquor, a {{strongly}} polluting byproduct from the kraft pulping process in {{pulp and paper}} mills, is traditionally treated by being passed through multiple effect evaporators and burned in a recovery boiler to produce energy and recover chemicals. However, the traditional treatment of black liquor is not economically viable for the small-scale kraft paper mills in India that uses waste agricultural products as raw material to produce brown paper. Membrane ultrafiltration treatment has been advocated by many scholars as a possible alternative treatment method for black liquor, and this study attempts to address industrial concerns on the cost-effectiveness of membranes for black liquor concentration and treatment. Utilizing a cross-flow hollow fiber membrane module in a recirculation system operating under constant pressure, black liquor is recirculated through the system {{over an extended period}} of time to observe the quantity and quality of the lignin in the concentrate and the permeate, and how they vary over time. Additionally, the permeate flux rate change over time is also observed to determine the required <b>frequency</b> of <b>cleaning</b> membranes from reversible fouling of membranes, as well as the frequency to replace membranes due to irreversible fouling. Cost of cleaning and changing membranes, as well as the profit gained from lignin retained can be estimated and compared with literature to determine the cost-effectiveness of ultrafiltration membranes in treating black liquor. Experimental results suggest that operating at a pressure of 207 kPa and a cross-flow velocity of 1. 06 m/s, the average permeate flux of black liquor is 7 - 21 LMH when concentrating lignin in black liquor from a concentration of 38 g/L to 185 g/L, which compares favorably to literature results. However, a membrane <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency</b> of every 4 to 6 hours and an estimated membrane lifetime of several weeks, predicted by experimental results, significantly raises the cost of cleaning and changing membranes in comparison to the commonly estimated membrane <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency</b> of once per day and lifetime of 1. 5 year in literature. The permeate lignin concentration, which increased up to 40 g/L at the end of a concentration cycle, would also decrease the profit gained from reusing the permeate stream in the cooking process. The increased cost factors associated with both intense membrane fouling and the need for permeate stream retreatment require to be addressed in future research, in order to more comprehensively evaluate membrane filtration process as a cost-effective alternative for treating black liquor. by Xiaoyuan "Charlene" Ren.

40|$|AbstractThe {{state of}} Qatar has {{established}} firm renewable energy deployment {{targets for the}} next decade, using primarily solar photovoltaic technologies. Qatar, in the Arabian Peninsula, is in the MENA Region, where the solar resource is fairly abundant, but local environmental conditions are challenging, particularly, high ambient temperatures all-year round, a dusty atmosphere due to high aerosol content, and water scarcity, which impact negatively on PV system performance and reliability. The Solar Test Facility (STF) at the Qatar Science & Technology Park (QSTP) was founded in 2012 for {{the main purpose of}} contributing to the achievement of Qatar's sustainable energy technology deployment targets. STF provides scientific and technical capabilities for testing and evaluation of solar technologies under the specific local climate conditions. This paper presents the results of outdoor exposure of a specific model of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) photovoltaic (PV) modules after their first complete year of operation at STF. The impact of module <b>cleaning</b> <b>frequency,</b> use of commercial anti- soiling coatings and module mounting on either fixed, one-axis-tracking or two-axis-tracking systems was studied. These results give some indication of the next steps to be taken and the solutions that would eventually work for the improvement of both the energy yield and the durability of PV systems deployed in this region...|$|R
