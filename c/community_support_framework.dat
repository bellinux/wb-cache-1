The reform of the Structural Funds has had three consequences for power shifts between the European Community, the nation state and the regions. Firstly, it has caused more power to be directed away from the national level towards the European Community level. Secondly, it has increased European Community involvement in national and regional affairs, and the regional level has acquired more power in this process. Finally, centralisation of jurisdiction by means of more extensive and detailed regional policy packages has led to increasing fiscal dependence of regions on European Community funding...|$|R

40|$|The {{new model}} of {{agricultural}} policy in Europe, applied through the rural development programs (RDPs), has been considered most appropriate for the case of Greece, given the structural problems of this country?s farm sector (including the high proportion of mountainous, less favoured areas in the country?s territory) and {{the new wave of}} return migration to rural areas ? {{as a result of the}} uneven regional impact that the current crisis and the austerity measures it led to have had for regions exposed to the global vicissitudes (i. e. urban areas and former industrialized regions). An integral part of the rural development policy of the CAP is a decentralized type of governance, based on a ?bottom-up? approach and implemented through the Leader programs. Within this context, regional and local actors, state or private, are assigned a substantial role in designing and implementing RDPs in their localities through the creation of horizontal or vertical synergies. Though the Leader philosophy can be instrumental in the successful application of RDPs in Greek rural regions (possibly aided by the new administrative division ? the Kallicrates), it has been rather little researched and investigated. This paper aims at ?filling this gap? in the literature by examining the possibilities of introducing the bottom up approach in the governance of rural regions in Greece, where the old-type ?sectoral? (vs. the holitistic development) approach continues to dominate agricultural policy and where local decisions have traditionally (and certainly in the last 30 years or so) been controlled and directed by the central state. A crucial question is can the leader-based type of governance help in the regeneration of the country-side and the promotion of internal cohesion in Greece? The methodology basically includes a comparison between leader programs of various periods as well as between the bottom-up approach and the one prevailing before the adoption of the <b>Community</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Frameworks</b> (CSFs) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the context}} of large {{homogeneous}} retrieval systems, metrics like precision and recall have been established to assess the effectiveness. Nevertheless, measuring Web search effectiveness is a new challenge regarding the heterogeneity of highly dynamic Web content. Currently, users select a Web search engine by their individual preferences and the evaluation of effectiveness is a subjective measure defined by the user. Since there are different emphases for each single user, those user-defined measures cannot be quantified in a common way. On this account we propose a new Web system, where the effectiveness is continuously evaluated by explicit user feedback in terms of personalized ranking lists. This local rankings can be accumulated and evaluated according to different goals: accumulation leads to a wider base of ranked and validated results. Furthermore, the aggregate ranking lists {{can be used to}} identify topics as well as communities of interest.

These changes are to be completed through finance by the National Strategic Reference Framework 2007 - 2013 (NSRF). • The unconditional connection of the universities with the market economy and their almost exclusive orientation to technical subject studies lapse them from their social and institutional role and lead them to the falsification of their public status and the decline of human studies...|$|R

It will analyse the change in the relative weight of sectors, regions and social groups that occurs through successive planning exercises. It will compare such change with developments in the E.

Moreover to compare expressed objectives, derived from programme documents, with actual priorities, emerging from the phase of implementation through the concentration of resources and the relative weight of interventions.

It is finally worth examining the relationship between regional programme objectives and national policy priorities as the latter are expressed in the sectoral programmes also included in the CSFs of the above period. To what extent the former support national policy priorities and to what extent the latter serve the overriding goal of a more balanced regional development?
