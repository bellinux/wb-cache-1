5|$|Another {{quantum effect}} that predicts the {{occurrence}} of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect; under certain conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant, regardless of {{the thickness of the}} barrier. This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, no information <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> using this effect.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{a target}} for planet finding {{programs}} because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder, it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to Epsilon Eridani.|$|E

5|$|On October 15, {{the game}} {{received}} update 1.2 that added cloud saving, survival mode, Russian language support and Piper, a character from Fallout 4 available only for iOS version through lunchboxes. The update added a statistics page, ability to skip tutorial {{and a new}} gameplay feature where dwellers can loot equipment from dead raiders. Later in October, the game received a Halloween-themed update that added room decorations and outfits. The update removed the limit introduced in the previous update on number of dwellers that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to explore the Wasteland.|$|E
5|$|Other major {{subsystems}} in the E-3 Sentry are navigation, communications, and computers. Fourteen consoles display computer-processed data in graphic and {{tabular format}} on video screens. Console operators perform surveillance, identification, weapons control, battle management and communications functions. The radar and computer subsystems on the E-3 can gather and present broad and detailed battlefield information. This includes position and tracking information on enemy aircraft and ships, and location {{and status of}} friendly aircraft and naval vessels. The information <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to major command and control centers in rear areas or aboard ships. In times of crisis, data can be forwarded to the National Command Authority in the U.S. via RC-135 or naval aircraft carrier task forces.|$|E
5|$|Players control {{one of two}} diamond trading companies: the eponymous Diamond Trust of London or {{an unnamed}} Antwerp-based competitor. The game is set in 2000 and {{the aim is to}} extract {{diamonds}} from Angola before the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme is put in place. The winner is the one who finishes the game with the most diamonds after nine turns. Each turn, players decide where to send their three agents. They <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to six different Angolan regions to extract diamonds, or recalled to the player's headquarters to deposit extracted diamonds. Players make decisions in secret, and both sets of decisions are resolved on the game board simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Ben then visits Jack, {{telling him}} his real name, {{and that he}} has lived on the island all his life. He offers that if Jack cooperates, he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> home. Jack {{believes}} the Others are also stranded just as he is, but Ben informs him of the exact time and date of his plane crash and that 69 days have since passed (making the date November 29, 2004) and insists that they are in contact with the outside world. He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of Christopher Reeve and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts laughing and says that proves he is lying. Ben then proves it by playing a recording of the final play in the game as Jack watches in shock.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to}} the information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E
5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> faster than c.|$|E

5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity {{can be used}} to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Privacy Control can warn users when sending {{confidential}} information. It {{can also}} be configured to block the transmission. It allows users to specify how the information can sent, such as via IM or e-mail. Item-specific exceptions allow users to control where there data <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent.</b> However, PC Pro found a flaw in the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted {{on the list of}} confidential information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of a credit card number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in four digits. PC Magazine also noted the fact anyone who can login to the computer can view the database of private information. For that reason, Symantec recommends entering only the last portion of sensitive information.|$|E
5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. The locomotive is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key is locked {{in such a way that}} it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{main hub}} is the Comet Observatory, a {{spaceship}} which contains six themed domes that {{provide access to}} the 42 galaxies available in the game. Five of the domes end with a boss level in which {{the objective is to}} defeat Bowser or Bowser Jr., which then gives the player access to the next dome via acquiring a collectable called a Grand Star. The player only has access to a few galaxies when they begin the game; as more Power Stars are collected, more galaxies become available. The player is awarded the ability to play as Luigi after collecting 120 Power Stars as Mario. Once 120 Power Stars are collected with both characters, the player is rewarded one further challenge for Mario and Luigi to complete, which upon completion, awards the player with two commemorative pictures that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to the Wii Message Board.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} repairs are the {{grinding}} of the wheels; more complicated repairs {{are made by}} replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer. By having components in reserve, trains can have shorter maintenance times. The center also has the system's work trains, including a diesel locomotive that can fetch broken trains. At any time, there are four people working at the control center. Two monitor the ATC system, one monitors passenger information, while the last is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, {{there is always a}} team of technicians who <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Russian Federation {{had one of}} {{the highest}} levels of {{psychiatric}} beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need {{to increase the number of}} places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.|$|E
