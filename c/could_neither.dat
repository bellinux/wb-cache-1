5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are relieved {{that they did not have}} to make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that <b>could</b> <b>neither</b> have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E
5|$|Oryol {{took the}} lead after Borodino was sunk; she was joined by Nebogatov's Second Division after Tōgō ordered the Japanese battleships to {{disengage}} in the gathering darkness. Nebogatov assumed command of {{the remains of the}} fleet and they continued towards Vladivostok. The ships were discovered by the Japanese early the following morning and attacked by Tōgō's battleships around 10:00. The faster Japanese ships stayed beyond the range at which Nebogatov's ships could effectively reply and he decided to surrender his ships at 10:30 as he <b>could</b> <b>neither</b> return fire nor close the range.|$|E

5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} and tapu (sacred matters) in the Cook Islands {{was controlled by}} ariki (high chiefs), with typically between three and six per island. Each ariki was a ruler of an ivi or ngati (tribe). Lesser noble ranks in the social hierarchy were the mataiapo and rangatira (minor chiefs). The chief's control, which <b>could</b> <b>neither</b> be gained or lost, was established by his mana (power), which derived from his birth, achievements and status. However, an ariki with declining popularity could be perceived to be lacking in mana, which {{might lead to a}} loss of social control.|$|E
5|$|The Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—achieved several {{victories}} at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, but {{in northern}} Italy, they <b>could</b> <b>neither</b> lift nor escape the siege at Mantua. The efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian {{forces to the}} border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, leading to the formal Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797. Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought so hard to acquire, including the strategic river crossings at Hüningen and Kehl, as well as key cities further north.|$|E
5|$|The game Donner–Tal, Zurich 1959, was {{a classic}} {{demonstration}} {{of the power of}} Black's queenside pawn advance, backed up by the bishop on g7. After Black's 20...Qb4! White was unable to exchange queens, as 21.Qxb4 cxb4 22.Nd1 Nc5 would fork the pawns on a4 and e4. However, the actual game did not last long after Donner's 21.Qf1: Tal set his pawns in motion with 21...c4 22.Re2 b5 23.axb5 axb5 24.Kh1, created a passed c-pawn with 24...Bxc3! 25.bxc3 Qxc3 26.Rxb5 Qd3 27.Qe1 c3 28.Rb1, and forced Donner's resignation with 28...Nc5! when White <b>could</b> <b>neither</b> save his e-pawn nor stop Black's c-pawn from queening. According to Donner, while he spent over two hours on the game, Tal used only fifteen minutes.|$|E

5|$|The {{surviving}} Russian {{ships were}} spotted {{the next morning}} and the Japanese ships opened fire and stayed beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he <b>could</b> <b>neither</b> return fire nor close the range. During the battle, Asama was struck by about a dozen shells that killed 11 men and wounded 13 more. In contrast, Tokiwa was struck by eight shells that caused only minor damage, but killed 1 crewman and wounded 14. After the battle, the division covered amphibious landings in northeastern Korea in July and August before the war ended.|$|E
5|$|After 17:30 Kamimura led his {{division}} in a fruitless pursuit {{of some of}} the Russian cruisers, leaving Tōgō's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when the range closed to 8000–9000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20:08 as night was falling. The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he <b>could</b> <b>neither</b> return fire nor close the range.|$|E
5|$|In the unreformed House of Commons to {{be either}} a {{candidate}} or an elector for a county seat, a man had to own (not rent) freehold property valued for the land tax at two pounds a year (women <b>could</b> <b>neither</b> vote nor stand for election). This {{was known as the}} 40/- freehold. The franchise for borough seats varied enormously. Originally in Peterborough the dean and chapter had claimed the franchise and held that only residents of Minster Precincts were burgesses. By the interregnum, the city was one of 37 boroughs in which suffrage was restricted to those paying scot and lot, a form of municipal taxation. In 1800 there were 2,000 registered voters in Northamptonshire and 400 in Peterborough. By 1835 this was 576, or about one per cent of the population. Bribery was general until the introduction of the secret ballot under the Ballot Act 1872. Votes were cast by spoken declaration, in public, at the hustings, erected on the Market Place (now Cathedral Square).|$|E

5|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 {{conducted}} on P. neimongoliensis and P. mongoliensis {{concluded that the}} forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other Psittacosaurus species) were too short (only about 58% {{as long as the}} hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they <b>could</b> <b>neither</b> be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that Psittacosaurus was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if Psittacosaurus needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, Psittacosaurus could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.|$|E
5|$|With the Australian and Viet Cong {{positions}} now {{too close}} to each other, O'Halloran <b>could</b> <b>neither</b> move forward nor withdraw. Artillery began to fire {{in support of the}} Australians, however it initially fell too far to the rear to be effective, and it had to be adjusted by the B Company forward observer, Captain Jim Ryan, himself under heavy fire. 5 Platoon was still in danger of becoming isolated and O'Brien now suggested he move A Company forward to assist B Company, however this was rejected by Mackay who feared the two companies clashing in the confusion. Meanwhile, O'Halloran called for the APCs to come forward to provide assistance, while the platoon sergeant—Sergeant Mervyn McCullough—guided a section from 6 Platoon forward to reinforce 5 Platoon, and begin evacuating the casualties. Bolstered by reinforcements and with accurate artillery covering fire O'Halloran now felt that he {{was in a position to}} extract his platoon. Yet at that moment two rounds from one of the howitzers fell short, and while one of the shells harmlessly exploded against a tree, the other landed just to the right of the 5 Platoon headquarters, killing two men and wounding eight others, including six of the seven reinforcements from 6 Platoon. Following an urgent radio call from O'Halloran, the artillery ceased fire. Shortly afterwards an RPG round hit the same area, wounding McCullough.|$|E

25|$|This {{decision}} {{at that time}} caused polemics in Switzerland, started by the Swiss Italian art historian Piero Bianconi.
