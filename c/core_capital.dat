40|$|The {{last three}} decades have {{witnessed}} {{a great deal of}} research effort devoted to measur-ing the private output elasticity of public capital. However, the wide range of available estimates have precluded any consensus so far. This paper reconciles the empirical find-ings of the literature by quantitatively analyzing a sample of 578 estimates collected from 68 studies for the 1983 – 2008 period. Using meta-regression analysis, we find an average output elasticity of public capital of 0. 082. We show that a large fraction of the variation across estimates is explained by study design characteristics, publication bias, and, most important, true effect heterogeneity. In addition, we find a short-run output elasticity of public capital supplied at the central government level of 0. 051. This estimate is roughly doubled if primary studies only consider <b>core</b> public <b>capital</b> installed at a regional/local level of government and is about three times larger in the long run. Our results suggest that <b>core</b> public <b>capital</b> is undersupplied in OECD economies...|$|R
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] study addresses the following: (1) does a team leader change along {{with the quality of}} the team’s human capital affect post-change team performance?; (2) is functional leadership of the team’s human capital a driver of post-change team performance?; and (3) should interim vs. permanent leaders manage the team’s human capital differently? We analyzed archival data from Major League Baseball teams who had undergone an in-season manager change (N = 129). Team performance improved after a leader change, {{and the quality of the}} team’s strategic and nonstrategic <b>core</b> human <b>capital</b> were positively related to postchange performance. New leaders who engaged in more active functional leadership of the strategic <b>core</b> human <b>capital</b> enhanced the positive effects of human capital quality. Additionally, active functional leadership enhanced the positive effects of strategic <b>core</b> human <b>capital</b> for interim replacement leaders, but not for permanent replacement leaders. This study extends theory and practice on the importance of functional team leadership and human capital following a leader transition. As such, our results provide actionable knowledge for organizations and managers who are part of leadership transitions. This empirical study leverages a unique sample to provide insights into the implications of team leader transitions. The results of this study shed light on the impact that leader transitions which involve “interim” and “permanent” replacements may have on post-transition team performance and how these different types of leaders should leverage the inherent human capital that exists within the team...|$|R

Capital ratios also vary over the economic cycle. These findings have implications for the ongoing review of international capital standards. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{situation}} {{is common in}} many developing countries. A developing economy, still coming out painfully from the productive limitations of mass agriculture; long years of colonialism or fiscal siphoning off from regional peripheries to <b>cores.</b> <b>Capital</b> investment typically flows away from these territories towards the heartland of North America and Western Europe. Employment is precarious and risk capital hard to come by. The provision of services directly related to one's quality of life - such as energy, telecommunications, water, housing, education, health and social security - fall also within the ambit of the state, often out of simple default. All this {{in the context of}} an expanding population, with many consumer tastes and habits influenced by the Western world. In these situations, it is inevitable to find the state playing a key role in the development process. The responsibility to provide employment and to create productive investment in the absence of local or foreign capital predisposes the state towards assuming a major role in the economy; one which is broader and wider than that of the stewardship and monitoring effected by states in more developed economies. The outcome is usually a bloated public sector with substantial levels of underemployment, and a sprawling parastatal sector with under-productive or inefficient corporations and utilities whose running expenses and losses are justified on the basis of political and social arguments: jobs, strategic industries, basic needs provision. peer-reviewe...|$|R
