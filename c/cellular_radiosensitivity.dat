5000|$|Several human syndromes are {{associated}} with dysfunctional NHEJ. [...] Hypomorphic mutations in LIG4 and XLF cause LIG4 syndrome and XLF-SCID, respectively. These syndromes share many features including <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity,</b> microcephaly and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to defective V(D)J recombination. Loss-of-function mutations in Artemis also cause SCID, but these patients do not show the neurological defects associated with LIG4 or XLF mutations.

Artemis is a nuclease and is thought to be required only for repair of DSBs with damaged ends, whereas DNA Ligase IV and XLF are required for all NHEJ events.

To determine what molecular assays are predictive of <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> whatever the genes mutations, {{the existence of}} a quantitative correlation between <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> and unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) repair defects was examined in a collection of 40 human fibroblasts representing 8 different syndromes.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Survival fraction at 2 Gy was found to be inversely proportional to the amount of unrepaired DSB, whatever the genes mutations and the assay applied. However, no single assay discriminates the full range of human radiosensitivity. Particularly, nuclear foci formed by the phosphorylation of H 2 AX do not predict well moderate radiosensitivities.

Cell lines which expressed mutp 53 protein were all relatively radioresistant and exhibited no relationship between RAF 1 protein and <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity.</b> Cell lines expressing wtp 53 protein, however, showed a strong relationship between RAF 1 protein levels and the radiosensitivity parameter SF 2. In addition, when post-irradiation perturbation of G 2 /M transit was compared using the parameter T 50 (time after the peak of G 2 /M delay at which 50 % of the cells had exited from a block induced by 2 Gy of irradiation), RAF 1 was related to T 50 in wtp 53, but not mutp 53, cell lines. Cell lines which expressed wtp 53 protein and high levels of RAF 1 had shorter T 50 s and were also more radiosensitive.

Radiosensitivity was quantified as the surviving fraction after a radiation dose of 2 Gy irrespective of cell type (overall SF 2), or based on identification of cell type (tumour cell SF 2, fibroblast SF 2). Sixty-three biopsies were from primary tumours, and eight were from recurrences. Overall plating efficiency ranged from 0. 005 to 1. 60 % with a median of 0. 052 %. The majority of the colonies obtained from the biopsies were fibroblast marker-positive; the proportion of tumour marker-positive colonies ranged from 1 to 88 % with a median of 15 %. The median overall SF 2 was 0. 47 (range 0. 24 – 0. 96), the median tumour cell SF 2 was 0. 50 (range 0. 11 – 1. 0) and the median fibroblast SF 2 was 0. 49 (range 0. 24 – 1. 0). Comparing data from independent experiments, the overall SF 2 was significantly correlated with the SF 2 of fibroblasts (2 P = 0. 006) but not with the tumour cell SF 2. The tumour cell and fibroblast radiosensitivities measured in the same individuals were not correlated (r = 0. 06, 95 % CI [– 0. 19, 0. 30]). This finding seems to preclude a strong correlation between the radiosensitivity of tumour cells and fibroblasts. Concerning the clinical characteristics, neither of the measures of tumour radiosensitivity was correlated with T- and N-category, stage, tumour size, sex and age. However, the tumour cell radiosensitivity decreased with increasing grade of histopathological differentiation (2 P = 0. 012). The same tendency was found in two independent analyses of the same patient material.

40|$|The human {{neurodegenerative}} {{and cancer}} predisposition condition ataxia-telangiectasia is characterized at the <b>cellular</b> level by <b>radiosensitivity,</b> chromosomal instability, and impaired induction of ionizing radiation-induced cell cycle checkpoint controls. Recent work {{has revealed that}} the gene defective in ataxia-telangiectasia, termed ATM, encodes an ≈ 350 -kDa polypeptide, ATM, that {{is a member of}} the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase family. We show that ATM binds DNA and exploit this to purify ATM to near homogeneity. Atomic force microscopy reveals that ATM exists in two populations, with sizes consistent with monomeric and tetrameric states. Atomic force microscopy analyses also show that ATM binds preferentially to DNA ends. This property is similar to that displayed by the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase family member that functions in DNA damage detection in conjunction with the DNA end-binding protein Ku. Furthermore, purified ATM contains a kinase activity that phosphorylates serine- 15 of p 53 in a DNA-stimulated manner.

40|$|Determination of {{an optimal}} Clinical Target Volume (CTV) margin is {{generally}} challenging since the exact extent of microscopic disease to be encompassed by the CTV cannot be fully visualized using current imaging techniques and therefore remains uncertain. The {{aim of this}} work was to establish a treatment-modelling framework for evaluation of current CTV practices in terms of tumour clonogen survival fraction following treatment. An integrated radiobiological model has been developed for this purpose, using the Monte Carlo (MC) toolkit Geant 4. In {{order to determine the}} tumour site with high discrepancy/ uncertainty in terms of the CTV margin definition, a comprehensive literature review was conducted. As a result, Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) was identified to be the subject of this research work. Model Development The architecture of the MC model consists of three main components: 1) simulation of a GBM tumour with diffusions of tumour cells beyond the limit of the CTV, called Microscopic Extension Probability (MEP) model; 2) irradiation of the GBM model; and 3) cell survival calculation. GBM treatment modelling using 6 MV conventional X-ray therapy A model of GBM and its microscopic extension was developed using MATLAB® (Math- Work® Natick, MA). The input parameters required for the simulation were obtained from published clinical literature data. The MC toolkit Geant 4 was used for the second component of the model. The input code enabled simulation of geometry (i. e. the GBM model), the radiation beam, and detailed transport of each particle tracked throughout the geometry until coming to rest. As a result absorbed dose was calculated in individual cells. In the third component of the model, predicting survival probability for each individual tumour cell within the in silico model, was achieved using a combination of Matlab codes developed in this work and Geant 4 outputs imported into Matlab. The Linear Quadratic (LQ) model was used to calculate cell survival probabilities. Homogeneous and normoxic GBM The first study considered a simplified model of GBM consisting of a population of cells with homogeneous radiosensitivities represented in terms of α and β parameters of the LQ model. At this stage of the study, hypoxic cells were not considered. A Geant 4 cellular model was developed to calculate the absorbed dose in individual cells represented by cubic voxels of 20 μm sides. The system was irradiated with opposing 6 MV X-ray beams. The beams encompassed planning target volumes corresponding to 2. 0 and 2. 5 cm CTV margins. As a result, Survival Fraction (SFs) following x-ray EBRT were calculated for various simulation set-ups including different cellular p 53 gene status, CTV margin extensions and ME propagations in regions of interest. Heterogeneous and hypoxic GBM The next stage of the project focused on expanding the GBM model to incorporate other radiobiological parameters affecting <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivities.</b> Oxygenation and heterogeneous radiosensitivity profiles were incorporated into the GBM model. The genetic heterogeneity was modelled using a range of α/β values associated with different GBM cell lines, obtained from published clinical data. Cellular oxygen pressure taken from a sample weighted to literature-based profiles was randomly distributed. Three types of GBM models were analysed: homogeneous-normoxic, heterogeneous-normoxic, and heterogeneous-hypoxic. The SF in different regions of the tumour model and the effect of the CTV margin extension from 2. 0 - 2. 5 cm on SFs were investigated for three MEP models. The results of this study for a virtual GBM model suggested that radiobiological damage caused by x-ray beams may not be sufficient to kill or sterilize GBM cell populations, and the tumour is most likely to relapse in the treatment volume. Therefore, the ultimate aim of the x-ray therapy of these tumours may be extension of time to recurrence rather than cure. This conclusion led the direction of the study to another modality which could potentially offer more promising treatment outcome for GBM. GBM treatment modelling using Boron Neutron Capture Therapy Recent technological advances have enabled other modalities to be developed, including charged particle radiation and targeted therapies, to be developed. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a biochemically-targeted type of radiotherapy where thermal neutrons are captured by ¹⁰B, resulting in the emission of high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) α-particles and re-coiling ⁷Li nucleus. This is a binary modality in which a suitable ¹⁰B agent is taken up preferentially by malignant cells. The clustered damage produced by high LET radiation could selectively destroy cancer cells dispersed in normal tissue, with minimal normal tissue toxicity. This makes BNCT an appropriate modality for infiltrative GBM. A realistic neutron beam model was developed in Geant 4 and verified against published data. The system was defined as a cubic phantom divided to 20 μm side voxels (the average size of glioma cells) and irradiated with an epithermal neutron beam. Typical ¹⁰B concentrations in GBM and normal brain cells were obtained from literature. Each cell was then assigned a ¹⁰B concentration depending on its MEP status. Nested parameterisation method was used, to assign each cell with its corresponding material, which was built in Geant 4 using brain composition with added boron atoms. Results from the cell-based dosimetry model and the MEP models were combined to evaluate SFs for CTV margins of 2. 0 & 2. 5 cm, and different infiltration distributions in regions of interest. Conclusion A novel Monte Carlo-based approach has been employed by this project aiming to address a clinically important question. The integrated GBM radiobiological model is a tool to quantitatively evaluate the impact of different CTV margins for GBM on cancer cell survival. It is believed that the information acquired during this research will be useful for clinicians to optimize treatment prescription for glioblastoma multiforme patients using x-ray therapy and boron neutron capture therapy.

Both patients presented with immunoglobulin deficiency, telangiectasia, <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity,</b> and increased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. The younger sibling had a more pronounced neurological and morphological phenotype, and she also carried an ATM gene mutation in the heterozygous state.

Overexpression of exogenous p 73 α by transfection in the radioresistant cells resulted in a significant increase of cellular sensitivity to radiation. Enhanced radiosensitivity in p 73 α-transfected cells was attributed by increase of cellular apoptosis.

There is, however, a growing interest in reconstructing <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> (measured by colony assay) from concurrent micronucleus and apoptosis data. Using a variety of radiosensitive and radioresistant cell lines, we have derived a missing parameter - Poe, the probability of cell death by other events such as small deletions, chromosome aberrations, late apoptosis and necrosis which are undetectable by micronucleus and apoptosis assays performed at a single time point. In the radioresistant glioma cell lines G 120, G 60, G 28, G 44 and G 62 (SF 2 ≥ 0. 59), a characteristic threshold dose exists above which cell loss due to undetectable lesions occurs. In the radiosensitive SK-N-SH and KELLY cell lines (SF 2 ≤ 0. 43), the Poe parameter is positive at very low doses, reaches a maximum and declines at higher doses.

In the G 62, G 44 and G 120 cell lines, the threshold doses to induce Poe events were 0. 87, 3. 04 and 3. 85 Gy, respectively. Cell death by undetectable lesions is a cell-specific and time-dependent variable.

When S/S cells (mid-) G 1 + 8 h in the cycle, {{at the peak of}} radioresistance, were X-irradiated at 37 degrees C and then treated hyperthermically (12 h, 38. 7 - 40. 3 degrees C), the survival curve, which has a shoulder at 37 degrees C, changed progressively to the simple exponential obtained for G 1 cells. Under conditions where Ne ions (LET = 35 keV microns- 1) have a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of approximately 2 for normally radioresistant cells in vitro and in situ, the RBE for G 1 S/S cells was approximately 1. Neon ions (1 - 50 Gy) caused similar amounts of DNA damage in S/S cells and photoreceptors, but the cellular responses were very different. After 5 Gy, the surviving fraction of asynchronous S/S cells was 10 (- 5), DNA structures were not restored and by 8 h post-irradiation extensive DNA degradation was evident; in the retina, however, the photoreceptor complement was unchanged for greater than 1 year, DNA structures appeared to be restored and remained so (many months) until late DNA degradation began.

The doubling time of 9 L/Ro cells was slightly faster than that for 9 L/SF cells both in culture and in the brain. The <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> of both i. c. tumour cell sublines was identical when measured immediately after irradiation by an in vitro colony formation assay.

When i. c. 9 L/Ro and 9 L/SF tumours of similar size were treated with fractionated doses of BCNU, X-rays or combinations of the two, the responses of the two tumours were essentially identical.

The <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> of M 4 Be and its seven sublines was estimated using an in vitro colony assay. The total amount of gangliosides in M 4 Be and its seven sublines was determined by cell extraction and thin-layer chromatography, while the expression of GD 3 gangliosides was estimated by flow cytometry with a monoclonal antibody. The radiation-cell survival curves of most clones and variants derived from M 4 Be showed a zero dose extrapolation clearly lower than 100 %, suggesting that two populations of cells of very different radiosensitivity coexist within each of these clones and variants. Although the proportion of radiosensitive cells could be estimated from {{the shape of the}} survival curve, its radiosensitivity is too high to be properly evaluated by the colony assay. The eight survival curves differ essentially in the proportion of radiosensitive cells [...] which varied from 0 % to 40 % among M 4 Be and its seven sublines [...] whereas the <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> of the radioresistant population was similar among them. The metastatic potential in vivo of M 4 Be and its seven sublines was not significantly related to the <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> of their corresponding radioresistant population, but significantly increased with the fraction of radiosensitive cells. This relationship is valid only when the highly metastatic cells are cultured for no more than five passages in vitro as the fraction of radiosensitive cells is rapidly lost during subcultures. The relationship remains valid in vivo as metastatic melanoma-bearing newborn rats whole body irradiated with 20 cGy show no lung metastasis compared with controls. The radiosensitive cell fraction is inversely correlated with both the total ganglioside content (r = 0. 84, P < 0. 02) and the number of cells positively labelled with the monoclonal antibody directed to GD 3 (r = 0. 92, P < 0. 001). The incubation of a radiosensitive clone with the exogenous bovine brain ganglioside GM 1 significantly increases the proportion of radioresistant cells and suppresses its metastatic potential, while the inhibition of the endogenous gangliosides synthesis in the radioresistant cell line M 4 Be increases the proportion of radiosensitive cells. This study provides a possible explanation for the correlation between the metastatic potential and the proportion of radiosensitive cells within the seven sublines derived from a single parental human melanoma cell line...|$|E
40|$|Summary Endogenous and {{exogenous}} thiols {{are thought}} to influence <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> directly by radical scavenging and/or hydrogen donation processes, and indirectly, by regulating the amount of oxygen (or other electron affinic radiosensitiser) able to reach the radiosensitive targets of the cell. The relative importance of these two mechanisms was evaluated in multicell spheroids treated with two agents currently undergoing clinical testing, the thiophosphate WR- 2721 and the glutathione synthesis inhibitor BSO. Fluorescenceactivated cell sorting techniques were used to recover cells selectively from different depths (different oxygenation status) within the spheroids. The radiosensitivity of cell populations recovered from different regions suggested that both agents acted primarily by affecting the oxygenation status of the spheroid. Similarly, the binding of a fluorescent marker for hypoxic cells, the nitrofuran AF- 2, was markedly enhanced by WR- 2721 addition, and decreased by BSO-induced thiol depletion. We conclude that the major radiobiological consequence of thiol manipulation in multicell systems is to increase or decrease the availability of oxygen. A number of different classes of compounds have been studied as potential radiosensitisers and radioprotectors, but oxygen remains the most effective modifier of <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> {{in the absence of}} cytotoxicity. In fact, the search for new sensitisers and protectors has long been confounded by the ability of many such compounds to modify the oxygenation of the test system (Gray, 1956; Bridges, 1969), and thus to act by indirect rather than direct mechanisms. Manipulation of cellular thiols, an accepted method of modifying radiosensitivity, is being increasingly recognised as effective only at relatively low oxygen tensions, that is, for concentrations of oxygen similar to those which produce about half maximal radiosensitisation (Denekamp et al. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevailing}} hypothesis on {{the mechanism}} of radiation-induced cell killing identifies the genetic material deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{as the most important}} subcellular target at biologically relevant doses. In this review we present new data and summarize the role of the DNA double-strand breaks (dsb) induced by ionizing radiation and DNA dsb rejoining as determinants of <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity.</b> When cells were irradiated at high dose-rate, two molecular end-points were identified which often correlated with radiosensitivity: (1) the apparent number of DNA dsb induced per Gy per DNA unit and (2) the half-time of the fast component of the DNA dsb rejoining kinetics. These two molecular determinants, not mutually exclusive, may be linked through a common factor such as the conformation of DNA...|$|E

40|$|Radiotherapy is a {{powerful}} cure for several types of solid tumours, but its application is often limited because of severe side effects in individual patients. With the aim to find biomarkers capable of predicting normal tissue side reactions we analysed the radiation responses of cells from individual head and neck tumour and breast cancer patients of different clinical radiosensitivity in a multicentric study. Multiple parameters of <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> were analysed in coded samples of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 15 clinical radio-hypersensitive tumour patients and compared to age- and sex-matched non-radiosensitive patient controls and 15 lymphoblastoid cell lines from age- and sex- matched healthy controls of the KORA study.

40|$|The role of {{the initial}} DNA double-strand breaks (dsb) as a {{determinant}} of <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> was studied in human breast and bladder cancer cell lines. Cell survival was measured by monolayer colony-forming assay as appropriate and differences in radiosensitivity were seen (alpha-values ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 54). After pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) the initial slopes of dose-response curves were biphasic with a flattening of the curves above 30 Gy. When the frequency of DNA dsb induction was assessed using a mathematical model based on the DNA fragment size distribution into the gel lane, we found a statistically significant relationship {{between the number of}} DNA dsb induced and the corresponding alpha-values and fraction surviving after 2 Gy (P = 0. 0049 and P = 0. 0031 respectively).

40|$|Part 1 : The {{level of}} {{cytogenetic}} damage induced by ionizing radiation under in vitro conditions in human peripheral blood lymphocytes is analyzed {{for the purpose}} of biological dosimetry and for assessing the intrinsic radiosensitivity of the blood donors. A factor that is often not regarded, but may influence the level of DNA damage is blood temperature during exposure. Hence, this part of the thesis was conducted to analyse the impact of temperature during irradiation of lymphocytes at 0 °C and 37 °C on the level of DNA damage using micronucleus assay and comet assay. Whole blood cultures were kept at 0 °C and 37 °C for 15 min before and during exposure to 2 Gy of X-rays. In some experiments isolated PBL were additionally incubated in the presence of 0. 5 M DMSO (radical scavenger). A significantly higher level of micronuclei was found when lymphocytes were kept 15 min before and during exposure at 37 °C when compared to 0 °C. This effect disappeared in the presence of DMSO, what indicates that the observed temperature effect in micronucleus assay is due to the indirect action of radiation. No temperature effect was observed using alkaline and neutral versions of comet assay. Part 2 : There is some evidence that approximately 10 % of the population show an enhanced intrinsic radiosensitivity of normal tissue and hence have a higher risk for developing side-effects during or after radiotherapy. Moreover, higher <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> may also indicate cancer susceptibility. For that reason {{there is a need for}} a fast and robust test to assess individual <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity.</b> Hence, the aim of the second part of the thesis was to find out whether PBL from prostate cancer patients (PC) with strong clinical side effects following radiotherapy show enhanced rates of in vitro radiation-induced DNA damage when compared to patients without side effects and healthy age–matched donors. The study included 20 prostate cancer patients without and 20 patients with acute side-effects during and after radiotherapy, as well as 20 healthy age-matched donors. From each donor, blood samples were collected, exposed to a radiation dose of 0. 5 Gy or 1 Gy of γ–rays and analysed for the following biological endpoints: the initial level of dsb and the repair kinetics (γ–H 2 AX–assay), apoptosis (Annexin V/PI–assay) and the induction of chromatid–type chromosomal aberrations (G 2 –assay). Significant higher chromatid aberration yield was found in prostate cancer patients when compared to healthy donors. No differences were observed between both patients groups in any in vitro assay. Clinical radiosensitivity in vivo assessed on the basis of the EPIC questionnaire correlated with <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> in vitro assessed on the basis of chromatid aberration 90 th cut-off value analysis for 50 - 62 % of prostate cancer patients.

40|$|Purpose: To {{test whether}} {{induction}} of DNA damage is correlated with tumour-cell radiosensitivity. Materials and methods: Initial DNA {{damage caused by}} X-irradiation was measured in ten human tumour cell lines, which largely differed in radiosensitivity, using either the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis assay or the halo technique. Results: None of the parameters of DNA damage correlated with any parameter of <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity.</b> This was not only true when the analysis was performed on all data but also when the analysis was performed after separating the cell lines into radioresistant and sensitive groups. Even when differences in chromosome number, ploidy and cell cycle distribution were taken into account, no significant correlations were obtained. Conclusions: Contrary to previous suggestions, differences {{in the number of}} double-strand breaks induced or chromatin-related 'presentation' of DNA lesions, measured by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or halo respectively, are generally not the dominant factors determining tumour-cell radiosensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Radiotherapy is a {{well-established}} treatment for cancer. However, {{the existence of}} radioresistant cells {{is one of the}} major obstacles in radiotherapy. In order to understand the mechanism of cellular radioresistance and develop more effective radiotherapy, we have established clinically relevant radioresistant (CRR) cell lines, which continue to proliferate under daily exposure to 2 Gray (Gy) of X-rays for > 30 days. X-ray irradiation significantly induced autophagic cells in parental cells, which was exiguous in CRR cells, suggesting that autophagic cell death is involved in <b>cellular</b> <b>radiosensitivity.</b> An autophagy inducer, rapamycin sensitized CRR cells to the level of parental cells and suppressed cell growth. An autophagy inhibitor, 3 -methyladenine induced radioresistance of parental cells. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of Beclin- 1 made parental cells radioresistant to acute radiation. These suggest that the suppression of autophagic cell death but not apoptosis is mainly involved in cellular radioresistance. Therefore, the enhancement of autophagy may have a considerable impact on the treatment of radioresistant tumor...|$|E
