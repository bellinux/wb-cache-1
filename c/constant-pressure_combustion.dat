The recent review article by Kailasanath highlights some of the progress that has been made in comparing the available experimental measurements with analytical and numerical models. In recent work by the author, a quasi-one-dimensional, finite rate chemistry CFD model was utilized to study the gasdynamics and performance characteristics of PDREs over a range of blowdown pressure ratios from 1 - 1000. Models of this type are computationally inexpensive, and enable first-order parametric studies of the effect of several nozzle and extension geometries on PDRE performance over a wide range of conditions. However, the quasi-one-dimensional approach is limited in that it cannot properly capture the multidimensional blast wave and flow expansion downstream of the PDRE, nor can it resolve nozzle flow separation if present. Moreover, the previous work was limited to single-pulse calculations. In this paper, an axisymmetric finite rate chemistry model is described and utilized to study these issues in greater detail. Example Mach number contour plots showing the multidimensional blast wave and nozzle exhaust plume are shown. The performance results are compared with the quasi-one-dimensional results from the previous paper. Both Euler and Navier-Stokes solutions are calculated {{in order to determine the}} effect of viscous effects in the nozzle flowfield.

The goal {{of this paper is to}} improve understanding of PDRE blowdown gasdynamics and performance issues through use of a simplified model that captures the essential features of the unsteady blowdown process, and yet remains computationally inexpensive. The PDRE system studied here is highly idealized, consisting of a constant-area detonation tube with one end closed and the other end open to the environment. The tube is prefilled with a gaseous propellant mixture with no initial velocity or outflow to the environment. The detonation is initiated instantaneously at the closed end of the device. Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) post-detonation gas conditions are calculated using the CET 89 version of the NASA thermochemical code. The I-D, unsteady method of characteristics is used to calculate the flowfield following the detonation front. See the compressible flow texts by Thompson and Zucrow and Hoffman for details of this method. Parametric studies of the effect of mixture stoichiometry, fill temperature, and blowdown pressure ratio on performance are reported. A comparison of the performance of an idealized straight-tube PDRE with a conventional steady-state rocket engine is provided.

These programs have changed over the years to include additional features and improved calculation techniques and to take advantage of constantly improving computer capabilities. The minimization-of-free-energy approach to chemical equilibrium calculations has been used in all versions of the program since 1967. The two principal purposes of this report are presented in two parts. The first purpose, which is accomplished here in part 1, is to present in detail a number of topics of general interest in complex equilibrium calculations.

The recent review article by Kailasanath highlights some of the difficulties in comparing the available experimental measurements with numerical models. In a previous paper by the author, parametric studies of the performance of a single, straight-tube PDRE were reported. A 1 -D, unsteady method of characteristics code, employing a constant-gamma assumption behind the detonation front, was developed for that study. Models of this type are computationally inexpensive, and are particularly useful for parametric performance comparisons. For example, a plot showing the specific impulse of various PDRE and steady-state rocket engine (SSRE) configurations as a function of blowdown pressure ratio. The performance curves clearly indicate that a straight-tube PDRE is superior in specific impulse to a SSRE with a sonic nozzle over the entire range of pressure ratios. Note, however, that a straight-tube PDRE in general does not compare favorably to a SSRE fitted with an optimized de Laval supersonic nozzle, particularly at the high pressure ratios typical for boost or in-space rocket applications. However, the calculations also show that if a dynamically optimized, supersonic de Laval nozzle could be could be fitted to a PDRE, then the specific impulse of the device would exceed that of a comparable SSRE. While such a nozzle is a considerable idealization, it is clear that nozzle design and optimization will {{play a critical role in}} whether the performance potential of PDREs can be effectively realized in practice. In order to study PDRE nozzle issues with greater accuracy, a quasi-one-dimensional, finite-rate chemistry CFD code has been developed by the author. Comparisons of the code with both the previous MOC model and experimental data from Stanford University are reported. The effect of constant-gamma and finite-rate chemistry assumptions on the flowfield and performance is examined.

The thermodynamic efficiency is substantially improved over <b>constant-pressure</b> <b>combustion</b> systems by utilizing detonation-based combustion that occurs typically between 40 and 60 pulses per second. An existing four-inlet combustor was modified to a single-inlet arm design for integration with a rotary-valve concept. This paper discusses the design process of the single-inlet combustor so that it provides the same operation and reliability characteristics as its four-inlet predecessor. The design was derived from analysis through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which compared a variety of single-inlet arm designs to the four-inlet model. Cold flow analysis was achieved with ANSYS CFX software to map the flow field through the combustor. The combustion features inside the engine, were predicted with ANSYS FLUENT software. The inlet dump angle and ignition-shroud were selected from the results in order to support the optimal environment for flame kernel growth and subsequent deflagration to detonation transitions.

40|$|The {{combustion}} mode in a steady-flow {{propulsion system}} {{has a strong}} influence on the overall efficiency of the system. To evaluate {{the relative merits of}} different modes, we propose that it is most appropriate to keep the upstream stagnation state fixed and the wave stationary within the combustor. Because of the variable wave speed and upstream stagnation state, the conventional Hugoniot analysis of combustion waves is inappropriate for this purpose. To remedy this situation, we propose a new formulation of the analysis of stationary combustion waves for a fixed initial stagnation state, which we call the stagnation Hugoniot. For a given stagnation enthalpy, we find that stationary detonation waves generate a higher entropy rise than deflagration waves. The combustion process generating the lowest entropy increment is found to be <b>constant-pressure</b> <b>combustion.</b> These results clearly demonstrate that the minimum entropy property of detonations derived from the conventional Hugoniot analysis does not imply superior performance in all propulsion systems. This finding reconciles previous analysis of flowpath performance analysis of detonation-based ramjets with the thermodynamic cycle analysis of detonation-based propulsion systems. We conclude that the thermodynamic analysis of propulsion systems based on stationary detonation waves must be formulated differently than for propagating waves, and the two situations lead to very different results.

40|$|Detonation wave engines, {{thanks to}} their more {{efficient}} thermodynamic properties, are expected to exhibit {{a higher level of}} performance than more conventional propulsion system that rely on <b>constant-pressure</b> <b>combustion</b> processes. Nevertheless, it still has to be proved that this advantage is not superseded by the difficulties which could be encountered to practically define a real engine and to implement it in an operational flying system. In that respect, continuous detonation wave principle appears less challenging than the pulsed detonation process and should lead to the development of more efficient propulsion systems, even if such radical adaptation of the overall engine concept and of the vehicle architecture would be necessary. During past years, MBDA performed some theoretical and experimental works, mainly in cooperation with the Lavrentyev Institute of Hydrodynamics in Novosibirsk. These studies aimed at obtaining a preliminary demonstration of the feasibility of a Continuous Detonation Wave Engine for air-breathing and rocket application. Compared to a Pulsed Detonation Engine, this design allows an easier operation in reduced-pressure environment and an increase in engine mass flow rate and thrust-to-weight ratio. Those studies were focused on global performance and understanding of the unsteady, three dimensional flow behind the detonation wave.

40|$|Atomic-based-combined-cycle (ABCC) engine {{combines}} an air-breathing {{ramjet engine}} with an atomic reactor {{to increase the}} mission-averaged specific impulse and thereby increasing the dry-mass ratio. ABCC engine is similar to RBCC engine except that energy needed for the propulsive power is derived from nuclear reaction rather than chemical combustion used in the RBCC engine. The potential performance improvement of an ABCC engine over a RBCC engine comes from two factors. Firstly, the energy density of nuclear reaction is several order of magnitudes higher than the chemical combustion. Secondly, hydrogen can produce much higher nozzle exit velocity because of its small molecular weight. A one-dimensional, transient numerical model was used to analyze a generic scramjet engine and it {{is used as a}} baseline to evaluate an imaginary ABCC engine performance. A nuclear reactor is treated as a black box energy source that replaces the role of the primary rocket and the chemical combustion chamber in a RBCC engine. Hydrogen is heated by the reactor and accelerated to produce high-speed ejection velocity. The ejection velocity up 10, 000 m/sec is theoretically possible because of high energy density from the reactor and large gas constant of the hydrogen. Oxygen contained in the entrained air reacts with hydrogen and produces propulsive power for ejector mode operation. To provide enough thrust for initial acceleration, relatively large amount of hydrogen must be pumped through the reactor. Amount of oxygen contained in the entrained air may not be sufficient to burn all hydrogen and consequently combustion could occur at the end of exit nozzle. It is assumed that this combustion process is <b>constant-pressure</b> <b>combustion</b> at 1. 0 atmospheric pressure and thus not affects the nozzle exit condition...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{applications}} of steady and unsteady detonation waves to air-breathing propulsion systems. The efficiency of ideal detonation-based propulsion systems is first investigated based on thermodynamics. We reformulate the Hugoniot analysis of steady combustion waves for a fixed initial stagnation state {{to conclude that}} steady detonation waves are less desirable than deflagrations for propulsion. However, a thermostatic approach shows that unsteady detonations {{have the potential for}} generating more work than <b>constant-pressure</b> <b>combustion.</b> The subsequent work focuses on specific engine concepts. A flow path analysis of ideal steady detonation engines is conducted and shows that their performance is limited and poorer than that of the ideal ramjet or turbojet engines. The limitations {{associated with the use of}} a steady detonation in the combustor are drastic and such engines do not appear to be practical. This leads us to focus on unsteady detonation engines, i. e., pulse detonation engnes. The unsteady generation of thrust in the simple configuration of a detonation tube is first analyzed using gas dynamics. We develop one of the first models to quickly and reliably estimate the impulse of a pulse detonation tube. The impulse is found to scale directly with the mass of explosive in the tube and the square root of the energy release per unit mass of the mixture. Impulse values for typical fuel-oxidizer mixtures are found to be on the order of 160 s for hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures and 120 s for fuel-air mixtures at standard conditions. These results are then used as a basis to develop the first complete system-level performance analysis of a supersonic, single-tube, air-breathing pulse detonation engine. We show that hydrogen- and JP 10 -fueled pulse detonation engines generate thrust up to a Mach number of 4, and that the specific impulse decreases quasi-linearly with increasing flight Mach number. Finally, we find that the performance of our pulse detonation engine exceeds that of the ramjet below a Mach number of 1. 35...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was carried out to investigate the effect of fireball composition on secondary combustion. The fireball was created from a 1. 5 liter balloon filled with a propane-oxygen mixture (1 1, the incompletely oxidized products from the primary burn mix with the surrounding air and may be oxidized in a secondary combustion process. The unique feature of the present experiments was a repeatable secondary pressure pulse for sufficiently rich mixtures. The secondary pressure rise was observed repeatably for all initiation configurations. The nature of the secondary pressure pulse is a strong function of the initial equivalence ratio. For [Greek Phi] = 1 and 1. 5, no secondary pressure waves are observed. An acoustic analysis of the measured pressure histories {{has been carried out}} to infer the rate of volume displacement and the total volume displaced by the secondary combustion. The results of the acoustic analysis are in reasonable agreement with both a simplified thermodynamic model predicting the total volume displacement assuming <b>constant-pressure</b> <b>combustion</b> for the secondary burn and the analysis of the fireball luminosity of the high-speed images. For nearly stoichiometric mixtures, [Greek Phi] = 1 and 1. 5, the leading blast wave peak pressures and impulses are comparable with the previously-measured gaseous and high explosive blasts when the energy content of the balloon only is used to formulate Sachs scaling variables. Due to a much slower combustion process than detonation for [Greek Phi] > 2 the peak pressure of the leading wave rapidly decreases below the energy-equivalent reference blast values as the equivalence ratio is increased. The Sachs-scaled impulse agrees well with the predictions {{on the basis of the}} energy in the balloon alone for 2. 75 > [Greek Phi] > 1. One of the key results of the present study has been the documentation of the existence of the secondary pressure wave. The present study has emphasized the acoustic nature of the secondary pressure waves and the origin of these pressure waves due to the processes at the interface between the fireball and the atmosphere. The presence of the secondary pressure peak and the higher impulses indicate that there is the potential for significant enhancement of the blast through secondary combustion...|$|E
40|$|Pulse {{detonation}} engines (PDE's) {{have received}} increasing attention for future aerospace propulsion applications. Because the PDE {{is designed for}} a high-frequency, intermittent detonation combustion process, extremely high gas temperatures and pressures can be realized under the nearly constant-volume combustion environment. The PDE's can potentially achieve higher thermodynamic cycle efficiency and thrust density in comparison to traditional <b>constant-pressure</b> <b>combustion</b> gas turbine engines (ref. 1). However, {{the development of these}} engines requires robust design of the engine components that must endure harsh detonation environments. In particular, the detonation combustor chamber, which is designed to sustain and confine the detonation combustion process, will experience high pressure and temperature pulses with very short durations (refs. 2 and 3). Therefore, it is of great importance to evaluate PDE combustor materials and components under simulated engine temperatures and stress conditions in the laboratory. In this study, a high-cycle thermal fatigue test rig was established at the NASA Glenn Research Center using a 1. 5 -kW CO 2 laser. The high-power laser, operating in the pulsed mode, can be controlled at various pulse energy levels and waveform distributions. The enhanced laser pulses can be used to mimic the time-dependent temperature and pressure waves encountered in a pulsed detonation engine. Under the enhanced laser pulse condition, a maximum 7. 5 -kW peak power with a duration of approximately 0. 1 to 0. 2 msec (a spike) can be achieved, followed by a plateau region that has about one-fifth of the maximum power level with several milliseconds duration. The laser thermal fatigue rig has also been developed to adopt flat and rotating tubular specimen configurations for the simulated engine tests. More sophisticated laser optic systems can be used to simulate the spatial distributions of the temperature and shock waves in the engine. Pulse laser high-cycle thermal fatigue behavior has been investigated on a flat Haynes 188 alloy specimen, under the test condition of 30 -Hz cycle frequency (33 -msec pulse period and 10 -msec pulse width including a 0. 2 -msec pulse spike; ref. 4). Temperature distributions were calculated with one-dimensional finite difference models. The calculations show that that the 0. 2 -msec pulse spike can cause an additional 40 C temperature fluctuation with an interaction depth of 0. 08 mm near the specimen surface region. This temperature swing will be superimposed onto the temperature swing of 80 C that is induced by the 10 -msec laser pulse near the 0. 53 -mm-deep surface interaction region...|$|E
