One of the factors to be considered is the polarization characteristic of the transmitter/receiver. The two fundamental lidar systems are either based upon the backscattering of linearly polarized or circularly polarized light. Consequently, the response of <b>calibration</b> <b>materials</b> to the particular state of polarization of the incident radiation is an important consideration.

There are two measurement parameters that are useful in presenting the characteristics of polarization of reflecting materials.

The second is circular polarization ratio: mu (sub c) = I (sub sc) /I (sub oc) where ol denotes opposite circular and sc denotes same circular. Notice that the ratios are inverted with respect to same polarization. It is the relative values of these polarization ratios that are used to characterize the retro-reflectance mechanism.

This new MRM has been designed as <b>calibration</b> <b>material</b> {{for a wide range of}} different Mn-Fe deposits, such as desert/rock varnish, ocean crusts and nodules as well as Mn accumulations in soils and lakes. Small-scale and large-scale homogeneity of FeMnOx- 1 were tested with three LA systems (200 nm femtosecond, and 193 nm and 213 nm nanosecond lasers) using different spot sizes and fluences. Our results demonstrate that FeMnOx- 1 is homogeneous in the pg to mu g and nm to mu m range and therefore well suited for microanalytical applications. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values obtained from repeated measurements are about 2 - 3 % for test portion masses of 5 - 100 ng, and are comparable to those of the homogeneous NIST SRM 610 and USGS GSE- 1 G reference glasses. Homogeneity of FeMnOx- 1 was also verified for a test portion of 0. 1 ng. Seven laboratories using five different bulk and microanalytical techniques were involved in the characterization of FeMnOx- 1. Small amounts of this MRM can be obtained on request from the authors.
