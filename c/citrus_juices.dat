25|$|Synephrine, {{although}} {{already known}} as a synthetic organic compound, was first isolated as a natural product from the leaves of various Citrus trees, and its presence noted in different <b>Citrus</b> <b>juices,</b> by Stewart and co-workers in the early 1960s. A survey {{of the distribution of}} synephrine amongst the higher plants was published in 1970 by Wheaton and Stewart. It has subsequently been detected in Evodia and Zanthoxylum species, all plants of the family Rutaceae.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Citrus</b> <b>juices</b> {{and other}} acidic drinks leach lead from crystal as {{effectively}} as alcoholic beverages. Under conditions of repeated use of the decanter, the lead leaching steeply decreases with increasing use. This finding is [...] "consistent with ceramic chemistry theory, which predicts that leaching of lead from crystal is self-limiting exponentially {{as a function of}} increasing distance from the crystal-liquid interface." [...] Lead leaching still occurs, but the quantity that leaches into a glass of wine or other beverage let stand for a few hours is much smaller than the quantity of lead consumed daily in ordinary diet.|$|E

40|$|Recently, the {{prevalence}} of allergies in Japan has been increasing. Certain types of fruit juice and lactic acid bacteria are known to alleviate allergic symptoms. Therefore, we examined whether <b>citrus</b> <b>juice</b> fermented by a specific lactic acid bacteria can improve the symptoms of Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCPsis). Lactobacillus plantarum YIT 0132 (LP 0132) was selected based on its high proliferative activity in <b>citrus</b> <b>juice</b> and anti-inflammatory interleukin- 10 -inducing activity. Dietary administration of heat-killed LP 0132 cells or <b>citrus</b> <b>juice</b> fermented with LP 0132 was found to significantly suppress nasal rubbing in a JCPsis mouse model, indicating relief of allergy symptoms. To evaluate the effects of LP 0132 -fermented <b>citrus</b> <b>juice</b> on pollinosis symptoms {{and quality of life}} (QOL) in humans with JCPsis, a single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted. The participants were 42 adults with JCPsis. They ingested 100 mL of sterilized LP 0132 -fermented <b>citrus</b> <b>juice</b> (active group) or unfermented <b>citrus</b> <b>juice</b> (placebo group) once daily for 8 weeks. Immediately after the pollen peak when allergy symptoms and QOL loss were most severe, itchy eyes, itchy skin, and QOL loss by JCPsis were alleviated in the active group compared with the placebo group. At 10 weeks after starting the intervention, increased the levels of blood eosinophils were significantly suppressed in the active group compared with the placebo group. We conclude that continuous ingestion of <b>citrus</b> <b>juice</b> fermented with LP 0132 may help alleviate the allergy symptoms and impaired QOL caused by JCPsis...|$|R

5000|$|Naringinase is a {{debittering}} {{enzyme that}} {{is used in the}} commercial production of <b>citrus</b> <b>juices.</b> It breaks down the compound naringin that gives <b>citrus</b> <b>juices</b> its bitter taste.
