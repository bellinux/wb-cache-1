40|$|There {{are both}} {{challenges}} and opportunities for people working {{at the intersection of}} the <b>crafts</b> <b>and</b> design, and this presentation is interested in both analysis of {{the current state of the}} industry as well as strategies to aid its progression. "There are many intersections within this topic: between <b>crafts</b> <b>and</b> art, <b>crafts</b> <b>and</b> design, <b>crafts</b> <b>and</b> industry, <b>crafts</b> <b>and</b> society. All those words change their meanings over time and place, and the relationships and intersections between them change as well. Whatever the intersection is, I have always been interested in people who know how to do things well. That includes their knowledge of materials and the skills and processes needed to work with them ? what craftspeople and those in specialised industries do. I believe this knowledge is also an essential part of design, whether carrying out the tasks oneself, or designing for others to make or manufacture. "But many things are changing; there are both {{challenges and opportunities}} for people working at the intersection of the <b>crafts</b> <b>and</b> design. Some time ago I said, in passing, that these days I was more interested in strategies than theories; now I?m pretty sure I believe it. But what are they?...|$|R

5|$|As {{the convoy}} of landing <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> other vessels ferried the Commandos across the English Channel; however, {{they had a}} chance {{encounter}} with a German tanker escorted by a number of armed trawlers which proceeded to fire upon them. In the confusion that followed a number of the landing craft were damaged and forced to turn back, while others were reported as missing and believed sunk. As a result {{the decision was made to}} abandon the attack.|$|E
5|$|Funded by a Derelict Land Grant, the {{engineering}} consultants Binnies {{carried out a}} feasibility study in 1994, which concluded that full restoration was possible. A new administrative structure for the project was created in 1997, when the Sleaford Navigation Trust was formed, and the Navigation Society was disbanded. The Trust has continued to work on restoring the structures of the canal, campaigning successfully to prevent the Navigation Warehouse from being demolished in 1998. The local council organised funding {{for the restoration of}} the warehouse and the former offices of the canal company in 2002, and Lincolnshire County Council funded a further study which looked at how to provide an adequate water supply for a re-opened canal. The former seed warehouse now forms part of The Hub, housing the National Centre for <b>Craft</b> <b>and</b> Design, which is supported by the Arts Council {{and is one of the}} leading centres for the promotion and exhibition of international <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Gump's core {{character}} and personality are also {{changed from the}} novel; among other things his film character is less of an autistic savant—in the novel, while playing football at the university, he fails <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> gym, but receives a perfect score in an advanced physics class he is enrolled in by his coach to satisfy his college requirements. The novel also features Gump as an astronaut, a professional wrestler, and a chess player.|$|E

5|$|Longren {{obtained}} {{space in}} Topeka {{for a small}} factory and {{enlisted the help of}} his brother Ereanius and his friend William Janicke, a fellow mechanic. Together the three men began working on Longren's design for a new airplane, despite having no prior aviation experience or professional assistance. The trio built the prototype in complete secrecy, wishing to forestall publicity of any potential failures; they even disassembled the <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> transported it discreetly in boxes to its first flight trial.|$|E
5|$|Metalwork was an {{important}} and well-developed <b>craft,</b> <b>and</b> metal tools such as axes, mammoties and hoes were widely used.

30|$|Although {{the best}} fitting model {{suggests}} that job <b>crafting</b> <b>and</b> autonomy support are both important factors predicting workplace well-being, {{it is also}} possible that there is a synergistic association, such that the highest levels of well-being occur when both job <b>crafting</b> <b>and</b> autonomy support are present. We explored this possibility in two ways. First, we estimated three linear regressions, predicting PA, NA, and job satisfaction from job <b>crafting,</b> autonomy support, <b>and</b> the interaction of the two. The interaction term was computed by multiplying the centered composite job <b>crafting</b> (JC) <b>and</b> autonomy support (AS) predictor variables (Aiken and West 1991). The interaction was significant for PA (β =  0.118, p =  0.02), and non-significant for NA (β =  0.017, p =  0.77) and job satisfaction (β =  0.019, p =  0.71). This finding suggests that employees who engaged in high levels of job <b>crafting</b> <b>and</b> who perceived their managers as high on autonomy support had the highest levels of positive affect, whereas employees who engaged in the lowest levels of job <b>crafting</b> <b>and</b> who perceived their managers as low on autonomy support had the lowest levels of positive affect.|$|R
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels {{from all over the}} south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure <b>craft,</b> <b>and</b> many other types of small craft. The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E
5|$|Around 1497, while {{continuing}} {{with his work}} on the Caesars, Cairano also developed five keystones for portico of the Loggia palazzo, representing Sant'Apollonio, San Faustino, San Giovita, Justice and Faith. Between 1499 and 1500, he delivered two large trophies to be placed on the top order of palazzo, while between 1493 and 1505, Cairano participated in the fulfilment of leonine protome, capitals, and candelabras and friezes for the same top order. The attention of the artist to his <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> productions is evident, and it influenced in general all the decorative sculptural works made for the palazzo at the time.|$|E
5|$|Between 1761 and 1790, 14-15 turumas were built, {{including}} Amphion, {{a modified}} version used by King Gustav III as both a pleasure <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> command ship. The turuma was among the heaviest in the arsenal of the archipelago fleet {{and a number of}} them served in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. It had three masts, two decks and was equipped with 16–22 pairs of oars along with a crew of about 220–260. Its length was 35–39m, width 9m and the draft 3,3m. The armament consisted of 24–28 heavy guns with up to 24 swivel guns for close-quarter combat.|$|E
