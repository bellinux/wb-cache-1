5|$|According to Tino's account, {{on the day}} of the election, Selvo was {{attending}} mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, an island in the Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under <b>construction</b> <b>at</b> the time, but the new church was also spacious enough to hold a fairly large number of people. The location also proved ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very same reasons.|$|E

5|$|Although three launch battalions {{were formed}} by the Germans in late 1943, they never {{got the chance to}} deploy to the V-weapons launch sites at Watten and Wizernes. On 3 July 1944, the Oberkommando West {{authorised}} the cessation of <b>construction</b> <b>at</b> the heavily damaged sites. On 18 July 1944, Hitler abandoned plans for launching V-2s from bunkers and authorized the downgrading of the Wizernes bunker to make it a LOX production facility. However, these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the Normandy landings. The site was finally abandoned {{a few days before the}} Allies reached it at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British, American, Canadian and Polish troops. British engineers inspected it on 5 September.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Shogunate's {{efforts to}} protect Japan from Western colonial forces, the defence of Hyogo Port was {{upgraded}} {{with the construction of}} the Wadamisaki Battery, one of six land batteries built around Osaka Bay under the design of Count Katsu Kaishū. It was completed in 1864 after 18 months of <b>construction</b> <b>at</b> a cost of 25,000 ryō. The outer enceinte was built of granite from the Shiwaku Islands and the inner two-storey structure was made of keyaki (Japanese elm) wood harvested from the Nunobiki and Tekkai Mountains in Kobe. In 1921 the battery was the first place in Hyogo Prefecture to be designated as a historic site by the prefectural government.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Akersbanerne {{was working}} on {{building}} the Lambertseter Line, which is located further east in Aker. This caused an uproar amongst the residents in the Ekeberg area, who wanted the Ekeberg Line extended, in {{what became known as}} the thousand meter, before the construction of the Lambertseter Line. The municipality therefore granted free municipal land and a grant of NOK50,000 for expropriation. Construction started in July 1940, after having been delayed by the German occupation of Norway. The construction included a new double track from Holtet to Bråten. During the <b>construction</b> <b>at</b> Sæter, the trams turned at Bråten and backed to Sæter, where they used the turning loop. The thousand meter extension to Ljabru opened on 17 September 1941.|$|E

5|$|Because Wells Cathedral was secular {{rather than}} monastic, cloisters {{were not a}} {{practical}} necessity. They were omitted from several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their <b>construction</b> <b>at</b> these two secular cathedrals range from the processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a scriptorium.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on May 24, 2004, {{construction}} of new platforms began at Clinton, Guilford, and Branford. The rebuilt Clinton station opened on July 25, 2005, and the rebuilt Branford station opened on August 8, 2005; both consist of a single high-level platform {{on the south side}} of the tracks. The new Guilford station, which has platforms on both sides of the tracks (connected by a pedestrian bridge) to allow for greater operational flexibility, opened on November 28, 2005. <b>Construction</b> <b>at</b> Madison started on September 24, 2007, and finished with the opening of the rebuilt station platform on July 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Ny-Ålesund saw four air {{expeditions to}} the North Pole, {{two of which}} {{required}} {{the construction of an}} airship hangar and mast. The first proposal for an airport in Ny-Ålesund was launched in 1956 by Norsk Polar Navigasjon, who proposed an airport at Kvadehuksletta. Soviet protests against the airport caused the Norwegian authorities to oppose the plans, which were laid to rest in the early 1960s. <b>Construction</b> <b>at</b> Hamnerabben started in 1965 following the decision to build Kongsfjord Telemetry Station. The airport first hosted service to temporary landing strips near Longyearbyen, but from 1975 served Svalbard Airport.
