40|$|Hydrostatic bicycle drives use {{a working}} fluid {{instead of the}} common roller-chain to {{transmit}} power to the drive wheel. These transmissions are typically considered too inefficient for human power applications. An experiment consisting of a very simple hydrostatic drive was designed and built {{in an attempt to}} measure the efficiency of these devices at approximate <b>cycling</b> <b>speeds.</b> A theoretical model was also developed to help predict losses using a wider range of operational parameters. Due to shortcomings of the experiment design, the measured efficiencies were on the order of 60 % - considerably lower than those theoretically possible. Although the experimental results are of limited value, this study highlights the importance of minimizing side-loading on hydraulic cylinder piston-rods during low-speed, low-pressure operation. The research is used to suggest several design features which may aid in continued attempts to develop a highly efficient hydrostatic transmission. by Michael T. SocksThesis (S. B.)

40|$|This work {{develops}} {{a method for}} capturing some of the kinetic energy ordinarily lost during braking on bicycles to power LED safety flashers. The system is designed to eliminate: (a) battery changing in popular LED flashers, and (b) the "generator drag" associated with battery-less human-powered bicycle lights and flashers. System sizing, mechanical design considerations, potential end-user factors, and a model for braking frequencies in urban settings are discussed. With the urban commuter cyclist in mind as a potential user of the regenerative braking system, custom direct-pull brake calipers (or "V-Brakes") were designed and manufactured to include both conventional friction pads {{in addition to a}} DC motor {{to be used as a}} generator for kinetic energy capture. The energy captured by the DC motor during braking is passed through a full wave bridge to a bank of Nickel-Cadmium batteries at an efficiency of 79 %. The output of the full wave bridge and the batteries are connected in parallel with a step-down switching voltage regulator, which insulates the LED safety flasher from voltage spikes due to braking at high <b>cycling</b> <b>speeds.</b> The performance of the final prototype was evaluated at <b>cycling</b> <b>speeds</b> ranging from 8 to 19 mph and braking frequencies ranging from 2 to 8 operations/stops per mile of travel. (cont.) From the mean power flow (charging) into the batteries per unit distance of travel and the power required by LED safety flashers, the effectiveness of the system at each speed and stopping frequency is examined. For cyclists traveling at average speeds of 10 mph or higher, the LED safety flashers can be powered continuously for stopping frequencies of 8 times per mile and semi-continuously (> 50 % of the time) for stopping frequencies of at least 4 times per mile. As such, the system is determined to be potentially useful to urban commuter cyclists, who frequently perform braking operations at regularly spaced intersections and traffic signals, and who regularly travel by bicycle in low-light conditions (dawn or dusk), though usually less than 50 % of the time. by Ian M.

40|$|Wind is {{fundamentally}} important to cyclists since it affects their performance, bicycle control, balance and road safety. The overall {{aim of this}} research is to improve the understanding of the effect of cycling position and crosswinds on the aerodynamics and performance of a cyclist. The first part of this thesis focuses on cycling position. To minimise air resistance, cyclists lower their torso to become more aerodynamic. Results show that lowering torso angle is associated with impairment of physiological functioning, which can be explained by a combination of mechanical and muscular factors. Consequently, there is a trade-off between aerodynamic gains and physiological impairment. Therefore a mathematical model has been developed predicting the optimal torso angle at different <b>cycling</b> <b>speeds.</b> The second part of this thesis aims to understand the flow mechanics around a cyclist subjected to crosswinds. Both wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow around a cyclist are used to reveal the effect of crosswinds on cyclists in different cycling positions. This thesis provides a unique approach to study cycling performance and safety by jointly investigating the human physiology and aerodynamic performance...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE To examine pacing {{strategies}} of ultra-cyclists {{competing in the}} 'Race Across AMerica' (RAAM), the world's longest ultra-cycling race covering ~ 4, 860 km from the west to {{the east coast of}} America. METHODS Age, <b>cycling</b> <b>speed</b> at and across time stations, race distance, relative difference in altitude between time stations, wind velocity, wind gradient and temperature at each time station were recorded for women and men competing from 2010 to 2014. Changes in <b>cycling</b> <b>speed</b> and power output of elite and age group finishers were analysed using mixed-effects regression analyses. RESULTS <b>Cycling</b> <b>speed</b> decreased across time stations for women and men where men were faster than women. Power output decreased across time stations in women and men and was lower for women for all finishers, the annual three fastest and age group 60 - 69 years, but not for age groups 18 - 49 and 50 - 59 years. The change in temperature and altitude had an influence on <b>cycling</b> <b>speed</b> and power output in all finishers, the annual top three, non-finishers, in all different age groups for both women and men, only in the age group 50 - 59 years altitude had no influence on <b>cycling</b> <b>speed.</b> CONCLUSIONS Positive pacing (i. e. decrease in speed throughout the race) seemed to be the adequate strategy in the RAAM. The top three finishers started faster and had a higher power output at the start compared to less successful competitors, achieved the highest peak cycling speeds and power output and maintained peak <b>cycling</b> <b>speed</b> and power output longer before slowing down...|$|E

40|$|Background: The distance, duration, and {{velocity}} of cycling for transport purposes {{are used in}} health economic assessments, epidemiological studies, traffic modelling, and planning. It is therefore of value to determine relevant levels for them, and analyze how they relate, {{as well as to}} what extent other relevant variables may affect cycling velocities. 1661 cycle commuters (34 % males) in Greater Stockholm, Sweden have been studied for that purpose. Methods: The participants were recruited with advertisements. They received questionnaires and individually adjusted maps to draw their normal cycling route. Route distances were measured by a criterion method. Age, sex, weight, height, and cycling durations to work were self-reported. The commuting routes were positioned in relation to inner urban and/or suburban–rural areas. Linear multiple regression analyses were used. Results: <b>Cycling</b> <b>speeds</b> were positively related to commuting distances or durations, being male, of younger age, having higher body weight but lower body mass index (BMI), and using the last digits 1 – 4 or 6 – 9 in duration reports (as compared to 0 and 5), as well as cycling in suburban (versus inner urban) areas. Conclusions: The study provides new knowledge about how distance and duration, as well as other factors, relate to the velocity of commuter cycling. It thereby enables the use of more appropriate input values in, for instance, health economic assessments and epidemiological health studies. FAA...|$|R

Cyclists 9 ̆ 2 value of travel time savings {{turns out to be}} high, considerably higher than the value of time savings on alternative modes. Cyclists also value other improvements highly, such as separated bicycle lanes. As to additional benefits of cycling improvements in the form of health and reduced car traffic, our results do not support the notion that these will be a significant part in a cost-benefit analysis. Bicyclists seem to take health largely into account when making their travel choices, implying that it would be double-counting to add total health benefits to the analysis once the consumer surplus has been correctly calculated. As to reductions in car traffic, our results indicate that the cross-elasticity between car and cycle is low, and hence benefits from traffic reductions will be small. However, the valuations of improved <b>cycling</b> <b>speeds</b> and comfort are so high that it seems likely that improvements for cyclists are cost-effective compared to many other types of investments, without having to invoke second-order, indirect effects. In other words, our results suggest that bicycle should be viewed as a competitive mode of travel and not primarily as a means to achieve improved health or reduced car traffic...|$|R
