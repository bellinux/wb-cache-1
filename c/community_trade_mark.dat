This paper suggests that trademark analysis can contribute in capturing relevant aspects of innovation phenomena and the process of industrial change. We propose trademarks as a complementary indicator in the portfolio of available empirical tools of innovation studies and industrial dynamics. Our empirical exploration is based on a study of <b>Community</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks,</b> an intellectual property right granted in the European Union, and draws on recent research on trademarking trends in Portugal. Quantitative as well as qualitative data, including survey data from a representative sample of Portuguese manufacturing and services firms, are used to identify the advantages and limitations of this indicator.

40|$|This paper uses a novel {{data set}} of the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> {{activity}} of UK manufacturing and service sector firms to investigate whether applications for <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> are suggestive of product innovation, improving the profitability and productivity of firms. Data on both <b>trade</b> (and service) <b>marks</b> sought via the UK Patent Office (UKTM) and the European Community Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market (CTM) are available. There was rapid growth in <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> activity during the period covered by the data (1996 - 2000). We first analyse Tobin’s q, the ratio of stock market value to the book value of tangible assets, as {{the market value of}} the firm should reflect the expected future return on intangible assets. We explore the impact of undertaking any <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> activity and also the effects of increasing <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> intensity among those who do. The results indicate that stock market values are positively associated with R&D and <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> activity by firms. We find larger differences between firms with and without <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> for services than for manufacturing. We also find bigger differences in Tobin’s q when the services firm is applying for Community marks, rather than just applying for UK marks. Increasing the intensity of <b>Community</b> <b>trade</b> <b>marking</b> appears to raise market value for both manufacturing and services, but this relationship weakened over the 1996 to 2000 period. The second part of this paper investigates the relationship between <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> activity and productivity, using a value added production function. The results indicate that firms that <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> have significantly higher value added than non-trade markers (by between 10 % and 30 % across all firms). Our interpretation is that <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> activity proxies a range of other, unobservable, firm-level characteristics including innovation that raise productivity and product unit values. We also analyse whether greater <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> intensity raises productivity growth. Higher <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> intensity has some positive association with productivity growth, particularly in services, but the results are relatively weak. These results seem broadly consistent with those derived using the market value approach, suggesting that stock markets are efficient in estimating the likely benefits of new intangible assets, and that managers were not just seeking <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> to follow a management fad, but could expect to receive real returns from innovative activity leading to new products requiring <b>trade</b> <b>marks.</b> Even so, the marginal returns to extra <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> per firm were diminishing quite rapidly over the period, as indicated by our exploration of the interaction of time trends with <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> intensity. In the final section of the paper we examine interactions between firms IP activity to explore the nature of creative destruction and simultaneous growth via innovation. We find that, in the short run, greater IP activity by other firms in the industry reduces the value added of the firm, but this same competitive pressure has later benefits via productivity growth and this is reflected in higher stock market value. This describes the Schumpeterian process of competition through innovation restraining profit margins while increasing product variety and quality...|$|R

If properly protected, <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> can last forever; and can provide the business with a unique and immediately visible identification to its customers and the world beyond. A <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> cannot be protected by the law unless it is registered, since registration is considered as a basis of the legal protection. The <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969 together with its Rules organize all matters concerning registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> and provide the procedure to be followed in obtaining such registration. This thesis examines the registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in Sudan under the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} for the first time, a history of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in Australia. Its {{focus is on the}} latter to middle part of the 19 th century and early into the 20 th century, predating the Commonwealth <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act. This is because it was during this period when the legislative framework for <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> protection was first established under the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime and the most important, characteristic features of modern <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law developed. With a specific focus on this critical period, the legal narrative and this thesis considers the inception of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime, contextualising its genesis. It also examines the architecture of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The final part of the narrative focuses on the operation of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The key reason for this particular doctrinal focus is twofold. The primary reason relates to the lack of consideration given to the historical development of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in Australia to date, and in particular, the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The second ancillary reason relates to the potential importance of this thesis to modern debates about <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, which often refer back to and rely upon the assumed traditional principles of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, without any inquiry or deep understanding as to what those traditional foundations actually are, at least from an Australian perspective. In taking a doctrinal and empirical approach, this thesis draws on the relevant legal archive, containing the limited primary and secondary sources available relating to the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. Here, particular attention is paid to the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registers, which have been examined in detail. However, the relevant legal archive also includes the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> statutes, the related Hansard reports, colonial newspapers and the case law reported as arising out of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. This thesis further draws on the body of 19 th century British (and to a lesser extent American) <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> and other treatises as the authoritative legal texts of the time, as well as the statutory protection afforded to <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in the United Kingdom and the extrinsic material concerning early British <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, so far {{as it relates to the}} colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime...|$|R
