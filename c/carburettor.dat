5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw {{the introduction of}} a Bendix-Stromberg pressure <b>carburettor</b> that injected fuel at 5 pounds per square inch (34kPa; 0.34 bar) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger, and was fitted to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was fitted to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection <b>carburettor</b> that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.|$|E
5|$|Usually {{reports were}} issued on any {{incident}} with every aircraft. On the date McCudden died, 29 such returns exist for S.E.5s {{but the report}} pertaining to his accident is not among them leaving the official cause of the crash unexplained. It is possible the engine failed due to a wrongly installed <b>carburettor.</b> However, there is some doubt as to whether a mechanical defect was the culprit. The witnesses reported the pilot was attempting low-level stunts, manifesting in several turns and rolls. Many years later other witnesses disputed the aircraft performed a roll, but all agreed the trouble began when the machine entered an attitude resembling a near-vertical turn.|$|E
25|$|The full remedy {{was to use}} the Bendix-Stromberg {{pressure}} <b>carburettor,</b> {{which allowed}} more precise metering {{of the amount of}} fuel used by the engine and prevented fuel starvation. This new <b>carburettor</b> was used from the Merlin 66 series and on all Griffon engines. In these engines the <b>carburettor</b> injected fuel at 5 psi through a nozzle direct into the supercharger and the compressed air-fuel mixture was then directed to the cylinders. The final development was the SU injection <b>carburettor,</b> that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures; although this was fitted to the 100 series Merlins, which were not used in production Spitfires, it was used in the Griffon 60 and 80 series.|$|E

25|$|In ancient times, {{the float}} valve {{was used to}} {{regulate}} {{the flow of water}} in Greek and Roman water clocks; similar float valves are used to regulate fuel in a <b>carburettor</b> and also used to regulate tank water level in the flush toilet.|$|E
25|$|Various {{engineering}} refinements {{that had}} gone into the Tempest II were incorporated into the last Tempest variant, designated as the Tempest VI. This variant was furnished with a Napier Sabre V engine with 2,340hp (1,700kW). The more powerful Sabre V required a bigger radiator which displaced the oil cooler and <b>carburettor</b> air intake from the radiator's centre; air for the <b>carburettor</b> was drawn through intakes on {{the leading edge of the}} inner wings, while the oil cooler was located behind the radiator. Most Tempest VIs were tropicalised, the main feature of this process being an air filter which was fitted in a fairing on the lower centre section. Other changes included the strengthening of the rear spar and the inclusion of spring tabs, which granted the variant superior handling performance.|$|E

25|$|For the Mark VI, {{launched}} in 1990, the engine mounting points were moved forward to take 1,275cc power units, and includes the HIF <b>carburettor</b> version, plus the single point fuel injected car {{which came out}} in 1991. The 998cc power units were discontinued. Internal bonnet release were fitted from 1992.|$|E
25|$|The company {{developed}} and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle {{with the engine}} in the centre and 'springer' front forks which was ahead of its time. This first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray <b>carburettor,</b> bottom-bracket engine and mechanically operated valves. With a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904. The following year, however, Rover stopped motorcycle production to concentrate on their 'safety bicycle' but in 1910 designer John Greenwood was commissioned {{to develop a new}} 3.5hp 500cc engine with spring-loaded tappets, a Bosch magneto and an innovative inverted tooth drive chain. It had a Brown and Barlow <b>carburettor</b> and Druid spring forks. This new model was launched at the 1910 Olympia show and over 500 were sold.|$|E

Warman's machine gun fire set Kroll's airplane's <b>carburettor</b> on fire, but Kroll killed the engine to starve the flames, tore off his oily goggles so he could still see, and landed dead stick, {{trailing}} telephone wires.|$|E
50|$|The big {{products}} of Zenith were the Zenith-Stromberg <b>carburettors</b> used in MGs, 1967-1975 Jaguar E-types, Saab 99s, 90s and early 900s, 1969-1972 Volvo 140s and 164s, and some 1960s and 1970s Triumphs.The Triumph Spitfire for instance used Zenith IV <b>carburettors</b> in the North American market. In Australia the CD-150 and CDS-175 models were fitted {{to the high}} performance triple <b>carburettored</b> Holden Torana GTR-XU1.|$|R

50|$|The {{six-speed}} gearbox {{was used}} on all later variants of the Thunderbird along with Keihin <b>carburettors.</b> The earlier Mikuni <b>carburettors</b> initially sufferd from premature needle and jet wear {{in its first}} year of release; this was rectified with a factory recall soon after. All later Thunderbirds with the 150 mph speedometer and Keihin <b>carburettors</b> should have six speed gearboxes fitted along with chrome engine cases.|$|R
25|$|Like its predecessor, the three-litre engine had a {{cast iron}} block, an {{aluminium}} head with hemispherical combustion chambers, two valves per cylinder, angled 90° and timed by directly acting, chain driven dual overhead camshafts. Fed by a twin-choke <b>carburettor,</b> it developed , {{sent to the}} rear wheels through a 4-speed all-synchromesh gearbox with a column-mounted shifter as on the 6C 2500.|$|E
25|$|The carburetted water gas {{process was}} {{improved}} by Thaddeus S. C. Lowe in 1875. The gas oil was fixed into the BWG via thermocracking in the <b>carburettor</b> and superheater of the CWG generating set. CWG was the dominant {{technology in the}} USA from the 1880s until the 1950s, replacing coal gasification. CWG has a CV of 20 MJ/m³ i.e. {{slightly more than half}} that of natural gas.|$|E
25|$|Sopwith's design, the 3F.2 Buffalo, was a single-engined tractor biplane, {{with its}} two-bay wooden wings taken from Sopwith's earlier Bulldog fighter. Like the Salamander, the forward {{fuselage}} was {{made out of}} armour plate, weighing about 750lb (340kg), with {{the bottom of the}} fuselage 0.315in (8mm) thick, with the sides and front of 0.179in (5mm) plate. The armoured box reached back to the observer's cockpit, protecting the crew together with the fuel tanks and pipes, the <b>carburettor</b> and the magnetos.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, {{the diesel}} engine was {{enlarged}} to 1.8L, whilst the entry level 1.1L and 1.3L models were updated with the redesigned HCS {{version of the}} Kent/Valencia family introduced for the Mk III Fiesta. For the same year, a Ford developed {{electronic fuel injection system}} replaced the Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system in the XR3i and Orion Ghia injection models, and a central point fuel injection system replaced the <b>carburettor</b> on models with the 1.4L engine.|$|E
25|$|The basic Mk V was a Mk I {{with the}} Merlin 45 series engine. This engine {{delivered}} 1,440hp (1,074kW) at take-off, and incorporated a new single-speed single-stage supercharger design. Improvements to the <b>carburettor</b> also allowed the Spitfire to use zero gravity manoeuvres without {{any problems with}} fuel flow. Several Mk I and Mk II airframes were converted to Mk V standard by Supermarine and started equipping fighter units from early 1941. The majority of the Mk Vs were built at Castle Bromwich.|$|E
25|$|Australia made do {{with the}} 910 series, which was facelifted in 1985. New Zealand {{marketing}} for the U11 proclaimed the vehicle as the 'Widetrack Bluebird', to differentiate it from its very similar-looking predecessor. Several Wiri-assembled models including a wagon were offered with 1.6 (base) or two-litre <b>carburettor</b> engines. The alloy head castings all had an unused location for a second spark plug per cylinder, as twin-plug, fuel-injected {{versions of the same}} engines were used in certain markets (US, Japan, Scandinavia) with stricter emission laws.|$|E
50|$|Following {{standard}} BMW {{practice of}} the time, two 32 mm Bing CV <b>carburettors</b> were used and the R65 used a single dry plate clutch. An additional lower powered version was also produced for the German market and was fitted with 26 mm Bing CV <b>carburettors.</b>|$|R

25|$|Like its predecessors, the 510 Bluebird {{line was}} {{imported}} into New Zealand, {{this time as}} a single 1.6-litre, four-speed manual Deluxe model, assembled from CKD kits by Campbell Industries (later Toyota New Zealand Thames assembly plant). Local content included glass, radiator, upholstery, carpet, paint, wiring and numerous other items. A few automatic and twin <b>carburettor</b> SSS versions were imported built-up from Japan, primarily for buyers who had access to funds overseas and could utilise the country's 'no remittance' new car purchase scheme to avoid lengthy waiting lists.|$|E
25|$|To {{compete with}} Volkswagen's Golf GTI, a hot hatch {{version of the}} Mark III was developed– the XR3. Initially this {{featured}} a tuned version of the 1.6L CVH engine fitted with a twin-choke Weber <b>carburettor,</b> uprated suspension and numerous cosmetic alterations. It lacked a five-speed transmission and fuel injection. Fuel injection finally arrived in October 1982 (creating the XR3i), eight months behind the limited edition (8,659 examples), racetrack-influenced RS1600i. The Cologne-developed RS received a more powerful engine with , thanks to computerized ignition and a modified head {{as well as the}} fuel injection.|$|E
25|$|The most {{fundamental}} change {{made to the}} later Merlin (60, 70, 80 and 100 series) and Griffon engines (60 and 80 series) was the incorporation of a two-stage, two-speed supercharger, which provided a considerable increase in power, especially at higher altitudes. Two-stage refers {{to the use of}} two impellers on a common driveshaft, constituting two superchargers in series. As air was drawn through the air intake, fuel was pumped into the airstream by the <b>carburettor.</b> The first-stage impeller compressed the air-fuel mixture and this was then fed to the smaller second-stage impeller which further compressed the mixture.|$|E
