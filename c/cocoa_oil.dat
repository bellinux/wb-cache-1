The recovery of oil prices in the early 2000s gave Venezuela oil funds not seen since the 1980s. The Venezuelan government then established populist policies that initially boosted the Venezuelan economy and increased social spending, significantly reducing economic inequality and poverty. However, such policies later became controversial, as their excesses - especially a uniquely extreme fossil fuel subsidy - are widely blamed for destabilizing the nation's economy and creating a crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, resulting in hyperinflation, an economic depression, and drastic increases in poverty, disease, child mortality, malnutrition, and crime.|$|E

The economic activity within the basin is primarily, farming, where foodstuffs, such as yam, plantain, banana, vegetables, fruits, and cash crops, such as <b>cocoa,</b> <b>oil</b> palm, and coffee, are grown.

Degradation of paraquat compound was done with the influence of variation of time without the addition ZnO, the influence of ZnO additional variations, and the effect of combination between variations of time and optimization of ZnO addition. The result of the study shows that photolysis degradation product without the addition of ZnO for 120 minutes has been degraded by 12. 56 %. While the optimum addition of 0. 1 grams ZnO increased the percentage of degradation which is about 57. 64 %. This is proved that the addition of ZnO with photolysis method can degrade more paraquat compounds...|$|E

40|$|Mining in {{developing}} countries are located in rural areas where agriculture is {{the main source of}} livelihood. Mining communities in Ghana's mineral-rich regions engage in food crop production. These regions are actually leading the production of cash crops like <b>cocoa,</b> <b>oil</b> palm and citrus. They also produce in large quantities food staples like plantain, maize, cocoyam, legumes and an assortment of vegetables. The paradox, however, these areas have seen unprecedented boom in activities of ASM. This gives potential negative spillovers to individuals who are involved in farming through environmental pollution and competition for key inputs (like, land, water, and labor). To exam this situation, we employed the impact of gold mining on staple food crop production in Ghana. We estimated the yield of agricultural productivity for major crop in a selected areas where ASM is intensive using both quantitative data analysis and qualitative systemic literature reviewed. It suggests that a 1 % increase in ASM production might reduce agricultural production in Ghana. This may be as a result of pollution from mines and agricultural land used by mines. Gold price and mining price have a positive relationship with agricultural production, statistically significant at 0. 01 levels. Furthermore, we find that the mining activity is associated with food insecurity (food pollution) and poverty reduction. A simple cost-benefit analysis shows that, the actual fiscal contributions of mines in Ghana wouldn't have been enough to compensate the affected populations considering the hug negative effect mining from ASM...|$|E
40|$|Globalization and {{commodity}} exports have a {{long history}} in affecting land use changes and land rights on the tropical forest frontier. This paper reviews a century of social and environmental discourse around land issues for four commodities grown in the humid tropics—rubber, <b>cocoa,</b> <b>oil</b> palm and bananas. States have exercised sovereign rights over land and forest resources and the outcomes for deforestation and land rights of existing users have been quite varied depending on local institutional contexts and political economy. In the current period of globalization, as land use changes associated with tropical commodities have accelerated, land issues are now at center stage in the global discourse. However, efforts to protect forests and the rights of local communities and indigenous groups continue to be ad hoc and codification of minimum standards and their implementation remains a work in progress. Given a widespread failure of state directed policies and institutions to curb deforestation and protect land rights, the private sector, {{with the exception of the}} rubber industry, is emphasizing voluntary standards to certify sustainability of their products. This is an important step but expectations that they will effectively address concerns about the impact of tropical commodities expansion might be too high, given their voluntary nature, demand constraints, and the challenge of including smallholders. It is also doubtful that private standards can more than partially compensate for long standing weaknesses in land governance and institutions on the forest frontier...|$|E

Although prices fell 50 % from 1996 to US$ 0. 70 /kg in 2001, a study {{published}} early in 2002 by the University of Amsterdam predicts that a rise in demand and prices in the mid-term future. Liberia, Ghana and Cameroon have increased production in recent years, but the market share of Côte d Ivoire and Nigeria Africa s biggest producers is at risk. In Côte d Ivoire privatisation has not worked well, leaving smallholder producers the majority to fend for themselves. In Nigeria, replanting has long been neglected and most trees are more than 30 year old, at least 5 years past their prime. Replanting is dear for smallholders: new trees (Hevea brasiliensis) take six years before they can be tapped; regular replanting, and delayed production, cuts directly into the flow of sap and income. The National Agricultural Research Centre in Côte d Ivoire has ways to soften these blows. Rubber can be intercropped with any one crop of rice, yam, groundnut, plantain, maize or vegetables, without any loss of yield.
