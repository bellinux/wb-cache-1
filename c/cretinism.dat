5|$|Infants with {{thyroid hormone}} {{deficiency}} (congenital hypothyroidism) can manifest problems of physical {{growth and development}} as well as brain development, termed <b>cretinism.</b> Children with congenital hypothyroidism are treated supplementally with levothyroxine, which facilitates normal growth and development.|$|E
5|$|Cribb et al. (2014) {{suggest that}} Bontius' account {{referred}} not to apes (which were not known from Java) {{but rather to}} humans suffering some serious medical condition (most likely endemic <b>cretinism)</b> and that {{his use of the}} word was misunderstood by Nicolaes Tulp, who was the first to use the term in a publication.|$|E
5|$|English {{physician}} John Langdon Down {{first described}} Down syndrome in 1862, recognizing it {{as a distinct}} type of mental disability, and again in a more widely published report in 1866. Édouard Séguin described it as separate from <b>cretinism</b> in 1944. By the 20th century, Down syndrome had become the most recognizable form of mental disability.|$|E
5|$|Iodine deficiency, {{most common}} in inland and mountainous areas, can {{predispose}} to goitre – if widespread, known as endemic goitre. Pregnant women deficient of iodine can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency. The use of iodised salt used to add iodine to the diet has eliminated endemic <b>cretinism</b> in most developed countries, and over 120 countries have made the iodination of salt mandatory.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} hypothyroidism (lack of production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid). Typical symptoms are tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, {{as well as}} a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, hypothyroidism leads to delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called <b>cretinism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called <b>cretinism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Numerous authors {{described}} <b>cretinism,</b> myxoedema {{their relationship}} with the thyroid in the nineteenth century. Charles Mayo coined the term hyperthyroidism in 1910, Hakaru Hashimoto documented a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1912, and autoantibodies were demonstrated in 1956. Knowledge of the thyroid and its conditions developed throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolving throughout the mid twentieth century, including the use of radioactive iodine, thiouracil and fine needle aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Some {{table salt}} sold for {{consumption}} contain additives which address {{a variety of}} health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or <b>cretinism</b> in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.|$|E

He concludes that LB1 and LB6 H.floresiensis are not modern human (H.sapiens) cretins.|$|E
25|$|In a paper {{delivered}} to the Australasian Society for Human Biology in 2009, Colin Groves and Catharine FitzGerald compared the Flores bones with those of ten people who had had <b>cretinism,</b> focusing on anatomical features which are typical of the disease. They found no overlap, and stated that they had put the claim to rest. However, an article by Oxnard, Obendorf and Kefford rejects Groves and FitzGerald's argument and revives the <b>cretinism</b> hypothesis. Oxnard and colleagues also criticise the cladistic analysis of Argue et al. (2009), stating {{that it is not}} logically possible for the analysis to conclude that the Liang Bua remains represent a separate species and not a pathology because the cladistics analysis assumes that they do not represent a pathology.|$|E
25|$|Kocher {{and others}} later {{discovered}} that the complete removal of the thyroid could lead to <b>cretinism</b> (termed cachexia strumipriva by Kocher) caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormones. The phenomena was reported to Kocher first in 1874 by the general practitioner August Fetscherin and later in 1882 by Jacques-Louis Reverdin together with his assistant Auguste Reverdin (1848-1908). Reverdin met Kocher on 7 September in Geneva at the international hygienic congress (internationaler Hygienekongress) and expressed his concerns about complete removal of the thyroid to Kocher. Kocher then tried to contact 77 of his 102 former patients and found signs of a physical and mental decay in those cases where he had removed the thyroid gland completely. Ironically, it was his precise surgery that allowed Kocher to remove the thyroid gland almost completely {{and led to the}} severe side effects of <b>cretinism.</b>|$|E
25|$|In humans, an {{unhealthy}} diet can cause deficiency-related {{diseases such as}} blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and <b>cretinism,</b> or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Undernutrition {{can lead to the}} wasting of kwashiorkor in acute cases, and the stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Australian {{researchers}} Peter J. Obendorf, Charles E. Oxnard, and Ben J. Kefford {{suggested that}} LB1 and LB6 suffered from myxoedematous (ME) endemic <b>cretinism</b> resulting from congenital hypothyroidism {{and that they}} were part of an affected population of H.sapiens on the island. This disease, caused by various environmental factors including iodine deficiency, is a form of dwarfism which can still be found among the local Indonesian population.|$|E
25|$|Affected people, {{who were}} born without a {{functioning}} thyroid, have both small bodies and reduced brain size but their mental retardation and motor disability is not as severe as with neurological endemic cretins. According to {{the authors of the}} study, the critical environment could have been present on Flores approximately 18,000 years ago, the period to which the LB fossils are dated. They wrote that various features found on the fossils, such as enlarged pituitary fossa, unusually straight and untwisted tops of the upper arm bone and relatively thick limbs, are signs of this diagnosis. The double rooted lower premolar and primitive wrist morphology can be explained in this way as well. The oral stories about strange human-like creatures may also be a record of <b>cretinism.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Kocher {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that a complete removal of the thyroid (as it was common to perform at the time because the function of the thyroid was not yet clear) was not advisable, a finding that he made public on 4 April 1883 in a lecture to the German Society of Surgery and also published in 1883 under the title Ueber Kropfexstirpation und ihre Folgen (English: About Thyroidectomies and their consequences). Reverdin had already made his findings public on 13 September 1882 and published further articles on this topic in 1883; yet still Kocher never acknowledged Reverdin's priority in this discovery. At the time, the reactions to Kocher's lecture were mixed, some people asserted that goitre and <b>cretinism</b> were different stages of same disease and that <b>cretinism</b> would have occurred independently of the removal of the thyroid in the cases which Kocher described. [...] In the long run however, these observations contributed to a more complete understanding of thyroid function and were one of the early hints of a connection between the thyroid and congenital <b>cretinism.</b> These findings finally enabled thyroid hormone replacement therapies for a variety of thyroid related diseases.|$|E

[...] "Even moderate deficiency, especially in pregnant women and infants, lowers intelligence by 10 to 15 I.Q. points, shaving incalculable potential off a nation's development. The most visible and severe effects — disabling goiters, <b>cretinism</b> and dwarfism — affect a tiny minority, usually in mountain villages. But 16 percent of the world's people have at least mild goiter, a swollen thyroid gland in the neck." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nutrition {{disorders}} and nutritional deficits may cause neurodevelopmental disorders, such as spina bifida, and the rarely occurring anencephaly, {{both of which}} are neural tube defects with malformation and dysfunction of the nervous system and its supporting structures, leading to serious physical disability and emotional sequelae. The most common nutritional cause of neural tube defects is folic acid deficiency in the mother, a B vitamin usually found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and milk products. (Neural tube defects are also caused by medications and other environmental causes, many of which interfere with folate metabolism, thus they are considered to have multifactorial causes.) Another deficiency, iodine deficiency, produces a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders ranging from mild emotional disturbance to severe mental retardation. (see also <b>cretinism)</b> ...|$|E
