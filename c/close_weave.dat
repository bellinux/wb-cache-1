The colours get embedded in the lime plaster as it dries up. Frescos cover about 600 square metres of the walls of the Chapel. For an oil painting, the colours are made by mixing pigments with linseed oil. The canvas is made of pure linen of strong <b>close</b> <b>weave.</b> The paintings on the ceilings in the Chapel (about 400 Square Metres) are in oil on canvas.|$|E

The first is to ditch the current unworkable and restrictive comparative politics approach, in favour of a genuinely global analysis framework. Instead of obsessively looking at data on nation states, we need to seek data completeness on the whole (multi-level) world we have. A second cluster of challenges involves looking far more deeply into political phenomena; reaping the benefits of ‘digital-era’ developments; moving from sample methods to online census methods in organisational analysis; analysing massive transactional databases and real-time political processes (again, instead of depending on surveys); and devising new forms of ‘instrumentation’, informed by post-rational choice theoretical perspectives...|$|R

This is a unique piece of craftsmanship, in which a multi-coloured schematic pattern is woven all over the surface, and after the shawl is completed, the rafugar (expert embroiderer) works the outlines of the motifs in darker shades to bring into relief the beauty of design. This attractive mode of craftsmanship not only produces a shawl which is reversible because of the perfect workmanship on both sides, but it combines the crafts of both weaving and embroidery and religious beliefs expressed in different shawls.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} general method for {{estimating}} {{the risk of}} data loss in arbitrary two-dimensional RAID arrays where each data disk belongs to exactly two single-parity stripes. We start by representing each array organization by a graph where each parity stripe, and its associated parity disk, is represented by a node and each data disk by an edge. We then use this representation to identify and enumerate minimal sets of disk failures, say, triple failures, quadruple failures and so forth, that will cause a data loss. The overall probabilities that a given number n of disk failures will cause a data loss is then given by {{the ratio of the}} total number of fatal disk failures involving n disks over the total number of possible failures of n disks. To illustrate the power of our method, we apply it to two distinct, archival two-dimensional array organizations. The first, ”square ” organization is a traditional square layout where data disks are formed into a square and the parity stripes are formed by the rows and columns in the square. Hence a square layout organization with n 2 data disks will have 2 n parity disks. The second, ”complete ” organization corresponds to a <b>closer</b> <b>weave,</b> where all parity stripes intersect and each intersection contains a parity disk. This organization with n parity disks will have n(n− 1) / 2 data disks. Our results show that previous ad hoc estimates of the reliability of these arrays significantly underestimated their reliability by assuming that either all triple or all quadruple disk failures were fatal. We show that the two two-dimensional array organizations exhibit mean times to data loss and five-year survival rates that are very similar to those of a RAID Level 6 organization of much smaller capacity. Our complete organization is about 4. 5 times and the square organization is about 8 times more reliable than a disk array with same storage capacity built from RAID level 6 stripes.

5000|$|The form of my Symphony in One Movement is a {{synthetic}} {{treatment of the}} four-movement classical symphony. It is based on three themes of the initial Allegro non troppo, which retain throughout the work their fundamental character. The Allegro ma non troppo opens with the usual exposition of a main theme, a more lyrical second theme, and a closing theme. After a brief development of the three themes, instead of the customary recapitulation, the first theme in diminution forms {{the basis of a}} scherzo section (vivace). The second theme (oboe over muted strings) then appears in augmentation, in an extended Andante tranquillo. An intense crescendo introduces the finale, which is a short passacaglia based on the first theme (introduced by violoncelli and contrabassi), over which, together with figures from other themes, the <b>closing</b> theme is <b>woven,</b> thus serving as a recapitulation for the entire symphony.|$|R

For this article, I explore {{the politics of the}} guest performer and how they become an inside eye or internal dramaturg in the process of making a performance. In doing so, I propose a new dramaturgical paradigm for the guest performer involved and reflect on the way practice as research is an inherently dramaturgical and curatorial process. The performance takes place in liminal space between composition and dissemination and sees dramaturgy as process and product. The text is the seed but it grows in different ways depending on how it is interpreted by the performer. It is germinated in performance {{in front of an audience}} not the usual incubation in the rehearsal room. The piece explores the process of raveling the work from its own devising, of making something wide open and making something narrow, of opening and <b>closing</b> a <b>weave.</b> I relate the role of dramaturg to that of curator and argue that it is a catalysing role that enables intersubjective relation with a number of texts authorised by an audience...|$|R

The huts were hexagonal in form, and where grouped were joined so that they resembled the cells of a bee-hive. One hut meant a warrior and his mate, and each additional hut in a group indicated an additional female. The palisade which surrounded the village was of logs set <b>close</b> together and <b>woven</b> into a solid wall with tough creepers which were planted at their base and trained to weave in and out to bind the logs together. The logs slanted outward at an angle of about thirty degrees, in which position they were held by shorter logs embedded in the ground at right angles to them and with their upper ends supporting the longer pieces a trifle above their centers of equilibrium. Along the top of the palisade sharpened stakes had been driven at all sorts of angles.|$|R

50|$|Ripstop fabrics {{are used}} in yacht sails and spinnakers, hot air balloons, kites, parachutes, and remote control hovercrafts. High quality camping {{equipment}} such as lightweight tents, sleeping bags, and camping hammocks tend to use ripstop {{in order to reduce}} the wear on their fabrics which are in direct contact with the ground or the wind. Swags, flags, banners, and other applications requiring a strong lightweight fabric use ripstop too. Ripstop reinforcements are incorporated into heavier fabrics requiring extreme durability, such as those used in Army Combat Uniforms, Nomex protective clothing for firefighters and other workwear, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu uniforms, outdoor and sports clothing, backpacks, and luggage bags. Self-adhesive ripstop patches are used to repair both rips and tears in other fabrics.Ejector seat parachutes made with ripstop are woven with an elastic-like fabric so that they stretch to allow more air to pass through at high speed.

These treatment programs oftentimes involve the use of cryotherapy or ankle taping to create an optimal environment for healing. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the individual and simultaneous effects of ankle taping and cryotherapy on mechanical power and velocity. Sixteen (16) Division IA Baseball players (Age 20. 53 +/- 1. 15 yrs, Wt 878. 45 +/ 105. 68 N, Ht 1. 85 +/- 0. 087 m) served as subjects for this study. Subjects met the following criteria: 1) all were asymptomatic from any lower extremity injury for at least six months prior to testing. 2) none had any known cold allergy (ie. hives, hypersensitivity to cold). This study utilized a counterbalanced repeated measures design, in which subjects participated in three treatments, cryotherapy, ankle taping and a combination treatment of cryotherapy and ankle taping. For the taping treatment, each subject was taped using a standard <b>closed</b> basket <b>weave</b> technique` with porous 1. 5 " cloth athletic tape (Johnson and Johnson, Coach). The cryotherapy treatment was administered a 20 minute ice immersion treatment at 10 deg Celsius to the leg and ankle. In the combination treatment, both treatments were administered with the ice immersion preceding ankle taping. The effects of these treatments on mechanical power and velocity were measured by a Kistler amplifier and force plate platform during a one leg standing vertical jump. The two-way repeated measures ANOVA's for power and velocity showed no significant interaction between cryotherapy, taping or combination treatment. However, significant pre-post treatment effects for power were discovered after cryotherapy and combination treatment. As a result of these findings, it is evident that immediate return to participation after cryotherapy or combination treatment will lead to decreases in muscular performance or injury.

40|$|Many {{companies}} in the fashion industry are increasingly <b>weaving</b> <b>close</b> relationships with the art world, to appropriate art values and meanings {{to be associated with}} their own products and brands. The fashion luxury sector has been especially prone to using such strategies to transform their products into true artworks {{to address the issue of}} commodification resulting from high production volumes. This research aims to observe if a strategy based on the visual arts is recognized and accepted by final consumers. For this purpose, we use the Customer-based Brand Equity tool to test the artification effect on brand equity from a consumer perspective. The brand of reference is Louis Vuitton, the top brand worldwide as stated by 2016 Interbrand. They have embraced an art-based strategy for a long time. The methodology used is that of the questionnaire built on the measurement of scales of values. The questionnaire was created and distributed via Qualtrics Survey Software in collaboration with the Insead-Sorbonne Behavioural Lab Research Center. In brief, the experiment shows that Louis Vuitton strategy has been to act as an art institution that displays art collections to the widest public art status and bestows art status and global recognition to collaborating artists. This strategy relies on LV ability to raise consumers’ awareness of the arts. While the art-oriented public recognizes artistic collaborations, the larger public does not and is still very much aware of new designs...|$|R

But how amazingly he mingled a broad philosophy with his fun, a philosophy not less wise and comprehending than his fun was compelling! If his humor was American, it was also cosmopolitan, and had its laughing way not merely with our British kinsmen, but with alien peoples across the usually impenetrable barrier of translation.

40|$|This practise-led project investigates {{alternative}} pattern {{cutting processes}} {{for the design}} and making of a small collection of women’s swimwear for recreational purpose. The traditional pattern matrix system used to design patterns has little anatomical relationship to the moving body (Lindqvist, 2013). However there are alternative pattern design practitioners who step outside of this model (Sevin- Doering, 2004, Wang, 2011, Lindqvist, 2013, Cumming, 2015) These methodologies offer benefits to high stretch knit designs, enabling the designer to enhance garment fit by transferring shaping in direct relationship to the body to provide support and aid movement. An investigation of one piece pattern cutting for a <b>close</b> fit using <b>woven</b> and knit fabrics will {{play an important role}} in the technical design process. This analysis considers the application of Cumming’s method of one piece pattern development for fitted body garments along with an expanded analysis of methods and designs developed from other one piece cutting practitioners and active wear researchers informing the development of recreational swimwear (Sevin-Doering, 2004, Lindqvist, 2013, Cumming, 2015). Methods combining technical research and an iterative design practice including design, toile, sampling processes and motion wear qualitative testing to analyse designs. The use of new pattern cutting methods can improve the fit and comfort and subsequent performance capacity of recreational swimwear without the reliance on high performance materials. The benefits of this method encourage the designer to pattern design to the body shape and utilise fabric properties to meet the gap in the market between the fashion consumer and the elite athlete. Further developments open up opportunities for future developments including smart technologies and complete garment technology applications (Brownbridge, 2016).
