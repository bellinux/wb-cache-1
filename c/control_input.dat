5|$|The primary <b>control</b> <b>input</b> {{that the}} rider can make {{is to apply}} a torque {{directly}} to the steering mechanism via the handlebars. Because of the bike's own dynamics, due to steering geometry and gyroscopic effects, direct position control over steering angle {{has been found to}} be problematic.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} <b>control</b> <b>input</b> {{that the}} rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary <b>control</b> <b>input</b> on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E

In the proposed method, we introduce the notion of virtual <b>control</b> <b>inputs,</b> which are obtained by relaxing discrete-valued <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> to continuous variables. In online computation, first, we find continuous-valued <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> and virtual <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> minimizing a cost function. Next, using the obtained virtual <b>control</b> <b>inputs,</b> only discrete-valued <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> at the current time are computed in each subsystem.

5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every <b>control</b> <b>input</b> resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E
25|$|The Eurocopter AS355 TwinStar {{helicopter}} uses {{a double}} Gurney flap that projects from both {{surfaces of the}} vertical stabilizer. This is used to correct a problem with lift reversal in thick airfoil sections at low angles of attack. The double gurney flap reduces the <b>control</b> <b>input</b> required to transition from hover to forward flight.|$|E
25|$|The SA.4 was {{designed}} for a crew of five: pilot, copilot, bombardier ("air bomber"), navigator and radio operator. The prone bombardier's position was a tube extending forward of the cockpit above the radome; the crew compartment being pressurized. These positions were fitted with opaque nosecones, as the Sperrins were never used for live bombing. The pilot was {{the only member of}} the crew to have a Martin-Baker-produced ejector seat underneath a jettisonable roof panel; other crew members were intended to bail out via a door located under the navigator's console. The other three crew positions were located behind the pilots, facing rearwards. Unusually, the pilot's flying controls lacked any direct connection to the aircraft's flight control surfaces, <b>control</b> <b>input</b> was instead directed into a gearbox to actuate rotatable ball-screw jacks to move each flight surface via aerodynamic load instead; a corresponding artificial feel system was also installed. Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist describe the control system as having been simple, light, reliable, and low-friction and contrast it positively against powered systems of the era.|$|E
40|$|Continuous time model {{predictive}} control (CMPC) is a control algorithm similar to discrete time model {{predictive control}} {{in that it}} uses a quadratic cost function to find the optimal <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> within given constraints. Inputs which give the lowest cost function are the optimal <b>control</b> <b>inputs.</b> The benefit of CMPC over its discrete time counterpart {{is the use of}} a continuous time linear model to predict future system behaviour at each time sample. The <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> are modelled with orthonormal basis functions. This simplifies the calculation of the optimal <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> in continuous time. The cost function uses an exponentially data weighting strategy to improve the stability and tracking performance of the controller. Simulations with a non-linear F 16 jet aircraft MIMO model show that CMPC can control the attitude of the aircraft with good performance under certain conditions...|$|R

500|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) {{investigated}} the accident. The DC-7 {{was not required}} to be equipped with a flight recorder, which would have automatically recorded the pilots' every <b>control</b> <b>input.</b> Thus, the CAB was forced to rely on witness testimony, radio recordings, and a best guess based on experience. Nevertheless, the CAB determined that the evasive maneuvers taken by the pilot of Flight 663 {{in order to avoid}} the oncoming Pan Am jet caused spatial disorientation. The disorientation, coupled with the extreme maneuver, made it impossible for the pilot to recover from the roll in the few seconds remaining before the DC-7 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. The CAB also determined that Captain Carson had neither the time nor adequate information to assess Flight 663's position relative to Pan Am 212 and, given the illusion of a collision course, he had acted appropriately in initiating evasive maneuvers. The CAB made no recommendations in the final accident report. [...] Although early news reports reported the near miss of Flights 663 and 212, the FAA denied that there was ever any danger of a collision.|$|E
500|$|A {{completely}} new design was installed over the winter. The original spoilers were removed {{and replaced by}} a single ring below the annular flap. The ring shifted {{in relation to the}} craft under <b>control</b> <b>input,</b> [...] "sealing off" [...] the gap on one side while opening it on the other. Tests continued in January 1960, and appeared to work much better. However, while the new control system improved the hovering qualities, the craft now became unstable at higher speeds above [...] The first Avrocar at Ames was similarly modified, and, in April 1960, it was tested in their [...] wind tunnel. The problem became clear; the ring blocked so much of the overall engine thrust that the overall power was greatly reduced. As the craft sped up, the airflow on the underside reduced the recirculation, reducing the lift due to airflow over the upper surface. This was somewhat unexpected; recirculation had been considered a [...] "bad thing" [...] due to the loss of engine thrust, and its positive effects on lift do not appear to have been appreciated. In the end, in order to maintain lift at higher forward speeds the craft had to be pitched to the end of its control capability.|$|E

[...] Use of rudder and ailerons together produces co-ordinated turns, in which the longitudinal axis of the aircraft {{is in line with}} the arc of the turn, neither slipping (under-ruddered), nor skidding (over-ruddered). Improperly ruddered turns at low speed can precipitate a spin which can be dangerous at low altitudes.|$|E

40|$|A {{common goal}} in the control of a large network is to {{minimize}} the number of driver nodes or <b>control</b> <b>inputs.</b> Yet, the physical determination of control signals and {{the properties of the}} resulting control trajectories remain widely under-explored. Here we show that: (i) numerical control fails in practice even for linear systems if the controllability Gramian is ill-conditioned, which occurs frequently even when existing controllability criteria are satisfied unambiguously; (ii) the control trajectories are generally nonlocal in the phase space, and their lengths are strongly anti-correlated with the numerical success rate and number of control inputs; (iii) numerical success rate increases abruptly from zero to nearly one as the number of <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> is increased, a transformation we term numerical controllability transition. This reveals a trade-off between nonlocality of the control trajectory in the phase space and nonlocality of the <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> in the network itself. The failure of numerical control cannot be overcome in general by merely increasing numerical precision [...] -successful control requires instead increasing the number of <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> beyond the numerical controllability transition...|$|R
