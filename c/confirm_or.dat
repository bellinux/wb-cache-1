Colbert staunchly refused to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> deny his candidacy, stating he had not yet made up his mind and must first talk the possibility over with his family.|$|E
5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clotâ€”or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur.

5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because mutations in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{video game}} website GameSpot {{reported}} that Duke Nukem Forever had {{switched to the}} Doom 3 engine. Many gaming news sites mailed Broussard, asking him to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> deny the rumor. After receiving no answer from him, they published the rumor as fact, but Broussard explicitly denied the rumor soon after. Soon after 3D Realms replaced the game's Karma physics system with one designed by Meqon, a relatively unknown Swedish firm. Closed-doors demonstrations of the technology suggested that the physics of Duke Nukem Forever would be a step up from the critically acclaimed Half-Life 2. Rumors suggested that the game would appear at 2005 E3. While 3D Realms' previously canceled Prey made an appearance, the rumors of Duke Nukem Forevers appearance proved false.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-6b {{is a hot}} Jupiter, {{having a}} mass 0.669 times that of Jupiter, but an average {{distance}} of only 0.046 AU from its star and, thus, an orbital period of 3.23 days. It is almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is from our Sun. As a result, Kepler-6b is strongly irradiated by its star, heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K and puffing {{it up to a}} size 1.3 times that of Jupiter. It may also be the case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance {{from the center of the}} planet. However, additional observations are required to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> refute this possibility.|$|E

As a child, Tubman was told that she was of Ashanti lineage (from what is now Ghana), though no evidence exists to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> deny this assertion. Her mother Rit (who {{may have had a}} white father) was a cook for the Brodess family. Her father Ben was a skilled woodsman who managed the timber work on Thompson's plantation. They married around 1808 and, according to court records, they had nine children together: Linah, Mariah Ritty, Soph, Robert, Minty (Harriet), Ben, Rachel, Henry, and Moses.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with the word of God preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, the W23, an {{adaptation}} of the W19 nuclear artillery shell was developed specifically for the 16-inch guns. The shell had an estimated yield of , and its introduction made the Iowa-class battleship's 16-inch guns the world's largest nuclear artillery, and made these four battleships the only US Navy ships ever to have nuclear shells for naval guns. Although developed for exclusive use by the battleship's guns {{it is not known}} if any of the Iowas actually carried these shells while in active service due to the United States Navy's policy of refusing to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> deny the presence of nuclear weaponry aboard its ships. In 1991 the United States unilaterally withdrew all of its nuclear artillery shells from service, and dismantling of the US nuclear artillery inventory {{is said to have been}} completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state's major {{political}} offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal financial gain. In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges but a grand jury refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the insurance scheme, but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler team's {{scientists}} conducted follow-up {{observations to}} <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> reject the planetary {{nature of the}} detected object. To do so, they used the Keck 1 telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii; the Shane and Hale telescopes in California; telescopes at the WIYN (including MMT) and Whipple observatories in Arizona; Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands; the Hobby-Eberly and Harlan J. Smith telescopes in Texas; and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Because Kepler-11g orbits its star at a far greater distance than the inner five planets, fewer transits were observed, and radial velocity (the observation of a Doppler effect) interactions could not be easily discerned. As {{with the discovery of}} Kepler-9d, the Kepler team ran the information through numerous models to see if Kepler-11g's light curve could fit the profile of some other object, including an eclipsing binary star in the background that may have contaminated the data. The probability that Kepler-11g is not a planet but instead a false positive was determined to be 0.18%, effectively confirming its existence.|$|E

5|$|Frederick William's {{excise tax}} (Akzise), which since 1667 {{replaced}} {{the property tax}} raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges {{were not to be}} used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an Akzise was raised with the estates' consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates {{for the first time in}} 1674. Since 1704, the Prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682, the elector introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Due to Frederick William's reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.|$|E
5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to <b>confirm</b> <b>or</b> refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E
