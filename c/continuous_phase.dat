5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for {{ferromagnetism}} illustrated the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect. After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for <b>continuous</b> <b>phase</b> transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.|$|E

25|$|Ice {{cream is}} {{considered}} as a colloidal system. It is composed by ice cream crystals and aggregates, air that does not mixes with the ice cream by forming small bubbles in the bulk and partially coalesced fat globules. This dispersed phase made from all the small particles is surrounded by an unfrozen <b>continuous</b> <b>phase</b> composed by sugars, proteins, salts, polysaccharides and water. Their interactions determine the properties of ice cream, whether soft and whippy or hard.|$|E

25|$|In chemistry, a colloid is {{a mixture}} in which one {{substance}} of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. Sometimes the dispersed substance alone is called the colloid; the term colloidal suspension refers unambiguously to the overall mixture (although a narrower {{sense of the word}} suspension is distinguished from colloids by larger particle size). Unlike a solution, whose solute and solvent constitute only one phase, a colloid has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a <b>continuous</b> <b>phase</b> (the medium of suspension). To qualify as a colloid, the mixture must be one that does not settle or would take a very long time to settle appreciably.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise {{emulsions}} eventually break as the oil droplets coalesce, {{although the}} kinetics and the precise {{mechanisms by which}} the droplets coalesce are not fully understood. As samples of mayonnaise age, the size distribution of the oil droplets changed to produce fewer, larger droplets which eventually led to separation of the phases of the mayonnaise. The shift in droplet size could be measured either microscopically (through light or scanning electron micrographs) or by {{a decrease in the}} absorbance at 500nm. When mayonnaise is stored at elevated temperatures, increases in Brownian motion of the droplets, decrease in the viscosity of the <b>continuous</b> <b>phase,</b> and solubilization of the surfactants all contribute to the breakdown of the emulsion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>phase</b> {{transitions}}, such as order-disorder {{transitions in}} metallic alloys and ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions, involve {{a transition from}} an ordered to a disordered state. In terms of correlation functions, the equal-time correlation function is non-zero for all lattice points below the critical temperature, and is non-negligible for only a fairly small radius above the critical temperature. As the phase transition is continuous, the length over which the microscopic variables are correlated, , must transition continuously from being infinite to finite when the material is heated through its critical temperature. This {{gives rise to a}} power-law dependence of the correlation function as a function of distance at the critical point. This is shown in the figure in the left for the case of a ferromagnetic material, with the quantitative details listed in the section on magnetism.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine if phase plot normalization and phase angle definitions would have an affect on <b>continuous</b> relative <b>phase</b> calculations. A subject ran on a treadmill while sagittal plane kinematic data were collected with a high-speed (180 Hz) camera. Segmental angular displacements and velocities were used to create phase plots, and examine the coordination between the leg and thigh. <b>Continuous</b> relative <b>phase</b> was calculated with a combination of two different amplitude normalization techniques, and two different phase angle definitions. Differences between the techniques were noted with a root mean square (RMS) calculation. RMS values indicated that there were differences in the configuration of the non-normalized and normalized <b>continuous</b> relative <b>phase</b> curves. Graphically and numerically, it was noted that normalization tended to modify the <b>continuous</b> relative <b>phase</b> curve configuration. Differences in <b>continuous</b> relative <b>phase</b> curves were due to a loss in the aspect ratio of the phase plot during normalization. Normalization tended to neglect the nonlinear forces acting on the system since it did not maintain the aspect ratio of the phase plot. Normalization is not necessary because the arc tangent function accounts for differences in amplitudes between the segments. RMS values indicated that there were profound differences in the <b>continuous</b> relative <b>phase</b> curve when the phase angle was normalized and a phase angle was calculated relative to the right horizontal axis. r 2002 Elsevie...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{diffraction}} spectrometry (LDS) {{is often}} claimed {{to operate on}} the principle of Fraunhofer diffraction. This is only true, however, if particles are large compared to the wavelength of light or if the ratio of the refractive indices of the disperse and <b>continuous</b> <b>phases,</b> m, is clearly different from unity. In this study it has been established that LDS, as applied to particle and droplet sizing in suspensions and emulsions, is based on Miescattering. Scattering patterns of single particles may be calculated if the refractive indices of both phases are known. Thus, a theoretical basis has been provided for the application of LDS to size-measurement in suspensions and emulsions, and for extension of this method to the lower size ranges and those cases in which the refractive indices of the disperse and <b>continuous</b> <b>phases</b> are similar.

40|$|In yeast, aging {{appears to}} be marked by a {{progressive}} impairment in cellular mechanisms, resulting in irreversible changes in physiology and morphology. To date, very little has been reported about the biochemical changes that occur in yeast {{as a function of}} individual cell aging. To investigate this further, six generations of a brewing yeast strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC 1239) were separated according to cellular age using <b>continuous</b> <b>phased</b> culturing and biotin-streptavidin magnetic cell sorting. To obtain cells with no bud scars (virgin cells), a concentrated yeast slurry was layered onto sucrose density gradients and centrifuged. The uppermost band from the gradients was collected and cells were biotinylated with biotinamidocaproate- N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, that covalently binds to lysine residues on the yeast cell wall. For <b>continuous</b> <b>phased</b> culturing, biotinylated cells were added to a carbon-limited nutrient medium and growth was synchronized using the doubling time of the cells. Harvested cells were incubated with streptavidin superparamagnetic beads and sorted with a strong permanent magnet. In total, approximately 75 % of the biotinylated cells were recovered. Viability testing was conducted using vital staining and plate counts, with > 98 % viability reported with the vital stain and 37 % viability with the agar plates. In conclusion, <b>continuous</b> <b>phased</b> culture, together with magnetic cell sorting has the potential to become a powerful tool for the study of age-related biochemical changes in yeast. Further studies will focus on ensuring the reproducibility of the method and using the recovered cells to study biochemical changes occurring during yeasts' replicative lifespan...|$|R
