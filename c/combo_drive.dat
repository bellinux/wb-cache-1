25|$|The Mac Mini G4 uses {{a single}} 2.5-inch Ultra ATA/100 hard drive, {{which offers a}} maximum {{transfer}} rate of 100MB/s. Because of its sealed enclosure, {{it is not possible}} to upgrade the hard drive without opening the enclosure and possibly voiding the warranty of the system. The Mac Mini G4 also contains a second ATA cable that connects to the optical drive. A <b>Combo</b> <b>drive</b> was included as standard, while a SuperDrive able to write to DVDs was also an option.|$|E
25|$|The Intel-based Mac Mini {{moves away}} from the {{formerly}} used Ultra ATA/100 to the newer Serial ATA interface, which offers a maximum 3Gbit/s transfer rate, however all models of Intel Mac Mini have been limited to 1.5Gbit/s even though the SATA standard supports a transfer of 3Gbit/s. All models continue to use 2.5-inch hard drives as opposed to the 3.5-inch drives used in standard desktops. A server edition of the Mac Mini was introduced in October 2009, which omits the optical drive in favor of a second hard drive for a total of 1TB of storage. A <b>Combo</b> <b>drive</b> was initially offered as standard, with the SuperDrive being an option, but through the 2010 models, all models that have an optical drive contain the SuperDrive as standard. The 2010 standard version of the Mac (without Server) comes with a 300GB or on 2.66GHz 500GB of storage.|$|E

50|$|In computing, {{an optical}} disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light or {{electromagnetic}} waves within {{or near the}} visible light spectrum {{as part of the}} process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from certain discs, but recent drives can both read and record, also called burners or writers. Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives. Optical disc drives that are no longer in production include CD-ROM drive, CD writer <b>drive,</b> <b>combo</b> (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) <b>drive,</b> and DVD writer drive supporting certain recordable and rewritable DVD formats (such as DVD-R(W) only, DVD+R(W) only, DVD-RAM only, and all DVD formats except DVD-R DL). , DVD writer drive supporting all existing recordable and rewritable DVD formats is the most common for desktop PCs and laptops. There are also the DVD-ROM drive, BD-ROM <b>drive,</b> Blu-ray Disc <b>combo</b> (BD-ROM/DVD±RW/CD-RW) <b>drive,</b> and Blu-ray Disc writer drive.|$|R

It may be considered as addition of intelligence to the motors, so that the overall package requires no more space, yet is capable of increase in efficiency and working capabilities. In this paper an integral motor with a unique design is proposed to overcome critical issues associated with the motor and its embedded systems. It proposes a compact unit built to operate in arduous industrial environments with optimized power consumption and best practice motor management under different load conditions. Advantages of the proposed Integral motor are compactness of <b>combo</b> motor and <b>drive</b> system with no external cabling/wiring. This motor provides a perfect shielding for least amount of radiated emission. It has an inbuilt filter for EMC compliance and has been designed to provide lower EMC noise for immunity of the internal electronics as well as other neighboring systems...|$|R

Integration of VSD motor systems (Integral Motor) while partially reducing some of these effects, adds to immunity problem of their embedded systems. Fail safe operation of an Integral Motor in arduous industrial environments is considered. In this paper an integral motor with a unique design is proposed to overcome critical issues such as heat, vibration and electromagnetic interference which are damaging to sensitive electronics without requirement of any additional cooling system. Advantages of the proposed Integral motor are compactness of <b>combo</b> motor and <b>drive</b> system with no external cabling/wiring.

50|$|A <b>combo</b> <b>drive</b> {{is a type}} {{of optical}} drive that {{combines}} CD-R/CD-RW recording capability with an ability to read (but not write) DVD media; some manufacturers refer this as CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive. The term is used almost exclusively by Apple Inc. as a name for the low-end substitute for their high-end SuperDrive, as the latter was designed to both read and write CD and DVD recordable media. The device was created as a mid-range option between a CD burner and a DVD burner, which at the time the <b>combo</b> <b>drive</b> was introduced was generally an expensive option costing in excess of US$300 a unit.|$|E
50|$|In current Apple computers, {{none of them}} contain combo drives. As of October 2008, the MacBook {{comes with}} a SuperDrive as standard, and as of March 2009, the Mac mini comes with a SuperDrive {{as opposed to the}} usual <b>combo</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
5000|$|More {{recently}} the term [...] "combo drive" [...] {{is used to}} refer to an optical drive that can read & write CDs and DVDs, but only read Blu-ray Disc/BD-ROM; some manufacturers refer this as Blu-Ray Disc <b>combo</b> <b>drive</b> or BD-ROM/DVD±RW/CD-RW drive.|$|E

50|$|Combo drives are {{becoming}} {{less and less}} common on new systems, though they do occasionally appear in lieu of CD-only drives on low-end computers and business computers to lower production and sale costs. The cost difference between a <b>combo</b> <b>drive</b> and DVD burner has been steadily declining in recent years, so most new PCs (except for the low-end budget computers) have a DVD burner (which also reads and writes CDs).|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new type of {{heterogeneous}} storage device called <b>Combo</b> <b>Drive,</b> which comprises of a smaller-capacity low-latency solid-state disk drive (SSD) concatenated with a larger-capacity high-throughput hard disk drive (HDD). The overall cost of a <b>Combo</b> <b>Drive,</b> similar to a Hybrid Drive, is still dominated by the more capacious HDD. With <b>Combo</b> <b>Drive,</b> the performance advantages of both the SSD and the HDD are readily utilized by assigning the lower portion of the address space, which is already considered by many file systems as faster than the higher portion, to the SSD. Performance can be optimized further on file system level on the host side. In contrast, existing Hybrid Drives utilize non-volatile memory hierarchically as a cache transparent to the environment requiring complex cache coherence al-gorithms. We built a <b>Combo</b> <b>Drive</b> prototype and propose multiple heuristic optimization algorithms implemented in file-system-level optimizers. Performance measurements on the host side show that the prototype achieves system start up time and application launch time similar to an SSD alone while offering large capacity and low cost of an HDD...|$|E
