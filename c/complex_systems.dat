5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more <b>complex</b> <b>systems</b> such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E

40|$|In general, a <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} {{of a large number}} of interacting units, which when viewed in information-theoretic perspective could be seen to possess gross redundant features. Further, a <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> is inherently stochastical in its extensive spatiotemporal universe and hence, some of its statistical features could manifest as patterns occurring more frequently than others; and, likewise some other patterns could form rare elements of the same set. In information-theoretic perspectives (in Shannon sense) such more (or less) probabilistic occurrences of features specify the redundant (or nonredundant) aspects of the <b>complex</b> <b>system.</b> This attribute of information redundancy of a <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> could be adopted to devise a useful complexity metric as described in this paper.

40|$|The {{move toward}} an ecosystem-based {{fisheries}} management (EBFM) requires new operational tools {{in order to}} support management decisions. Among them, ecosystem- and fisheries-based models are critical to quantitatively predict the consequences of future scenarios by integrating available knowledge about the ecosystem across different scales. Despite increasing development of these <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> models in the last decades, their operational use is still currently limited in Europe. Many guidelines are already available to help the development of <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> models for advice yet they are often ignored. We identified three main impediments to the use of <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> models for decision support: (1) their very complexity which is a source of uncertainty; (2) their lack of credibility, (3) and the challenge of communicating/transferring complex results to decision makers not accustomed to deal with multivariate uncertain results. In this paper, we illustrate these somehow theoretical “best practices” with tangible successful examples, which can help the transfer of <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> models from academic science to operational advice. We first focus on handling uncertainty by optimizing model complexity with regards to management objectives and technical issues. We then list up methods, such as transparent documentation and performance evaluation, to increase confidence in <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> models. Finally, we review how and where <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> models could fit within existing institutional and legal settings of the current European fisheries decision framework. We highlight where changes are required to allow for the operational use of <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> models. All methods and approaches proposed are illustrated with successful examples from fisheries science or other disciplines. This paper demonstrates that all relevant ingredients are readily available to make <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> models operational for advice...|$|R

I utilise components of complexity theory to explain and interpret science as a <b>complex</b> <b>system.</b> I first explain the concept of complexity in ordinary language. The explanation of science as a <b>complex</b> <b>system</b> starts with a definition of the basic rules guiding the behaviour of science as a <b>complex</b> <b>system.</b> Next, I indicate how various sciences have resulted through the implementation of these rules in the study of a specific aspect of reality.
