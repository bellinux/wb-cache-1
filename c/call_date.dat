50|$|Most {{perpetual}} bonds issued nowadays are deeply subordinated bonds issued by banks. The bonds are counted as Tier 1 capital {{and help the}} banks fulfill their capital requirements.

50|$|The {{first three}} bonds and the Victory Loan were {{partially}} retired {{during the course}} of the 1920s, but the majority of these bonds were simply re-financed through other government securities. The Victory Loan, which was to mature in May 1923, was retired with money raised by short term treasury notes which matured after three to five years and issued at 90-day intervals until sufficient funds were raised in 1921. The likelihood of successfully retiring all of the war debt (within the amount of time) was noted as early as 1921. In 1927, the 2nd and 3rd, together worth five billion dollars, 1/4 of all government debt at the time, were called for redemption and refunded through the issuance of other government securities through the Treasury Department. Some of the principal was retired. For example, of the 3.1 billion dollars owed on the 2nd Liberty Bond, 575 million in principal was retired and the rest refinanced. At this same time, the 1st Liberty Bond still had 1.9 billion dollars outstanding in 1927 with a <b>call</b> <b>date</b> for 1932 while the fourth Liberty Bond, with six billion dollars, had a <b>call</b> <b>date</b> for 1932 as well.|$|E

5000|$|Thus, {{the issuer}} has an option which it pays for by {{offering}} a higher coupon rate. If interest rates in the market have gone down {{by the time of}} the <b>call</b> <b>date,</b> the issuer will be able to refinance its debt at a cheaper level and so will be incentivized to call the bonds it originally issued. [...] Another way to look at this interplay is that, as interest rates go down, the price of the bonds go up; therefore, it is advantageous to buy the bonds back at par value.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the stock}} is trading at $64 making the call option worth $19.45 with a {{theoretical}} call premium now of 45 cents above its in-the-money intrinsic value $19 (the $64 market price minus the call option $45 strike price). The call premium tends to go down as the option gets closer to the <b>call</b> <b>date.</b> And it goes down as the option price rises relative to the stock price, i.e. the 19.45 the option is now worth 30% (19.45/ $64) of the price per PNC shares. In August it was 23% (11.75/$50.65). The lower percentage of the option's price {{is based on the}} stock's price, the more upside the investor has, therefore the investor will pay a premium for it.|$|E
5000|$|The Little Mermaid {{introduced}} a new policy at Disney, called the Retailer Profit Protection Plan. That was primarily designed to put all retailers of Disney product on an equal footing.

Retailers could never be advertised any price lower than $18.75 inclusive of any rebates and value-added offers. In addition, Disney established a rule regarding the [...] "nationally advertised availability date" [...] (NAAD). Any advertising appearing before the NAAD had to clearly show the NAAD. Along with the NAAD of May 18 went a Warehouse Release Date of May 14, the earliest ship date for distributors and rackjobbers, and a Will <b>Call</b> <b>date</b> of May 16, the last being the first allowable day for sales to the public.

Qualifying securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch), at least 18 months to final maturity {{at the time of}} issuance, at least one year remaining term to final maturity as of the rebalancing date, a fixed coupon schedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. In addition, qualifying securities must have risk exposure to countries that are members of the FX-G10, Western Europe or territories of the US and Western Europe. The FX-G10 includes all Euro members, the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden. Original issue zero coupon bonds, 144a securities (both with and without registration rights), and pay-in-kind securities (including toggle notes) are included in the index. Callable perpetual securities are included provided they are at least one year from the first <b>call</b> <b>date.</b> Fixed-to-floating rate securities are included provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Contingent capital securities (“cocos”) are excluded, but capital securities where conversion can be mandated by a regulatory authority, but which have no specified trigger, are included. Other hybrid capital securities, such as those legacy issues that potentially convert into preference shares, those with both cumulative and non-cumulative coupon deferral provisions, and those with alternative coupon satisfaction mechanisms, are also included in the index. Securities issued or marketed primarily to retail investors, equity-linked securities, securities in legal default, hybrid securitized corporates, eurodollar bonds (USD securities not issued in the US domestic market), taxable and tax-exempt US municipal securities and DRD-eligible securities are excluded from the index.|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} pricing and structuring of contingent convertibles (CoCos) with extension risk. Under the new regulatory Basel III framework, CoCo bonds can be categorized as either belonging to the Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital category. The Tier 1 CoCo bonds have cancellable coupons and do not have a predefined maturity. In addition, they contain no incentive, such as a coupon step-up, for the issuer to redeem at the first <b>call</b> <b>date.</b> This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} old-style hybrid bonds issued by financial institution before the 2008 financial crisis. At that time, banks issued callable bonds with a coupon-step up after the first <b>call</b> <b>date.</b> These bonds were categorized as additional Tier 1 and their step-up feature reduced the probability that the bank skipped the call and kept the bond alive. The existence of the coupon step up was considered by many practitioners to be a justification to categorize those bonds as fixed maturity bonds that expire on the first <b>call</b> <b>date.</b> The fact that coupon step-ups are no longer allowed in the new regulatory framework forces us to think differently when dealing with Tier 1 bonds. We explain how to integrate this extension risk into a valuation method for CoCo bonds. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} reducing the interval between a patient's call for an appointment and the appointment itself.

In Experiment 2, patients were assigned to appointment dates either the next operating clinic day (next-day group) or 2 weeks from the <b>call</b> <b>date</b> (2 -week group). Show rates for those in the next-day group were significantly better than show rates for patients in the 2 -week group.

40|$|Many debt issues {{contain an}} {{embedded}} call option {{that allows the}} issuer to redeem the bond at specified dates for a specified price. The issuer is typically required to provide advance notice of a decision to exercise this call option. The valuation of these contracts is an interesting numerical exercise because optimal decision making by the issuer generally results in a discontinuity in the bond value at each <b>call</b> <b>date.</b> Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that finite difference methods cannot be used to price callable bonds requiring notice (Buttler, 1995; Buttler and Waldvogel, 1996). Poor accuracy was attributed to discontinuities and difficulties in handling boundary conditions. As an alternative, a semi-analytical method using Green's functions for valuing callable bonds with notice was proposed (Buttler and Waldvogel, 1996). Unfortunately, the Green's function method is limited to special cases. Consequently, it is desirable to develop a more general approach. We provide this by using [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Issuances of {{perpetual}} risky debt are often motivated by capital requirements for financial institutions. However, observed market practice indicates that actual maturity equals first possible <b>call</b> <b>date.</b> We analyze callable risky perpetual debt including an initial protection period before the debt may be called. To this end we develop European barrier option pricing formulas in a Black and Cox (1976) environment. The total {{market value of}} debt including the call option is expressed as a portfolio of barrier options and perpetual debt with a time dependent barrier. We analyze how the issuer’s optimal bankruptcy decision is affected by the existence of the call option using closed-form approximations. In accordance with intuition, our model quantifies the increased coupon and the decreased bankruptcy level caused by the embedded option. We show that the option will be exercised even at fairly low asset levels at the time of expiry. Callable perpetual debt; embedded options; barrier options; optimal bankruptcy...|$|E

40|$|Executives often blame {{external}} factors {{for their own}} bad performance. I propose a textual analysis-based measure to detect when corporate executives blame bad performance on {{external factors}} such as industry and economy (referred as BLAME measure). Using this methodology to analyze quarterly earn-ings announcement conference call transcripts, I find that: (1) these attribution behaviors are negatively related to the financial performance, indicating a higher desire to attribute bad performance to external factors; (2) a high BLAME measure predicts low returns subsequent to the conference <b>call</b> <b>date</b> after controlling for {{the tone of the}} transcripts and other known predictive variables. The hedged portfolio that takes long positions in companies with low BLAME measure and short positions in companies with high BLAME measure generates abnormal returns as high as 7 % per year; (3) BLAME measure negatively predicts SUE and analyst recommendation revision in the subsequent quarter, indicating underreaction to firm-specific negative information; (4) a high BLAME measure reduces turnover performance sensi-tivity. Overall, the evidence suggests that investors underreact to negative information when managers attribute bad performance to negative external factors...|$|E
30|$|Maritime {{flows of}} {{merchant}} vessels among ports {{of the world}} have been recorded by the maritime insurance company Lloyd’s List since the late sixteenth century, focusing primarily on the British fleet but since 1890, on any other. An in-depth review of all the research works having used such a unique source of information concluded that it still remains unknown to most shipping specialists (including historians, geographers, and economists). Only a dozen references to Lloyd’s List could be identified in the entire academic literature to date, mostly to retrieve the port calls of a given ship for genealogical purposes, to identify the location of shipwrecks for underwater archaeology, to count the vessel calls at a given port, and to measure the time gap between <b>call</b> <b>date</b> and publication date to analyze the evolution of telecommunications (Ducruet et al. 2015). Given their main focus on container shipping, most studies of maritime networks rather use carrier schedule data provided by Containerisation International, Barry Rogliano Salles (Alphaliner database), or company websites, while others compile information on real-time positioning of ships such as Automated Identification System (AIS). Data from Lloyd’s List appear to be the world’s only possible source to map and analyze global maritime flows back in time, i.e. prior to containerization.|$|E
40|$|Telephone {{healthcare}} {{systems have}} been put forward as a key strategy to overcome geographical disadvantage, however, evidence has suggested that usage decreases with increasing rurality. This research aimed to identify geographical high and low areas of usage of NHS Direct, a leading telephone healthcare provider worldwide to determine if usage is influenced by rurality. National call data was collected (January, 2011) from the NHS Direct Clinical Assessment System for all 0845 4647 calls in England, UK (N= 360, 137). Data extracted for analysis included; unit postcode of patient, type of <b>call,</b> <b>date</b> of call, time of call and final disposition. Calls were mapped using GIS mapping software using full postcode, aggregated by population estimate by local authority to determine confidence intervals across two thresholds by call rate. Uptake rate Output Area Classification (OAC) group profiles was performed using the chi-square goodness of fit. The majority of calls were ‘symptomatic’ (N= 280, 055; 74. 8 %) i. e. calls that were triaged by an expert nurse, with the remaining 25. 2 % of calls health/ medicine information only (N= 94, 430). NHS Direct were able to manage through self-care advice and health information 43. 5 of all calls made (N= 99, 367) with no onward referral needed. Geographical pattern of calls were highest for more urbanised areas with significant higher call usage found in larger cities. Lower observed usage was found {{in areas that are}} more rural of which were characterised by above average older populations. This was supported by geo-segmentation, which highlighted that rural and older communities had the lowest expected uptake rate. There is a variation of usage of NHS Direct relating to rurality, which suggests that this type of service has not been successful in reducing accessible barriers. However, geographical variations are likely to be influenced by age. There is a need for exploratory to determine the underlying factors that contribute to variation in uptake of these services particularly older people who reside in rural communities. This will have worldwide implications as to how telephone based healthcare is introduced...|$|E
