Roughness of cut specimens edge were evaluated by profilometer method according to ISO 13565 standard. For evaluation of surface quality, average roughness (Ra), maximum roughness (R max), valley roughness (Rv) and peak roughness (Rp) were used. Degrees of effectiveness of the parameters were evaluated by fractional factorial design as completely random design at confidence level of 95 %. The result showed that cutting speed, <b>cutting</b> <b>method</b> and feed rate are influencive factors on surface quality of machined specimens and their effects were significant. With increasing cutting speed and decreasing feeding rate the roughness decreased and surface quality improved.
