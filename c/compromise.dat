Before the delegates could formally elect Stevenson, they heard the report on the Committee on Credentials.

A similar dispute in New York was not resolved so easily: Tammany Hall and Tilden's Irving Hall had sent rival delegations as well, and neither was willing to <b>compromise.</b> The Committee had voted to consider the Irving Hall Democrats to have been regularly elected; Tammany was consequently excluded. Debate followed, in which some delegates urged <b>compromise,</b> with the idea that a united delegation would help unite the party in New York in the coming general election. The argument was unpersuasive, as the delegates endorsed the Committee's decision by a vote of 457 to 205½; Tammany was banished. Stevenson was then installed as permanent chairman and, as the Committee on Resolutions had not finished writing the platform, the delegates moved on to nominations.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, Crittenden rejected the idea that secession was inevitable and continued {{to work for the}} preservation of the Union. He believed that the current sectional crisis could—like all past disagreements in U.S. history—be resolved through <b>compromise.</b> However, he believed that this <b>compromise</b> must not be a simple legislative action, which could be altered or even repealed by a successive Congress, but amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which would be much more difficult to change. To that end, he proposed the Crittenden Compromise—a package of six constitutional amendments and four congressional resolutions—in December 1860. Among the resolutions were a condemnation of Northern personal liberty laws and an assertion of the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law. The amendments would have restored the Missouri <b>Compromise</b> line and extended it to California as a line of demarcation between slave and free territories. Crittenden's other amendments would have further guaranteed that slavery would remain legal indefinitely in Washington, D.C., so long as it was legal in either Maryland or Virginia and that slaveholders would be reimbursed for runaway slaves. Also, the amendments denied Congress any power to interfere with the interstate slave trade or with slavery in the existing Southern states and made the fugitive slave law and Three-Fifths <b>Compromise</b> perpetual in duration.|$|E

Estimates of infant mortality indicate that the <b>compromised</b> subpopulation has higher overall mortality but lower birth-weight-specific mortality. We attribute lower birth-weight-specific infant mortality in the <b>compromised</b> subpopulation to higher rates of fetal loss. Compared to European American birth cohorts, African American birth cohorts have (1) higher birth-weight-specific mortality in the normal subpopulation, (2) larger <b>compromised</b> subpopulations, and (3) lower birth-weight-specific mortality in the <b>compromised</b> subpopulation.

40|$|Sensor {{networks}} are often subject to physical attacks. Once a node’s cryptographic key is <b>compromised,</b> an attacker may completely impersonate it and introduce arbitrary false information into the network.

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{framework is}} able to detect the <b>compromised</b> VMs that try to claim receiving an unusual load of client requests, {{to be allowed to}} consume more resources. The <b>compromised</b> VM can hide that its <b>compromised</b> by mimicking normal load and/or flash crowds [44]. The hypervisor calculates the VM load (resources load) based on the <b>compromised</b> VM’s current declared application metrics and compares it with the actual resources load. If the calculated resources load is not within a short range of the actual resources load, there will be a high probability that the VM has been <b>compromised.</b> A possible strategy that a <b>compromised</b> VM may use, is trying to find α and β in order to obtain the model for calculating the resources load load=α+β∗VM_par. This can be done by using different values of α and β. For every α and β, the <b>compromised</b> VM sees the response from the hypervisor (the response is the resources given for the unusual declared metrics). If the <b>compromised</b> VM did not receive a response, the <b>compromised</b> VM tries other values of α and β, until the correct α and β values are obtained (receiving a response from the hypervisor). Although this can be possible, the number of trials will be very high, which makes it infeasible for the attacker, since α and β can be any real number from a large interval. In addition, the attacker will typically not have the opportunity to do a large number of attempts in trying to guess α and β. After several wrong guesses (e.g., 10 wrong attempts), the hypervisor would consider the VM as a <b>compromised</b> and prevent it from using resources.|$|R
30|$|Traditional {{security}} solutions such as cryptography and {{intrusion detection}} {{have been successfully}} applied in the computer networks, but when dealing with the internal <b>compromised</b> nodes, these methods are not so effective.

Thus, <b>compromised</b> nodes can pretend to be a legitimate one from a cryptographic standpoint while undertaking malicious actions.|$|R
