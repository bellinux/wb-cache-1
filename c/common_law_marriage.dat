25|$|Though {{celestial}} {{marriage is}} the only form of marriage recognized as a sacrament, the church permits sex within government-recognized marital unions, the notable exceptions being same-sex marriage, <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>marriage,</b> civil unions (in jurisdictions where marriage is available), and polygamy. The church is sensitive about its historical relationship with polygamy, and entry into a polygamous marriage, even where legal, will result in mandatory consideration of church discipline and possible excommunication. Today, the church's teachings allow married couples to decide what is appropriate sexual behavior between themselves. The law of chastity has also been interpreted to include various standards of modesty, which have varied according to cultural norms of the time. Serious offenses {{of the law of}} chastity may result in church discipline, including the possibility of excommunication.|$|E
25|$|In some states, {{the legal}} {{acceptability}} of <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>marriage</b> is very limited. Some couples, whether {{because there are}} no local formalities relevant to them or because they have strongly held prejudices against compliance with the local forms, decide to create a marriage either by a simple public exchange of vows (per verbis inter praesentes), or by habit and repute. Because the need for conformity between states requires respect for the legal systems, it is now very difficult to identify states with no local system for the celebration and registration of marriages, and even more difficult for the courts of one state to justify a decision to support the prejudices of two of its citizens against the laws of the second state. However, other states permit informal marriages to acquire legal status and, where this happens, there is no reason in principle why international recognition should not follow.|$|E

2500|$|While not {{accorded the}} {{theological}} {{significance of a}} celestial marriage, the LDS Church does recognize civil marriages or marriages performed within other religious traditions.

[...] Today, however, [...] non-celestial marriages are respected and recognized as valid by the church, but such marriages must be legal {{according to the government}} where the marriage is performed, and must not be a same-sex marriage, polygamous marriage, <b>common</b> <b>law</b> <b>marriage,</b> or other type of non-ceremonial marriages in non–common law countries.
