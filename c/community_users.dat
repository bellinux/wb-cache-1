2500|$|The lack of {{features}} in the release version of the game became a point of contention, with many players using the Steam and GOG.com review pages, along with Metacritic reviews, to give it poor ratings. Sean Murray received {{a great deal of}} online criticism from players, including accusations of lying. A Reddit user temporarily took down the documented list of removed features after he received messages that congratulated him on [...] "really sticking it to these 'dirtbag' devs", which was not his intention in publishing the list; he wanted no part of the anger towards Hello Games. The subreddit forum had become hostile {{due to a lack of}} updates from Hello Games or Sony, leading one moderator to delete the subreddit due to the toxicity of the comments, later undoing that action on further review. The Hello Games' Twitter account had been hacked into in October 2016 and used to post the message [...] "No Man’s Sky was a mistake" [...] among other tweets before the companies regained control of it, leading to confusion and additional drama within the <b>community.</b> <b>Users</b> sought refunds for the game via both Sony and Valve outside of the normal time allowance for claiming such refunds by their policies, citing the numerous bugs within the game and/or the lack {{of features}}, and while some players claim to have received such refunds, both companies have reemphasised their refund policies in response to the volume of refund requests.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Customer’s {{involvement}} in product development process, especially in idea generation, product conceptualization and the prototyping, has been examined in several literatures. It is well-known that “online <b>user</b> <b>communities</b> ” {{have provided a}} firm to leverage the creativity of its customers in all stages of the product development process. Nevertheless, the literature lacks a conceptual understanding on how different types of online <b>user</b> <b>communities</b> can influence the product innovation and development. In this study, “online <b>user</b> <b>communities</b> ” are classified, by their characteristic of community members and interaction level, into five types: virtual customer community, beta testing volunteer corps, user content collaboration innovation <b>community,</b> <b>user</b> development <b>community</b> and <b>user</b> product collaboration innovation community. Within these online <b>user</b> <b>communities,</b> we find that (1) different online <b>user</b> <b>communities</b> can be used at different stage of product development. It is more noteworthy that “user product collaboration innovation community ” can be used at all stages of the product development process, especially in design & engineer phase that less explored in literatures.
