5|$|Following birth it was common, {{particularly}} among richer families, {{to employ a}} wet-nurse {{to care for the}} child, sometimes living in with the family. Few sources give an insight into the experiences of young children in this period. Some parents played with their <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> demonstrated grief at their loss. The primary responsibility for bringing up young children fell on the mother. For older children, the major duty of parents was, according to the Kirk, to ensure the spiritual development of the child, with fathers leading daily family prayers, {{but it is not clear}} how widely these practices were adopted.|$|E
5|$|After the event, in {{response}} to Owen Hart's death, the WWF canceled the encore presentation of Over the Edge via pay-per-view, and they also canceled four live events in Canada and one in Illinois. Information about Over the Edge from the WWF (now named the WWE) is sparse because the event was never released on VHS or DVD due to Hart's death. In 2014, the event was shown in an edited form on the WWE Network. On May 24, 1999, the day following this event, a tribute to Hart was held on Raw is War in St. Louis, which the WWF called Raw is Owen. For this show, all storylines and rivalries were stopped, and wrestlers were given the option to wrestle or not. The show also featured interviews and testimonies from his coworkers and highlights of his professional wrestling career. Hart's funeral service was held on May 31, 1999, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and it was attended by family members, friends, and over 300 wrestlers who were acquainted with him. Following the funeral, Hart was buried in Calgary's Queens Park Cemetery later that day. Three weeks after the event, his widow, <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> sued the WWF for causing Owen's death with a poorly planned stunt; they claimed that the harness system was defective. After the court case had extended one-and-a-half years, a settlement was reached on November 2, 2000, when the WWF agreed to pay his widow, <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> US$18million. The manufacturer of the harness system had also been named as a defendant in the case but was dismissed from the case after the settlement was reached.|$|E
5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> <b>Parents</b> at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|The 1924 ban on {{immigration}} produced unusually well-defined generational {{groups within the}} Japanese-American community. The issei were exclusively those who had immigrated before 1924; some desired {{to return to their}} homeland. Because no new immigration was permitted, all Japanese Americans born after 1924 were, by definition, born in the U.S. and automatically U.S. citizens. This nisei generation were a distinct cohort from their parents. In addition to the usual generational differences, issei men had been typically ten to fifteen years older than their wives, making them significantly older than the younger children of their often large families. U.S. law prohibited Japanese immigrants from becoming naturalized citizens, making them dependent on their children to rent or purchase property. Communication between English-speaking <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> who spoke mostly or completely in Japanese was often difficult. A significant number of older nisei, many of whom were born prior to the immigration ban, had married and already started families of their own by the time the US joined World War II.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, only 15% of white, 6% of Hispanic, and 5% of African-American deaf {{high school}} {{graduates}} in the United States read above the sixth-grade level. In 1986, the median reading level of deaf American {{high school graduates}} was fourth grade. These concerning numbers are generally the result of varying levels of early language exposure. Most deaf children are born to hearing parents, which usually leaves a deficiency in their language exposure and development compared to <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> who use the same modality to communicate. This group of children acquire {{a wide range of}} proficiency in a first language, which then impacts their ability to become proficient in a second (though sometimes possibly a first) language in the written modality. Children exposed to Manually Coded English (MCE) as their primary form of communication show lower literary levels than their ASL signing peers. However in countries such as Sweden which have adopted a bilingual–bicultural policy in their schools for the deaf, one sees a higher literacy rate compared to school systems favoring an oral tradition.|$|E

The exact number of people who received ambulatory assistance immediately after the crisis is not known, but is estimated to be around 700 (753 according to the UN). Moscow-based military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer concluded on 7 September 2004 that 90% of the surviving hostages had sustained injuries. At least 437 people, including 221 children, were hospitalized; 197 children were taken to the Children’s Republican Clinical Hospital in the North Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz, and 30 were in cardiopulmonary resuscitation units in critical condition. Another 150 people were transferred to the Vladikavkaz Emergency Hospital. Sixty-two people, including 12 children, were treated in two local hospitals in Beslan, while 6 children with severe injuries were flown to Moscow for specialist treatment. The majority of the children were treated for burns, gunshot injuries, shrapnel wounds, and mutilation caused by explosions.

25|$|Adolescence marks a {{rapid change}} in one's role within a family. Young {{children}} tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship {{with his or her}} parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites {{in the first place and}} this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.|$|E

Although previous studies identify environmental predictors of parent perceived safety, {{little is known}} about predictors of child perceived safety. This study aims to identify the social and physical environmental neighborhood features that predict <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> perceived neighborhood safety and, simultaneously, to assess the association between <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> perceptions. Data were from the QUebec Adipose and Lifestyle InvesTigation in Youth (QUALITY) cohort, an ongoing study of Caucasian children (aged 8 - 10 years) with a parental history of obesity, <b>and</b> their biological <b>parents</b> from Québec, Canada. Measures of social and physical neighborhood features were collected using a spatial data infrastructure and in-person audits.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the agreement between the <b>child</b> self-reports <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> proxy reports of the PedsQL 3. 0 Asthma Module in Iranian children with asthma to evaluate HRQoL. Moreover, the psychometric properties of the <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> reports of the PedsQL 3. 0 Asthma Module were assessed in the present study. Methods: Participants were 112 <b>children</b> with asthma <b>and</b> their <b>parents,</b> who completed the Farsi version of the PedsQL 3. 0 Asthma Module. The multitrait-multimethod correlation matrix and factor analysis were used to test whether the <b>child</b> self-reports <b>and</b> the <b>parent</b> proxy reports measured the same construct. Additionally, convergent and discriminant validity and internal consistency were assessed using the Pearson correlation. Results: The correlation between the <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> HRQoL perceptions ranged between 0. 13 and 0. 36 across the same domains. Our factor analysis revealed that the <b>child</b> self-reports <b>and</b> the <b>parent</b> proxy reports measured 2 different constructs of HRQoL.
