5|$|Construction was in two phases. A {{level section}} from Tiverton to Lowdwells on the Devon/Somerset border, opened in 1814, and was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{carrying}}</b> broad-beam barges, carrying up to 40tons. The Somerset section, suitable for tub-boats, which were about 20feet (6.1m) long and <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> eight tons, opened in 1839. It included an inclined plane and seven boat lifts, the earliest lifts to see commercial {{service in the}} UK. The lifts predated the Anderton Boat Lift by nearly 40 years.|$|E

50|$|Darensbourg has {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of synthetic mimics of Hydrogenase enzymes. These include synthetic complexes featuring Fe-based organometallics species, which serve as precursor for producing iron only Hydrogenase enzyme active site. These enzymes are <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> out reaction {{even in the absence}} of the protein-based active site organization or carry out the proton production with high efficiencies. However, these Hydrogenase enzymes were found to be highly sensitive with di-oxygen, which can over oxidize and inactivate them. Even after the oxygen was removed, they don’t regain catalytic activity immediately but through multiple processes.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "boat" [...] {{refers to}} small craft {{limited in their}} use by size and usually not <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> making lengthy {{independent}} voyages at sea. The old navy adage to differentiate between ships and boats is that boats are <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> being <b>carried</b> by ships. (Submarines by this rule are ships rather than boats, but are customarily referred to as boats reflecting their previous smaller size.) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{high speed}} digital {{circuits}} became more prominent with incorporating information processing and computing. Arithmetic circuits {{play a very}} critical role in both general-purpose and application specific computational circuits. The modern computers lead to the deterioration in performance of arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, on the aspects <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> propagation delay, large circuit complexity and high power consumption. Designing this adder using QSD number representation allows fast addition/subtraction which is <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> free addition and borrows free subtraction because the carry propagation chain are eliminated, hence it reduce the propagation time in comparison with radix 2 system. QSD number system based on quaternary system, each digit can be represented by a number from- 3 to- 3. Operation on large number of digits such as 64, 128 or more, can be implemented with constant delay and complexity...|$|R

25|$|In its {{essentials}} {{simply an}} enlarged version of BOAR, {{which it was}} intended to replace in service, Hopi was designed as a medium-range weapon <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> being <b>carried</b> by a wide variety of carrier-based fighter and attack aircraft. The rocket-powered missile was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> being fitted with a W50 nuclear warhead <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> producing a yield between 60 and 400 kilotons; however, no details of the planned guidance system for the missile, or if there even was intended to be guidance at all, have survived.|$|R
2500|$|The commissioners {{strongly}} recommended safety improvements, {{starting with}} easy access to emergency hatches. Balloons of the late 1930s were equipped with large parachutes <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> safely <b>carrying</b> the detached gondolas; another proposal, integrating airtight gondolas into detachable gliders, was tested and discarded. VR60 Komsomol (1939) [...] had another safety feature: in case of abnormally rapid descent its balloon was designed to flatten into a gigantic parachute canopy.|$|R
5|$|The F-84 was {{the first}} {{production}} fighter aircraft to utilize inflight refueling and the first fighter <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> a nuclear weapon, the Mark 7 nuclear bomb. Modified F-84s were used in several unusual projects, including the FICON and Tom-Tom dockings to the B-29 Superfortress and B-36 bomber motherships, and the experimental XF-84H Thunderscreech turboprop.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} services, the Congolese Air Force is not <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's {{aircraft}} are currently flyable or {{capable of being}} restored to service and {{it is unclear whether}} the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.|$|E
5|$|The 757-200M, a {{convertible}} version <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> cargo and passengers on its main deck, entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in 1988. Also {{known as the}} 757-200 Combi, the type retains the passenger windows and cabin doors of the 757-200, while adding a forward port-side cargo door {{in the manner of}} the 757-200PF. Kathmandu-based Royal Nepal Airlines, later renamed Nepal Airlines, included the convertible model as part of an order for two 757s in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|A miniaturised EPIRB <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> being <b>carried</b> in crew members' {{clothing}} {{is called a}} Personal Locator Beacon (PLB).

5|$|According to an anecdote, {{the idea}} arose after {{a group of}} Royal Navy {{officers}} saw a similar, but fictional, bomb depicted in the 1943 Walt Disney animated propaganda film Victory Through Air Power, and the name Disney was consequently given to the weapon. The Royal Navy developed the bomb even though the Fleet Air Arm operated no aircraft <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> it. The navy was interested in a concrete-penetrating weapon due to the German navy's extensive use of fortified submarine pens to protect their U-boats and E-boats from air attack while docked.|$|E
5|$|After many {{boats were}} wrecked and {{several hundred people}} died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} safety rules, vetting the boats carefully and forbidding women and children to travel through the rapids. Additional rules stated that any boat carrying passengers required a licensed pilot, typically costing $25 ($680), although some prospectors simply unpacked their boats and let them drift unmanned through the rapids {{with the intent of}} walking down to collect them on the other side. During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> boats and equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate the rapids.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed to be <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO {{would be able to}} switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E

5|$|Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. Turboprop options were also considered, but they were so new that Bristol could not guarantee the performance specifications.|$|E
5|$|Myers made eleven {{hydrogen}} balloons for the Navy for Admiral Francis J. Higginson in 1902 for {{a military}} exercise. Ten of the balloons were six feet in diameter and used for signaling purposes that troops were nearby. The eleventh balloon of 12,000 cubic feet capacity was twenty-eight-feet in diameter. It was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> two men and all their associated observation equipment. It {{was used by the}} Signal Corps for a high altitude observation platform to monitor enemy warships. This balloon was tethered to and controlled by a Navy ship. The intelligence gleaned about the enemy and its possible intentions could be passed on to the Army.|$|E
5|$|Residents and {{visitors}} wishing {{to travel to}} Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, and other destinations along the Inside Passage may use the BC Ferries car and passenger ferry service from two terminals in the communities of Tsawwassen and Horseshoe Bay, south and north of Vancouver respectively. BC Ferries operates the Queen of Coquitlam, a C class ferry <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> 362 cars and 1,466 passengers, which was launched in 1976.
