40|$|As digital terrain {{models are}} {{indispensable}} for visualizing and modeling geographic processes, terrain <b>information</b> <b>content</b> {{is useful for}} terrain generalization and representation. For terrain generalization, if the terrain information is considered, the generalized terrain may be of higher fidelity. In other words, the richer the terrain information at the terrain surface, the smaller the degree of terrain simplification. Terrain <b>information</b> <b>content</b> is also important for {{evaluating the quality of}} the rendered terrain, e. g., the rendered web terrain tile service in Google Maps (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). However, a unified definition and measures for terrain <b>information</b> <b>content</b> have not been established. Therefore, in this paper, a definition and measures for terrain <b>information</b> <b>content</b> from Digital Elevation Model (DEM, i. e., a digital model or 3 D representation of a terrain’s surface) data are proposed and are based on the theory of map <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> remote sensing image <b>information</b> <b>content</b> and other geospatial <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> The <b>information</b> entropy was taken as the information measuring method for the terrain <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> Two experiments were carried out to verify the measurement methods of the terrain <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> One is the analysis of terrain <b>information</b> <b>content</b> in different geomorphic types, and the results showed that the more complex the geomorphic type, the richer the terrain <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> The other is the analysis of terrain <b>information</b> <b>content</b> with different resolutions, and the results showed that the finer the resolution, the richer the terrain information.

40|$|This study {{distinguishes between}} {{incremental}} and relative <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> Incremental comparisons ask whether one accounting measure provides <b>information</b> <b>content</b> beyond that provided by another, and apply when one measure {{is viewed as}} given and an assessment is desired regarding the incremental contribution of another (e. g., a supplemental disclosure). Relative comparisons ask which measure has greater <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> and apply when making mutually exclusive choices among alternatives, or when rankings by <b>information</b> <b>content</b> are desired (e. g., when comparing alternative disclosures). Questions of both incremental and relative <b>information</b> <b>content</b> arise frequently in accounting. However, few previous studies have examined questions of relative <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> Possible explanations include unfamiliarity with the relative versus incremental distinction, and the additional statistical complexity involved in testing for relative <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> First, we examine analytically the relation between incremental and relative <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> demonstrating that they address different research questions and require different tests for statistical significance. Second, we identify accounting research contexts in which questions of relative and incremental <b>information</b> <b>content</b> arise. Third, we propose a new regression-based test for relative <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> This test applies to both returns and valuation studies, generalizes to any number of predictor variables, {{and can be used}} in conjunction with White's (1980) adjustment for heteroskedasticity. Fourth, we illustrate tests for relative and incremental <b>information</b> <b>content</b> in a familiar research setting that compares the <b>information</b> <b>contents</b> of net income, cash flows, and net sales in 40 industries. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In a given {{space of}} models or {{hypothesis}} the individual <b>information</b> <b>content</b> {{of each of}} them is considered {{as opposed to the}} Shannon entropy that measures the average <b>information</b> <b>content</b> of the mentioned space. In particular expressing Bayes Theorem in terms of the <b>information</b> <b>contents</b> associated to its probabilities allows understanding how bits of information, introduced in the system by an observation, are transferred to each of the models in the space. It is shown how, from a single observation not one, but two causal information sources are generated: the <b>Information</b> <b>Content</b> Associated to the Evidence that always introduces positive information, and the <b>Information</b> <b>Content</b> Associated to the Bayes Likelihood that always introduces negative bits; therefore the evidence contributes to increase the probability of occurrence of the model and the likelihood to decrease it; depending on the net value of the difference between these two mentioned <b>information</b> <b>contents,</b> the <b>information</b> that arrives to a given model will be positive or negative. Thus, we propose a novel metric, given by the difference of the two mentioned <b>information</b> <b>contents</b> called transfer <b>information</b> <b>content</b> which measures the information transferred to each of the single models in the space. The resolution of the Monty Hall Problem (MHP) and some of its variants in the Information Theory framework proposed allows to confirm the validity of the formulas derived and to understand the counterintuitive and theoretically problematic concept of negative information. The implications of the concepts introduced in terms of information transfer to the emergent field of Local Information Dynamics, to Computational Neuroscience (particularly to Directed Information Theory and Neural Coding) are proposed as further work.
