5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Americans felt that they were better {{prepared}} to deliver destruction to the trail system. During Commando Hunt III (1 November 1969 to 30 April 1970), the Air Force claimed that 6,428 enemy trucks destroyed and another 3,604 damaged. 60 aircraft were shot down during this phase of the campaign by an estimated 743 anti-aircraft weapons. This increased number of aircraft losses forced the Air Force to decree that flak suppression missions would accompany the bombers on missions over the trail. Armed with <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> units (CBUs), the fighter bombers were poised to pounce upon any enemy anti-aircraft positions identified by other aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The M43 BZ <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb,</b> {{or simply}} M43 <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb,</b> was a U.S. {{chemical}} <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> intended {{to deliver the}} incapacitating agent known as BZ. The weapon was produced in the early 1960s and all stocks of U.S. BZ were destroyed by 1989.|$|E
25|$|The M34 <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> was {{the first}} mass-produced United States Army weapon meant to deliver the {{chemical}} agent sarin (GB). A large stockpile of M34s was destroyed between 1973 and 1976.|$|E
5|$|The use of M85S <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> by the Georgians and RBK 250 <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> by the Russians {{resulted}} in civilian casualties. Georgia {{was reported to}} have used cluster munitions twice to hit civilians fleeing via the main escape road and admitted using <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> against Russian troops and near the Roki Tunnel. Russia denied using <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>cluster</b> <b>bombing</b> of Niš was {{an event}} that {{occurred}} on 7 May 1999 during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. It was the most serious event involving civilian deaths {{and the use of}} <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> during the NATO campaign in Yugoslavia. The <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> had been dropped by Royal Netherlands Air Force.|$|R
25|$|The M44 {{generator}} cluster was an American chemical <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> {{designed to}} deliver the incapacitating agent BZ. It was first mass-produced in 1962 and all stocks of the weapons were destroyed by 1989.|$|E
25|$|The M125 bomblet was a U.S. {{chemical}} sub-munition {{designed to}} deliver the nerve agent sarin. It was brought into service in 1954 with the M34 <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> {{as part of the}} first U.S. air-delivered nerve agent weapon.|$|E
25|$|As the United States Army Chemical Corps focused {{its efforts}} on the weaponization of sarin nerve agent (GB) during the 1950s the M34 <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> was the first such weapon mass-produced by the Army. The weapon was the United States' first major nerve agent weapon after World War II.|$|E
50|$|On May 7, 1999, a CBU-87 {{was used}} {{in one of the}} most serious {{incidents}} involving civilian deaths and <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs,</b> the <b>cluster</b> <b>bombing</b> of Niš.|$|R
50|$|About 2,000 <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> {{containing}} 380,000 sub-munitions {{were dropped}} on Yugoslavia during the Operation Allied Force, in 1999, {{of which the}} Royal Air Force dropped 531 RBL755 <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R
50|$|American media also {{questioned}} whether Israel violated an agreement {{not to use}} <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> on civilian targets. Although many of the <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> used were advanced M-85 munitions developed by Israel Military Industries, Israel also used older munitions purchased from the US. Evidence during the conflict had shown that <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> had hit civilian areas, although the civilian population had mostly fled, as well as Israel claiming that Hezbollah frequently used civilian areas to stockpile weaponry and fire rockets, in violation of international law. Many bomblets remained undetonated after the war, causing hazard for Lebanese civilians. Israel said {{that it had not}} violated any international law because <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> are not illegal and were used only on military targets.|$|R
25|$|The Elwood {{unit was}} reopened in 1966 and would produce {{artillery}} rounds, supplementary charge assemblies and <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> units. The Kankakee unit was reopened in 1965 and would manufacture TNT until 1976. During the Vietnam War the Joliet Arsenal was renamed Joliet Army Ammunition Plant. The majority of {{operations at the}} facility were terminated by the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The missile was {{designed}} to meet the RAF's requirement for a long range anti-armour weapon, allowing strike aircraft to attack tanks and armoured vehicles at stand-off range, replacing the BL755 <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb.</b> This requirement was issued following an assessment of the British military's performance in the Gulf War. GEC-Marconi (whose missile interests now form part of MBDA) was originally awarded the contract on 7 November 1996.|$|E
25|$|The United States Army re-evaluated its {{chemical}} and biological weapons programs in 1961. This re-evaluation led to a renewed focus on an incapacitating agent program. A project was established to begin producing BZ munitions; one result was the mass production of the Chemical Corps' M43 BZ <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> in March 1962. Though M43s and another BZ weapon, the M44 generator cluster, were produced, they were never really considered {{an integral part of the}} U.S. chemical arsenal. In the end around 1,500 BZ munitions were produced between the M43 and the M44.|$|E
50|$|The {{death toll}} {{estimates}} {{do not include}} Lebanese killed {{since the end of}} fighting by land mines or unexploded Israeli <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs.</b> Between {{the end of the war}} and November 2008, approximately 40 people were killed and over 270 injured by <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In December 2016, a Saudi {{spokesperson}} {{admitted that}} at least some of the coalition's <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> were manufactured in the United Kingdom. British prime minister Theresa May refused to answer when asked in parliament when she first became aware that UK-made <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> were being used.|$|R
50|$|Anti-personnel <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> use {{explosive}} fragmentation to kill {{troops and}} destroy soft (unarmored) targets. Along with incendiary <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs,</b> these {{were among the}} first forms of <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> produced by Germany during World War II. They were famously used during the Blitz with delay and booby-trap fusing to hamper firefighting and other damage-control efforts in the bombed areas. They were also used with a contact fuze when attacking entrenchments. These weapons were most widely used during the Vietnam War when many thousands of tons of submunitions were dropped on Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.|$|R
25|$|The M125 bomblet was a sub-munition of the M34 <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb,</b> {{which was}} first brought into regular service by the United States Army in 1954. In {{development}} the M125 {{was known as}} the E54R6 bomblet (shortened to E54). The M34 and its payload of M125s was the first air-delivered nerve agent weapon in the U.S. chemical arsenal. Later, the Chemical Corps developed chemical-biological warheads for multiple missile systems including, Matador, Rascal, Snark, and Navaho missiles. These warheads incorporated the M125 bomblet and the M114 bomblet. Over 21,000 of the M125 containing M34 bombs were destroyed at Rocky Mountain Arsenal in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Coalition forces {{shot down}} several Iraqi F1s during the Gulf War, such as six F1EQs that {{were shot down}} by USAF F-15 Eagles. A pair of F1EQs, which were {{preparing}} {{to carry out a}} Beluga <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> attack on Saudi oil facilities were shot down by a Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) F-15C. Of a pre-conflict force of 88 Mirage F1EQs, 23 was destroyed in the war, a further six were damaged, 24 were flown to Iran and interned; only 23 aircraft remained {{by the end of the}} Gulf War. Of the 23 destroyed Iraqi Mirage F1EQs, 9 were claimed to have been destroyed in aerial combat.|$|E
25|$|The M34 was {{designed}} to hold 76 M125 bomblets, arranged in four groups of 19. Each bomblet held 2.6 pounds of the nerve agent sarin, and 8.8 ounces of the explosive tetryl. The ten pound cylindrical M125 bomblet also held an opening delay, fuze and parachute, {{as well as a}} burster, which contained the explosive. A M34 <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb,</b> fully loaded with M125 bomblets, had an agent weight to weapon weight ratio of 17 percent; the M34 and M125 were not the best delivery system. Eventually, cylindrical chemical bomblets, such as the M125, were supplanted by spherical models because they could obtain a greater coverage area.|$|E

"Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Dan Halutz {{plans to}} appoint a major general to {{investigate}} the use of <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> — {{some of which were}} fired against his order — during the Lebanon war. Halutz ordered the IDF to use <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> with extreme caution and not to fire them into populated areas. Nonetheless, it did so anyway, primarily using artillery batteries and the Multiple Launch System (MRLS). IDF artillery, MLRS and aircraft are thought to have delivered thousands of <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs,</b> containing a total of some 4 million bomblets during the war." ...|$|R
50|$|In June 2016, the NSA's base near al-Tanf {{was hit by}} {{multiple}} <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> from Russian airstrikes, killing 2 and injuring 18.

25|$|In May 1971, the Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, {{initiated}} the program Credible Chase {{to evaluate the}} potential use of armed light utility short takeoff and landing aircraft in Southeast Asia. The program was designed to add mobility and firepower to the Republic of Vietnam Air Forces {{in a relatively short}} time. Two commercial aircraft were selected for testing: the Fairchild Porter and the Helio Stallion. Initial performance testing was conducted with leased aircraft (Porter N352F, c/n 2011) at Eglin Air Force Base and was successful enough to warrant a combat evaluation. The Porter, designated AU-23A, was fitted with a side-firing 20mm XM-197 Gatling cannon, four wing pylons and a center fuselage station for external ordnance. The 20mm cannon was essentially a three barrel version of the M61 Vulcan 6-barrel 20mm cannon. The aircraft could carry a variety of ordnance including forward firing gun pods, 500- and 250-pound bombs, napalm units, <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> units, flares, rockets, smoke grenades and propaganda leaflet dispensers. The combat evaluation, PAVE COIN, was done in June and July 1971.|$|E
25|$|The CIA {{paramilitary}} {{agents in}} MR 3 were {{unique in the}} Laotian Civil War in the direct control {{they were allowed to}} exert on their irregular operations. In early 1969, MR 3 hosted three Royalist guerrilla battalions newly trained by the CIA at its Savannakhet base. On 23 March, two of Red Battalion's companies, with 115 men apiece, were tasked with the Operation Duck raid on an enemy complex housed in a cave southeast of Mahaxay. The purpose of the raid was to destroy the complex while gathering enemy documents for military intelligence analysis. Helilifted in by the 20th Special Operations Squadron (20th SOS) and Air America under air cover of U.S. Air Force (USAF) tactical fighter strikes, the guerrillas were heavily engaged by the PAVN. Four times the communist headquarters was struck by U.S. Air Force jets depositing napalm, <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> units, and 2,000 pound bombs. After suffering four killed, and having killed 40 of their foe, the raiders noted an incoming thunderstorm that would halt air strikes and fled southwards. On 26 March, eight CH-3E helicopters of the 20th SOS began evacuating the Red Battalion troops. They removed 70, but received battle damage from heavy ground fire to five helicopters, and aborted the mission. The remaining Royalist troops evaded the communists and moved to Route 122 to be removed on 27 March. Despite these disappointing results, the new guerrilla force was deemed ready for further action.|$|E
500|$|Although Little Boy {{exploded}} {{with the}} energy equivalent of 16,000 tons of TNT, the Strategic Bombing Survey estimated that the same blast and fire effect could {{have been caused by}} 2,100 tons of conventional bombs: [...] "220 B-29s carrying 1,200 tons of incendiary bombs, 400 tons of high-explosive bombs, and 500 tons of anti-personnel fragmentation bombs." [...] Since the target was spread across a two-dimensional plane, the vertical component of a single spherical nuclear explosion was largely wasted. A <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> pattern of smaller explosions would have been a more energy-efficient match to the target.|$|E
5000|$|Unexploded <b>cluster</b> <b>bombs</b> {{dropped by}} Israeli warplanes or duds fired by {{artillery}} remain {{in much of}} South Lebanon, and have killed 12 people and wounded 39, according to Chris Clarke, head of the U.N.

Block B brought an improved Synthetic Aperture Radar, and upgrades to the Defensive Countermeasures System and was fielded in 1995. Block C provided an [...] "enhanced capability" [...] for delivery of up to 30 <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> units (CBUs) per sortie with modifications made to 50 bomb racks.|$|E
500|$|According to {{designer}} Peter Johansson, {{the game}} {{would support a}} variety of downloadable content and DLC was released on PlayStation Store, Steam and Xbox Live Marketplace after the game's release. The Black Market Aerial Pack included an F-33 Dragonfly jet fighter, dual parachute thrusters and a multi-lock missile launcher. The Black Market Boom Pack included a quad rocket launcher, a <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> launcher and an air-propulsion gun. The Black Market Chaos Pack included Rico's signature gun, an Agency hovercraft, a Chevalier Classic, a bull's-eye assault rifle and Tuk Tuk Boom Boom. Although the pack is no longer available, its contents may be downloaded separately. Avalanche also released several pieces of free DLC, including a Chevalier Icebreaker (an ice-cream truck with bullbars), Tuk Tuk Boom Boom (introducing a tuk tuk with a [...] "roof-mounted weapon of mass destruction") and a Chaos Parachute pack.|$|E
