40|$|The major {{thrust of}} this {{briefing}} {{paper is to}} evaluate current and past railwaypolicy and to outline proposals which can overcome previous policy failures.

On the basis of this reappraisal, suggestions are made for the possible restructuring of railway services and the implications of such proposals for Scottish railway services are explored...|$|R
