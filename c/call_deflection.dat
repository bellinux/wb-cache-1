Aircraft were soon added to the list and the others fell from significance. Anti-aircraft was direct fire, the layer aiming at the aircraft. However, the target is moving in three dimensions and this makes it a difficult target. The basic issue is that either the layer aims at the target and some mechanism aligns the gun at the future (time of flight) position of the target or the layer aims at the future position of the aircraft.

5000|$|The {{most common}} use for this {{technique}} is controlling {{the path of a}} stream of electrons in a vacuum. One application is in small cathode ray tubes for oscilloscopes. In these tubes the electric field is created by two sets of paired electrodes, mounted at right angles, that the electron stream flows between. This arrangement allows independent deflection of the beam in two dimensions (usually perceived as up/down (vertical) and right/left (horizontal)). The electrodes are commonly <b>called</b> <b>deflection</b> plates. Traditionally, the electrons pass through the vertical deflection plates first, yielding slightly higher sensitivity because of the longer travel time from the vertical deflection plates to the phosphor screen as compared to the horizontal deflection plates. In very high speed oscilloscopes, the deflection plates were often complex structures, combining a series of sub-plates with an electrical delay line. By matching the propagation speed of the electrical signal with the transit speed of the electrons, maximum bandwidth (frequency response) was achieved.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{with the performance}} of the travelling wave ultrasonic motor (TWUSM). The performance of TWUSM is mainly constraint by the quality of the piezoceramic material, the electrical driving signal synchronisation and optimization, the heat dissipation system during the operation and the stator-roto interface designed. One of the factors in the stator-rotor interface design is the deflection amplifier mechanism. Under travelling wave electrical excitation, the piezoceramic layer of the stator vibrates by expanding and compressing. The amplitude of the vibration is amplified by the metal attached {{on the top of the}} piezoceramic layer. The metal vibration is in contact with the rotor and through a frictional layer, torque is generated and the rotor rotates. This mechanism of transferring the piezoceramic vibration to the rotor motion is <b>called</b> <b>deflection</b> amplifier. Current TWUSM utilises the comb-teeth structure as the deflection amplifier. One of the factors that influence the deflection amplifier is the position of the stator neutral axis to the contact surface of the stator. Thus, the objective of this thesis is to modify the design of the comb-teeth stator so that the neutral axis position is further distance from the stator top contact surface. The proposed solution is to remove selected mass element from the combteeth structure. Modelling and simulation of the proposed concept were carried out under Marc Mentat FEM software utilising Shinsei USR 60 as the chosen TWUSM. Results from the modal, harmonic, transient and stress analyses indicate that the modified comb-teeth stator increases the position of the neutral axis from the stator top surface. Due to the neutral axis shifting, simulation results also confirm that the stator speed increases for the modified stator. To observe the performance of the modified stator, experiments were conducted using Shinsei USR 60 as the test platform. One set of Shinsei USR 60 motor was modified by drilling hole to the comb-teeth structure. Results from experiments confirm that the motor with the modified stator produced better speed, torque and power consumption...|$|R

The development of a magnetic deflection system and the calculations necessary to determine the associated performance are both complex tasks. Their complexity arises from the detailed geometry involved in deflection unit designs, {{the wide range of}} product types and sizes, and variability in product performance specifications. The large variations of these issues compound the difficulty in realising an acceptable product design. Software simulation techniques which are able to accurately manipulate data and perform iterative calculations greatly aid this process.

In OBS, incoming IP packets are assembled into super-sized packets called data bursts. Burst contention is a well-known challenging problem in Optical Burst Switching (OBS) networks. Burst contention can be resolved using several approaches, such as wavelength conversion, buffering based on fiber delay line (FDL) or deflection routing Retransmission technique is used to reduce the Burst Loss Ratio (BLR) by deflecting dropped bursts. Segmentation also resolves contention by dividing the contended burst into smaller parts <b>called</b> segments. Combining <b>deflection</b> routing technique and retransmission technique outperforms both pure deflection and pure retransmission techniques to improve the performance.

Experiments were conducted to test the proposed protocol. The proposed technique was tested on complex models such as NSFNET and COST 238 topologies.

Whether or not intrinsicoid deflections (MacLeod et al., 1930) occur in prncordial leads is of considerable interest to vectorcardiographers, most ofwhom base their work on the belief that events represented in the electrocardiogram find themselves, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, represented in the corresponding vectorcardiogram. The significance of correlation between the ECG and the VCG has been pointed out by Duchosal and Sulzer (1949). The introduction of more advanced vectorcardiographic lead systems has improved such correlation (Sano et al., 1959) and certain cancellation experiments have indicated that on theoretical grounds, with accurate image space data for the individual examined, almost perfect correlation might be achieved (Frank, 1959). This view has not, however, been universally accepted; for example, McFee and Parungao (1959) have cast some doubt upon previous interpretations of cancellation experiments.

It {{is possible to}} bypass these buffers when they are empty, reducing dynamic power, but static buffer power, and dynamic power when buffers are utilized, remain. To improve energy efficiency, buffer less deflection routing removes input buffers, and instead uses deflection (misrouting) to resolve contention. However, at high network load,deflections cause unnecessary network hops, wasting power and reducing performance.

40|$|In {{microsystem}} applications, many MEMS {{devices are}} submerged in fluid and their responses and performances are directly {{influenced by the}} microfluid-microstructure interactions. Recent developments in microfluidic devices such as micro pumps, micro valves, micro viscometer, biomedical related micro fluidic chips, have necessitated investigations on fluid-structure interactions at the micro levels. A microcantilever submerged in microfluidic channel forms the simplest model for such investigations. The study of such interactions however necessitates systematic developments in suitable experimental methods. In this dissertation, a polymer base micro-fabrication process called "soft-lithography" is adopted to fabricate microcantilever integrated microfluidic channels. An experimental setup is designed to characterize the dynamic behavior of the submerged microcantilever using a new method <b>called</b> DVIP (<b>Deflection</b> using Video Image Processing) method. The DVIP method is used to estimate the deflection or dynamic responses of microcantilever under different flow conditions. The flow behaviors could also be characterized from {{the response of the}} microcantilever. A finite element model of the microstructure is developed and results obtained from this model are validated using the experimental results. The finite element model also provides considerable potential to investigate the influence of fluid viscosity on the dynamic responses of the microcantilever. A microcantilever integrated within the microfluidic chip was subsequently tested in the laboratory with fluids of different viscosities. The results obtained are analyzed and discussed {{in the context of an}} application development such as a viscometer. An effort is made to visualize the flows near the cantilever tip using the fluids mixed with fluorescent particles. The DVIP method is further extended to estimate the full cantilever beam deflection, which can be applied for determining the mode of vibration. Finally, it is established that the DVIP method is a reliable approach to estimate the dynamic deflections of a microcantilever subject to fluid forces. The concept of the micro viscometer that is developed in the current study can be miniaturized by integrating a miniature camera and an integrated circuit within the microfluidic chip. The current study, however, is limited to square cross-section microfluidic chip, while the proposed methodology would be applicable to study the responses of the microcantilever integrated within channels of different cross-sections. The DVIP method also offers considerable potential to characterize nano-electromechanical devices by integrating a more efficient and faster camer...|$|R

The main impulse (MI) of SCs is caused by two-cell ionospheric currents of the DP- 2 (disturbance polar of the second type) type as well as a pair of region- 1 (R 1)-sense FACs. MIs are often preceded by a reversed sense of smaller magnetic field <b>deflections</b> <b>called</b> a preliminary impulse (PI), which corresponds to two-cell ionospheric currents of a reversed DP- 2 type and a pair of R 2 -sense FACs.
