5|$|Bakshi {{recognized}} Kricfalusi's talent, {{and wanted}} {{to put him in}} <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> project that would showcase the young animator's skills. Bakshi and Kricfalusi co-wrote the screenplay Bobby's Girl as a take on the teen films of the era. Jeff Sagansky, president of production at TriStar Pictures, put up $150,000 to develop the project, prompting Bakshi to move back to Los Angeles. When Sagansky left TriStar, Bakshi was forced to pitch the film again, but the studio's new executives did not understand its appeal and cut off financing. Bakshi and Zingarelli began to develop a feature about Hollywood's Golden Age, and Bakshi Productions crewmembers worked on proposed cartoons influenced by pulp fiction. Bobby's Girl was reworked as a potential prime time series called Suzy's in Love, but attracted no serious interest.|$|E

He would later earn the Polish Cross of Valor for helping lead over 100 of his men out of a German encirclement to safety without a single casualty.

5|$|During 1166, Neville was {{in charge}} of Staffordshire for the general eyre {{undertaken}} in that year, and also tried the pleas of the forest for Devonshire and Worcestershire, and perhaps elsewhere. The abbot of Battle Abbey in 1167 sent a monk to plead with Waleran of Meulan to intervene and stop Neville's exactions on the abbot's manors. After the Revolt of 1173–74, Neville was in <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forest eyre held from 1176 to 1178 which resulted in fines totaling 12,000 pounds from breaches of the forest law during the revolt. It appears that the king intended this eyre to be a punishment, and used the forest law because it was solely dependent on the king's will rather than being based in customary law.|$|E

Thereafter Tartar returned to the American coast and tracked slowly southwards back to the Straits of Magellan.|$|E

In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie, the playwright.

5|$|Leeds Parish Church, rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1841 {{after an}} {{elaborate}} ceremony, was of almost cathedral size, {{the centre of}} a huge parish ministered by many curates.

He later moved next door, into a condemned property which became his home for his remaining service in Leeds. In addition to his normal parish duties, Lang acted temporarily as Principal of the Clergy School, was chaplain to Leeds Infirmary, and took <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> men's club of around a hundred members.
