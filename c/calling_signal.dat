50|$|In {{the heat}} of the day, the male D. {{carolina}} take flight and hover, clicking their wings in a courtship display to attract females. Males court females by producing a <b>calling</b> <b>signal</b> by stribulating with hindlegs and wings, the hindlegs are used alternately to rub against the tegmen in a behaviour called alternate stridulation. The male sits horizontally on sunlit bare ground and may continue to stridulate for 5 minutes or more until he is successful in attracting a female. She moves towards the male and when she is close enough he approaches her and mounts. If he is acceptable to the female they copulate and may remain copulated for as long as 16 hours.|$|E

50|$|To reach a {{specific}} station, the caller enters the ALE Address. On many ALE radios {{this is similar}} to dialing a phone number. The ALE controller selects the best available idle channel for that destination address. After confirming the channel is indeed idle, it then sends a brief selective <b>calling</b> <b>signal</b> identifying the intended recipient. When the distant scanning station detects ALE activity, it stops scanning and stays on that channel until it can confirm whether or not the call is for it. The two stations' ALE controllers automatically handshake to confirm that a link of sufficient quality has been established, then notify the operators that the link is up. If the callee fails to respond or the handshaking fails, the originating ALE node usually selects another frequency either at random or by making a guess of varying sophistication.|$|E
50|$|A picture above {{shows an}} STC SLU (Subscribers' Line Unit - {{in those days}} {{customers}} were always called subscribers, invariably shortened in conversation to 'subs'). It handled the traffic to and from five customers, and had five trunks going on to the B switches. There is therefore a 5×5 switching matrix of reed relays, which constituted the A-switch. Note that the four reeds {{in each of these}} reed relay were in-line, whereas in Plessey reed-relays the reeds were in a square formation. The SLU also contained 10 electro-mechanical relays, two for each line. They were the Line Relay (LR), which was operated when the customer picked up the handset and which generated the <b>calling</b> <b>signal,</b> and a K relay which gave the correct tones and prevented spurious calling conditions. These two relays both provided change-over contacts and therefore had to be electro-mechanical, because the reed-relays only gave make-break contacts. The face-plate of the unit is to the right: at the other end one can see the edge connector. It was feared that this type of connector would cause problems after a relatively low number of removal/re-insertion operations, but in practice they proved to be more than adequately robust.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the noise in the mating behavior between individuals of Nezara viridula (L.), by analyzing the temporal and spectral features of the non-pulsed type female calling song emitted by single individuals. We have measured the threshold level for the signal detection, by performing experiments with the <b>calling</b> <b>signal</b> at different intensities and analyzing the insect response by directionality tests performed on a group of male individuals. By using a sub-threshold signal and an acoustic Gaussian noise source, we have investigated the insect response for different levels of noise, finding behavioral activation for suitable noise intensities. In particular, the percentage of insects which react to the sub-threshold signal, shows a non-monotonic behavior, characterized by the presence of a maximum, for increasing levels of the noise intensity. This constructive interplay between external noise and <b>calling</b> <b>signal</b> is the signature of the non-dynamical stochastic resonance phenomenon. Finally, we describe the behavioral activation statistics by a soft threshold model which shows stochastic resonance. We find that the maximum of the ensemble average of the input-output cross-correlation occurs at a value of the noise intensity very close to that for which the behavioral response has a maximum.

40|$|The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is a {{polyphagous}} insect {{that can cause}} severe economic damage on different crops. In Italy this species was first recorded in the region Emilia Romagna in 2012 and in few years it spread {{in most of the}} Northern and part of the Central Italian regions. As well as in other stink bugs the mid-short range mating communication is based on the exchange of vibrational signals (duet) between sexes that is the key of pair formation, courtship and copula. During the duet females are stationary and males actively search on the plant. In other pentatomids the directionality of the searching in males, given by female attractive signals, has been demonstrated. We hypothesize that the same principle works also in BMSB and thus {{it would be possible to}} use the female <b>calling</b> <b>signal</b> to attract males towards precise source sites (i. e. artificial shakers). If confirmed, this would represent a potential implementation to the traps commonly used for BMSB monitoring, by providing an additional stimulus to enlarge the amount of captured bugs. To assess whether the female <b>calling</b> <b>signal</b> could be employed to capture males we performed different bioassays with males stimulated with either natural and synthetic vibrational signals, in different scenarios (i. e., net cages, round arenas, potted plants). Vibrational signals were recorded with laser vibrometer and a video analysis software was used to study the behavioural responses. Our experiments demonstrated the attractive effect of the female signal in all performed tests. On average, more than 50...|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Japanese fireflies {{range from}} nocturnal {{luminescent}} species to diurnal non-luminescent species. Their communication systems are classified into 6 types {{based on the}} following criteria: 1) Female responds to male’s flashes after a fixed delay; 2) Male is directly attracted by female’s light signal, the male perches on a leaf near the female, then the male changes his flashes with twinkling, and copulation behavior is released. However, the female may {{not respond to the}} male; 3) Male seeks female <b>calling</b> <b>signal</b> during the male’s flying and synchronous flashing, then the male approaches the female, emitting flashes with various patterns, displaying walking-luminescing, sedentary signaling, chasing, and copulating; 4) Male is attracted by continuous luminescent signals of the female, and male perches near the female, then the male distin-guishes the female’s light organs shape. Thereafter, the male copulation behavior is released by her sex pheromone; 5) Male and female flight occurs in the daytime; when the male approaches the female, copu-lation is released by the female’s pheromone; weak luminescent signals may be fulfilling the function of supplementary communication signals; 6) Luminescent signals {{have nothing to do with}} communication be-tween male and female, and copulation is released by a sex pheromone...|$|E

40|$|Mating {{behaviour}} of Scaphoideus titanus Ball, {{the vector}} of the grapevine disease Flavescence dore´e, {{was investigated in}} order to determine the role of substrateborne vibrational signals in intra-specific communication and pair formation. Vibrational signals were recorded from grapevine leaves with a laser vibrometer. Signalling activity of single males changed throughout the day and the peak in activity was associated with twilight and early night when ‘call and fly’ behaviour was observed. Pair formation began with the spontaneous emission of male signals. The male <b>calling</b> <b>signal</b> consisted of a single series of pulses, partially accompanied with a ‘rumble’. The male courtship phrase consisted of four consecutive sections characterized by two sound elements, pulse and ‘buzz’. Female vibrational signals were emitted only in response to male signals. The female response was a single pulse that closely resembled male pulses and was inserted between pulses within the male signals. All recorded vibrational signals of S. titanus have a dominant frequency below 900 Hz. A unique feature of vibrational communication in S. titanus is well-developed intrasexual competition; males may use alternative tactics, in the form of disturbance signals, or silently approach duetting females (satellite behaviour). While the male-female duet appears to be essential for successful localization of females and copulation, it is also vulnerable to, and easily disrupted by, alternative tactics like masking...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{communicative}} {{behavior of}} five species and subspecies of Tropisternus Solier (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae) was studied. These aquatic beetles have stress and calling chirps (both sexes), a second male <b>calling</b> <b>signal</b> (one species), a single male courtship sound (usually), a male copulatory sound, {{and a female}} aggressive rejection buzz (three species). Males utilize visual, not acoustical, clues to orient towards females at close range. Males court females with stereotyped movements, sounds, and tactile signals while positioned dorsally on the female. The role of chemical signals in recognition of sexual readiness, sex, or species remains unclear. A mark-release field study of T. ellipticus ruled out aggregation and territorial behavior as possible functions of acoustic signals. This species, at least, wanders freely and has no home range. Acoustic courtship signals were stereotyped, i. e., the same signal was always produced by males in particular positions of courtship, in T. natator and T. columbianus, but variable in T. ellipticus and two subspecies of T. lateralis. Experiments using models of beetles indicated that visual stimuli can release a calling chirp response and an approach in both sexes, or a courtship sound and an approach in males. Results of experiments utilizing broadcasts of tape recorded signals established that Tropisternus can hear water-borne acoustic signals even though auditory receptors are as yet unknown in Coleoptera. Males of T. natator and T. lateralis nimbatus discriminated female calling chirps from other acoustic signals. Female calling chirps stimulated males to emit calling chirps, to cease feeding and begin swimming, and to approach models of beetles (searching behavior). Males of T. ellipticus and T. lateralis limbalis, species from populations in western Oregon, did not respond predictably to acoustic signals. T. natator and T. lateralis nimbatus, which responded to calling chirps, are from populations in southern Michigan, where four species of Tropisternus share breeding sites. In contrast, the three species in western Oregon probably breed in different microhabitats. The lack of mating interference between species in western Oregon may have allowed the loosening of stereotypy in courtship seen in T. ellipticus and the degeneration of the calling function of acoustic signals seen in T. ellipticus and T. lateralis limbalis...|$|E
