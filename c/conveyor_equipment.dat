40|$|The {{onion is}} a major export crop in Argentina and obtaining {{consistent}} quality {{is a matter of}} concern to remain competitive internationally. Grading is generally done according to Mercosur standards but quality assurance programs are necessary at the packinghouse level. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a first approach for characterizing sorting and sizing efficiency. During the 1998 season five onion packinghouses located in the Valle Bonaerense del Río Colorado (Buenos Aires Province, Argentina) were randomly selected. In all of them, variables measured were: sorting table width, bulb transport and rotation speed as well as number of bulbs/sorter/hour. Before and after sorting, samples of 100 bulbs of each size category were randomly taken and closely inspected and their diameters were measured. Sizing efficiency was determined and a Chi-square test was performed to compare observed frequencies of defects with the expected ones within each category. All the studied packinghouses failed to meet the established limits for slight defects and only one of them was able to comply with the standards for basic requirements when preparing Extra class onions. Even when equipment and operational setup were different among packinghouses, the operational flux (bulbs/sorter/hour) was similar for all of them. Differences in sorting performance can be attributed mainly to the sequence of operations and speed of belt <b>conveyors.</b> <b>Equipment</b> and its calibration affected sizing efficiency, with better results obtained with the diverging roller system. The proposed methodology for characterizing efficiency could be considered as a simple and useful tool for monitoring quality at onion packinghouses...|$|R

40|$|Issue: As {{wood waste}} {{material}} travels through a processing facility on conveyors, it can form layers, piles, or clumps. These layers, piles, or clumps often bury or hide embedded contaminants (ferrous metals in particular), reducing {{the effectiveness of}} contaminant removal systems. Failure to remove metal contaminants can cause {{a number of problems}} such as excessive wear, damage to equipment in the processing facility itself, and contamination, creating problems in meeting end-user specifications. If the material is manually sorted either for removal of various types of contaminants or for separation into sub-streams, embedded contaminants and deep piles can also create problems. Best Practice: This best practice recommends the integration of mechanical features into conveyor systems that will improve the exposure of contaminants to specialized removal systems (especially ferrous metals) and to manual sorters. Distribution and exposure of the material flow also helps sorters separate into various sub-streams. TYPES OF MECHANICAL SEPARATION TECHNIQUES Mechanical Waterfalls or Cascades: These types of conveyor designs allow the wood waste material to fall and tumble during exchanges between <b>conveyors</b> and <b>equipment.</b> This dynamic transfer has the effect of redistributing the material on the conveyor and exposing previously hidden contaminants.

30|$|Based on the {{variation}} of tensile force during the start, stop {{and operation of}} belt conveyor, a tension technology and equipment of high accuracy and large tensioning stroke has been developed. It can quickly respond and automatically adjust tension and tensioning stroke with the tension variation of the belt conveyor. During normal operations, the tensile force is 0.9 – 1.1 times of the rated tensile force, during start and stop, the tensile force is 1.3 – 1.4 times of the rated tensile force, and during the shift of <b>conveyor</b> tail, the <b>equipment</b> can quickly respond and guarantee non-skid. The working principle is: based on the conveyor’s start-up and loading, with the feedback of tension sensor signal, the PLC controller and fuel tank can automatically adjust the output of tensile force to avoid slipping between belts and drive pulley, lower the safety factor selected for the belt, and ensure the normal operation of the belt conveyor. Installed with an automatic moved conveyor tail, the automatic tensioning can be achieved when the conveyor tail is automatically moved, thus to a certain extent, the downtime rate of the belt conveyor and the downtime rate of the three face machine can be reduced.|$|R
