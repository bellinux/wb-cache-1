40|$|This study aim at {{providing}} an academic {{point of view}} on the possibilities of applying forward trading to fishery catch commodities in PIH Mina Ayu, Indramayu. This study was done based on secondary data of varieties of fishery commodities on the level of fish auctions in the Indramayu area and on the level of the Central Market in Caringin, Bandung. Gathered data were analyzed using the portofolio mean variance model (Markowitz model) to determine five commodity types with the largest rate of return and the optimal portofolio combination. Using the Winter’s Method time series analysis, forecasting of production, availability and price were conducted on the commodities determined by the previous analysis. The result of the time series analysis becomes the basic information for PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu to produce sales order for the agro-commodity auction in West Java. The five commodities with the highest rate of return were: Eastern little tuna (Euthynus spp), Indo-pacific king mackerell (Scomberomorus guttatus), Black promfet (Formio niger), <b>Common</b> <b>squids</b> (<b>Loligo</b> <b>spp)</b> and Indian mackerell (Restrelliger spp) with an optimal portofolio combination of 99. 4 % return and 25. 7 % risk. Forecasting of production and price suggest that PIH Mina Ayu can feasibly apply the forward trading method due to adequate availability of raw materials, which is needed in a relatively small amount in regards to the capacity of cold storage facility available in PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu. Forecasting of the price of commodities in the Central Market in Caringin Bandung suggest a significant margin of price, which shows a potential profit for PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu. The significant margin was {{due to the fact that}} by applying the forward trading method, PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu can bypass three links in the chain of distribution undergone by the existing spot trading method...|$|R

From April 2001 to March 2003, we monitored a total of 618 landings from the beach-seine (99), the gill nets ("corvineira" - 331, "linguadeira" - 40 and "rede alta" - 25), the hook and line (98), the squid jigging (17), and the spear fishing and trap fisheries (five and three, respectively). The total monitored production was 21866 kg and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) 35. 4 kg. trip- 1. Considering the number of effective fishing days and the average daily production per fishing gear, the annual production was estimated at 136687 kg (0. 2 % of the state's production in 2004). Predominant resources were: Micropogonias furnieri,Trichiurus lepturus, <b>squids</b> (<b>Loligo</b> <b>spp.),</b> clupeiform fishes (Sardinella brasiliensis, Cetengraulis edentulus, Pellona harrowerii and Harengula clupeola), Eucinostomus spp., Cynoscion spp., Menticirrhus spp., Caranx crysos and Selene setapinnis.

40|$|This study compares {{alternative}} empirical {{models for}} forecasting interannual variation in <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> <b>spp.)</b> abundance around Scotland (UK). Annual abundance indices (1970 – 1996) {{were derived from}} fishery data, for stocks in coastal waters (northern North Sea and West Coast) and the Rockall area. Abundance in coastal waters was correlated with several annual environmental indices, including the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index and the average sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) in the northern North Sea. Regression models, relating fishery abundance to annual environmental indices, and time-series models, predicting abundance from the previous year’s abundance, could both provide reasonable fits to observed abundance data. Model fits obtained for coastal waters were generally better than those for the Rockall area. Regression models produced consistently poor forecasts whereas time-series models produced satisfactory forecasts for the years 1997 – 1999. Forecast accuracy for the time-series models could be improved by taking into account environmental variables. Thus, adding effects of SST in May in the northern North Sea in the current and previous years improved a time-series model of squid abundance in coastal waters. Improved forecasts were also achieved by fitting time-series models to monthly abundance data. The apparent influence of May SST in the northern North Sea on the coastal fishery could indicate that SST affects recruitment strength. Results for the offshore Rockall fishery suggest that large-scale and longer-term oceanographic processes may be involved...|$|R
40|$|Mortality {{during the}} egg and larval stages is thought {{to play a major}} role in {{determining}} year-class strength of many marine fish. Predation of eggs and larvae is normally considered to be a major factor but the full suite of predators responsible has rarely been identified. Potential predators on a patch of plaice Pleuronectes platessa eggs located in the eastern Irish Sea were mapped using acoustics and sampled by trawl and a plankton multi-net. Gut contents of 3373 fish, crustacea and cephalopods sampled in the area were screened using a plaice-specific TaqMan DNA probe. Herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus dominated trawl catches and showed high positive TaqMan responses (77 and 75 % of individuals tested respectively). Locations of clupeid schools also broadly corresponded with the distribution of fish eggs in the plankton. Whiting Merlangius merlangus were also reasonably abundant in trawl hauls and 86 % of their stomachs tested positive for plaice DNA. Species showing lower levels of positive TaqMan response included mackerel Scomber scombrus, poor cod Trisopterus minutus, <b>squid</b> <b>Loligo</b> <b>spp.,</b> dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula and weever Trachinus vipera. Non-reactivity of all negative controls precluded the occurrence of cross-contamination, and positive reactions from demersal species, such as dogfish and weever, may have resulted from secondary predation. No benthic macro-crustaceans tested positive. Samples of planktonic organisms yielded 13 % positive TaqMan reactions, mainly from clupeoid or sandeel (Ammodytidae) larvae, but also included some Malacostraca and Amphipoda. Use of the molecular approach allowed rapid screening of a large number of potential predators of plaice eggs, and the results provide a more holistic description of the predator community than has previously been achieved...|$|R
40|$|Studies on fishers’ {{ecological}} knowledge (FEK) {{and local}} ecological knowledge (LEK) have rarely been undertaken for practical application in a management context. Here, we describe a methodology to access FEK {{that was designed}} under an ecosystem-based fisheries management framework. The procedure was adapted from the Delphi technique, which seeks experts’ consensus, and focused on several spatial and temporal {{issues related to the}} small-scale fisheries of the northern coast of São Paulo, Brazil (particularly, in Ubatuba, between 23 ◦ 20 _ S and 23 ◦ 35 _ S). Experienced fishers, considered as experts, were selected during a pilot phase to participate in two sequential rounds of semi-structured interviews at 3 main landing sites and 12 coastal fishing communities. The issues addressed were: (1) spatial and seasonal occurrence of mature females and juveniles of the main commercial species, (2) fishing grounds and bycatch species for each type of fishing gear, and (3) fishers’ suggestions for local fisheries management (e. g. mesh and size of gillnets, closure seasons, gear restrictions by fishing area). It was possible to identify consensus rates on the spatial and temporal issues, as well as on fishers’ management suggestions. The former allowed the construction of maps representing fishing grounds and the local spatial distribution of different fishery stocks strata. We illustrate the output by focusing on five fishery stocks: the seabobshrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri, the whitemouth croaker Micropogonias furnieri, the inshore <b>squid</b> <b>Loligo</b> <b>spp,</b> the white shrimp Litopenaeus schimitti and the blue runner Caranx crysos.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Ciências do Mar, da Terra e do Ambiente (Avaliação e Gestão de Recursos), Faculdade das Ciências do Mar e do Ambiente, Universidade do Algarve, 2013 Fishery-dependent {{data from}} the Portuguese coastal fish trawl fleet were {{integrated}} to examine fleet segmentation and dynamics along a 13 -year period, and estimate speciesdirected effort and abundance. Six landing profiles (LPs) {{were based on the}} relative importance of target and by-catch species, including horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) almost exclusive LPs, three others corresponding to trips targeting <b>squids</b> (<b>Loligo</b> <b>spp.),</b> horse mackerel and octopuses, as the main species. LPs were assigned to trawlers, defining fleet components with specific technical characteristics and fishing strategies. This showed that large vessels target pelagics along the entire coastline, average-powered units fished a diverse catch off the Central zone of the western coast, including horse mackerel and cephalopods and a group of trawlers targeted cephalopods and benthic species off the south coast. Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data, processed by GeoCrust 2. 0, was used to quantify effective fishing effort and define geographic patterns of fishing activity. VMS-based species-specific effort from 2003 was integrated with landings to estimate landings per unit effort (landings per day at sea and landings per hour trawled. Integration of cephalopod size-classes data with VMS information enabled the estimation of size-dependent effort and analysis of geographical patterns of population structure. A group of vessels with landing activity and VMS coverage of trips belonging to distinct LP were selected to constitute a potential sample fleet for estimating speciesdirected LPUE. Their representativeness in terms of effort and LPUE was examined by comparing these results with those obtained for the entire fleet. This reduced fleet was found to be a possible candidate for a sampling programme under the EU Data collection Framework. Overall findings highlight the benefits of combining fisheriesdependent data, to produce information relevant for integrated management, in accordance with the Common Fisheries Policy and Marine Strategy Framework Directive objectives.

Gastrointestinal fluids and blood plasma were collected over a time course from pre-feeding to 216 ·h post feeding. Following food intake, monovalent ions were largely absorbed across the intestinal epithelium, leaving a fluid rich in divalent ions, which have a lower osmotic coefficient and effectively reduce osmotic pressure in the lumen to allow for enhanced fluid absorption. Concentrations of Cl – and HCO 3 – in fluid along the gastrointestinal tract of fish fed both diets, particularly 1 and 2 days post-feeding, demonstrate that apical Cl –/HCO 3 – exchange plays a vital role in postprandial Cl – Summary and water absorption. Postprandial acid–base balance disturbance as indicated by plasma alkalinization was limited or absent, indicating compensation for gastric acid secretion in this teleost fish. Plasma osmolality peaked 12 ·h post-feeding in toadfish fed squid, but was not accompanied by a significant increase in inorganic ion concentrations. Transient fluid secretion by the gastrointestinal tract was evident from reduced luminal Mg 2 + and SO 4 2 – concentrations for 24 – 48 ·h post feeding. Discrepancy between the sum of inorganic osmolytes and measured osmotic pressure was attributed to organic osmolytes, which occurred at high concentrations in the stomach and anterior intestine for up to 24 ·h post feeding...|$|R
