40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} idea of _ethical revaluation_ — taking things we normally see as good for our flourishing and seeing them as neutral or bad, and vice versa — in the Mahāyāna Buddhist thinker Śāntideva. It shows how Śāntideva’s thought on the matter is more coherent than it might otherwise appear, first by examining the consistency of Śāntideva’s own claims and then by applying them to contemporary ethical thought. In so doing, it makes four significant contributions. 	Śāntideva claims that property and relationships are bad for us because they promote attachment, and that others’ wrongdoing is good for us because {{it allows us to}} generate patient endurance. Yet he also urges his readers to give property to others, and to prevent their wrongdoing. Is he <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>contradiction?</b> The dissertation argues that he is not, because giving to others is not intended to benefit them materially, but rather to produce beneficial mental states in them, and preventing wrongdoing is intended to benefit the wrongdoer and not the victim. In both cases, Śāntideva emphasizes individual action {{in a way that makes}} social or political action more difficult to justify. 	The dissertation’s first contribution is to show how this interpretation of Śāntideva contrasts notably with standard presentations of Mahāyāna ethics. Its second contribution is to refute claims that Buddhists have no normative ethics. 	Śāntideva’s resolutions of these apparent contradictions also have relevance for contemporary ethical thought. Martha Nussbaum argues against an ethical revaluation similar to Śāntideva’s, on the grounds that such a revaluation makes it contradictory to argue for providing goods to others, preventing others’ wrongdoing or engaging in political action. Śāntideva’s views show that ethical revaluation is a more sustainable position than these criticisms of Nussbaum’s would imply; if it is to be rejected, it must be rejected on other grounds. To show this point is the dissertation’s third contribution. The fourth contribution is methodological; by finding similarities of concern and differences of opinion between Śāntideva and a contemporary thinker, it helps bridge the gap between normative and comparative religious ethics...|$|E

The argument is made by examining three profound tensions shaping the context which both young people and practitioners inhabit. These tensions are between the, broadly, protectionist agenda of policy development on sexual exploitation and: firstly, socio-cultural changes in respect of consumption, sex and identities; secondly political changes and punitive youth justice system expansionism; and, finally, the closed and moralist rhetoric justifying recent policy changes.

Hudson’s novel Green Mansions. The method in use is Edmund Husserl’s phenomenological method of bracketing that which is transcendent {{to the field of}} study (epoché). It is argued that there is a fundamental tension in the novel between presentation (unmodified acts of consciousness) and representation (modified acts of consciousness). The conclusion drawn from the studied evidence is that Green Mansions favours intimacy over remoteness, immediacy over mediation, presence over rupture, and wholeness over divisiveness. The study shows that the hero is <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a <b>contradiction</b> between a culture based on representivity (a mania for picture-thinking, sign-thinking, and relation-thinking) and an immediacy of life embodied in the heroine as a pure presentation lacking any significant traces of gaps, divisions, or borders. Personified by the heroine, immanence constitutes a silent yet persisting resistance to a world-view based on representivity...|$|R
40|$|JEL {{classification}} numbers: B 12 and H 22) The {{development of}} political economy in Britain {{in the second}} half of the eighteenth and the early nineteenth centuries was characterized by an attempt to escape from Locke's theorem that all taxes would finally fall on the rent of land and his proposal of a single tax on rent. Although Hume and Steuart rejected Locke's theorem and proposal, they failed to create a system of political economy which adequately accounted for capitalistic reproduction. Smith did produce such a system, but his conclusion respecting tax incidence did not differ much from Locke's theorem. Malthus, <b>in</b> turn, was <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the <b>contradiction</b> between the Smithian theory of tax incidence and the Ricardian theory of differential rent. Ricardo, however, established a system of political economy which produced a consistent theory of tax incidence which escaped Locke's theorem: he succeeded in showing that most taxes would ultimately fall on profits, not rent. Yet as a very result of his success, Ricardian political economy prepared a route back to Locke's proposal, that is a single tax on rent. 2 1...|$|R

40|$|I utilize {{narrative}} to analyze both the ontological (theoretical) and epistemological (methodological) {{elements of the}} public discourse surrounding the Dixie Chicks 2 ̆ 7 March 2003 declaration of shame for the President. My goal for this project was to uncover how popular culture contexts provide resources for our individual agency; constructions {{of our ability to}} stand as self-oriented and self-motivated agents. I use, (a) citizen-generated commentary, (b) popular news reports, (c) the Chicks 2 ̆ 7 own responses, and (d) the discourse, such as popular country music songs, which establish the expectations that fans have for their celebrated artists. This allowed me to examine the symbols centering on character, act, and context {{in order to get a}} sense for how the dominant, public narrative puts the pieces of the story together in order to create a vision of the world. The meaning that results from the portrayal of the Chicks 2 ̆ 7 resistance includes: (a) the championing of an aggressive patriot, (b) the connection between a rough, redneck character and Middle-American values, and (c) a 2 ̆ 7 shut up and sing 2 ̆ 7 attitude which diminishes the agency of celebrity-artists. A critical analysis of this narrative reveals: (a) that the above named constructions have consequences upon the shaping of our agency, (b) that popular culture both enables and constrains resistance in various ways, (c) that resistance is <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a <b>contradiction</b> [...] -it has to be popular, yet, it cannot be, and (d) we need to change our theoretical conceptualizations regarding both master and counter narratives and postmodern and modern theory. ...|$|R
40|$|Tracking Europe is a bold {{interdisciplinary}} {{critique of}} claims regarding the {{free movement of}} goods, people, services, and capital throughout Europe. Ginette Verstraete interrogates European discourses on unlimited movement for everyone and a utopian unity-in-diversity in light of contemporary social practices, cultural theories, historical texts, media representations, and critical art projects. Arguing against the persistent myth of borderless travel, Verstraete shows the discourses on Europe to be <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> an irresolvable <b>contradiction</b> on a conceptual level and in deeply unsettling asymmetries on a performative level. She asks why the age-old notion of Europe as a borderless space of mobility goes hand-in-hand with the at times violent containment and displacement of people. In demystifying {{the old and new}} Europe across a multiplicity of texts, images, media, and cultural practices in various times and locations, Verstraete lays bare a territorial persistence in the European imaginary, one which has been differently tied up with the politics of inclusion and exclusion. Tracking Europe moves from policy papers, cultural tourism, and migration to philosophies of cosmopolitanism, nineteenth-century travel guides, electronic surveillance at the border, virtual pilgrimages to Spain, and artistic interventions in the Balkan region. It is a sustained attempt to situate current developments in Europe within a complex matrix of tourism, migration, and border control, as well as history, poststructuralist theory, and critical media and art projects...|$|R

A second axis questione the finding of a contradiction between the logic of innovation that would imply empowerment of actors vis-à-vis inherited constraints from school tradition and also an institutional logic that seems to devote school to homeostasis. I 3 M The laboratory has a real experience of research on these issues, which will allow us an empirical and methodological anchor in three areas of observation: • A research involved two years (CM 1 -CM 2) {{on the use of}} ICT to enhance the communicational side of education (school journalism, production of an animated film). One of the authors was previously a school teacher and has personally experienced through this research the singular position of the user-innovator <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the <b>contradictions</b> of the educational system. • An action research of one year around the introduction of digital tablets to college (4 th) and high school (1 st), which allowed us a double displacement (distancing researchers and change of education) to the observation of the same issues, through various uses and actors. • A national research program underway (2014 - 2016), supported by a consortium of publishers, researchers and institutional partners on the design and use of innovative educational content for multi-media digital platform for the primary and the secondary. The last stage of a double movement, from the micro to the macro and involvement in detached observation, this third field will complement our observation broadening the focus and incorporating a third logical, Editorial, between innovation and tradition school.

After surveying South African church historiography and concluding that synchronic political economic history is seldom integrated into the Church story, it is argued that critical social theory should inform church historiography. An historical material framework is adopted and the relationship of theory and practice established [...] . PART TWO, the bulk of the study, analyses the churches in context. To set the scene, the missionary period of the nineteenth century is discussed in relation to Victorian expansionism, concluding that, whatever their value, the missions were closely tied in to imperial interests and the penetration of capital, fundamentally altering the indigenous societies. This leads to a brief consideration of race and class in the South African political economy. A class definition is adopted that allows for fractions within the dominant capital-labour dichotomy. Finally, an overview of the first stage of industrialisation follows in respect of primitive accumulation, gold mining, farming, alcohol and domestic workers. With that background to the 1903 - 1930 period clear, extensive archival material is used to describe and analyse the churches in relation to their political economic context. The focus is the Church in industrialisation, including the shaping of its practice, polity and theology by the conflicts and interests of foreign and national capital [...] . PART THREE returns to the earlier theoretical framework in order to found a theory of religion and theology. David Tracy's notions of the limits-to human agency and the limits-of experience locate the religious phenomenon in relation to empirical-analytic and historical-hermeneutic sciences. Questions of meaning, meaningfulness and truth are introduced. Utilising Theodore Jennings, William Lynch and Paul Ricoeur, the structure of analogical imagination is explored and applied to Bernard Lonergan's investigation of insight, to be finally related to religion as a way-of-being-in- the-world. Lastly, the culminating chapter pursues ecclesiological directions, within a historical material framework, applicable to a Church <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> social <b>contradictions</b> but anticipating an emancipated world, and concludes with a definition of the Church-at-the-limits...|$|R
40|$|In this project, I {{build on}} {{existing}} {{research in the}} critical intersection of media, sport, gaming and race to explore how fantasy football, an entertainment byproduct of the National Football League (NFL), rearticulates and recontexualizes the colonial ideology already prolific in the NFL and other products of American media culture. I investigate how fantasy football may represent an innocuous, yet exigent place to study the commodification and consumption of bodies in our contemporary media landscape {{because of the way}} that the increasingly popular game operates in a capitalistic logic, where NFL players are almost exclusively valued for their statistical production and fantasy football participants are positioned as 2 ̆ 2 owners 2 ̆ 2 of these players. Within this assumption, I analyze three specific colonial rhetorics of fantasy football: the language used to talk about NFL players in fantasy football discourse, the procedures of playing fantasy football and the numerical representation of NFL players within the game that serve as the main conduit for visual interactivity. Through a postcolonial lens, I argue that these various rhetorics in fantasy football serve to otherize, commodify, and ultimately dehumanize NFL players, while also inviting fantasy 2 ̆ 2 owners 2 ̆ 2 to attempt to control these bodies. However, because those who play fantasy football have no real access to the operations of the NFL or its players, I suggest that fantasy football participants become situated in an ideological illusion of control, <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the <b>contradiction</b> between the game 2 ̆ 7 s colonial rhetorics and their own level of agency. Furthermore, I explore how these colonial rhetorics impact how we come to see, know and interact with race and rhetorically reshape black and white relations within the United States. In the end, I draw conclusions about the way colonial ideology functions and is rearticulated through fantasy football, as well as offer limitations of my own project and suggestions for future research...|$|R
