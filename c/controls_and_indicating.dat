We estimate local suppliers’ productivity response to multinational entry in downstream industries. We find that firms with stronger production capabilities benefit less than others. In contrast, firms with greater absorptive capacity benefit more. These results are largely robust to the inclusion of firm fixed effects, industry-year and region-year fixed effects, <b>and</b> other <b>controls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicate</b> the importance of firm capabilities in moderating the effect of downstream FDI on productivity. Finally, we also find some evidence, though less robust, that firms with greater complementary capabilities (proxied by firm size) also benefit more from downstream FDI. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the human brain is intrinsically organised into dynamic, anti-correlated functional networks. This paper presents a study on the so-called default mode network - which is active when the brain is apparently at rest - and on brain activity related to a given task. This work involves the analysis of low frequency magnetoencephalographic recordings of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) <b>and</b> <b>controls</b> performing both attentional as well as perceptual tasks. Single channel independent component analysis is used to isolate low frequency brain signals within the data in the presence of higher frequency brain activity and artifacts. Phase synchrony analysis is then carried out between the components of channels of interest to quantify any interaction between distant brain regions within the default-mode network. Preliminary results show variations in the phase locking between ADHD <b>and</b> <b>controls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicate</b> a corresponding change in phase synchrony between the corresponding brain regions at periods of rest and when tasks are being performed...|$|R

40|$|FUS is an RNA-binding protein {{associated}} with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS). Previous reports have demonstrated intrinsic roles of FUS in synaptic function. However, the mechanism underlying FUS’s regulation of synaptic morphology has remained unclear. We found that reduced mature spines after FUS depletion were {{associated with}} the internalization of PSD- 95 within the dendritic shaft. Mass spectrometry of PSD- 95 -interacting proteins identified SynGAP, whose expression decreased after FUS depletion. Moreover, FUS and the ELAV-like proteins ELAVL 4 <b>and</b> ELAVL 1 <b>control</b> SynGAP mRNA stability in a 3 ′UTR length-dependent manner, resulting in the stable expression of the alternatively spliced SynGAP isoform α 2. Finally, abnormal spine maturation and FTLD-like behavioral deficits in FUS-knockout mice were ameliorated by SynGAP α 2. Our findings establish an important link between FUS and ELAVL proteins for mRNA stability <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicate</b> that this mechanism is crucial for the maintenance of synaptic morphology and cognitive function...|$|R

A discriminant analysis was then made on two variables: health locus of control for the depressive patient, and the adaptability and cohesion factors for the existing couple, the original family and the nuclear family. This analysis provided a psychological profile of the suicidal patient and his family based on the individual's health locus of <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> certain psychological <b>and</b> familial predisposing factors.

The introduction and establishment {{of a new and}} markedly different environment within a long established natural system provides an excellent opportunity to study the principles of adaptation and colonisation by native species. In Australia, an example is furnished by the conversion of large areas of native eucalypt forests to mono-cultured plantations of Monterey Pine (Pinus radiata). The principal aim {{of this study was to}} assess which species of native mammals, birds and higher plants are able to utilise or occupy such plantations. Successional aspects of community structure, and colonisation in pine forest systems, were investigated by considering stands of different ages. A variety of adjacent native eucalypt forests provided <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> the range of potential colonisers. Various habitats in both forest types were studied with regard to potential nest sites and availability of food, in order to determine those habitats most favourable for mammals and birds. The effect, on wildlife, of clearing eucalypt forests, but leaving forest remnants along gullies, was also assessed. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Shoot {{branching}} {{is regulated}} by the complex interactions among hormones, development, and environmental factors. Recent studies into the regulatory mecha-nisms of shoot branching have focused on strigolactones, which is a new area of investigation in shoot branching regulation. Elucidation of {{the function of the}} D 53 gene has allowed exploration of detailed mechanisms of action of strigolactones in regulating shoot branching. In addition, the recent discovery that sucrose is key for axillary bud release has challenged the established auxin theory, in which auxin is the principal agent in the control of apical dominance. These developments increase our understan-ding of branching <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicate</b> that regulation of shoot branching involves a complex network. Here, we first summarize advances in the systematic regulatory network of plant shoot branching based on current information. Then we describe recent developments in the synthesis and signal transduction of strigolactones. Based on these considerations, we further summarize the plant shoot branching regulatory network, including long distance systemic signals and local gene activity mediated by strigolactones following perception of external envi-ronmental signals, such as shading, in order to provide a comprehensive overview of plant shoot branching...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 31 - 33) Since {{the concept}} of locus of control was proposed by Rotter in 1954, other theorists have sought to expand upon his initial bipolar concept. Levenson (1972) proposed that locus of control is not two dimensional or bipolar but that externality can be further subdivided to account for perceived control by powerful others and the attribution of chance or fate as a causal factor. Factor analyses consistently reveal at least 3 dimensions of locus of <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicate</b> that Rotter???s scale is too simplistic to account for intersubject variations in measures of adjustment. Previous studies also reveal a correlation between externality and well-being. The present study utilized Levenson???s three factor locus of control scale {{in an effort to}} replicate and clarify the relationship of locus of control to indices of adjustment and self-esteem. Additionally, the introduction of instructional manipulation was designed {{to address the issue of}} instructional effects, singly and in combination with the factor of sex. Results support the replicability and stability of the relationships between locus of <b>control,</b> well-being, <b>and</b> self-esteem.

Variation in Staph. aureus- induced, PHA-induced, <b>and</b> <b>control</b> proliferation [peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and media only] was observed at d 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10 of in vitro culture.
