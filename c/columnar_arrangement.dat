We measure submillimeter functional responses to sound frequency sweeps at high magnetic fields (7 tesla) and show that frequency preference is stable through cortical depth in primary auditory cortex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that-in this highly columnar cortex-task demands sharpen the frequency tuning in superficial cortical layers more than in middle or deep layers.

Adapting such a bottom-up view provides a potential route to the fabrication of novel materials. However, this approach suffers from the lack of a sufficiently detailed understanding of the noncovalent forces that hold the self-assembled structures together. Here we demonstrate that nature can indeed guide us, as we explore routes to helicity with achiral building blocks driven by the interplay between two competing length scales for the interactions, as in DNA. By characterizing global minima for clusters, we illustrate several realizations of helical architecture, the simplest one involving ellipsoids of revolution as building blocks. In particular, we show that axially symmetric soft discoids can self-assemble into helical <b>columnar</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Understanding the molecular origin of such spatial organisation has important implications for the rational design of materials with useful optoelectronic applications...|$|R

Two approaches were applied to direct the assembly of aromatic materials. The first one involved the use of coordination bonds between aromatic nitriles and silver(I) triflate. Several acridine-based ligands were synthesized and crystallized, alone and complexed to silver(I) triflate. Generally, ligands that possessed three peripheral coordination sites formed sheet-like crystal structures. Ligands with only one coordination site crystallized into <b>columnar</b> <b>arrangements</b> with significant edge-to-face interactions. The second approach studied the effect of mutually phobic side-chains on the properties of dyads - molecules comprised of linked electron-rich and electron-poor aromatic moieties. It was shown that, despite attractive electrostatic forces between electron-rich and electron-poor aromatic species, aliphatic hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon side-chains form segregated domains in single crystals.

Although it has been well established that like-charged macromolecules can aggregate {{under the influence of}} oppositely charged condensing agents, the specific conditions for the stability of such aggregates can only be determined empirically. We examine these conditions, which involve an interplay of electrostatic and osmotic effects, by using a well defined model system composed of F-actin, an anionic rod-like polyelectrolyte, and lysozyme, a cationic globular protein with a charge that can be genetically modified. The structure and stability of actin–lysozyme complexes for different lysozyme charge mutants and salt concentrations are examined by using synchrotron x-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations.

40|$|Self-assembly {{is one of}} {{the most}} useful techniques, which provide a facile {{strategy}} to construct structure-defined functional materials, such as ion-selective membranes. Highly selective membranes can eventually form a basis to replace some energy- or labor-intensive purificatiion processes and can also simplify specific detection problems in the fields of biochemical, medical and even environmental analytical technology. In this dissertation, a series of wedge-shaped sulfonic acid derivatives differing in substitution pattern and molecular symmetry as well as in the size of the cationic count-ions, were synthesized and characterized to give a better understanding of the self-assembly process. From the dependence of transition temperatures and enthalpies on the cation diameter, it is conclusive that the occurrence of mesophases of these compounds is more ruled by the geometric shape of the mesogen than by the ionic interactions between cation and sulfonate anion. For example, the symmetrical substituted alkali metal cationic sulfonates all exhibit columnar mesophases either on melting from the crystalline phase or on annealing at the proper temperature. The target molecule with polymerizable groups was also found to exhibit a hexagonal columnar mesophase between 115 °C and 233 °C, as well as in semi-polar methacrylate solvents as the concentration exceeded 70 wt%. Photo-curing this hexagonal columnar mesophase results in a cross-linked polymer film covalently embedded with the cylinders network. The membranes with abundant sulfonate channels were obtained by photo-initiated polymerization in the state of lyotropic columnar mesophases without losing the ordered <b>columnar</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The ion-transport measurements showed their ability to transport small alkalic cations through the channels. The ion transport rates exhibited a decreasing tendency in the sequence of Lithium > Sodium > Potassium cation. Since in a free solution Lithium cation diffuses slower than sodium cation that diffuses slower than potassium cation, this opposite result is indicative of the transport through the supramolecular channels. It is confirmed that the diffusion became controlled by cation-sulfonate interactions during the transport through the supramolecular channels. In the last part of the dissertation, the sulfonated functional membranes with orientated columnar channels were achieved and used as a model system to investigate the mechanism of cation transport through the supramolecular sulfonated channels. Due to the possession of the geometrically defined superstructure, the presented strategy of constructing the channel-like functional membrane gives the potential to modify or tune the performance of the membranes for further application...|$|R

MethodsEPC obtained by purifying {{a small amount of}} peripheral blood from rabbits were seeded into a highly porous, biocompatible PLGA scaffold, namely, EPC-PLGA, and implanted into the osteochondral defect in the medial femoral condyle. Twenty two rabbits were randomized into one of three groups: the empty defect group (ED), the PLGA-only group or the EPC-PLGA group. The defect sites were evaluated 4 and 12 weeks after implantation. ResultsAt the end of testing, only the EPC-PLGA group showed the development of new cartilage tissue with a smooth, transparent and integrated articular surface. Moreover, histological analysis showed obvious differences in cartilage regeneration. At week 4, the EPC-PLGA group showed considerably higher TGF-β 2 and TGF-β 3 expression, a greater amount of synthesized glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, and a higher degree of osteochondral angiogenesis in repaired tissues. At week 12, the EPC-PLGA group showed enhanced hyaline cartilage regeneration with a normal <b>columnar</b> chondrocyte <b>arrangement,</b> higher SOX 9 expression, and greater GAG and collagen type II (COLII) content.

Many {{functional}} materials {{rely on a}} well-organized {{internal structure}} for their output properties, and this makes them suitable {{for a variety of}} applications. Indeed, the control of the macroscopic molecular arrangement is essential for certain properties to manifest or to be enhanced. Our group has reported several examples of materials consisting of molecular building blocks encoded with functionality as well as with possibilities of self-organization. The final end is to create functional materials with well-defined molecular architectures that enable structural- and order-dependent properties. A particular approach is to exploit mesogenic driving forces to generate functional architectures by the self-organization of molecules into columnar mesophases. Furthermore, these mesophases are often based on molecules that can self-aggregate in solvents to afford functional gel materials with defined <b>columnar</b> molecular <b>arrangements</b> along their fibers. The work herein discussed will cover two types of functional columnar assemblies: i) Chiroptical supramolecular switches consisting on H-bonded complexes derived from melamine and carboxylic acids that self-organize into well-defined columnar mesophases, the supramolecular chirality of which can be tuned in a reversible manner by illumination with circularly polarized light. ii) Luminescent materials based on mesogenic molecules derived from a rigid π-conjugated core, 1, 6 -diphenyl- 3 -hexen- 1, 5 -diyne.
