5|$|The {{animals were}} {{restored}} between 1975 and 1977 by Bill and Caroline Von Stein of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Von Steins were experienced with {{other types of}} museum conservation work, but had never restored carousel animals. Because of the animals' poor <b>condition,</b> <b>no</b> attempt was made to restore them to their original paintwork; instead, the restorers were allowed to use their judgment on color choices and other decorations. The museum's only requirements were that they use reasonably natural decorative schemes and no high-gloss paint.|$|E
5|$|Following the report, the NRM {{commissioned}} First Class Partnerships (FCP) to independently {{review the}} remaining work identified as necessary by the NRM, and make recommendations {{on how to}} proceed. In March 2013, the museum announced FCP had determined the locomotive would {{not return to the}} main line until 2015, and believed the outstanding work should be put out to external tender. On 29 October 2013 the museum announced Riley & Son in Bury as the winning contractor, and the same day the locomotive was moved to their workshop in order to return it to running <b>condition</b> <b>no</b> earlier than summer 2015.

25|$|As an {{implication}} of undrained <b>condition,</b> <b>no</b> elastic volumetric strains occur, and thus Poisson's ratio {{is assumed to}} remain 0.5 throughout shearing. The Tresca soil model also assumes no plastic volumetric strains occur. This is of significance in more advanced analyses such as in finite element analysis. In these advanced analysis methods, soil models other than Tresca {{may be used to}} model the undrained condition including Mohr-Coulomb and critical state soil models such as the modified Cam-clay model, provided Poisson's ratio is maintained at 0.5.|$|E

25|$|Ben Land snr., private trainer to Lord Poulett at Droxford, {{had decided}} to retire in 1870, and Chris Green was persuaded {{to take his place}} in Hampshire in September 1870 where he took charge of such horses as Benazet, Cortolvin and The Lamb. He was given the task of {{preparing}} The Lamb, a little iron grey Irish horse, for a second Grand National win and during the winter 'Lord Poulett and his party were exceedingly sanguine of success, and his Lordship caused a private circular to be distributed among his friends telling them to back The Lamb to win'. For the race itself, The Lamb, unseen in public for exactly two years, was paraded by Ben Land jun. and 'was greeted with a buzz of admiration, aroused by his beautiful appearance and <b>condition...</b> <b>No</b> horse in the world could have looked better than The Lamb did'. This testament to Green's work continued in the race as The Lamb kept ahead of the pursuing horses to finally win by a couple of lengths in 'a desperately exciting finish'.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the element}} of surprise, the policemen {{did not have the}} chance to defend {{themselves}} from the aggression. The policemen that got out of the vehicles were shot by the CJNG. Those who stayed inside them died of calcination. In total, 15 police officers were killed in the ambush. 5 more were wounded and transported by helicopter to a wounded-care zone in Puerto Vallarta before being transferred to several hospitals across the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area. Authorities reported them as being in stable <b>condition.</b> <b>No</b> casualties on the CJNG's side were confirmed because the gunmen were able to escape. The police called for reinforcements in Guadalajara. Several police units drove to the area, and a helicopter made it to the scene to provide air support. The Mexican Navy and the Mexican Federal Police (PF) then carried out a search of the surrounding areas to locate the CJNG gunmen. Investigators discovered that the assailants built an encampment in the mountains and waited for the police for as long as 48 hours.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, {{males with}} 5α-reductase type II {{deficiency}} exhibit signs of continued undervirilization {{in a number}} of domains. Facial hair was absent or sparse in a relatively large group of Dominican males with the condition. However, more facial hair has been observed in patients with the disorder {{from other parts of the}} world, although facial hair was still reduced relative to that of other men in the same communities. The divergent findings may reflect racial differences in androgen-dependent hair growth. A female pattern of androgenic hair growth, with terminal hair largely restricted to the axillae and lower pubic triangle, is observed in males with the <b>condition.</b> <b>No</b> temporal recession of the hairline or androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss or baldness) has been observed in any of the cases of 5α-reductase type II deficiency that have been reported, whereas this is normally seen to some degree in almost all Caucasian males. Individuals with 5α-reductase type II deficiency were initially reported to have no incidence of acne, but subsequent research indicated normal sebum secretion and acne incidence.|$|E
500|$|Like [...] "The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor", [...] "Breaking Quarantine" [...] {{deals with}} the Flood {{outbreak}} that occurs during Halo.

Johnson is a minor personality in Halo: Combat Evolved who becomes an important character in the following two games; while the novel [...] explains that Johnson resists Flood infestation due to a medical <b>condition,</b> <b>no</b> other story {{up to that point}} explained how Johnson escapes. [...] "Breaking Quarantine" [...] is an example of Bungie's attempts to expand the story arcs of secondary characters that would have no opportunity to go explained in the main storyline.
