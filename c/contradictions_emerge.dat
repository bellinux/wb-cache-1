The authors refer {{to the development of}} journalistic practices, which is projected in the quality of political coverage. However, later the authors continue to illustrate how many <b>contradictions</b> <b>emerge</b> in the nature and the importance of context in professionalization of journalism within the liberal systems. [...] Thomas E. Patterson believes Hallin and Mancini’s discussion of the impact of journalism, and the influence the craft has on political influence is correct and unchallenged in the scholarly literature. Patterson explains that a tight clutch by the media to the state, as well as political institutions, creates professionalism. Patterson elaborates how a liberal culture will create an environment of journalistic autonomy, which in turn creates professionalism. [...] Katrin Voltmer agrees that professionalization prevents dependency from outside perspective and influence to impose certain rules or norms on journalists. However, Voltmer also explains the difficulties within the classifications of professional journalistic performance. Voltmer enlightens the challenge of trying {{to bridge the gap between}} theory and practice of professionalization. Which Voltmer later elaborates how new and old norms, as well as new standards, of journalistic quality are finding it difficult to co-exist in finding their roles in the new democratic order.|$|E
50|$|Mao {{finds the}} best way to talk about the {{relativity}} of contradiction is to look at it in several different parts. “The contradiction in each form of motion of matter has its particularity.” This contradiction is the essence of a thing. When one can identify the particular essence, one can understand the object. These particular contradictions also differentiate one object from another. Knowledge is developed from cognition that can move from general to particular or particular to general. When old processes change, new processes and <b>contradictions</b> <b>emerge.</b> Each contradiction has its own way of being solved, and the resolution must be found accordingly to the particular contradiction. Particular contradictions also have particular aspects that have specific ways of being handled. Mao believes that one must look at things objectively when reviewing a conflict. When one is biased and subjective, he or she cannot fully understand the contradictions and aspects of an object. This is the way people should go about “studying the particularity of any kind of contradiction - the contradiction in each form of motion of matter, the contradiction in each of its processes of development, the two aspects of that contradiction in each process, the contradiction at each stage of a process, and the two aspects of the contradiction at each stage.” Universality and particularity of a contradiction can be viewed as general and individual character of a contradiction. These two concepts depend on each other for existence. Mao says the idea of these two characters is necessary in understanding dialectics.|$|E

However, various discursive <b>contradictions</b> can <b>emerge,</b> potentially limiting or facilitating tourism development. This paper has two objectives. First, it aims to identify discursive contradictions embedded in the positioning statements of regional tourism marketing strategy documents. Second, it intends to highlight how such contradictions simultaneously prioritize and destabilize certain destination identities. Employing the case of the Dutch province of Fryslân, discourse analysis of tourism marketing documents was conducted. Findings revealed <b>contradictions</b> <b>emerging</b> along five themes: place branding, identity claims, target groups, roles and collaboration. Regional Frisian tourism marketing appears to prioritize external orientations and homogenizing identities, with limited consideration of geographically proximate markets and a selective perception of internal stakeholders' roles in tourism. Possible implications of such destination positioning are discussed and suggestions are made to balance various positioning orientations in regional place branding...|$|R

Once subsumption occurs, <b>contradictions</b> <b>emerge,</b> which must be negated through real subsumption: bounding and spatial integration. These socio-spatial dialectics are class- and ethnic-specific; thus, space subsumption is inevitably the contested terrain among different classes and ethnic groups. This article examines several spatial contradictions: the relation between the more institutionalized Wirkungsraum and the more anarchical Aktionsraum; networks with the inherent paradox to create spatial unevenness and struggles over “stray space,” class, or ethnically specific modes of territorial integration in the central-place system; and scale jumping. All these manifest the struggle between les representation de l’espace and les espaces de representation (Lefebvre [1974] 1991).

40|$|Purpose – Previous work on paradox and contradiction {{has argued}} for {{management}} approaches that transcend dilemmas through {{a kind of}} creative synthesis. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate empirically how change leaders’ efforts to transcend <b>contradictions</b> <b>emerge,</b> evolve and contribute to organizational change. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyses three case studies in different sectors drawing on interviews, documents and observations. Findings – It is found that discourses of transcendence emerge as leaders bring new elements to the debate and supply a rationale that creatively bridges opposite poles of a dilemma. The credibility of the discourse is enhanced when it is embedded in extant institutional ideas, when stakeholders’ interests and values appear to be accommodated and when leaders are viewed as legitimate. However, inherent contradictions tend to resurface over time, suggesting that while transcendence offers a powerful stimulus for change, its range and lifetime may be transitory. Three mechanisms associated with the acceptance of transcendent ideas (quasi-resolution of conflict, strategic ambiguity and groupthink) may sow the seeds of their eventual re-evaluation and dissolution. Originality/value – By examining the antecedents and consequences of transcendent discourses over time, the paper provides a nuanced view of their potential and limitations...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to inform a shift from the idea that we need to have “better leaders” towards a better {{appreciation}} of emotions and power relations that make leadership possible and impossible in practice. The article makes two inter-connected contributions to knowledge. First, “violent innocence” is introduced as a construct that is helpful in understanding inter-personal and organizational processes of projection and denial connected to leadership. Second, the construct is used to comprehend a “structure of innocence” in organizations arising from symbolic violence and connected to destructive relations of power that are accepted as normal. Three illustrations of violent innocence are discussed and linked with contradictions that are integral to leadership in practice. These <b>contradictions</b> <b>emerge</b> from particular dynamics: that leadership is often undertaken in a hostile environment covered up with positivity; that it is informed by strategies that create relations of dependence and domination; that it is inseparable from the exercise and experience of power; and that it is bound up with projective dynamics that connect the “unwanted self” of the leader with systemic processes of destruction.

40|$|In {{the quest}} for {{sustainable}} development, numerous examples of ‘best practice’ have been created and circulated in national and international arenas. Yet despite the vast array of examples, demonstration projects, case studies, and the like, {{little is known about}} the ways in which best practices are produced and used, and their role in processes of policymaking. Focusing on best practice for urban sustainability, the author argues that, rather than conceptualising its role and impact in terms of policy transfer or lesson drawing, the creation, dissemination, and use of best practice can be better understood as a discursive process, in which not only is new knowledge created about a policy problem, but the nature and interpretation of the policy problem itself are challenged and reframed. Drawing on insights from concepts of governmentality, the author argues that best practices are at once a political rationality and a governmental technology through which the policy problem of urban sustainability is framed and defined. Illustrations of the practice of best practice show how <b>contradictions</b> <b>emerge</b> between claims for general applicability and the need for policy actors to understand the contingencies of the process of urban sustainability, in order to enrol it for their own struggles over sustainability. The local stickiness of best practices points to the very real struggles that the rationalities of urban sustainability have in competing with other governmentalities which seek to shape urban futures. ...|$|E

Eighty nine percent currently obtain leaflets from health promotion units, with the exception of health visitors, professionals are largely satisfied with the units' service. Seventy six percent use commercial or sponsored leaflets primarily because of the large numbers and topics that are available. The numbers and type of leaflets used were found to vary across the professions. All professionals see an increasingly important role for leaflets in their work. A number of them, pharmacists and occupational health workers in particular, saw the numbers they use rising. These views were accompanied by lower levels of belief in a leaflets ability to increase knowledge and behaviour as well as lower levels of satisfaction with current leaflet use and a concern over the public's reception of leaflets. Methods of leaflet distribution to the public largely reflect the professionals' work contexts. Most popular were handing out leaflets with advice, leaving them in a public place and using them as a back-up to a meeting. A number of <b>contradictions</b> <b>emerge</b> between distribution practices and perceived effectiveness.

40|$|Abstract {{for this}} short paper given at ALT-C 2012 : University of the Arts London {{recently}} {{decided to change}} the core component of its VLE from Blackboard to Moodle. For {{the last five years}} the university has invested significant resources into mainstreaming Blackboard as an institutional learning and teaching environment and the majority of the evidence from the last three years demonstrates that Blackboard is increasingly embedded in the expectations and practice of staff and students throughout the university. Therefore a critical question emerges: why, despite the obvious growth and institutionalisation of the tool, is there currently such a significant drive and appetite for change? This paper outlines the enquiry process and evidence discovered to support the drive for change that started with an extensive consultation with staff and students from across the university. This consultation process utilised questionnaires and focus groups which consistently revealed, especially among staff, a desire for change. This is despite the successful attempts, in accordance with the diffusion of innovation theory as proposed by Rogers, to systematically improve the relative advantage, compatibility, trailability and observability of the system {{while at the same time}} reducing the complexity, yet we find ourselves on the cusp of change. Utilising activity theory as an analytic framework a series of <b>contradictions</b> <b>emerge</b> that can be used to explain the desire for change. We conclude that the process of customising and mainstreaming an innovation for an environment can lead to unintended and unexpected consequences that are not immediately visible in the types of standard system metrics used to demonstrate system mainstreaming. In effect, the drive for change appears less to do, at least in our context, with system functionality or product and more related to the changing nature and expectation of technology tools used to support learning and teaching. What appears most significant is to implement technology enhanced learning in ways that allow flexibility and innovation to flourish in conjunction with the bureaucracy of mainstreaming...|$|E
40|$|Modern agency law—the consensual {{agreement}} {{of one person}} to work for and {{under the control of}} another—has been widely used to provide a general framework for understanding a great deal of business law. Agency law concepts can be used to frame pedagogical, scholarly, institutional, and even political discourses. In so doing, modern agency law addresses concerns about the institution of the corporation, generally by reference to contract: institutions are created out of essentially consensual, and hence justifiable, relationships among autonomous individuals. So modern agency law is more than a “theory” of the firm in the narrow sense of theory; modern agency law provides a liberal myth or ideology for business associations. As discussed below, the effort to establish the firm on the bedrock of modern agency law is serviceable for many social purposes, notably classroom teaching, but falls short in at least two ways. First, key corporate relations can be translated into agency law only by squinting in dim light. Second, agency law cannot really be understood solely in terms of consent. The problems with status and hierarchy found in the corporation are replicated in agency law, which used to be discussed more candidly in terms of master and servant. So while modern agency law provides a handy language for articulating much of corporate life, it does not allay the anxieties with which we seek a theory of the firm. Our theory is shallow. A less than gentle reader might ask: But so what? Why should modern agency law, of all things, be taken so seriously? Much of what follows in the remainder of this Essay is familiar, at least to law professors. Doctrinal structures are subjected to logical pressure that they cannot bear; <b>contradictions</b> <b>emerge,</b> and the author declares victory. But this is only a “victory” for thought under the strange assumption that agency law—or corporation law—is or should be highly intellectually consistent. While perhaps convenient for job talks, the idea that law is consistent has not been serious since Aeschylus. The structure of law is tragic; the law’s commitments are conflicted. Why, then, dwell on these relatively trivial difficulties with modern agency law’s apology for the firm? Why engage in extenuated doctrinal logic and close reading of old cases to debunk modern agency law? The vocabulary and grammar of agency law works well enough for teaching, policy discourse, and a rough and ready understanding of corporate law. Why be impolite...|$|E

Other developing {{countries in}} Asia that have not yet graduated to LMIC status such as Cambodia and Bangladesh are also growing well, the former in particular. While the performance of the region vis-a-vis the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has varied considerably depending on the goal and the country, the region is nevertheless on track to meet most of the goals related to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger.
