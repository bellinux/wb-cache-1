40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of cementation on the mechanical properties of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil,</b> a series of isotropic consolidation and undrained triaxial compression shear tests were performed for cement-treated specimens of Ariake clay, Akita sand, Rokko Masado and Toyoura sand. This paper evaluates factors affecting the shear strength of these cement-treated soils. The following conclusions are obtained: 1) <b>Cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> has a normally consolidated line in e-ln p 2 ̆ 7 space which depends on the mixing cement content. The consolidation yield stress, p 2 ̆ 7 _y, of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> increases with increasing cement content and initial specimen density. 2) Changes in cohesive strength due to cement-treatment can be represented by a tensile effective stress, p 2 ̆ 7 _r. Strength properties can then be normalized by the augmented consolidation stress, (p 2 ̆ 7 _c+p 2 ̆ 7 _r). 3) The shear strength properties of quasi-overconsolidated clay can be represented by the yield stress ratio, R=(p 2 ̆ 7 _y+p 2 ̆ 7 _r) /(p 2 ̆ 7 _c+p 2 ̆ 7 _r). 4) The undrained shear strength of cement-treated soils can be represented as a power law relation of the yield stress ratio, R, and the augmented consolidation stress...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{compression}} behavior of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> with various cement contents and zinc concentrations is presented and modeled by the destructuring framework {{and the concept}} of the Intrinsic Compression Line (ICL). The void ratio of a cement-treated sample with Zn contamination is the sum of the void ratio sustained by the intrinsic soil fabric (destructured void ratio) and the additional void ratio due to cementation. The compression index at the pre-yield state, Cs, increases as the Zn concentration increases or as the cement content decreases. At the post-yield state, the additional void ratio is inversely proportional to the effective vertical stress. The rate of reduction in the additional void ratio is controlled by the destructuring index, b. The values for b and yield stress are mainly dependent upon the degree of cementation, which is controlled by the cement content and the Zn concentration. Based on a critical analysis of the test data, a practical (simple and rational) method for assessing the compressibility of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> with various Zn concentrations is suggested. The proposed predictive method is useful not only for quickly determining compression curves, with acceptable errors, but also for examining the results of tests on cement-treated zinc-contaminated soil...|$|E
40|$|In Yamaguchi prefecture, {{recently}} weathered soils of Sangun {{metamorphic rock}} {{have been used}} as an earthwork material in cases of reclamation and back-fill. Physical properties, compaction and CBR tests were performed on 14 these weathered soils. From the test results, it was shown that these soils could not be used as the earthwork material for reclamation without any soil improvement. Therefore, cement stabilization was proposed as a soil improvement method. On the basis of compaction and CBR test results regarding the <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil,</b> the maximum dry density and optimum water content did not change, but the CBR value increased remarkably...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} for estimating an ultimate cyclic shear strength of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soils</b> after along-term curing. Shaking table tests are performed on cement-treated Toyoura sand and Ube masado with different curing periods. It was found from the tests that a hyperbolic curve {{can be applied}} to approximate a relationship between the cyclic shear strength and the curing time, so that the ultimate cyclic shear strength is determined as an the asymptotic value of the hyperbora. In addition, it was clarified that an ultimate cyclic shear strength curve, which is considered as a maximum effect of cementation, is experimentally obtained...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} and structural changes in <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soils</b> under influence of freeze/thaw (f/t f/t) exposure are investigated. Specimens from plastic and compacted soil-cement mix designs were exposed to different f/t f/t scenarios to study the influence of f/t f/t dimensionality (i. e., one-dimensional versus three-dimensional exposure) and specimens’ age {{at the time of}} f/t f/t exposure on changes in their performance. Changes in hydraulic conductivity, unconfined compressive strength, and longitudinal resonant frequency of the specimens were studied under each exposure scenario. An examination of the microstructure of the f/t f/t exposed and control specimens using transmitted light optical microscopy was also performed to evaluate how the soil-cement matrix was disrupted after exposure to f/t f/t cycling. Observations showed increases in water content of the mix design (when wet of optimum water content), as well as increased specimen age at the time of exposure may increase f/t f/t susceptibility. On the other hand, comparison of {{the performance}} of the specimens exposed to 1 D and 3 D f/t f/t exposure did not show any significant variation. Microstructural analysis of petrographic thin section samples from control and f/t f/t exposed specimens showed that while optical microscopy can detect matrix disintegration for highly damaged specimens, it is not able to identify structural degradation at early stages of damage development...|$|R
40|$|Peat soil is {{characterized}} by its high content of decomposed organic matter. Majority of areas occupied by peatland {{have been developed for}} agriculture sectors such as pineapple cultivation and oil palm. Due to its geotechnical drawback characteristics such as highly compressibility and low shear strength, peat soil is classified as problematic soils and unstable for engineering structures. Lack of suitable and expensive price of lands, peatland will be an alternative option for future development. Prior to construction works, stabilization of peat soil should be performed to enhance its engineering characteristics. This paper presents the effect of cement and curing period on engineering properties of the <b>cement-treated</b> peat <b>soil.</b> Some engineering variables were examined including the compaction behaviour, permeability and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). The Atterberg limit test was also carried out to examine the influence of cement addition on peat <b>soil.</b> The <b>cement-treated</b> peat <b>soils</b> were prepared by adding varying amount of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) ranging between 0 % and 40 % of dry weight of peat soil. In order to examine the effect of curing, the treated samples were dried at room temperature for three and seven days while for UCS tests samples were extended to 28 days prior to testings. The results showed that the liquid limit of treated soil decreased with the increase of cement content. Maximum dry density (MDD) increased while optimum moisture content (OMC) dropped with the increase in cement content. Permeability of treated soil decreased from 6. 2 × 10 - 4 to 2. 4 × 10 - 4 ms- 1 as cement content increase from 0 % to 40 %. In contrast, the UCS tests indicated an increase in uncompressive strength with the increase in cement contents and curing period. The liquid limit and permeability were also altered as curing periods were extended from three to seven days. This study concluded that geotechnical properties of peat soil can be stabilized using ordinary cement and by modification of the curing periods...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{formula to}} {{estimate}} {{unconfined compressive strength}} of cement-treated marine clays is proposed. The formula has a form similar to the gel–space ratio theory. In the proposed formula, the strength of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> is given by volumetric solid content, strength increase coefficient due to cement, exponential parameter N representing {{the effect of the}} void structure of soil and cement content in respect to the solid material of soil. The formula was adapted to the results of laboratory strength tests of cement-treated soils made of six dredged marine clays with different levels of initial water content. The strengths estimated by the proposed formula agreed with the measured strengths fairly well, using the parameter N= 3. 5 – 4. 6. The formula was applied to the strength estimate of foam- and bead-treated soils made from dredged marine clay, using the parameter N= 2. 1 – 2. 5. The applicability of the proposed formula was examined with the results of strength tests carried out for the design of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> for the construction of D runway at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. Seven samples collected in the construction sites were mixed with different amounts of cement and the different levels of initial water content. On fitting the proposed formula to the results of all the data, the proposed formula estimates the measured strength well. On comparing the estimates with those using a conventional formula based on the water–cement ratio, the proposed formula generated better-fit estimates...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the pilot-scale application of two different stabilisation/solidification (S/S) techniques was carried out at a former fireworks and low explosives manufacturing site in SE England. Cores and granular samples were recovered from uncovered accelerated carbonated (ACT) and cement-treated soils (S/S) after 4 years to evaluate field-performance with time. Samples were prepared for microstructural examination and leaching testing. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> was progressively carbonated over time, whereas the mineralogy of the carbonated soil remained essentially unchanged. Distinct microstructures were developed in the two soils. Although Pb, Zn and Cu leached less from the carbonated soil, these metals were adequately immobilised by both treatments. Geochemical modeling of pH-dependent leaching data suggested that the retention of trace metals resulted from different immobilisation mechanisms operating in the two soils examined.

30|$|<b>Cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> to {{face the}} similar {{situation}} as mentioned for soils treated with lime. Sasanian and Newson [95] and Zhang et al. [96] observed that the soil treated with cement is susceptible to organic materials hindering the chemical reaction which produces cementitious materials. Huat et al. [93] reported that soil containing organic acids and having pH less than 9 inhibit the cementing reaction. For the purpose to reduce the negative effect of organic materials, bentonite {{is added to the}} organic soil. This treatment provides two benefits, one, bentonite has high water retention ability, which is favorable for lime hydration. Two, bentonite is the source of silica for pozzolanic reaction and can become a filler [97, 98]. Kaolinite and zeolite may also be used for lime treated soil having humic acid [98, 99, 100]. This gives enough amount of silica that is required for pozzolanic process.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{electrical}} resistivity {{was related to}} the fundamental geotechnical properties of cement solidified/stabilized heavy metal–contaminated soils. Lead-contaminated soils were artificially prepared with various concentrations and treated by portland cement Type I at three content levels. The compacted cylindrical specimen was prepared with a diameter of 50 mm and height of 100 mm. The apparent {{electrical resistivity}}, electrical conductivity of pore fluid, unconfined compressive strength, and water contents were measured at different curing times. The result shows that the apparent electrical resistivity increases with the increase of curing time and the decrease of porosity and saturation degree as a result of cement hydration development. The effects of lead concentration, cement content, and curing time on the apparent electrical resistivity were discussed. The cementation index mm was used to evaluate the cementation degree of <b>cement-treated</b> lead-contaminated <b>soils.</b> Lead pollutant at high concentrations could suppress or retard the hydration of solidified/stabilized soils.

40|$|This study aims at {{understanding}} various parameters {{that influence}} {{the performance of the}} sodium silicate (SS) additive along with cement in treating the soft Kuttanad soil. The change in soil structure in the presence of SS additive during cement treatment has been correlated with the engineering properties of <b>cement-treated</b> Kuttanad <b>soil.</b> The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of samples was measured to study the additive dosage effect and to evaluate the impact of the clay water to cement (W/C) ratio on the additive performance. Microstructural and mineralogical investigations were carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pH, and zeta potential measurements. The results show that the presence of SS additive notably impacts the strength behavior of Kuttanad soil treated with cement by more than one mechanism. SS additive accelerates and augments the formation of calcium silicate hydrate (CSH). Further, it is found to induce changes in fabric and pore water chemistry that favor enhanced cementation imparting substantial strength to the cemented soil matrix.

40|$|Engineering {{behaviour}} of <b>cement-treated</b> expansive <b>soils</b> {{refers to}} changes in the engineering properties of the soil in terms of reduction in values of swelling indicators and increase in values of strength characteristics of the soil when it is treated with various percentages of cement. In this study, engineering properties including liquid limit, plasticity index, linear shrinkage, maximum dry density/optimum moisture content, and California Bearing Ration (CBR) of expansive subgrade soils from Awgu, Southeastern Nigeria, were determined in the laboratory and their behaviour in terms of changes in the engineering properties on treatment with various percentages of cement (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) investigated. Results of the study show that liquid limit, plasticity index and linear shrinkage values of the treated soil were reduced while the maximum dry density and CBR values were increased. The maximum reduction percentages of 34. 61 % (56. 60 to 37. 01 %), 72. 89 % (33. 60 to 9. 11 %) and 46. 51 % (12. 90 to 6. 90 %) in liquid limit, plasticity index and linear shrinkage, respectively; and maximum percent increase of 7. 59 % (1. 58 to 1. 70 mg/m 3, on maximum dry density), 236. 36 % (11 to 37 %, on unsoaked CBR) and 800. 00 % (3 to 27 %, on soaked CBR), were obtained on treatment of the soil with 8 % cement by weight.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that the {{strength}} of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> increases {{over the course of several}} years. In general, the long-term increase in strength is attributed to the pozzolanic reaction between the cement paste and the soil. The carbonation of cementitious material can also increase its strength. In this study, the effect of carbonation of cement-treated sand on its strength was investigated. Specimens of cement-treated Toyoura silica sand were cured under three conditions: sealed, natural, and accelerated carbonation. The CO 2 concentrations under the three curing conditions were 0 %, 0. 03 %, and 5 %, respectively. The measured strengths of the specimens cured under sealed conditions were almost constant after 28 days, whereas those of the specimens cured under the natural and accelerated conditions increased beyond 28 days because of carbonation. These results indicate that carbonation is one of the main reasons for the long-term increase in the strength of cement-treated sand. Based on thermal analysis, the effect of the CO 2 concentration on the strength and elastic modulus can be explained by the formation of CaCO 3...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} results {{regarding the}} potential of lignosulfonate (LS) to control the swelling of expansive soil. One-dimensional swell tests were performed on untreated and LS-treated remoulded samples of Australian expansive soil {{from the state of}} Queensland. The test results indicated that LS has significant influence on the swelling behaviour of this expansive soil. The results were compared with those of identical <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> samples, and it was found that LS could be a economical and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional alkaline additives. In addition, the behaviour of LS-treated specimens during repeated freezing and thawing cycles was measured. The results indicated significant improvement in the percentage mass loss in LS-treated specimens compared with cementtreated specimens. The microstructural analysis of the untreated and the LS-treated samples showed soil surface area reduction in the treated specimens, which in turn reduced the affinity of the specimens towards moisture uptake, resulting in a reduction in the swell potential of the otherwise expansive soil. The use of LS as a novel non-traditional stabiliser for expansive soil appears to be a viable solution in view of the sustainable use of waste by-products and green construction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to validate the free–free resonant frequency method and its interpretation to determine the small-strain stiffness moduli of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil.</b> In this testing method, a cylindrical soil specimen is laid on top of a soft foam layer to approach fully free boundary conditions. Next, an accelerometer is placed in contact with one end of the specimen to measure vibrations, while the other end is impacted with a light hammer. Then, the small-strain moduli can be evaluated from the density, the dimensions and the fundamental frequency of the vibrations. Factors that could affect the interpretation include the actual boundary conditions of the sample, the interference of the accelerometer on the vibrational response of the sample and the aspect ratio of the sample given by the ratio diameter to length. In order to verify the reliability of the measurements, the free–free resonant frequency method was compared with a more robust technique like the laser Doppler vibrometer. Furthermore, the impact of the sample’s aspect ratio was investigated through a numerical modal analysis from which correction factors were also proposed to improve the reliability of the interpretations...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} called the cement-mixing and mechanical dehydration method (CMD) {{as one of}} recycling techniques for soft clay slurry is developed. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the CMD for increasing the strength of soft clay, a series of unconfined compression tests and several durability tests were performed together with the literature review of unconfined compressive strength in cement-treated soils. Moreover, a series of constant strain rate consolidation tests were also performed to evaluate the effects of cement content and dehydration speed on the permeability of cement-treated clay. The following conclusions are obtained: 1) Literature review and theoretical considerations on the shear strength of cement-treated soils show that an additional treatment for the purpose of increasing the density of cement-treated specimen is effective for increasing the shear strength of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil.</b> 2) The mechanical dehydration of soft clay with high pressure is accelerated by cement mixing, where the coefficient of consolidation of cement-treated clay increases as the cement content increases. 3) The high-strength specimen having the unconfined compressive strength of more than 20 MPa can be created from soft clay treated by the CMD with the cement content of over 20 % and the dehydration pressure of 20 MPa...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn a {{study on}} the {{properties}} of very soft clays, bender element testing was used to evaluate thixotropic hardening behavior; that is, to measure the stiffness with resting time under constant volume and water content. A laboratory vane test, which measures the undrained shear strength of the materials, was also carried out for comparison purposes. To investigate the mechanism of the thixotropic phenomenon, a consolidation test with very low pressure was also performed in a cell equipped with bender elements. The most important findings from this study are as follows: (1) regardless of soil types, the effect of thixotropy was significant around the liquid limit state and less remarkable at the lower and higher ranges; (2) the shear modulus at the liquid limit after 24 h resting is around 200 kPa; (3) the correlation between the shear modulus and the undrained shear strength of very soft clays {{is similar to that of}} <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> proposed by Seng and Tanaka (2011); (4) the increment of the shear modulus developed in the thixotropy process appears to be noticeably higher than that in the secondary consolidation process. It is believed that these findings are very useful to establish a new theory for the consolidation of ground filled by very soft clays or dredged soils with extremely high water content as well as to understand the effects of ageing on the consolidation properties of natural soils...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSoil and {{granular}} materials stabilization with {{hydraulic cements}} {{is an interesting}} solution as stiffness and strength are highly improved. It is especially attractive when high traffic loads with considerable number of passages are expected and high mechanical properties of subgrade soils are required. Furthermore, such improvement allows {{reducing the amount of}} natural soils to be disposed for the fact of being rehabilitated, with significant environmental and economic advantages. Many authors have studied the cyclic behaviour of soils and soft rocks and others have studied soil-cement mixtures under static conditions. However, few studies have been published on soil-cement mixtures in cyclic conditions, particularly with a high number of cycles. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the behaviour of some mixtures of <b>cement-treated</b> <b>soil</b> subjected to long term cyclic loading in order to contribute to the identification of rational criteria for design of subgrades for transportation infrastructures. The soil used is a well-graded silty sand remoulded from the weathered horizons of Porto granite, the most common rock in the north-western region of Portugal. The cement added to the soil varied in four percentages from 0 to 7 % of mass of the uncemented soil. For each of these cement contents, two specimens were moulded with two initial void ratios. The study included an extensive set of long-duration drained cyclic triaxial tests, performed under stress-controlled conditions using an automatic hydraulic system with cells containing high-precision internal axial and radial strain gauges. The scope of the triaxial cyclic tests is to study the evolution of the accumulation of permanent strain in cemented and uncemented specimens subjected to cyclic loading...|$|E
