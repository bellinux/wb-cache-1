5|$|James played wide {{receiver}} for St. Vincent-St. Mary's football team and was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame. As a sophomore, {{he was named}} first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals. He decided to stop playing high school football before his senior year, after he broke his wrist during an AAU basketball game. Many sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, and former and current players have speculated on whether he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> in the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have debated {{as to how}} sauropods {{were able}} to breathe with their large body sizes and long necks, which would have {{increased}} the amount of dead space. They likely had an avian respiratory system, which is more efficient than a mammalian and reptilian system. Reconstructions of the neck and thorax of Diplodocus show great pneumaticity, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role in respiration {{as it does in}} birds.|$|E

Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E

5|$|According to Vrba, the impala {{evolved from}} an alcelaphine {{ancestor}}. She noted that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the impala has continued in its basic form {{for at least}} five million years. Several fossil species have been discovered, including A. datoadeni from the Pliocene of Ethiopia. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, variety in diet, positive population trend, defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with the tick-feeding oxpeckers <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role in preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Nash grew {{up playing}} soccer—he stated in a 2005 {{interview}} that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> professionally if he had focused on it—and continues to hold {{an interest in the}} sport. When Dirk Nowitzki arrived in the NBA from Germany, he and Nash became close friends, in part because they enjoyed watching soccer together. Nash is friends with several professional soccer players, including Alessandro Del Piero, Thierry Henry, Owen Hargreaves, Massimo Ambrosini and Steve McManaman. During his off-season, when he lives in New York City, he has trained with the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer, and once tried to arrange a pick-up game in the city's Central Park with the Red Bulls and one of his local teams.|$|E
5|$|Baroš joined Premier League side Portsmouth on {{loan from}} Lyon in January 2008 {{until the end of}} the season, with the option of making the move {{permanent}} at the end of the loan. Baroš played a significant role in the club winning the 2008 FA Cup. He won Portsmouth's match-winning penalty kick in the quarter-final at Manchester United and assisted Nwankwo Kanu's deciding goal in the semi final match against West Bromwich Albion with a suspected handball that went unnoticed by both the referee and his assistant. The final match of Baroš' loan spell was the 2008 FA Cup Final victory over Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium, where he appeared as an 87th-minute substitute for Kanu. By the end of the season, Baroš had played 16 matches for Portsmouth, including seven as a substitute, although he failed to score. He was one of a number of Portsmouth players to be absent at the team parade after the club won the FA Cup, leading to speculation he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> his last game for the club. At the end of the season, Baroš returned to Lyon.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Sereno {{pointed out}} several skull and {{dentition}} features that suggest a purely {{or at least}} preponderantly herbivorous diet. These include the horny beak and the specialised cheek teeth, which were suitable for cutting off vegetation, as well as fleshy cheeks, which would have helped keeping food within the mouth during mastication. The jaw muscles were enlarged, and the jaw joint was set {{below the level of}} the teeth. This deep position of the jaw joint would have allowed an evenly spread bite along the tooth row, in contrast to the scissor-like bite seen in carnivorous dinosaurs. Finally, size and position of the tusks are very different in separate members of the Heterodontosauridae family; a specific function in feeding thus appears unlikely. Sereno surmised that heterodontosaurids were comparable to today's peccaries, which possess similar tusks and feed on a variety of plant material such as roots, tubers, fruits, seeds and grass. Butler and colleagues suggested that the feeding apparatus of Heterodontosaurus was specialised to process tough plant material, and that late-surviving members of the family (Fruitadens, Tianyulong and Echinodon) probably showed a more generalised diet including both plants and invertebrates. Heterodontosaurus was characterised by a strong bite at small gape angles, but the later members were adapted to a more rapid bite and wider gapes. A 2016 study of ornithischian jaw mechanics found that the relative bite forces of Heterodontosaurus was comparable to that of the more derived Scelidosaurus. The study suggested that the tusks <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role in feeding by grazing against the lower beak while cropping vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Janowitz {{originally}} intended {{the part of}} Cesare {{to go to his}} friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Mayer wrote the part of Jane for Gilda Langer, {{but by the time the}} film was cast Langer's interests had moved on from Janowitz and Mayer to director Paul Czinner, leaving the role to be played by Lil Dagover. Janowitz claimed he wrote the part of Dr. Caligari specifically for Werner Krauss, who Deutsch had brought to his attention during rehearsals for a Max Reinhardt play; Janowitz said only Krauss or Paul Wegener <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> the part. The parts of Dr. Caligari and Cesare ultimately went to Krauss and Conrad Veidt, respectively, who enthusiastically took part in many aspects of the production. Krauss suggested changes to his own make-up and costumes, including the elements of a top hat, cape, and walking stick with an ivory handle for his character. The actors in Caligari were conscious of the need to adapt their make-up, costumes, and appearance to match the visual style of the film. Much of the acting in German silent films at the time was already Expressionistic, mimicking the pantomimic aspects of Expressionist theatre. The performances of Krauss and Veidt in Caligari were typical of this style, as they both had experience in Expressionist-influenced theatre, and as a result John D. Barlow said they appear more comfortable in their surroundings in the film than the other actors. Prior to filming, Kraus and Veidt appeared on stage in the winter of 1918 in an Expressionist drama, Reinhold Goering's Seeschlacht, at the Deutsches Theater. By contrast, Dagover had little experience in Expressionist theatre, and Barlow argues her acting is less harmonious with the film's visual style.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspiration}} behind Fergus' ecclesiastical patronage is uncertain.

Gordon Liddy and told Liddy to contact Attorney General Kleindienst, with an order that James W. McCord, Jr. should be released before his identity was discovered. Liddy insisted that the call had come from Magruder. Mardian always insisted on his innocence and since the trial has said that John Dean had the idea of calling Kleindienst. Mardian stated that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> no role in getting the burglars released, given his location and the difference in time zones.|$|E
25|$|Tsukuru stays {{alone with}} Kuro, now a {{successful}} pottery artist. Eri prefers {{to dispense with}} nicknames and explains that Yuzu was mentally ill. The rape accusation was a fabrication, but he was cut off {{as a way of}} not frontally contradicting Yuzu to enable her to deal with her problems. Eri reveals that {{she was in love with}} Tsukuru, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role in the accusation, but also that Yuzu was actually raped and had a miscarriage, then developed anorexia as a way of never being pregnant again. Eri told him nothing, maybe because he never noticed her love, but mostly to prevent a confrontation with Yuzu. Tsukuru was sacrificed to protect Yuzu because the group believed he was the strongest emotionally and could deal with the ban. These redemptive revelations give the lie to Tsukuru's own perception of himself as plain and colorless.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors which}} {{may have contributed to}} the decline of the water {{hyacinth}} in Lake Victoria include varying weather patterns, such as El Niño during the last few months of 1997 and first six months of 1998 bringing with it higher levels of water in the lake and thus dislodging the plants. Heavy winds and rains along with their subsequent waves may have also damaged the plants during this same time frame. The plants may not have been destroyed, instead merely moved to another location. Additionally, the water quality, nutrient supply, temperature, and other environmental factors <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>played</b> a role. Overall, the timing of the decline could be linked to all of these factors and perhaps together, in combination, they were more effective than any one deterrent would have been by itself. The water hyacinth is in remission and this trend could be permanent if control efforts are continued.|$|E
