It is formulated the operational principle of this damper, which contains the orifice with high and low resistance and also the stabilizer (vortex damper) of an outflow. Future references for choosing the diameter {{and the amount of}} passages in the orifices are also done. It is proposed the sequence of choosing the damper parameters, which contains the stages of tentative gas-dynamic calculation of the <b>plain</b> <b>washer</b> parameters on basis of the Saint-Venant-Wenzel formula and the final modeling, produced on basis of the numerical simulation.

40|$|When a bar falling {{or moving}} at any speed strikes the {{opposite}} side of threaded rod fastening a thick circular disk, stress wave propagating from the collision interface is transmitted into the assembly system, tightening the thick circular disk by the bolt-nut unit. This paper experimentally studies the relationship between the loosening response of bolt-nut fastening assembly system and stress wave modes (tension or compression) along the direction of propagation. The technique of observing the loosening of a bolt-nut assembly system by monitoring the configuration of stress waves reflected from the surface of a thick circular disk is presented. The axial stress of a bolt tightened by a hexagonal nut in conjunction with a <b>plain</b> <b>washer,</b> a spring washer or a flanged nut is measured, when a number of incident waves are impinged into the assembly system. The shift of axial stress due to tightening by flanged nut is the smallest...|$|R

40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that a bolt-nut {{assembly}} system properly tightened can be loosened under vibrating load or impact. This paper experimentally investigates the loosening response of an assembly when a stress wave is transmitted from a gross area of a bolt, a face of a circular disk, or a screw thread of the thick circular disk assembly fastened by the bolt-nut unit. When a falling bar strikes {{the opposite side of}} a threaded rod fastened to the circular disk, or a falling circular pipe collides with the circular disk or with the anvil attached {{to the end of a}} screw, a stress wave propagating from the collision interface is transmitted into the assembly. The axial stress of a bolt tightened by a hexagonal nut in conjunction with a <b>plain</b> <b>washer</b> is measured, while a number of incident waves are impinged into the assembly. The shift of axial stress due to the stress wave transmitted from the portion of the screw thread is the largest. The cause of the loosening is investigated by observing the stress waves transmitted into the circular disk assembly system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBolted joints {{are used}} for {{fastening}} components together in the industry, aeronautics and in railways. These joints may get loose with time and if not attended timely may result in catastrophic failure also. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of tightening torque on loosening. For this purpose tests were conducted using three different tightening torque values, in the vicinity of rated torque. Washers of different types are used in bolted joint, with an understanding that they prevent or retard loosening. This study also attempts to examine the role of two types of most commonly used washers: the <b>plain</b> <b>washer</b> and the spring washer. Trials were also performed on joint without any washer, for the sake of comparison of loosening performance of the joint. The results of this experimental study are shown in terms of starting point of loosening of joint and rate of loosening of the joint. Various combinations of washers for three values of tightening torque are considered in the experimental study. The results are useful in understanding the role of type of washer in prevention of loosening of the bolted joint...|$|R

Beatrice 'Tilly' Shilling, a young female {{engineer}} working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, came up with a disarmingly simple solution. She introduced a simple flow restrictor: a small metal disc much like a <b>plain</b> metal <b>washer.</b> The restrictor orifice was made to accommodate just the fuel needed for maximum engine power, the power setting usually used during dogfights. It came in two versions, one for 12 psi manifold pressure and one for boosted engines with 15 psi manifold pressure.|$|R

5000|$|The playing {{pieces in}} the game are known as [...] "cones" [...] because of their cone shape. This allows them to be stacked {{on top of one}} another in {{unlimited}} numbers. Each player starts off with four cones, and whenever one player lands on the space occupied by the cone of another, this player captures the opponent's cone. The capturing player places his/her cone on top of the cone of the player being captured, where it remains throughout the game. The result is known as a [...] "stack."

Shiga, located near Kyoto in central Japan, is home to Lake Biwa, the largest lake in the country. Approximately 500 rivers flow into Lake Biwa from the steep surrounding mountains. The population is concentrated in alluvial <b>cones</b> and alluvial <b>plains.</b> The Shiga Prefectural Government enacted the integrated flood management ordinance in March 2014. This ordinance includes land use and building regulation measures {{in order to promote}} flood risk reduction for excessive flood events based on the newly developed risk evaluation method, which is the first in Japan. The goal of the risk-based floodplain regulation is to make use of existing legal framework for effective land use and building regulations, based on comprehensive flood hazard risk maps, to indicate both the damage levels and occurrence probabilities of various floods at all sites in a flood plain...|$|R

But this {{superimposition}} of lightness {{on weight}} {{is still more}} distinctly the system of many buildings of the kind which I have above called Architecture of Position, that is to say, architecture of which the greater part is intended merely to keep something in a peculiar position; as in light-houses, and many towers and belfries. The subject of spire and tower architecture, however, is so interesting and extensive, that I have thoughts of writing a detached essay upon it, and, at all events, cannot enter upon it here: but this much is enough for the reader to note for our present purpose, that, although many towers do in reality stand on piers or shafts, as the central towers of cathedrals, yet the expression of all of them, and the real structure {{of the best and}} strongest, are the elevation of gradually diminishing weight on massy or even solid foundation. Nevertheless, since the tower is in its origin a building for strength of defence, and faithfulness of watch, rather than splendor of aspect, its true expression is of just so much diminution of weight upwards as may be necessary to its fully balanced strength, not a jot more. There must be no light-headedness in your noble tower: impregnable foundation, wrathful crest, with the vizor down, and the dark vigilance seen through the clefts of it; not the filigree crown or embroidered cap. No towers are so grand as the square-browed ones, with massy cornices and rent battlements: next to these come the fantastic towers, with their various forms of steep roof; the best, not the <b>cone,</b> but the <b>plain</b> gable thrown very high; last of all in my mind (of good towers), those with spires or crowns, though these, of course, are fittest for ecclesiastical purposes, and capable of the richest ornament. The paltry four or eight pinnacled things we call towers in England (as in York Minster), are mere confectioner's Gothic, and not worth classing.|$|R
40|$|Inorganic scintillators {{are widely}} used in modern medical imaging {{modalities}} as converter for the X- and gamma-radiation {{that is used to}} obtain information about the interior of the body. Likewise, they are applied in high-energy physics to measure the energy of particles that are produced in particle physics experiments. Their use is motivated by the very good detection efficiency of these materials for hard radiation which allows the construction of relatively compact and finely pixelised systems with a high spatial resolution. One key problem {{in the development of the}} next generation of particle detectors and medical imaging systems is the optimisation of the energy resolution of the detectors. This parameter is influenced by the statistical fluctuations of the light output of the scintillators, i. e. by the number of photons that are detected when a particle deposits its energy in the scintillator. The light output of the scintillator depends not only on the absolute number of generated photons but also on the geometrical shape of the material, its transmission properties at the wavelength of scintillation, and its refractive index. Especially in tiny detector crystals with small aspect ratio, a significant fraction of photons is lost before conversion into an electronic signal in the photo detector. This effect increases the statistical fluctuations of the light output and therefore, deteriorates the energy resolution. The present work explores possible ways to overcome the problem of total internal reflection at the surface of the scintillator that couples to the photo detector, which is one of the principal reasons for signal losses in heavy inorganic scintillators with high refractive index. The emphasis is placed on the recently developed Ce doped scintillators LuYAP:Ce and LYSO:Ce which are used in the dedicated PET imaging systems ClearPEM and ClearPET developed by the Crystal Clear Collaboration. Starting point of the work are Monte-Carlo simulations of standard LuYAP and LYSO crystals used in ClearPEM and ClearPET with the light ray tracing program LITRANI. These simulations are used to assess the losses induced by total internal reflection and the potential in effective light yield gain. In order to calibrate the model, experiments in several reference setups are performed and the results compared with those from simulations of equivalent systems. This combination of experimental and simulated data is also used for a precise determination of the absolute light yield of the scintillators. The results of the simulations are then used to study the effect of non-planar coupling faces on the light extraction. Two approaches are considered: A macroscopic one, in which trapezoidal grooves with a depth of several hundred micrometer are used to break up total internal reflection at the coupling face; and a microscopic one that uses the unique op tical properties of photonic crystals to assess photons outside the extraction <b>cone</b> of a <b>plain</b> coupling face. The potential of the macroscopic approach is assessed by means of LITRANI simulations and validated by experiments with prototype samples designed on basis of the simulation results. The experimental results show that the gain in light yield is less than predicted from simulations of an idealized system. However, they are found to be well described by a model where the crystal layers immediately beneath the groove surfaces are described by a heavily absorbing and diffusing material. The microscopic approach is probed by means of simulations with a scattering-matrix algorithm. This algorithm is used to evaluate the impact of several structural parameters of the photonic crystal on the transmission properties of the exit surface. From these data, a model is developed which uses the results obtained with LITRANI to calculate the gain in light collection efficiency for a number of possible designs. Finally, possible fabrication techniques for photonic crystal structures on scintillators are briefly discussed. The thesis closes with a short summary of the results and a short outlook on possible future projects based on the presented approaches...|$|R
