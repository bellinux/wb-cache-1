50|$|Erythema anulare centrifugum (EAC), {{also known}} as deep gyrate erythema, <b>erythema</b> perstans, palpable <b>migrating</b> <b>erythema</b> and {{superficial}} gyrate erythema, is a descriptive term for a class of skin lesion presenting redness (erythema) in a ring form (anulare) that spreads from a center (centrifugum). It was first described by Darier in 1916. Many different terms {{have been used to}} classify these types of lesions and it is still controversial on what exactly defines EAC. Some of the types include annular erythema (deep and superficial), erythema perstans, erythema gyratum perstans, erythema gyratum repens, darier erythema (deep gyrate erythema) and erythema figuratum perstans.|$|R
40|$|A gnatostomíase é parasitose endêmica em alguns países asiáticos, causada pela ingestão da larva do nematódio Gnathostoma sp, que pode ocorrer no consumo de carne crua de peixes de água doce. Atinge vários órgãos, entre eles a pele, manifestando-se frequentemente como lesão subcutânea migratória. Países da América Central e do Sul como México e Peru vêm apresentando número crescente de casos da doença desde 1970. Este trabalho registra o primeiro caso notificado e publicado no Brasil e alerta para o surgimento dessa doença em áreas anteriormente não endêmicas. Relata-se caso de paciente, com história de viagem ao Peru, que evoluiu com quadro cutâneo compatível com gnatostomíase. Gnathostomiasis is an {{endemic disease}} in Asian {{countries}} {{caused by the}} ingestion of larval stage of Gnathostoma sp roundworms that may be acquired by eating raw fresh-water fish. It can reach many organs and the skin is one of them, characterized by creeping eruptions and/or <b>migrating</b> <b>erythema.</b> Since 1970 {{the number of patients}} affected seems to be increasing in Central and South America countries like Mexico and Peru. This is the first notification and publication of gnathostomiasis in Brazil, and it serves as an alert to the possibility of the emergence of this disease in non-endemic areas. We report a case of a man who traveled to Peru and developed cutaneous features accordant with gnathostomiasis...|$|R
40|$|Necrolytic migratory {{erythema}} {{is a rare}} {{skin condition}} that consists of <b>migrating</b> areas of <b>erythema</b> with blisters that heal with hyperpigmentation. It usually occurs in patients with an alpha islet cell tumor of the pancreas-or glucagonoma-and when associated with glucose intolerance, anemia, hyperglucagonemia, and weight loss defines the glucagonoma syndrome. We describe a 52 -year-old female patient with necrolytic migratory erythema associated with glucagonoma syndrome who had metastatic disease at presentation and passed away one week after her admission. The autopsy showed a tumor {{in the body of}} the pancreas, which was diagnosed as a neuroendocrine tumor and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The diagnosis of necrolytic migratory erythema is a matter of great importance, since it might be an auxiliary tool for the early detection of glucagonoma...|$|R
40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood basophils from two patients with unusually high basophil counts {{in association with}} <b>chronic</b> myelogenous leukaemia <b>migrated</b> in vitro toward various chemotactic agents of human origin. These included supernatants from sensitized lymphocytes challenged with specific antigen, diffusates from lung fragments challenged with pollen antigen E, the enzyme plasma kallikrein, and two complement derived agents, C 5 a and C[unk][unk][unk]. Thus, chemotaxis in vitro, a previously unreported property of human basophils, has been observed, although none of the agents tested produced a selective chemotactic response...|$|R
40|$|Erythema nodosum {{presents}} variable {{clinical and}} histologic patterns of {{response in the}} vessels, septa, and fat lobules of the subcutaneous tissue. Acute or chronic phlebitis with hemorrhage may be commonly observed; acute panniculitis is observed in foci, but at times {{it may be the}} principal histologic feature; lymphocytic infiltration of fat lobules is often found, and lymphoid nodules are not infrequent; rarely, chronic granulomatous lesions involve septa or fat lobules; and proliferative lipocyte response may be observed. Because these variable histologic patterns may be coexistent, excision biopsy and multiple sections are necessary to recognize them. The variable histologic features correlate with the different clinical forms: acute nodular, <b>chronic</b> nodular, <b>migrating</b> plaque lesion, cellulitis, and the rare suppurative form. This variety of panniculus response in erythema nodosum can be explained on the basis of host-tissue response to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to an antigenic stimulus...|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of some chronic diseases, {{transplant}}ationbecomes an option. Although transplants offer various levels of normality, the transplant must subsequently be cared for {{in addition to the}} chronic disease. Because of the need for complex immunosuppressive medication regimens, the approach to management of these patients has been highly focused on ensuring adherence, defined as following the provider’s recommendations. The philosophy of care for most <b>chronic</b> diseases has <b>migrated</b> to patient self-management (PSM), 1 defined as ability to detect and manage signs and symptoms, treatment, and physical and psychosocial consequences inherent in living with a chronic condi-tion. 2 This movement was historically led by diabetes, in recognition of the fact that PSM was essential to survival.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} modified antigen presenting cells (APCs) expressing high levels of Fas ligand (APC-FasL) on post-viral chronic inflammatory disease. FasL-deficient B 6 -gld/gld mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) cleared the virus from their lungs, kidneys, and livers within 2 weeks of infection. However, inflammation persisted in these organs for more than 8 weeks, with a chronically increased T-cell response to MCMV-infected APCs and production of autoantibodies. Administration of APC-AdFasL at 4 weeks suppressed this inflammation and diminished the T-cell response and autoantibody production. APC-AdFasL that had been transfected with ultraviolet-irradiated MCMV were more effective than uninfected APC-AdFasL in ameliorating the <b>chronic</b> inflammation. APC-AdFasL <b>migrated</b> preferentially to the spleen, where they triggered apoptosis of lymphocytes in the marginal zone of the spleen. These results confirm that Fas-mediated apoptosis is not required for clearance of virus, but is required for down-modulation of the virally induced chronic inflammatory response. This organwide effect of APC-AdFasL appears to be mediated by elimination of activated T lymphocytes in the spleen before their emigration to the target organs...|$|R

40|$|A {{progressive}} {{destruction of}} the myocardium occurs in ∼ 30 % of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected individuals, causing chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, a disease so far without effective treatment. Syngeneic bone marrow cell transplantation {{has been shown to}} cause repair and improvement of heart function in a number of studies in patients and animal models of ischemic cardiopathy. The effects of bone marrow transplant in a mouse model of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, {{in the presence of the}} disease causal agent, ie, the T. cruzi, are described herein. Bone marrow cells injected intravenously into <b>chronic</b> chagasic mice <b>migrated</b> to the heart and caused a significant reduction in the inflammatory infiltrates and in the interstitial fibrosis characteristics of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. The beneficial effects were observed up to 6 months after bone marrow cell transplantation. A massive apoptosis of myocardial inflammatory cells was observed after the therapy with bone marrow cells. Transplanted bone marrow cells obtained from chagasic mice and from normal mice had similar effects in terms of mediating chagasic heart repair. These results show that bone marrow cell transplantation is effective for treatment of chronic chagasic myocarditis and indicate that autologous bone marrow transplant may be used as an efficient therapy for patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|African American women (AAW) {{are at a}} {{high risk}} for type 2 diabetes, a {{debilitating}} and potentially fatal disease {{for which there is}} no cure. The purpose of this study was to extend the research of Mosca et al. (2012) by examining the relationship between caregiver status and self-reported health status for AAW 18 years or older diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The chronic care model (CCM) provided the theoretical framework for this study. The CCM promoted routine care for patients with <b>chronic</b> illnesses to <b>migrate</b> from acute care to proactive, planned, and risk-based protocols. A binomial logistic regression investigated the relationship between caregiver status, categorized as paid or unpaid, and self-reported health status, which was dichotomized as either good to excellent health or poor to fair health. There was a statistically significant relationship between primary caregiver status and self-reported health status among AAW diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes after controlling for age, education, and marital status (p 3 ̆c. 004). Based on the fitted binomial logistic regression model, there were 186 cases of AAW with type 2 diabetes; having a paid caregiver was associated with a lower odds of having good to excellent health (OR = 0. 294).
