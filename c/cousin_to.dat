5|$|Historian Timothy Bolton has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} similarities between these genealogies is evidence of a shared family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling.

Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had only recently risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was another indication of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.|$|E

During this time period, New York was often looked down upon as the upstart, over-populated, dirty <b>cousin</b> <b>to</b> aristocratic and clean Boston.|$|E

Godoy and Testera were soon in conflict and the friar was forced to abandon Champoton and return to central Mexico.

Champoton was the last Spanish outpost in the Yucatán Peninsula; it was increasingly isolated and the situation there became difficult.|$|E
