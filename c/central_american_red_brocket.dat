2500|$|Systematic {{recording}} of dietary intake {{while living in}} the forest entirely off wild foods suggests that about 80% of the energy in the diet comes from meat, 10% from palm starch and hearts, 10% from insect larva and honey, and 1% from fruits. Total energy intake is approximately 2700 kcal per person daily, and males acquire about 84% of all calories consumed. Children do not produce significant amounts of food until they are fully adult. Despite the presence of over 500 species of edible vertebrate prey, only nine species of mammals provide more than 1% of the prey biomass actually harvested by Aché hunters.

50|$|The <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> (Mazama temama) is {{a species}} of brocket deer ranging from {{southern}} Mexico, through Central America, to northwestern Colombia. It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the red brocket from South America, but its karyotype has 2n = 50, while the latter's was initially described as having 2n = 68-70. However, a more recent description gives the red brocket a variable karyotype with 2n varying from 48 to 54. It is sympatric with the Yucatan brown brocket over part of its range. The species is found in primary and secondary tropical forest at altitudes from sea level to 2800 m. In Mexico, it is regarded as an agricultural pest by bean farmers. It is probably threatened by hunting and deforestation.|$|E
50|$|It {{formerly}} {{included the}} <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> (M. temama) {{and sometimes the}} Yucatan brown brocket (M. pandora) as subspecies. Considerable taxonomic confusion still exists for the populations remaining in the red brocket. Pending a solution to this, it has been evaluated as data deficient by the IUCN, though as presently defined, {{it is the most}} widespread species of brocket. It is sympatric with the smaller Amazonian brown brocket over much of its range (the latter tends to have significantly lower population densities). The karyotype of the red brocket was initially described as having 2n = 68, FN = 74, and more recently as having 2n varying from 48 to 54 and FN varying from 54 to 56. This variability may indicate the presence of unrecognized species in the population.|$|E
50|$|Ecoregions are {{not only}} {{established}} to protect the forests themselves {{but also because they}} are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (Pharomacrus mocinno), three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata), bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and black guan (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, {{which is part of the}} Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extincition are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. Jaguars, cougars, spider monkeys, as well as tapirs, and anteaters live in the woods of Central America. The <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe gochu (Korean red pepper) {{that goes}} into Korean {{traditional}} fermented foods such as kimchi (fermented cabbage) and gochujang (spicy red pepper paste) should have a mild spiciness and its Scoville heat unit (the unit that measures spiciness) is < 1, 000. The kimchi and gochujang that are fermented only with Korean gochu can be eaten. Kimchi and gochujang cannot be prepared even with cheongyangkochu (Scoville heat unit is approximately 3, 000), which is a hybrid of Korean gochu and Thai gochu. When these foods are prepared with other spicier gochu, such as Thai pepper, Southern Asian <b>red</b> pepper, <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>red</b> pepper, or Mexico's aji (which is 500 times spicier than Korean gochu), they will be too spicy to consume. Biologically, Korean gochu {{is different from the}} <b>red</b> peppers of <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> countries (such as Mexico and Colombia), Indonesia, India, and Thailand. Therefore, the statement that the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>red</b> pepper came to Korea during the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592 is not true. We can refer to a research paper in the magazine “Nature” that Korea's gochu arrived at the Korean peninsula millions of years ago, having been spread by birds. It states that gochu has evolved for millions of years, therefore, we can infer that Korean gochu existed as a completely different variety. In addition, gochujang and kimchi can be made using gochu only, which proves that people in Korea cultivated gochu thousands of years ago and have been eating it since then. Furthermore, many old Korean documents support the fact that Koreans have been planting and harvesting gochu for the last 1, 500 years...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>red</b> <b>brocket</b> deer, Mazama americana, has {{at least}} six {{distinct}} karyotypes in different regions of South America that suggest the existence of various species that are today all referred to as M. americana. From an evolutionary perspective, the <b>red</b> <b>brockets</b> are a relatively recent clade that has gone through intense diversification. This study sought to prove the existence of post-zygotic reproductive isolation in deer offspring between distinct chromosome lineages. To achieve this, inter-cytotype and intra-cytotype crosses were performed, which resulted in both F 1 hybrid (n = 5) and pure offspring (n = 3) in captivity. Results: F 1 females were analyzed {{in terms of their}} karyotypes, ovarian histology, estrous cycles and in vitro embryo production. Pure females presented parameters that were similar to those previously reported for M. Americana; however, the parameters for hybrid females were different. Two hybrids were determined to be sterile, while the remaining hybrids presented characteristics of subfertility. Conclusions: The results support the existence of well-established reproductive isolation among the most distant karyotype lineages and elucidates the need to define all karyotype variants and their geographical ranges in order to define the number of species of <b>red</b> <b>brocket...</b>|$|R
