50|$|For {{calibrating}} {{the monitor}} a colorimeter is attached flat to the display's surface, shielded from all ambient light. The calibration software sends {{a series of}} color signals to the display and compares the values that were actually sent against the readings from the <b>calibration</b> <b>device.</b> This establishes the current offsets in color display. Depending on the calibration software and type of monitor used, the software either creates a correction matrix (i.e. an ICC profile) for color values before {{being sent to the}} display, or gives instructions for altering the display's brightness/contrast and RGB values through the OSD.This tunes the display to reproduce fairly accurately the in-gamut part of a desired color space.

50|$|Vaisala's origins {{date back}} to the 1930s when Professor Vilho Väisälä (1889-1969), Vaisala's founder and long-time {{managing}} director, invented some of the operating principles of a radiosonde. He sent the first Finnish radiosonde aloft in December 1931. After the first sounding, Väisälä continued with further development and tests until a radiosonde could be brought into production and deliveries started in 1936. From the very start, Vaisala was an international business, exporting 95 percent of the production. As the Vaisala radiosonde became internationally renowned, the demand for them increased. In 1944, Prof. Väisälä established a company called Mittari Oy ("Gauge Incorporated") and set up manufacturing facilities for radiosonde systems. The first sounding system included a semi-automatic radiosonde receiver, a <b>calibration</b> <b>device</b> and a ground check set. The company employed 13 people at the time. Later, in 1955, the name of Mittari was changed to Vaisala.|$|E

40|$|The {{continued}} {{scaling of}} CMOS process features enables ever-faster and denser circuits, which {{comes at the}} cost of increased device parameter variation. The performance of analogue and mixed-signal circuits in particular degrades in such a high variation environment, which poses an extraordinary challenge in the design and fabrication of such circuits. This thesis develops a set of tools and methodologies for a post-fabrication calibration system called the Configurable Analogue Transistor (CAT). The principle of the CAT technique is to replace certain transistors in a circuit with <b>calibration</b> <b>devices,</b> which allow adjustment of circuit performance after fabrication to compensate the effects of device parameter variation. Building on initial research on the CAT, this thesis develops a methodology to identify the most suitable <b>calibration</b> <b>devices</b> in their circuit and determine their optimal sizes. Furthermore, the applicability of CAT is extended beyond parameter variation to also include direct compensation of temperature. A complementary technique to post-fabrication calibration is robust design, where a circuit is designed to be inherently robust against variation in device parameters. In this thesis, a novel closed-loop pick-off circuit for force-balanced MEMS accelerometers is presented. It is comparable in performance to other state-of-the-art techniques, but provides vastly improved robustness against parameter variation and a more intuitive design process. <br/...|$|R

50|$|Deflection sensors (geophones; force-balance seismometers) mounted {{radially}} {{from the}} center of the load plate measure the deformation of the pavement in response to the load. Some typical offsets are 0mm, 200mm, 300mm, 450mm, 600mm, 900mm, 1200mm 1500mm. The deflections measured at these sensors are termed D0, D200, D300 etc. The advantages of seismometers compared to geophones are built-in <b>calibration</b> <b>devices</b> and higher range (5 mm vs 2 mm). Geophones are more sensitive to disturbance immediately before the impact since the initial error is integrated. Geophones however are much cheaper than seismometers.
