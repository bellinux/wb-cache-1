50|$|Early mills {{had been}} taken to the forest, where a {{temporary}} shelter was built, and the logs were skidded to the nearby mill by horse or ox teams, often when there was some snow to provide lubrication. As mills grew larger, they were usually established in more permanent facilities on a river, and the logs were floated down to them by log drivers. Sawmills built on navigable rivers, lakes, or estuaries were called <b>cargo</b> mills because <b>of</b> the availability <b>of</b> ships transporting <b>cargoes</b> <b>of</b> logs to the sawmill and <b>cargoes</b> <b>of</b> lumber from the sawmill.|$|R

5|$|After the British {{settlement}} at Sydney Cove {{was established}} in 1788, {{a significant part of}} the Chinese porcelain shipped to Australia came via British traders living in India.

Examination of the <b>cargo</b> <b>of</b> ships wrecked during the early colonisation of Australia show that the Country Trade played an important role in getting supplies, including Chinese porcelain traded via India often in Indian-built vessels, to the early Australian colonies.|$|E
