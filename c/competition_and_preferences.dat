40|$|Gender {{gaps in the}} {{workplace}} are widespread. One explanation for gender inequality stems from the e¤ects {{of the interaction between}} competition and two pressure sources, namely, task stereotypes and time constraints. This study uses a laboratory experiment to …nd that the gender gap in performance under <b>competition</b> <b>and</b> <b>preferences</b> for competition can be partly explained by the di¤erential responses of men and women to the above pressures. In particular, while women underperform the men in a highpressure math-based tournament, women greatly increase their performance levels and their willingness to compete in a low-pressure verbal environment, such that they actually surpass the men. This e¤ect appears largely {{due to the fact that}} extra time in a verbal competition improves the quality of women’s work, reducing their mistake share. On the other hand, men use this extra time to increase only the quantity of work, which results in a greater relative number of mistakes. A simple labor market study suggests that the nature of the job and the stress level seem to be correlated with the gender gap in the labor market in a manner consistent with the results of my experiment...|$|E
40|$|Modern democracies {{are built}} on an edifice of <b>competition</b> <b>and</b> {{information}} asymmetry, yet citizens must remain uncertain about the preferences of those they rely upon.

We describe a game-theoretic laboratory experiment in which subjects play an information transmission game with two senders who have private information about their preferences. Although we find support for many equilibrium predictions, we also observe that senders “overjam, ” exaggerating {{even when they are}} predicted to tell the truth. Overjamming can be explained by a bounded rationality framework in which senders choose messages based on experience within the experiment, exaggerating more when they have observed their opponents exaggerate more previously. Our results suggest that jamming and the resulting polarization of competing messages may be persistent features of political discourse featuring <b>competition</b> <b>and</b> <b>preference</b> uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|In many animals, {{body size}} plays {{a crucial role}} in mating success in the context of <b>competition</b> <b>and</b> <b>preference</b> for mates. Increasing {{evidence}} has shown that male mate preference can be size-dependent and, therefore, an important driver of size-assortative mating. To test this theory, mate choice experiments were performed during the three consecutive stages of mating behaviour, namely trail following, shell mounting and copulation, in the dioecious mangrove snail, Littoraria ardouiniana. These experiments identified two possible forms of size-dependent male mate preference which could contribute to the formation of size-assortative mating in these snails. Firstly, whereas small males were unselective, large males were selective and preferred to follow mucus trails laid by large females. Alternatively, the results can also be interpreted as all males were selective and adopted a mating strategy of selecting females similar to, or larger than, their own sizes. Both small and large males also copulated for longer with large than with small females, and this was more pronounced in large males. When two males encountered a female, they engaged in physical aggression, with the larger male excluding the smaller male from copulating with the female. This study, therefore, demonstrated that size-dependent male mate preference may, along with male–male competition, {{play an important role in}} driving size-assortative mating in these mangrove snails, and this may also be the case in other species that exhibit male mate choice...|$|R

40|$|A {{pronounced}} {{cycle of}} car {{sales in the}} 1950 s is {{explained in terms of}} styling <b>competition</b> <b>and</b> consumer <b>preferences.</b> An oligopolistic industry concentrated on non-price <b>competition,</b> <b>and</b> responded to perceived consumer demand for styling and status, with an accelerated product cycle. Demand was shifting from higher price-and-status models, to the feature-loaded high end of 'low-price' models. This suggests a consumer preference for sensual gratification rather than status. But feature competition was eventually constrained by the physical limitations of car size and power, which created a competitive impasse. Upwards feature drift also opened up a gap at the bottom of market. This gap was invaded by imports. Consumer feature fatigue was expressed in buyers' strike in 1958, but Detroit responded nimbly with the new compacts in 1959.

This research examines with a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) the conditions, including gender, that relate to <b>competition</b> <b>preferences</b> <b>and</b> the different paths {{that may lead to}} a decision to enter competition. The results of the economic experiment show that no single condition but combinations of characteristics explain preferences for competition. Furthermore, results show that experience in competitive sports relates to a higher self-confidence and increases the willingness to enter in competitive systems. Interestingly, one of the causal paths leading to enter competition is being a risk-averse woman with experience in competitive sports.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of species {{has long been}} a central concern of ecology and evolutionary biology. Contemporary patterns of plant assemblies suggest that sexual interactions among species, i. e., reproductive interference, lead to the exclusive distributions of closely related species that share pollinators. However, the fitness consequences and the initial ecological/evolutionary responses to reproductive interference remain unclear in nature, since reproductive isolation or allopatric distribution has already been achieved in the natural community. In Japan, three species of blue-eyed grasses (Sisyrinchium) with incomplete reproductive isolation have recently colonized and occur sympatrically. Two of them are monomorphic with white flowers, whereas the other exhibits heritable color polymorphism (white and purple morphs). Here we investigated the effects of the presence of two monomorphic species on the distribution and reproductive success of color morphs. The frequency and reproductive success of white morphs decreased in area where monomorphic species were abundant, while those of purple morphs did not. The rate of hybridization between species was higher in white morphs than in the purple ones. Resource <b>competition</b> <b>and</b> habitat <b>preference</b> seemed not to contribute to the spatial distribution and reproductive success of two morphs.

40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{is common}} in polygynous species, and there is clear evidence that both intra-sexual <b>competition</b> <b>and</b> female <b>preferences</b> can drive the evolution of large body size in males. In contrast, sexual monomorphism is often argued to reflect a relaxation of male mate competition or an intensification of resource competition among females. Alternatively, it might imply opportunities for females to circumvent or counteract male mate competition in a polygynandrous mating system. We test the prediction that sexual monorphism is associated with polygynandry in the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu, Tayassuidae), a social ungulate {{closely related to the}} old-world suids. The genetic mating system in the Tayassuidae is unknown, but its sexual monomorphism presents a striking contrast to the strong size dimorphism found in most Suidae, so that a departure from the polygynous system common in Suidae would be noteworthy. We characterized genetic relationships among adults within herds in three geographically distinct populations, assigned parents to 75 offspring, and tested for skew in individual reproductive success. Parentage assignment data indicated that multiple males sire offspring within a herd, and in the population for which genetic data were most complete, 19 % of parentage assignments were potentially sired by extra-herd males. Some litters have multiple sires, and neither males nor females monopolized reproduction, even in small herds. This result supports our prediction and suggests that sexual monomorphism may either select for or be an evolutionary consequence of a promiscuous mating system...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{computer}} model for how two different chemical catalysts in solution, A and B, could be driven to form AB complexes, based on the concentration gradients of a substrate or product that they share in common. If A's product is B's substrate, B will be attracted to A, mediated by a common resource that is not otherwise plentiful in the environment. By this simple physicochemical mechanism, chemical reactions could spontaneously associate to become chained together in solution. According to the model, such catalyst self-association processes may resemble other processes of "stochastic innovation," such as Darwinian evolution in biology, that involve a search among options, a selection among those options, and then a lock-in of that selection. Like Darwinian processes, this simple chemical process exhibits cooperation, <b>competition,</b> innovation, <b>and</b> a <b>preference</b> for consistency.

The strong <b>competition</b> <b>and</b> changing purchasing <b>preferences</b> should motivate the transport, forwarding and logistics sector managers to apply the marketing approach in practice. 	Methods: Results of direct research, conducted among a targeted group of 100 companies from the transport, forwarding and logistics sector, constitute the source basis. The sample group was divided into three categories of logistics providers: 2 PL, 3 PL and 4 PL. The statistical analysis was based on three different non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square and V Kramer). 	 Results and conclusions:  Currently, marketing does not {{play a key role in}} the activity of logistics services providers. The prevailing opinion is that importance of marketing in the company is average. The respondents have assessed in a similar way their activity compared to the activities of the competition. However, it was found that with the increase of the level of specialization (2 PL- 4 PL), the awareness of impact of marketing on the logistics services sector also increased.

40|$|About three {{quarters}} of human emerging infectious diseases are caused by zoonotic pathogens, {{and many of them}} are spread by vectors such as mosquitoes. Mathematical models nowadays represent very powerful tools to make investigations and predictions for biological dynamical systems, providing helpful insights that can be extremely valuable for several aims. In this thesis, we will focus on a particular mosquito-borne zoonosis, West Nile virus (WNV), a flavivirus of emerging public health relevance in Europe and North America, and its main European vector, Culex pipiens mosquitoes. As the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases is largely driven by the abundance of the vector, to design appropriate control strategies it is crucial to understand the population dynamics of existing vector populations and evaluate how it depends on biotic and environmental factors. This thesis presents some new mathematical models that provide insights on several aspects of mosquito population dynamics by using different statistical and computational approaches, including for instance Linear Models and Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. Specifically, they aim to study the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on Cx. pipiens dynamics by using adult mosquito trapping data, gathered over several years in Northern Italy, to feed theoretical models.

40|$|The US Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} {{are intended to}} influence automaker vehicle design and pricing choices. CAFE policy has been in effect {{for the past three}} decades, and new legislation has raised standards significantly. We present a structural analysis of automaker responses to generic CAFE policies. We depart from prior CAFE analyses by focusing on vehicle design responses in long-run oligopolistic equilibrium, and we view vehicles as differentiated products, taking demand as a general function of price and product attributes. We find that under general cost, demand, and performance functions, single-product profit maximizing firm responses to CAFE standards follow a distinct pattern: firms ignore CAFE when the standard is low, treat CAFE as a vehicle design constraint for moderate standards, and violate CAFE when the standard is high. Further, the point and extent of first violation depends upon the penalty for violation, and the corresponding vehicle design is independent of further standard increases. Thus, increasing CAFE standards will eventually have no further impact on vehicle design if the penalty for violation is also not increased. We implement a case study by incorporating vehicle physics simulation, vehicle manufacturing and technology cost models, and a mixed logit demand model to examine equilibrium powertrain design and price decisions for a fixed vehicle body. Results indicate that equilibrium vehicle design is not bound by current CAFE standards, and vehicle design decisions are directly determined by market <b>competition</b> <b>and</b> consumer <b>preferences.</b> We find that with increased fuel economy standards, a higher violation penalty than the current stagnant penalty is needed to cause firms to increase their design fuel economy at equilibrium. However, the maximum attainable improvement can be modest even if the penalty is doubled. We also find that firms' design responses are more sensitive to variation in fuel prices than to CAFE standards, within the examined ranges.

Although focus groups—small group discussions led by a moderator—have been used in fields such as marketing research and sociology for many years, only in {{the past decade or so}} have politicians begun frequently employing this qualitative methodology. According to accounts in the popular media, focus groups are commonplace in campaigns, but this research indicates that is not the case. Instead, focus groups are relied upon a great deal in presidential elections, but much less so in U. S. senate races, and hardly at all in campaigns for the U. S. House of Representatives. Moreover, the decision to use focus groups depends largely on the size of the campaign, the degree of <b>competition,</b> <b>and</b> the personal <b>preferences</b> of politicians <b>and</b> advisors. These conclusions were reached after conducting interviews with federal politicians, their staffs, consultants, political operatives, and observers of federal politics. Additionally, books and articles chronicling various campaigns were also drawn upon. In essence, focus groups are simply a systematic way to obtain constituent input, not vastly different from discussions politicians routinely have with voters. Moreover, while focus groups can provide information helpful to determining how to communicate with voters, it is not essential for success even at the presidential level.

40|$|We study a {{generalized}} Hotelling duopoly {{in which a}} consumer's net utility from a product depends on the location of product and consumer in product attribute space, a random utility term that captures idiosyncratic <b>preferences,</b> <b>and</b> {{the price of the}} product. Our model allows us to vary the relative impact of product attribute preferences (i. e., location) <b>and</b> idiosyncratic <b>preferences</b> on consumer utility. Since the model is analytically intractable, we computationally study equilibria under both simultaneous location and sequential location by the two. rms, with prices decided simultaneously after locations have been chosen. In our numerical analysis, the simultaneous game admits only symmetric equilibria. If product attribute preferences are weak (i. e., distance costs are unimportant) <b>and</b> idiosyncratic <b>preferences</b> are also weak, both. rms locate in the interior of the feasible location space. With strong product attribute <b>preferences</b> <b>and</b> weak idiosyncratic <b>preferences,</b> price competition is at its most intense, leading to maximal di. erentiation. As idiosyncratic preferences become more important, price competition is mitigated, leading to both. rms locating at the market center. In the sequential game, we. nd that when product attribute <b>preferences</b> are strong <b>and</b> idiosyncratic <b>preferences</b> are weak, the follower has a strong desire to avoid price <b>competition</b> <b>and</b> the leader experiences a. rst-mover advantage. However, if idiosyncratic preferences are also strong, price competition is somewhat weaker, and the leader cedes a location and pro. t advantage to the follower. If product attribute <b>preferences</b> <b>and</b> idiosyncratic <b>preferences</b> are both weak, maximal di. erentiation results, and entry order is irrelevant. Finally, when idiosyncratic preferences dominate, price competition is a non-issue, and both players locate at the market center. Once again, the order of entry does not matter...|$|R
