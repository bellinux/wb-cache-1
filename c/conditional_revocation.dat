40|$|This paper proposes, for {{the first}} time, the use of re-encryption scheme to improve users privacy in a privacy-enhancing system. Firstly, a secure {{protocol}} to distribute a re-encryption key from a user A to a service provider B, {{with the help of}} n referees, is proposed. Next, this re-encryption key distribution protocol is combined with an existing private credential system to provide a protocol for <b>conditional</b> <b>revocation</b> of private information. This protocol has a strong accountability property with efficient online performance. It does not assume the existence of a single trusted entity. We tolerate up to t dishonest referees (t ≤ n − 1), while A and B are dishonest and do not trust each other...|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} {{mechanisms for}} handover authentication is designing a secure authentication module, and protect users’ privacy information {{when they are}} authenticated by the access points for data access. Further, most existing approaches do not support user revocation. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient authentication protocol named Handauth. Similar to the existing mechanisms but, Handauth provides user authentication and session key establishment. However, compared to other well-known approaches, Handauth not only enjoys both computation and communication efficiency, but also achieves strong user anonymity and untraceablility, forward secure user <b>revocation,</b> <b>conditional</b> privacy-preservation, AAA server anonymity, access service expiration management, access point authentication, easily scheduled revocation, dynamic user revocation and attack resistance.
