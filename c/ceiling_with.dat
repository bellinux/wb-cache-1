5|$|During the {{restoration}} of the casino, a number of historical items were found. Those included newspapers, specifically a copy of Las Últimas Noticias from February 1941, during the time the building served as a hotel; a US telephone battery from 1909; and a tile from the casino's <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> signatures and drawings by casino workers in 1915.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an ornate}} {{semi-circular}} wooden <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> smaller panels along the ridge, moulded ribs and carved bosses, and brattished cornice each side above {{a row of}} little fan-vaults separating seven half-round panels with shield-bearing angels. The ceiling is finely finished with bosses {{at the intersection of}} the moulded principals and purlins. It was inserted in 1882–84.|$|E
5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling of the room {{may have been used}} {{in the construction of the}} canopy of the bed.|$|E

5|$|Dean deduces John's {{message was}} {{coordinates}} {{to where he}} has headed. Sam still {{does not want to}} join the search, so Dean drops him off at his apartment. Lying alone in bed, Sam discovers Jessica pinned to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> a slash across her stomach. She ignites into flames as Dean breaks in and rescues Sam. While firefighters attempt to put out the inferno, Sam decides to join his brother in the search for their father and the creature that killed their mother and Jessica.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 in Lawrence, Kansas, Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) investigates a sound {{coming from}} her infant son Sam's nursery. She sees a figure {{standing}} over his crib, and confronts him. Her husband, John (Morgan), is awoken by her screams and finds her pinned to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> a slash across her stomach. She bursts into flames, and John is forced to evacuate the house with Sam and his older son, Dean, while the house erupts into flames.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} {{were influenced}} by Inigo Jones, but executed by his heir John Webb, a fact confirmed many years later when the National Trust discovered Webb's plans during their formal takeover of the estate. The interiors mostly date from about 1835. The hall has a barrel-vaulted high <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> painted decoration and the dining room has panelled walls, tapestries and a decorated plaster ceiling. The library has a ceiling painting attributed to Guido Reni. The staircase is of white marble with turned balusters and a relief frieze, its ornamented ceiling being attributed to Giorgione.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper level}} {{classrooms}} {{at the ends}} of the east and west wings feature timber arched braced trusses springing from semi-circular impost blocks, diagonally boarded timber <b>ceilings</b> <b>with</b> exposed rafters, and timber cornices with quatrefoil motifs. The four classrooms either side of the Great hall on the upper floor and several on the ground floor have sheeted <b>ceilings</b> <b>with</b> dark timber coverstrips.|$|R
50|$|The Galerie d'Apollon {{is a part}} of the Louvre, {{famous for}} its high vaulted <b>ceilings</b> <b>with</b> painted decorations.|$|R

5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches {{divide the}} nave from the aisles. On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
5|$|The present building, {{dating from}} around 1283 to 1537, mostly {{replaced}} the earlier monastic church founded in 1093 {{which was built}} in the Norman style. It is believed that the newer church was built around the older one. That the few remaining parts of the Norman church are of small proportions, while the height and width of the Gothic church are generous would seem to confirm this belief. Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept, which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to the sacristy, which was formerly a chapel. The transept has retained an early 16th-century coffered <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> decorated bosses, two of which are carved with the arms of HenryVIII and Cardinal Wolsey.|$|E
5|$|The dining room, {{originally}} the library, {{was designed by}} Lewis Wyatt in about 1808. Wyatt extended the room and added a shallow, semi-circular apse at one end. It features decorative plasterwork on both the ceiling and walls, but is largely unadorned. Wyatt implemented a design featuring gilded acanthus leaves and vines on the <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> large-scale egg-and-dart molding around the upper sections of the wall, scagiola columns and a black marble fireplace with bronze ornamentation. Wyatt's alteration works at Rode Hall {{are influenced by the}} style of Sir John Soane, and he described his designs for the interiors as an 'experiment in primitive simplicity... At Rode the primitivist intent is emphasized by the total absence of an entablature.' The room is furnished with original pieces of furniture designed and made by the English manufacturer Gillows of Lancaster and London; of note is the mahogany dining-table and the semi-circular sideboard built into the apse. A Royal Crown Derby dinner service, purchased by Mary Wilbraham-Bootle for her son Randle Wilbraham III in 1809, is on display here.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, goths {{decorated}} their {{walls and}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> black fabrics and accessories like rosaries, crosses and plastic roses. Black furniture and cemetery-related objects like candlesticks, death lanterns and skulls. In the 1990s the interior design {{approach of the}} 1980s {{was replaced by a}} less macabre style.|$|E
25|$|On {{the ground}} floor, a {{decorative}} plaster <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> layered and coloured cornice survives in the wedding {{room of the}} register office. That room, like several others, has a large window set back into an arch, as viewed from the interior. Another ground floor room also has a deep, decorative plaster cornice, but no decoration on the ceiling.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} grand salon, {{is decorated}} in paneled <b>ceilings,</b> <b>with</b> two sculpted coat-of-arms: {{one of the}} Canto and the other the Castro families.|$|R
25|$|The {{architecture}} of the trompe-l'oeil dome (illustration, left) seems to erase and raise the <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> such a realistic impression {{that it is difficult}} to distinguish what is real or not. Andrea Pozzo painted this ceiling and trompe-l'oeil dome on a canvas, 17 m wide. The paintings in the apse depict scenes from the life of St. Ignatius, St Francis Xavier and St Francis Borgia.|$|E

25|$|The wall on {{the south}} east (Datchet Road) side of the station forms a long curve, {{parallel}} with the platform, containing a series of arches with depressed heads. This wall links the station proper with the former Royal Waiting Room built for Queen Victoria. This is a small building of main room and ante rooms crowned by a turret with spirelet, and has Tudor arched windows. The interior of the main room has a ribbed <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> a pendant finial.|$|E

50|$|Park Güell (collaboration with Antoni Gaudí), Barcelona, 1911-1913. Decorated {{the benches}} and <b>ceilings</b> <b>with</b> ceramic {{fragments}} (trencadís technique). Possibly created the medallions in the Hypostyle Hall.|$|R
25|$|A Casa de Jantar da Rainha (Queen's Dining Room), {{a private}} {{dining room was}} never planned in the 1802 design of the Palace, but by 1880 {{there was a need}} for a {{communal}} space. The final room was decorated in red silk and rich wood grain trim from floor to <b>ceiling,</b> <b>with</b> a wood fireplace/stove on one wall (surmounted by a large mirror), while the opposite wall provides an entrance to adjacent Billiard Room. The floor is cover in inlaid parquet floor with a bronze lustre.|$|E
25|$|The Church of Nossa Senhora da Vitória (Our Lady of Victory)is a long {{rectangular}} temple grafted {{along one}} wall of the cloister (to {{the right of the}} main entranceway) and is also three-storeys tall. The main chapel, similarly rectangular, but much narrower, is covered in a vaulted <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> a niche located opposite the main entrance. On the nave wall {{on the side of the}} epistle, is the Chapel of Santo António, covered in 16th century azueljos (in blue, yellow and white) with two panels depicting the life of Saint Anthony.|$|E
25|$|Chichester Cathedral {{was built}} to replace the cathedral founded in 681 by St. Wilfrid for the South Saxons at Selsey. The seat of the bishop was {{transferred}} in 1075. It was consecrated in 1108 under Bishop Ralph de Luffa. An early addition was the Chapel of Saint Pantaleon off the south transept (now the Canons' Vestry), probably begun just before an 1187 fire which burnt out the cathedral and destroyed much of the town. That fire necessitated a substantial rebuilding, which included refacing the nave and replacing the destroyed wooden <b>ceiling</b> <b>with</b> the present stone vault, possibly by Walter of Coventry. The cathedral was reconsecrated in 1199.|$|E
50|$|Painted <b>ceilings</b> <b>with</b> mythological {{scenes from}} the Domus Transitoria, the {{earliest}} examples of fourth style painting, perhaps by the painter Fabullus are displayed in the Palatine Antiquarium.|$|R
50|$|The 1899 section has ripple iron ceilings, {{while the}} 1925 section has sheeted <b>ceilings</b> <b>with</b> coverstrips. The {{southern}} rooms have views to the city, Petrie Terrace and Paddington.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{interiors}} of the preserved architectural objects in Macedonia dating from the 19 th and 20 th centuries, shows a very significant presence of the wood-carved <b>ceilings</b> <b>with</b> the highest aesthetic features. The types of ceiling surfaces are derived according to the applied materials, as well as, to the forms of construction. According to the materials used, the rossetes are constitutive elements of wooden ceilings, while, according to the construction form, they belong to the so-calledhigh <b>ceilings</b> <b>with</b> more complex forms and way of execution...|$|R
