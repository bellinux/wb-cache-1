40|$|Software {{systems of}} today are {{frequently}} composed from prefabricated, heterogeneous components that provide complex functionality {{and engage in}} complex interactions. Software architecture research has revealed the importance of component interactions on our ability to perform software composition. Various development organizations have found interaction mismatches to be both difficult and a core issue behind failed software integration efforts. This paper is aimed at improving the understanding of component interactions, embodied {{in the notion of}} software connectors, in order to prevent such failures. Our previous work has resulted in a four-level classification framework for studying the characteristics of connectors. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of software connectors based on the previously published connector classification framework. This taxonomy is used to explain various existing software connectors and study compatibility of <b>connector</b> <b>characteristics,</b> intended to prevent component interaction mismatches. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA stub-girder {{floor system}} is a {{composite}} system constructed from a continuous steel beam and a reinforced concrete slab separated {{by a series of}} short, typically wide, flange sections called stubs. The finite element method has been used in the analysis of this composite system where it is capable to represent the constituent parts, adopt adequate elements and use appropriate solution techniques. As the behavior of stub-girders presents significant nonlinear effects, it is fundamental that the interaction of all different components should be properly modeled as well as the interface behavior. The present work focuses on the modeling of stub-girders with full and partial shear connection in two and three dimensions. The proposed model contains all the main structural parameters and their associated nonlinearities (concrete slab, steel beam, stubs, and shear connectors). In this model, the shear connectors are modeled as springs to consider the geometry of studs in addition to the nonlinearity due to the interaction between the shear connector and the concrete slab. Tests and numerical results available in the literature are used to validate the models. Based on the proposed finite element model, an extensive parametric study of stub-girders is performed, considering the material properties, relative dimensions and shear <b>connector</b> <b>characteristics,</b> where valuable recommendations and conclusions are achieved...|$|E
40|$|A new small {{circular}} {{patch antenna}} for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications is presented. By studying this structure, it is {{shown that the}} insertion of a slot with the desired length and width in the ground plane, {{can lead to a}} large bandwidth. Our antenna, whose dimensions are 18 × 12 × 1. 58 mm 3, was fed by an SMA female <b>connector</b> with <b>characteristic</b> impedance of 50 Ω in order to measure the return loss and VSWR and to compare them with the simulation results. The bandwidth obtained from measurements ranges from 3. 52 to 13. 67 GHz for VSWR < 2 and from 3. 26 GHzto 14. 23 GHz for VSWR < 3. The radiation pattern is omnidirectional on most of the operating band. High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) was used for simulation whose results are in good agreement with the measured parameters...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that an isolated deck develops horizontal displacements of considerable amplitude during a strong earthquake. In this case the possibility of mobilizing the abutments in moderating such large amplitude horizontal response is beneficial {{for the safety of}} the structure. Thus, apart from lowering the seismic forces by the low-stiffness isolator units, the interaction between the deck and the abutments in the form of pounding for large horizontal deck response amplitudes aims at limiting through this mechanism excessive horizontal deck displacements. Such a problem was examined at the laboratory of Strength of Materials and Structures of Aristotle University using a small-scale physical representation that retains in a qualitative way the following important features: 1. A relatively stiff steel platform, representing the bridge deck, which is supported on a shaking table by two flexible supports, representing the isolator units; it is subjected to simulated horizontal earthquake motions developing large amplitude horizontal displacement response. 2. The possibility of bridge deck pounding on the abutment was introduced through a connector device that became active after the deck response exceeded a certain amplitude, introducing an initial gap within this connector. Despite the fact that these two basic response mechanisms, flexibility of isolator units and <b>connector</b> force-displacement <b>characteristics,</b> are crude small-scale representations of the actual mechanisms that are mobilized in a prototype bridge deck, the qualitative characteristics of this problems are retained. A number of simulated earthquake tests provided the necessary measured acceleration and displacement response of the model steel platform of the small-scale model and the force-displacement response of the connector and the flexible supports of the steel platform with the shaking table. This was next utilized to validate numerical simulations of this small-scale experimental representation of the bridge-deck pounding problem. By comparing the numerical predictions with the measured response of this small-scale experimental representation of the bridge-deck pounding problem it can be concluded that such numerical simulations can yield quite accurate predictions provided that the force-displacement characteristics of the isolator units as well as the force-displacement characteristics of the mechanism representing the bridge deck-abutment pounding are defined with reasonable accuracy for the prototype bridge...|$|R
40|$|To {{enable the}} next {{generation}} subsea boosting and processing facilities, high power electrical connectors are strongly needed and {{considered one of the}} most critical components of the system. Electrical tree growth is a precursor to electrical breakdown in high voltage insulation materials. Therefore, the study of the tree growth dependency with hydrostatic pressure is needed to understand the behaviour of the insulation material used in subsea connectors. Silicone rubber (SiR) is used as an insulation material for these applications thanks to its higher viscosity characteristic in comparison with other solid insulation materials used in subsea cables. This property is the main factor that allows the water to be swiped off the connector when a receptacle is mated into the plug of a subsea connector. In addition, the silicone rubber must provide similar electric field control as other insulation materials used in cable terminations and <b>connectors.</b> The <b>characteristics</b> of partial discharges generated during the electrical tree growth and the light emission from the partial discharge pulses, have been studied under different pressure conditions. SiR samples, with a needle to plate electrode configuration, have been put into a pressure vessel to grow the electrical tree in the material under high hydrostatic pressure conditions. The electrical tree growth has been divided in three stages (initiation, intermediate and final or pre-breakdown stage) and tests have been performed at 1, 20 and 60 bar. A digital NIKON camera and a CCD camera have been used, both attached to a long-distance microscope, to observe in real time the tree growth and light emission, respectively. Pictures showed a higher growth speed for the electric tree as voltage and pressure were increased. The length of electrical trees pre-grown at lower pressures collapsed faster as the pressure increased, than those pre-grown at higher pressures under the same pressure increasing conditions. As the pressure increased, Pulse Sequence Analysis performed to the partial discharges measured confirmed the partial discharge inception and extinction voltage increase and showed a polarity dependency to space charge generation in addition to other patterns regarding the charge magnitude and phase of occurrence characteristics. Pressure vessel internal reflections have suggested changes to be done in future studies for the light emission measurement. Finally, partial discharge patterns from the electrical tree growth process have been identified to be characteristics from void faults in the dielectric with a spherical void shape.
