40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} very simple reduced {{abstract}} model {{of the behavior of}} the EDCA (Enhanced Distributed <b>Channel</b> <b>Access)</b> <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> with respect to an access category under saturation. This model is derived from a Markov chain model of EDCA using reduction techniques. Closed-form expressions of common performance metrics (i. e. mean throughput, mean access delay and packet drop probability of an access category) are given and insight into the potential applications of this model are briefly presented...|$|R
40|$|With fast {{deployment}} of wireless local area networks (WLANs), {{the ability of}} WLAN to support real time services with stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements has come into fore. In this paper, we evaluate the capability of QoS support in the IEEE 802. 11 e standard, which is the medium access control (MAC) enhancements for QoS support in 802. 11. Both the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) and the polling based <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> <b>modes</b> are evaluated, and their performance under real time audio and video traffic is shown through simulations. We find that EDCA provides satisfactory service differentiation among its four access categories...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a new pointer-based medium-access control protocol {{that was designed to}} significantly improve the energy efficiency of user terminals in quality-of-service-enabled wireless local area networks was analysed. The new protocol, pointer- controlled slot allocation and resynchronisation protocol (PCSARe), is based on the hybrid coordination function-controlled <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> of the IEEE 802. 11 e standard. PCSARe reduces energy consumption by removing the need for power-saving stations to remain awake for channel listening. Discrete event network simulations were performed to compare the {{performance of}} PCSARe with the non-automatic power save delivery (APSD) and scheduled-APSD power- saving modes of IEEE 802. 11 e. The simulation results show a demonstrable improvement in energy efficiency without significant reduction in performance when using PCSARe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we present a {{comprehensive}} survey on the architecture, protocol issues, and standard of the hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) networks which are evolving from the existing residential CATV networks. We first describe the HFC architecture and discuss the problems in providing two-way communication. Then, we identify three important medium access control (MAC) issues in designing the IEEE 802. 14 standard; namely, synchronization, upstream <b>channel</b> <b>access</b> <b>modes,</b> and collision resolution. Resolutions adopted by the IEEE 802. 14 Committee are illustrated after giving a protocol overview. Key resolutions include compensating round trip correction (RTC), interleaving minislots of data and request concurrently, and resolving collisions by multiple collision resolution engines, using the n-ary tree plus p-persistence algorithm with a first transmission rule. A comparative summary of some draft proposals {{that lead to the}} standard is given. Finally, we pinpoint two headend algori [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In our {{previous}} publication, {{a framework for}} information flow in interaction networks based on random walks with damping was formulated with two fundamental modes: emitting and absorbing. While many other network analysis methods based on random walks or equivalent notions have been developed before and after our earlier work, one can show that they can all be mapped {{to one of the}} two modes. In addition to these two fundamental modes, a major strength of our earlier formalism was its accommodation of context-specific directed information flow that yielded plausible and meaningful biological interpretation of protein functions and pathways. However, the directed flow from origins to destinations was induced via a potential function that was heuristic. Here, with a theoretically sound approach called the <b>channel</b> <b>mode,</b> we extend our earlier work for directed information flow. This is achieved by constructing a potential function facilitating a purely probabilistic interpretation of the <b>channel</b> <b>mode.</b> For each network node, the <b>channel</b> <b>mode</b> combines the solutions of emitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a channel tensor. The entries of the channel tensor at each node can be interpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a destination. Similarly to our earlier model, the <b>channel</b> <b>mode</b> encompasses damping as a free parameter that controls the locality of information flow. Through examples involving the yeast pheromone response pathway, we illustrate the versatility and stability of our new framework. Comment: Minor changes from v 3. 30 pages, 7 figures.
