40|$|The rate {{at which}} the Earth’s surface {{receives}} high-utility energy from the Sun is 11, 000 times as great as the {{rate at which}} humans <b>use</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>energy.</b> Despite this, 88 percent of the <b>commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>used</b> comes from non-renewable, fossil-fuel sources. Fossil fuel use each year adds 3 percent more carbon-dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove. The task for humans is to find ways to obtain utility from a greater portion of solar radiation. The one natural process that achieves this goal is photosynthesis, which is neutral to carbon-dioxide accumulation and which provides all the human food on Earth. Past efforts to enhance the productivity of human-managed photosynthesis systems have involved energy inputs in non-solar forms – mainly from fossil fuel sources – causing such systems to be non-sustainable from the long-term perspective. There exist both technological and sociological opportunities to make non-fossil-fuel energy more economically feasible. These include accounting systems that link costs associated with atmospheric pollution avoidance and with natural capital depletion, to the market prices of fossil fuels, and also include the use of information-intensive processes (so that less energy of any type is needed) to manage high-productivity photosynthetic systems. The long-term goal is to bring high productivity achievement to all the World’s citizens, while <b>using</b> sustainable <b>energy</b> forms. This productivity level is expected to be associated with reduced rates of population increase and with increased attention to global pollution reduction. Resumen...|$|R

This paper identifies diverse data sources to assess GHG emission from community-wide infrastructure footprints (CIF) in four Chinese cities of varying population (1 to 20 million people) and administrative levels: Yixing, Qinhuangdao, Xiamen and Beijing. CIF addresses seven infrastructure sectors providing energy (fuels/coal), electricity, water supply and wastewater treatment, transportation, municipal waste management, construction materials, and food to support urban activities. Industrial energy use dominates the infrastructure GHG CIF in all four cities, ranging from 76 % of total CIF in Yixing to 30 % in Beijing, followed by residential energy use (6 – 13 %), transportation (4 – 12 %), <b>commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> (2 – 25 %), food (6 – 11 %), cement use (3 – 8 %) and water (about 1 %), thereby identifying priorities for low-carbon infrastructure development. Trans-boundary footprint contributions ranged from 31 % (Beijing) to 8 % (Qinhuangdao), indicating that supply chains to cities are important. GHGs from energy use are dominated by electricity (35 – 45 %) and non-electricity coal use (30 – 50 %).

40|$|The flux of {{heat from}} human {{activities}} such as <b>commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> renewable source combustion, and the human metabolism has been incorporated into a variable resolution global weather forecast model, along with improved urban surface roughness and radiative properties. Sensitivity studies of these changes were used {{to show that the}} addition of anthropogenic heat improves the accuracy of surface air temperature forecasts. The addition of urban surface radiative properties has a secondary effect on the forecast temperature, and the addition of urban surface roughness changes has a minimal effect. Comparisons between observed and forecast boundary layer heights suggest that this parameter is poorly predicted by the model employed here, but that the impact of anthropogenic heating {{is likely to be a}} substantial increase in PBL heights over urban regions. Decreased atmospheric stability is also evidenced by comparisons of the diffusion constants for heat and moisture between the original and modified models, which show increases from a factor of 2 to a factor of 16 near the surface, depending on the size of the city. An examination of the effects of spatial averaging on heat flux suggests that significant sub-gridscale anthropogenic heating effects may occur, and implies that the results of the current simulations represent lower bounds. The simulations suggest that anthropogenic heat flux has a large local impact, with important implications for simulations of air-quality and radiative balance on regional and global scales...|$|E

40|$|With rapid {{economic}} growth, total energy demand in rural China {{has increased dramatically}} and its structure is in the transition from non-commercial to commercial energy. At the same time, {{it is also expected}} that households in rural areas will face energy shortage and causes more environmental problems without having more access to renewable energy technologies. However, little is still known about (i) the transition of the energy use and (ii) whether the technologies introduced have been effective or not. To analyze these issues, we have estimated energy demands of rural households by utilizing a survey data taken from Beijing's ten suburban districts. The data contains the information of both non-commercial and <b>commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> key characteristics of the households and several renewable energy technologies. Our empirical analysis reveals three main results. First, the per capita income is a key factor to per capita energy consumption. More speci cally, a rise in per capita coal consumption strongly diminishes as per capita income increases. Second, coal and LPG prices do not exhibit any substitution effect, but an increase in these prices has strong negative effects on their own energy use. Third, the renewable energy technologies are identi ed to reduce the coal consumption and induce more energy efficiency. Overall, these ndings suggest a positive perspective: if the Chinese government could appropriately design policies associated with renewable energy technologies and with the related energy price controls, then coal consumption will be induced to decline in the near future and the substitution effects to cleaner energy use will speed up. This implies that the smooth energy transition in rural China can be made in more environmentally sustainable manners...|$|E

This study aims to analyze the effect that internalizing these externalities {{in the cost of}} energy would have on the US energy system, emissions, and human health. In this study, we model different policy scenarios in which fees are added to emissions related to generation and use of energy. The fees are based on values of damages estimated in the literature and are applied to upstream and combustion emissions related to electricity generation, industrial energy use, transportation energy use, residential energy use, and <b>commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> The energy sources and emissions are modeled through 2055 in five-year time steps. The emissions in 2045 are incorporated into a continental-scale atmospheric chemistry and transport model, CMAQ, to determine the change in air quality due to different emissions reduction scenarios. A benefit analysis tool, BenMAP, is used with the air quality results to determine the monetary benefit of emissions reductions related to the improved air quality. We apply fees to emissions associated with health impacts, climate change, and a combination of both. We find that the fees we consider lead to reductions in targeted emissions as well as co-reducing non-targeted emissions. For fees on the electric sector alone, health impacting pollutant (HIP) emissions reductions are achieved mainly through control devices while Greenhouse Gas (GHG) fees are addressed through changes in generation technologies. When sector specific fees are added, reductions come mainly from the industrial and electricity generation sectors, and are achieved through a mix of energy efficiency, increased use of renewables, and control devices. Air quality is improved in almost all areas of the country with fees, including when only GHG fees are applied. Air quality tends to improve more in regions with larger emissions reductions, especially for PM 2. 5...|$|E
40|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> in Arizona is {{different}} from the rest of the United States because of their high demand for air conditioning. Nearly half of the energy used in commercial buildings goes to heating, cooling, and ventilation. In an attempt to reduce overall every use in buildings, looking at these categories led to an examination of ventilation in buildings, which is the main cause for high heating and cooling costs. Ventilation of fresh air is required in order to provide a safe, healthy environment, with acceptable indoor air quality. Indoor air quality and pollution has continuously come to light as a major health concern for building occupants. Chemicals used in manufacturing allow consumers to buy and expose themselves to toxic substances such as volatile organic compounds on a daily basis. With minimal regulations on indoor air, it is important to find ways to better filter and clean it. The traditional solution is ventilation, but more fresh air ventilation means more heating and cooling. This paper explores the research that has been done on plants and phytoremediation and the applicability to indoor air quality. With the proof that certain combinations and amounts of plants can filter the air of volatile organic compounds, systems are explored for indoor air filtration instead of mechanical ventilation. This type of system can greatly reduce heating and cooling costs in buildings due to the reduction of outdoor air being brought in and requiring conditioning. A system of this type is a feasible solution to indoor air quality and can lead to a significant reduction in energy use. The proposed AIRMAPS is a system that in certain quantities can reduce the need for fresh air ventilation by 25 %, which in turn has shown through the validation by eQUEST, that the energy used for heating, cooling, and ventilation fans can also be reduced by approximately the same amount. The plants used are spider plant, dumb cane, English ivy, and golden pothos. The average formaldehyde removal by each of these plants is a low approximation of 75 % per cubic meter.

However, suffice it to state that there is a strong feedback relationshipbetween the energy sector and the national economy. Energy demand, supply and pricing haveenormous impact on social and economic development and the living standards and overall qualityof life of the population. On the other hand the economic structure and the changes in that structureas well as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions are key determinants of energy demand andsupply. Furthermore, energy affects environmental quality through deforestation associated withunsustainable biomass energy dependence and greenhouse gas emission from fossil fuel use resultingin global warming. Prior to 1973, the rate at which energy consumption increased closely followed the rate atwhich the economy expanded. Rapid economic growth and steadily rising income and higher livingstandards combined with the long term declining trend in energy prices to produce rapidly risingglobal energy demand. Until the emergence of the high cost energy era in the post 1973 era,relatively cheap and abundant energy was a key feature of rapid industrialization and economicprogress. Indeed, <b>commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> remains a key factor in human development. This is despitethe global de-coupling of energy demand-economic growth relationship in the post – 1970 period,triggered by the onset of a new era of more expensive energy associated with the quadrupling of oilprice increases between 1973 and 1974, and further price escalation in 1979 and 1980. Beyond the low level of energy consumption per capita, and unsustainable over-dependenceon bio-mass (wood-fuel), Africa is faced with enormous problems in the quest for sustainableenergy development. For the purpose of addressing these problems effectively, we can summarizethe fundamental energy question facing Africa as: providing and maintaining widespread access ofthe population to reliable and affordable supplies of environmentally cleaner energy to meet therequirements of rapid economic growth and improved living standards. Two sets of factors complicatethe solutions to this critical question. First is the difficult initial energy and economic conditions inmuch of the region. These are broadly defined by the significant deterioration in energy infrastructure,inadequate and unreliable supply of commercial energy to end users despite the enormous untappedenergy resources in the region, and significant inefficiency in energy use. The energy constraints havebeen exacerbated by difficult domestic economic and social conditions. These are defined broadly by, low per capita income, high incidence of poverty, weak economic growth and growth collapsein several cases, stagnating or declining investment (energy inclusive) and weak though improvingdomestic macroeconomic conditions, social conflict and weak governance in public enterprises incharge of energy. Second, there is the global pressure driven by sustainable human development totackle the increasingly significant adverse local, regional and global environmental impact of energysector development. This will accelerate the demand for cleaner energy and the associated energyresource development. The search for a sustainable energy sector development will therefore remainan important issue in Africa {{as well as in the}} rest of the world. The paper presents a broad butsystematic discussion of the main issues concerning sustainable energy development in Africa. The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2 the socio-economic context of theproblem is discussed. In section 3 we present an overview of the developments in the energy sectorin the post 1970 period with emphasis on the sub-regional perspective. This is followed by ananalysis of the constraints to energy sector development in section 4. The paper explores some ofthe key issues and strategies for achieving the goal of sustainable energy development in Africa insection 5. The conclusions are presented in section 6. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>use</b> {{monitoring}} {{projects for}} commercial buildings must be carefully configured and managed to assure useful data products are produced in a timely and cost-effective manner. Many challenges associated with site selection, data definition, hardware installation, and quality assurance should be addressed before monitoring is attempted. This presentation describes our experience with these challenges and offers advice for those considering the monitoring of buildings in hot and humid climates. Over one hundred commercial buildings have been instrumented by Pacific Northwest Laboratory to provide an empirical basis for utility end-use load forecasting and conservation assessment. For the largest project, The End-Use Load and Consumer Assessment Program (ELCAP), specific protocols were developed for management, initial site inspection, measurement plan development, characteristics data collection, equipment installation, and data collection and verification. The purpose and general structure of these protocols will be described, and our experiences with their application will be shared {{in the hope that}} others undertaking <b>commercial</b> building <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> monitoring projects can benefit...|$|R
40|$|Measured {{energy savings}} promote and sustain energy {{conservation}} retrofits by verifying {{the success of}} retrofits, determining pay-back schedules, guiding the selection of future retrofits and identifying opportunities for further savings. This dissertation develops a methodology to measure retrofit energy savings and {{the uncertainty of the}} savings in commercial buildings. The functional forms of empirical models of cooling and heating <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> in <b>commercial</b> buildings are derived from an engineering analysis of constant-air-volume and variable-air-volume HVAC systems. One, two, three and four parameter, temperature-dependent regression models are proposed to model baseline <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> Retrofit savings are measured as the difference between the baseline <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> project by the models and the measured post-retrofit <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> A hybrid ordinary least squares/autoregressive method is developed to determine the uncertainty of the predicated <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> and savings. The annual predictive ability of models based on pre-retrofit data sets of less than a full year is investigated. The energy delivery efficiency is introduced to measure the efficiency of air-side systems at meeting the net building load. A preliminary investigation of the use of artificial neural network models to measure savings is presented. The methodology is demonstrated on case study examples using software specifically developed for the analysis of <b>commercial</b> building <b>energy</b> <b>use...</b>|$|R
