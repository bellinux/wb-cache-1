40|$|The use of {{rotation}} {{numbers in the}} classification of regular <b>closed</b> <b>curves</b> in the plane up to regular homotopy sparked the investigation of winding numbers to classify regular <b>closed</b> <b>curves</b> on other surfaces. Chillingworth [1] defined winding numbers for regular <b>closed</b> <b>curves</b> on particular surfaces and used them to classify orientation preserving regular <b>closed</b> <b>curves</b> that are based at a fixed point and direction. We define geometrically a group structure of the set of equivalence classes of regular <b>closed</b> <b>curves</b> based at a fixed point and direction. We prove this group structure coincides with the one introduced by Smale [9] via a weak homotopy equivalence. The set of equivalence classes of orientation preserving regular <b>closed</b> <b>curves</b> is a subgroup. This thesis investigates the relationship between this subgroup and the winding number of each element. Specifically, it is proven that this subgroup is isomorphic to the direct product of the integers with the group of orientation preserving <b>closed</b> <b>curves</b> up to homotopy where the isomorphism sends an equivalence class to its winding number and corresponding homotopy class. Using this result, we describe the subgroup for several surfaces by depicting representatives of generators...|$|R

5|$|The {{circle is}} the only simple <b>closed</b> <b>curve</b> that {{maintains}} its shape under the curve-shortening flow, but some curves that cross themselves or have infinite length keep their shape, including the grim reaper curve, an infinite curve that translates upwards, and spirals that rotate while remaining {{the same size and}} shape.|$|E
5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple <b>closed</b> <b>curve</b> move in this way, the curve remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous curve evolution. If the curve is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple <b>closed</b> <b>curve</b> can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E

5|$|For {{a simple}} <b>closed</b> <b>curve,</b> using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{estimate}} {{from below}} {{the number of}} lines meeting each of given 4 disjoint smooth <b>closed</b> <b>curves</b> in a given cyclic order in the real projective 3 -space and in a given linear order in R 3. Similarly, we estimate the number of circles meeting in a given cyclic order given 6 disjoint smooth <b>closed</b> <b>curves</b> in Euclidean 3 -space. The estimations are formulated in terms of linking numbers of the curves and obtained by orienting of the corresponding configuration spaces and evaluating of their signatures. This involves a study of a surface swept by lines meeting 3 given disjoint smooth <b>closed</b> <b>curves</b> and a surface swept in the 3 -space by circles meeting 5 given disjoint smooth <b>closed</b> <b>curves.</b> Higher dimensional generalizations of these results are outlined.
