5000|$|Malmesbury {{specialised}} in the top-secret {{development and}} production of the new radar systems {{as part of the}} [...] "Western Development Unit". Radar equipment produced at Malmesbury during the war included the AI Mk. IV and AI Mk. VIII <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> radars, and the ASV Mk. II air to surface vessel radar.|$|R
50|$|An air-to-air rocket or <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> rocket is an unguided {{projectile}} {{fired from}} aircraft to engage other flying targets. They were used briefly in World War I to engage enemy observation balloons and in and after World War II to engage enemy bombers. Fighters were too maneuverable to be effectively engaged with rockets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{squadron}} conducted <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> training missions {{with its}} F-51s until June 1952 {{when it was}} re-equipped with the F-86F Sabre daylight interceptor. [...] On 1 November 1952, the 123rd was released back to the Oregon ANG and its personnel, mission and equipment were absorbed by the newly activated 357th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron.|$|R
50|$|During WestPac in 1955, the {{squadron}} {{was part of}} the Navy's support of the evacuation of the Tachen Islands which were under bombardment by People's Republic of China forces. After returning from this cruise, {{the squadron}} re-equipped with the F7U Cutlass and its role was changed from <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> to ground attack with special weapons.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, the 415th Night Fighter Squadron was {{activated}} on 10 February 1943. At that time, {{the squadron}} {{was assigned to}} the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics for training in the P-70 fighter, a converted A-20 Havoc light bomber. That training included daylight and night <b>air</b> <b>interception,</b> ground-controlled interception, navigation, and instrument flying.|$|R
2500|$|Canada was {{the first}} export {{customer}} for the Hornet, replacing the CF-104 Starfighter (air reconnaissance and strike), the McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo (<b>air</b> <b>interception)</b> and the CF-116 Freedom Fighter (ground attack). The Canadian Forces Air Command ordered 98 A models (Canadian designation CF-188A/CF-18A) and 40 B models (designation CF-188B/CF-18B). [...] The original CF-18 as delivered is largely identical to the F/A-18A and B models.|$|R
50|$|Snell {{returned}} to Britain {{during the summer}} of 1942 and joined No. 242 Squadron RAF flying Spitfires. In October 1942 his unit was transferred to North Africa to provide air cover for the Operation Torch landings. For the rest of 1942 and into early 1943, Snell's squadron provided <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> and ground attack sorties in support of the British First Army as it drove towards Tunis.|$|R
2500|$|... 1942 {{also saw}} the {{manufacture}} of twelve Hurricane II C(NF) night fighters, equipped with pilot-operated <b>Air</b> <b>Interception</b> Mark VI radar. After a brief operational deployment with No. 245 and No. 247 Squadron RAF during which these aircraft proved too slow for operations in Europe, the aircraft were sent to India to serve with No. 176 Squadron RAF in the defence of Calcutta. They were withdrawn from service {{at the end of}} December 1943.|$|R
50|$|Despite the problems, the Navy ordered 239 F3H-2s, and {{the first}} were {{deployed}} in March 1956. 519 Demons were built {{up to the end}} of production in November 1959. It was not the Navy's first all-weather interceptor with radar (the AN/APG-51 <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> set was used first on the F2H-4 Banshee). The F3H-2 Demon had the AN/APG-51A, later upgraded to the 51-B version with a tunable magnetron then on to 51-C with better counter-measures in the receiver.|$|R
50|$|This eventuality {{had already}} been foreseen, and a {{successful}} programme by Edward George Bowen starting in 1936 developed a miniaturized RDF system suitable for aircraft, the <b>Air</b> <b>Interception</b> (AI) set. (Watson-Watt called the CH sets the RDF-1 and the AI the RDF-2A.) At the same time, Bowen developed AI sets for aircraft to detect submarines, the Air to Surface Vessel (ASV) set was also developed, making {{a significant contribution to}} the Battle of the Atlantic defeat of the German U-boats.|$|R
5000|$|FuG 224 Berlin A, and the {{contemporary}} FuG 240 Berlin N1 or Nachtjagd <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> radar, both {{made use of}} captured examples of the British cavity magnetron in the H2S radar. A H2S-equipped Short Stirling bomber had crashed near Rotterdam {{on the night of}} 2 February 1943. This led to H2S being given the German codename Rotterdam Gerät. Telefunken were instructed to examine the wreckage and build six replicas of it. This study also {{led to the development of}} the Naxos radar detector against it.> ...|$|R

500|$|Early {{development}} {{was prompted by}} a 1936 memo of Henry Tizard {{on the topic of}} night fighting. The memo was sent to Robert Watt, director of the radar research efforts, who agreed to allow physicist Edward George [...] "Taffy" [...] Bowen to form a team to study the problem of <b>air</b> <b>interception.</b> The team had a test bed system in flights later that year, but progress was delayed for four years by emergency relocations, three abandoned production designs, and Bowen's increasingly adversarial relationship with Watt's replacement, Albert Percival Rowe. Ultimately, Bowen was forced from the team just as the system was finally maturing.|$|R
50|$|Developments also {{continued}} in <b>air</b> <b>interception,</b> and a radar {{with a narrow}} rotating beam and plan-position-indicator (PPI) was developed and used by the RAF to direct fighters in October 1940. Early versions of airborne radar were fitted to Blenheims, but had limited minimum and maximum range. However, {{in the hands of}} skilled crews, later versions in 1941 were remarkably effective, and in the heavy night raids of 1941 radar-equipped fighters were the main weapon of air defence. In May 1941, over 100 enemy aircraft were shot down at night using radar, compared with 30 by anti-aircraft guns.|$|R
50|$|The Venom NF.2 {{was quickly}} {{modified}} after being subject to several accidents in which pilots had trouble making nighttime approaches; changes included {{the adoption of}} jettisonable clear canopies and alterations to the flight control surfaces, the altered aircraft were re-designated as NF.2As. The Venom NF.2 was soon followed by the NF 3, which was the ultimate night fighter variant of the Venom. The NF 3 had further improvements, including power-actuated ailerons and an improved <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> radar. In 1953, the Venom NF 3 performed its first flight; it entered operational service with the RAF during June 1955.|$|R

2500|$|At November 1942 {{meeting of}} the <b>Air</b> <b>Interception</b> Committee, the future of AI radar was {{discussed}} {{with an eye to}} producing a plan for the long-term evolution of the systems. Among many ideas considered, the team chose a number of features they wished to see.

Range was to be extended to at least , with a reduced minimum range of [...] The short minimum range was selected, along with demands for ½degree accuracy dead-ahead, to allow blind firing without visual contact. Other features like lock-follow and accurate range finding were also considered.|$|R

5000|$|The Lichtenstein radar {{was among}} the {{earliest}} airborne radars available to the Luftwaffe in World War II {{and the first one}} used exclusively for <b>air</b> <b>interception.</b> Developed by Telefunken, it was available in at least four major revisions, called FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C, FuG 212 Lichtenstein C-1, FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 and the very rarely used FuG 228 Lichtenstein SN-3. (FuG is short for Funk-Gerät, radio set). The Lichtenstein series remained the only widely deployed airborne interception radar used by the Germans on their night fighters during the war — the competing FuG 216 through 218 Neptun mid-VHF band radar systems were meant as a potentially more versatile stopgap system through 1944, until the microwave-based FuG 240 [...] "Berlin" [...] could be mass-produced; the Berlin system was still being testing when the war ended.|$|R
50|$|The aerial {{sequences}} included footage {{shot from}} accompanying CF-100s and featured five-plane formation flying. Additional footage of rocket firing at the CFB Cold Lake, Alberta, firing range {{was incorporated into}} the story of <b>air</b> defence <b>interceptions.</b> A Royal <b>Air</b> Force Vickers Valiant bomber is also briefly seen in the film.|$|R
50|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of real jets and weapons from the era, which can be employed in various mission types such as Combat <b>Air</b> Patrol, <b>Interception,</b> Close <b>Air</b> Support, Escort, Defense Suppression, and Reconnaissance.The game is based on the Strike Fighters engine and was developed by Third Wire Productions.|$|R
5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the <b>Air</b> <b>Interception</b> Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|R
5000|$|During the North African Campaign, the Ju 52 was the {{mainstay}} reinforcement and resupply transport for the Germans, starting with 20 to 50 flights {{a day to}} Tunisia from Sicily in November 1942, building to 150 landings a day in early April as the Axis situation became more desperate. The Allied air forces developed a counter-air operation over a two-month period and implemented Operation Flax on 5 April 1943, destroying 11 Ju 52s in the air near Cap Bon and many more during bombing attacks on its Sicilian airfields, leaving only 29 flyable. That began two catastrophic weeks {{in which more than}} 140 were lost in <b>air</b> <b>interceptions,</b> culminated on 18 April with the [...] "Palm Sunday Massacre" [...] in which 24 Ju 52s were shot down and another 35 staggered back to Sicily and crash-landed.|$|R

50|$|The Novi Avion {{most closely}} resembled the French Rafale, {{although}} it was smaller and had only one engine. It was designed to fill many roles, including <b>air</b> superiority, <b>interception,</b> reconnaissance, ground attack, and anti-ship attack. Maximum speed was just under Mach 2. Super-maneuverability at both supersonic and subsonic speeds was a priority, and {{a major portion of}} the airframe was to be composed of composites.|$|R
50|$|An Australian-American {{intercept}} {{station was}} later built at Townsville, Queensland. US Air Force Far East, and its subordinate 5th Air Force, {{took control of}} the 126th in June 1943. The 126th was eventually placed under operational control of U.S. Air Force Far East in June 1943 to support 5th <b>Air</b> Force. <b>Interception</b> and traffic analysis from the company supported the attack into Dutch New Guinea in 1944.|$|R
5000|$|... "As an Air Division, {{it carried}} out air defense {{operations}} in Iceland from 1952 to 1954. Activated {{three years later}} it transferred to Spain, where it cooperated with Spanish Air Force units in the Air Defense Direction Centers (ADDCs). The 65th Air Division directed base construction, {{and the establishment of}} off base housing and radar sites. Its fighter squadrons flew <b>air</b> defense <b>interceptions</b> over Spanish airspace." ...|$|R
5|$|At halftime, Air Force still led by 10–7. Following the half, Virginia Tech's defense {{began to}} break down under Air Force's rushing offense. The Hokies and Air Force battled defensively {{throughout}} the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, Air Force's offense broke free for 13unanswered points. Tech's offense was stifled by two <b>Air</b> Force <b>interceptions</b> and twolost fumbles, allowing Air Force to earn the easy victory, 23–7.|$|R
5000|$|The Indian Air Force (IAF) {{was first}} {{approached}} to provide air support on 11 May {{with the use}} of helicopters. On 21 May a Canberra on a reconnaissance mission, flown by Wg Cdr CH Kulkarni, Sqn Ldr A Perumal and Sqn Ldr UK Jha, was hit by ground fire. The flight was however, recovered safely, and returned to base on one engine. On 25 May, the Cabinet Committee on Security authorized the IAF to mount attacks on the infiltrators without crossing the LoC. Initial indications from the government to the IAF was to operate only Attack helicopters. However, the Chief of Air Staff put forth the argument that {{in order to create a}} suitable environment for the helicopters, fighter action was required. On 26 May, the go-ahead was given and the IAF started its strike role. Flying from the Indian airfields of Srinagar, Avantipur and Adampur, ground attack aircraft MiG-21s, MiG-23s, MiG-27s, Jaguars and the Mirage 2000 struck insurgent positions. Of note, although the MiG-21 is built mainly for <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> with a secondary role of ground attack, it is capable of operating in restricted spaces which was of importance in the Kargil terrain.|$|R
50|$|While the {{opposing}} team has possession, the defense attempts to prevent the offense from advancing the ball and scoring. If an offensive player loses the ball during play (a fumble) or the ball is caught by a defensive player while still in the <b>air</b> (an <b>interception),</b> the defense may attempt to run into the offense's end zone for a touchdown. The defense may also score points by tackling the ball carrier in the offense's own end zone, called a safety (which is worth two points).|$|R
5000|$|The Uragan-1 was {{the first}} {{generation}} of a Soviet automatic <b>air</b> defense <b>interception</b> system, and was a component of the Soviet Air Defence Forces protivovozdushnaya oborona strany (PVO Strany). The concept began with a Soviet Council of Ministers resolution dated February 26, 1955 and the Ministry of Aviation Industry order dated March 8, 1955. The resolutions were in response to the threat from long-range supersonic bombers such as the United States' Convair B-58 [...] "Hustler" [...] and the equally threatening British Vickers Valiant, among others. The current generation is the Uragan-5B.|$|R
