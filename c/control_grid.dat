25|$|Although {{it resembles}} a vacuum tube in appearance, its {{operation}} {{does not depend}} on thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a cold-cathode tube (a form of gas-filled tube), and is a variant of the neon lamp. Such tubes rarely exceed 40°C (104°F) even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or <b>control</b> <b>grid,</b> typically a single anode (in the form of a wire mesh, {{not to be confused with}} a <b>control</b> <b>grid),</b> and shaped bare metal cathodes.|$|E
25|$|Except for diodes, {{additional}} electrodes {{are positioned}} between the cathode and the plate (anode). These electrodes {{are referred to}} as grids as they are not solid electrodes but sparse elements through which electrons can pass {{on their way to the}} plate. The vacuum tube is then known as a triode, tetrode, pentode, etc., depending on the number of grids. A triode has three electrodes: the anode, cathode, and one grid, and so on. The first grid, known as the <b>control</b> <b>grid,</b> (and sometimes other grids) transforms the diode into a voltage-controlled device: the voltage applied to the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> affects the current between the cathode and the plate. When held negative with respect to the cathode, the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> creates an electric field which repels electrons emitted by the cathode, thus reducing or even stopping the current between cathode and anode. As long as the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> is negative relative to the cathode, essentially no current flows into it, yet a change of several volts on the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> is sufficient to make a large difference in the plate current, possibly changing the output by hundreds of volts (depending on the circuit). The solid-state device which operates most like the pentode tube is the junction field-effect transistor (JFET), although vacuum tubes typically operate at over a hundred volts, unlike most semiconductors in most applications.|$|E

25|$|At {{very high}} {{magnetic}} field settings the electrons are forced {{back onto the}} cathode, preventing current flow. At the opposite extreme, with no field, the electrons are free to flow straight from the cathode to the anode. There is a point between the two extremes, the critical value or Hull cut-off magnetic field (and cut-off voltage), where the electrons just reach the anode. At fields around this point, the device operates similar to a triode. However, magnetic control, due to hysteresis and other effects, results in a slower and less faithful response to control current than electrostatic control using a <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> in a conventional triode (not to mention greater weight and complexity), so magnetrons saw limited use in conventional electronic designs.|$|E

2500|$|If a third {{electrode}} {{is inserted}} between the cathode and the anode (called a <b>control</b> <b>grid),</b> {{the flow of}} electrons between the cathode and anode can be regulated by varying the electric charge on this third electrode. This allows the resulting electron tube (called a [...] "triode" [...] because it now has three electrodes) to function as an amplifier because small variations in the electric charge applied to the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> will result in identical variations in the much larger current of electrons flowing between the cathode and anode.|$|E
2500|$|The beam {{power tube}} {{is usually a}} tetrode with the {{addition}} of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the suppressor grid. These angled plates (not {{to be confused with the}} anode) focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing pentode behavior. The positioning of the elements in a beam power tube uses a design called [...] "critical-distance geometry", which minimizes the [...] "tetrode kink", plate to <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> capacitance, screen grid current, and secondary emission from the anode, thus increasing power conversion efficiency. The <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> and screen grid are also wound with the same pitch, or number of wires per inch. The two grids are positioned so that the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> creates [...] "sheets" [...] of electrons which pass between the screen-grid wires. They're aligned to be equidistant from, say, the bottom of the tube.|$|E
2500|$|When triodes {{were first}} used in radio {{transmitters}} and receivers, {{it was found}} that tuned amplification stages had a tendency to oscillate unless their gain was very limited. This was due to the parasitic capacitance between the plate (the amplifier's output) and the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> (the amplifier's input), known as the [...] Miller capacitance.|$|E
40|$|Electric {{power grid}} {{complexity}} is growing rapidly as {{we attempt to}} support technical, business, and societal goals for which power grids were not originally designed. To ensure grid stability and {{have the ability to}} remain reliable under highly dynamic destabilizing conditions requires that <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> systems evolve in ways that address transformational changes and the resultant operational problems. Ultra-large scale power system control architecture - a macro architecture for <b>grid</b> <b>control</b> that handles multi-objective, multi-constraint problems in a framework that can support coordinated control across utility organizational boundaries and, potentially, prosumer premises.

2500|$|To {{combat the}} {{stability}} problems and limited voltage gain {{due to the}} Miller effect, the physicist Walter H. Schottky invented the tetrode tube in 1919. He showed that {{the addition of a}} second grid, located between the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> and the plate (anode), known as the screen grid, could solve these problems. ("Screen" [...] in this case refers to electrical [...] "screening" [...] or shielding, not physical construction: all [...] "grid" [...] electrodes in between the cathode and plate are [...] "screens" [...] of some sort rather than solid electrodes since they must allow for the passage of electrons directly from the cathode to the plate). A positive voltage slightly lower than the plate (anode) voltage was applied to it, and was bypassed (for high frequencies) to ground with a capacitor. This arrangement decoupled the anode and the <b>control</b> <b>grid,</b> essentially eliminating the Miller capacitance and its associated problems. Consequently, higher voltage gains from a single tube became possible, reducing the number of tubes required in many circuits. This two-grid tube is called a tetrode, meaning four active electrodes, and was common by 1926.|$|E
2500|$|However, Lee De Forest is {{credited}} with inventing the triode tube in 1907 while experimenting to improve his original (diode) Audion. By placing an additional electrode between the filament (cathode) and plate (anode), he discovered {{the ability of the}} resulting device to amplify signals. As the voltage applied to the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> (or simply [...] "grid") was lowered from the cathode's voltage to somewhat more negative voltages, the amount of current from the filament to the plate would be reduced.|$|E
2500|$|Nixie tubes were {{superseded}} in the 1970s by {{light-emitting diodes}} (LEDs) and vacuum fluorescent displays (VFDs), {{often in the}} form of seven-segment displays. The VFD uses a hot filament to emit electrons, a <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> and phosphor-coated anodes (similar to a cathode ray tube) shaped to represent segments of a digit, pixels of a graphical display, or complete letters, symbols, or words. Whereas Nixies typically require 180 volts to illuminate, VFDs only require relatively low voltages to operate, making them easier and cheaper to use. VFDs have a simple internal structure, resulting in a bright, sharp, and unobstructed image. [...] Unlike Nixies, the glass envelope of a VFD is evacuated rather than being filled with a specific mixture of gases at low pressure.|$|E

50|$|A typical hot-cathode {{thyratron}} uses {{a heated}} filament cathode, completely contained within a shield assembly with a <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> on one open side, which faces the plate-shaped anode. In the off situation the voltage on the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> is negative {{with respect to}} the cathode. When positive voltage is applied to the anode, no current flows. When the control electrode is made less negative, electrons from the cathode can travel to the anode because the positive attraction from the anode prevails over the negative repulsion caused by the slightly negative voltage on the <b>control</b> <b>grid.</b> The electrons will ionize the gas by collisions with the gas in the tube, and an avalanche effect results, causing an arc discharge between cathode and anode. The shield prevents ionized current paths that might form within other parts of the tube. The gas in a thyratron is typically {{at a fraction of the}} pressure of air at sea level; 15 to 30 millibars (1.5 to 3 kPa) is typical. For a cold-cathode thyratron the trigger voltage on the <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> will typically be positive, and a flash-over from <b>control</b> <b>grid</b> to cathode will initiate the arc discharge in the tube.|$|E
