40|$|The {{methods of}} <b>Counterfactual</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Evaluation</b> (CIE) {{have not been}} {{extensively}} applied {{in the case of}} the Structural Funds assistance in the EU. The main research question is whether the <b>Counterfactual</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Evaluation</b> methods are applicable in the case of OP HRE (Operational program Human Resources and Employment), area of support 1. 1 in the Czech Republic and what requirements have to be met. In case of this  intervention, the “treatment” investigated by this paper is the enterprise support to training of employees. The crucial part of conducting Counterfactual Impact Evaluations is the quality of data set. The OP HRE was tested for the compliance with the data requirements (sample size, randomization for approval of the assistance, homogeneity of the assistance). The area of support 1. 1 in the OP HRE met the basic requirement for the <b>Counterfactual</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Evaluation.</b> There is enough assisted firms and the assistance is homogenous (i. e. there are trainings in just a few type of educational themes).

Overall, we find that just more than one-third of evaluation results from youth employment programs implemented worldwide show a significant positive impact on labor market outcomes 2 ̆ 013 either employment rates or earnings. In general, programs have been more successful in middle- and low-income countries; this may be because these programs' investments are especially helpful for the most vulnerable population groups 2 ̆ 013 low-skilled, low-income 2 ̆ 013 that they target. We also conjecture that the more-recent programs might have benefited from innovations in design and implementation.

40|$|Social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> is {{considered}} {{as an important}} tool enabling social enterprises to legitimise their existence and contribution to society. Attending to multiple goals and operating in a complex setting, social enterprises typically face diverse expectations when they seek to evaluate social impact. Although common agreement as to what constitutes an ideal social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> approach has not been reached, social enterprises are increasingly called upon to adopt sophisticated assessment metrics to demonstrate social impact accurately and objectively. Moving beyond the perception that social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> is a managerial tool providing precise and quantifiable measures of social outcomes, this thesis re-conceptualises social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> as a socially constructed phenomenon {{that needs to be}} understood in its contexts. The thesis reviews extant social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> research in three different contexts: (1) social enterprises’ care to the welfare of people in need; (2) social enterprises’ constraints; and (3) relationships between social enterprises and resource providers. From this review, three gaps are evidenced: (1) the underdevelopment of social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> research in the social entrepreneurship domain; (2) the lack of coherent theories to understand the complex nature of social impact evaluation; and (3) the narrow setting of empirical data in social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> research. The study focuses on answering three research questions: (1) what are the multiple contexts in which social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> takes place? (2) How do social enterprises respond to social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> in these contexts? (3) What theoretical frames can help us better understand social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation?</b> The research utilises three theoretical frames: care, effectuation, and social relations to explore social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> in different contexts. Specifically, care theory is used to understand social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> in the context of social enterprises’ concerns about the wellbeing of people in need. Effectuation theory is applied to explore social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> in the constrained circumstances of social enterprises. Social relations theories are employed to understand social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> in the relationships between social enterprises and resource providers. These are then integrated to present a cohesive theoretical frame for the study. The research utilises a multiple case study design with four social enterprises in Vietnam. The primary data derives from 45 interviews with social entrepreneurs, resource providers, beneficiaries and other stakeholders. The research show that facing multiple goals and requirements, social enterprises collectively employ different behavioural logics to respond to social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> requirements. Specifically, to understand the wellbeing of people in need, social enterprises evaluate social impact continuously through purposeful observations, regular interactions and thorough reflections to appreciate the subtle and significant changes to their beneficiaries at the time or over time. In order to counter constraints associated with social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation,</b> social enterprises adopt an effectuation logic as the basis of action. They ‘make do’ with the available resources they can afford, creatively applying alternative evaluation approaches, looking for assistance from partners and even ‘pushing back’ from perceived inappropriate assessment requests. Simultaneously, to sustain relationships, social enterprises react differently to social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> depending on the symmetric or asymmetric relationships they have with resource providers. The thesis provides a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics and complexity of social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> in the diverse settings of social entrepreneurship. Social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> is characterised as caring, effectual and relational practices. The findings advance our understanding of social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> by showing that social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> is not a linear and causal process that can be done with objective and quantifiable metrics. The key contribution of the research {{is the way in which}} it accounts for the contextualisation of the phenomenon under investigation by proposing an integrative frame rooted in the care, effectuation and social relation literatures. This integrative theoretical frame moves beyond a perspective on social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> as a technical and asocial activity to view it as a dynamic, socially constructed and contextually bounded phenomenon. More generally, and perhaps more importantly, the research responds to recent calls for more attention to pressures and conflicting demands in order to understand social enterprises by taking into account the tensions and challenges associated with social <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> inquiry.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the recent}} years, {{researchers}} {{as well as}} policy makers have been increasingly interested in <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> of development programs. A large number of <b>impact</b> <b>evaluations</b> have been developed and applied to measure the impact of programs. Different <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods rely on different identification assumptions. This paper presents an overview of several widely-used methods in program <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation.</b> In addition to a randomization-based method, these methods are categorized into: (i) methods assuming “selection on observable” and (ii) methods assuming “selection on unobservable”. The paper discusses each method under identification assumptions and estimation strategy. Identification assumptions are presented in a unified framework of counterfactual and two-equation model.

40|$|Background: In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{has been}} used to assess whether {{agricultural}} extension interventions have brought the intended result or to establish causal linkages between interventions and outcomes. However, there is some scepticism about the validity and reliability {{of the results of the}} <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> reports due to some contradictory and exaggerated results. Objectives: This article analyses some <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> studies conducted in SSA as to why contradictions and exaggerations are manifested in some reports and what would be the future prospects of <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> of agricultural extension programmes in the region. Methods: <b>Impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> reports and results of agricultural extension programmes from 10 SSA countries were reviewed and analysed based on <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> principles and theories. Results: The results show that most of the <b>evaluations</b> reported positive <b>impacts.</b> There are also conflicting reports on extension performance. The fact that the overwhelming majority of <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> reports claim positive extension impacts is not in line with the reports on agricultural productivity growth in the region. There are various reasons for over estimated impacts and contradictory results, which include use of poor <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> methodologies, lack of reliable data and insufficient capacity to conduct rigorous <b>impact</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Conclusion: Due to these challenges and the shift in agricultural research and extension approaches, it is recommended that rather than investing effort in trying to prove impact, greater attention should be given to improving impact as well as using other innovative monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and learning tools that consider the dynamic nature of agricultural development. </p...|$|R

This first guidance note, Introduction to <b>Impact</b> <b>Evaluation,</b> {{provides an overview of}} <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation,</b> explaining how <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> differs from [...] and complements [...] other types of <b>evaluation,</b> why <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> should be done, when and by whom. It describes different methods, approaches and designs {{that can be used for}} the different aspects of impact evaluation: clarifying values for the evaluation, developing a theory of how the intervention is understood to work, measuring or describing impacts and other important variables, explaining why impacts have occurred, synthesizing results, and reporting and supporting use. The note discusses what is considered good <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> [...] evaluation that achieves a balance between the competing imperatives of being useful, rigorous, ethical and practical [...] and how to achieve this. Exists also in English. The other notes of this series are: Faire le lien entre le suivi-évaluation et l'évaluation d'impact; Introduction aux méthodes mixtes dans l'évaluation d'impact and Utilisation des résultats d'évaluations d'impact.

40|$|Globally, {{protected}} areas {{are the most}} commonly used tools to halt biodiversity loss. Yet, some are failing to adequately conserve the biodiversity they contain. There is an urgent need for knowledge on how to make them function more effectively. <b>Impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods provide a set of tools that could yield this knowledge. However, rigorous outcome-focused <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> is not yet used as extensively as it could be in protected area management. We examine the role of international protected area funding agencies in facilitating the use of <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation.</b> These agencies are influential stakeholders as they allocate {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} annually to support {{protected areas}}, creating a unique opportunity to shape how the conservation funds are spent globally. We identify key barriers to the use of <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation,</b> detail how large funders are uniquely placed to overcome many of these, and highlight the potential benefits if <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> is used more extensively...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{guideline}} is to provide suggestions on designing <b>impact</b> <b>evaluations</b> for agricultural projects, particularly projects that directly target farmers, and seek to improve agricultural production, productivity and profitability. Specific issues in evaluating agricultural projects are addressed, including the need to use production-based indicators and to carefully consider indirect or spillover effects that are common in agricultural projects. The guideline considers the challenges of conducting <b>impact</b> <b>evaluations</b> of agricultural projects {{as well as the}} methods for assessing impact. Issues of collecting agricultural data for an <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> and how to put together the overall design strategy in an evaluation plan are also covered. The guideline concludes with three case studies of <b>impact</b> <b>evaluations</b> designed for a technology adoption project in the Dominican Republic, a forestry/technology project in Nicaragua, and a crop insurance project in Peru. <b>Impact</b> <b>Evaluation,</b> Agriculture, Technology Adoption, Development Effectiveness, Dominican Republic, PACTA, Nicaragua, APAGRO Program, Cotton Farmers, Peru...|$|R
40|$|The International Initiative for <b>Impact</b> <b>Evaluation</b> (3 ie) {{seeks to}} improve the lives of poor people in low-and middle-income {{countries}} by providing and summarising evidence of which development interventions work, when, why, and for how much. 3 ie operates several grant programmes to finance high-quality <b>impact</b> <b>evaluations</b> of policies and programmes in these countries, where high-quality <b>impact</b> <b>evaluations</b> are those that measure the net change in outcomes that can be attributed to a specific programme. Further, 3 ie produces, funds, and disseminates systematic reviews of <b>impact</b> <b>evaluations</b> on development policies and programmes. Systematic reviews are designed to make the evidence even more accessible and useful to policymakers. 3 ie also supports quality <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> through its quality assurance services. 3 ie is registered as a non-governmental organisation in the United States of America. 3 ie is operating as a programme of the Global Development Network (GDN) in New Delhi, India. The GDN- 3 ie programme in Delhi office houses th...|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increased}} focus on measuring results of World Bank development assistance through <b>impact</b> <b>evaluations.</b> An <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> assesses the changes in the well-being of individuals that can be attributed to a particular project, program or policy. <b>Impact</b> <b>evaluations</b> demand a substantial amount of information, time and resources. Therefore, it is important to select carefully the public actions that will be evaluated. One of the important considerations that could govern the selection of interventions (whether they be projects, programs or policies) for <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> is the potential of evaluation results for learning. In general, it is best to evaluate interventions that maximize the possibility of learning from current poverty reduction efforts and provide insights for midcourse correction, as necessary.|$|R
