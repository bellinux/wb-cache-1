40|$|Three {{methods of}} using {{ultrasonic}} flow meters {{for the purpose}} of testing small- and medium-sized billing flow meters in district heating subscriber stations in situ were investigated. Four subscriber stations, six billing flow meters, and three ultrasonic <b>clamp-on</b> meters <b>were</b> part of the investigation. The obtained results show that clamp-on meters have measurement accuracy problems on the ordinary steel piping in the subscriber stations. When using well defined pipes mounted in series with the billing flow meters the results are clearly better; provided that the flow rates exceed a Reynolds number of approximately 10 000. In this flow region, billing flow meter deviations >± 5 % can be detected. A flow rate below this Reynolds number renders the method less reliable. The useful flow range is extended when using calibration data from the clamp-on meter to correct the measured data, making it possible to determine deviations >± 10 % in flow rates below a Reynolds number of 10 000. The investigation also showed that not all <b>clamp-on</b> meters <b>are</b> suited for this type of in situ test. Godkänd; 1998; 20061029 (ysko) Fjärrvärm...|$|R
50|$|First {{introduced}} in 1965, the Trimline included a lighted dial and was {{encased in a}} sleek, curved plastic housing that took up much less space than earlier Western Electric telephones. However, the glass-smooth and shallowly-curved plastic handset proved difficult to retain between cheek and shoulder for hands-free communication without slipping, and this problem was never corrected {{over the life of}} the model line. Cushioned <b>clamp-on</b> adaptors <b>were</b> manufactured and sold by third parties to make it easier to cradle the handset, but these add-ons would greatly compromise the aesthetic appearance of the telephone.|$|R
50|$|Inexpensive {{varieties}} of ultrasonic meters <b>are</b> available as <b>clamp-on</b> flow meters, {{which can be}} used to measure flow in any diameter of pipe without intrusive modification. Such devices are based on two types of technology: (1) time of flight or transit time; and (2) cross correlation. Both technologies involve transducers that are simply clamped on to the pipe and programmed with the pipe size and schedule and can be used to calculate flow. Such meters can be used to measure almost any dry gas including natural gas, nitrogen, compressed air, and steam. <b>Clamp-on</b> meters <b>are</b> available for measuring liquid flow as well.|$|R
50|$|In AC circuits, {{a current}} {{transformer}} converts {{the magnetic field}} around a conductor into a small AC current, typically either 1 A or 5 A at full rated current, {{that can be easily}} read by a meter. In a similar way, accurate AC/DC non-contact ammeters have been constructed using Hall effect magnetic field sensors. A portable hand-held <b>clamp-on</b> ammeter <b>is</b> a common tool for maintenance of industrial and commercial electrical equipment, which is temporarily clipped over a wire to measure current. Some recent types have a parallel pair of magnetically soft probes that are placed {{on either side of the}} conductor.|$|R
50|$|Ferrite beads {{are one of}} the {{simplest}} and least expensive types of interference filters to install on preexisting electronic cabling. For a simple ferrite ring, the wire is simply wrapped around the core through the center, typically five or seven times. <b>Clamp-on</b> cores <b>are</b> also available, which attach without wrapping the wire: this type of ferrite core is usually designed so that the wire passes only once through it. If the fit is not snug enough, the core can be secured with cable ties or, if the center is large enough, the cabling can loop through one or more times. Small ferrite beads can be slipped over component leads to suppress parasitic oscillation.|$|R
50|$|As the ECM {{monitors}} the varying current, a special circuit (also inside the PCM or Power-train Control Module) converts the current into a voltage value and passes {{it on to}} the serial data stream as an OBD-II PID (not to be confused with a PID controller). This is why the best way to test an AFR sensor’s signal is by monitoring the voltage conversion circuitry, which the ECM sends out as an AFR-voltage PID. It is possible to monitor the actual AFR sensor varying current, but the changes are very small (in the low milliamp range) and difficult to monitor. A second drawback to a manual AFR current test is that the signal wire has to be cut or broken to connect the ammeter in series with the pump circuit. Today’s average <b>clamp-on</b> ammeter <b>is</b> not accurate enough at such a small scale. For this reason, the easiest (but not the only) way to test an AFR sensor is with the scanner.|$|R
40|$|In {{applications}} with ultrasonic clamp-on sensors {{measurement accuracy}} and repeatability are significantly worse {{when compared to}} ultrasonic inline sensors in spite of both sensor types using the same measurement principle. The positioning of the ultrasonic transducers of clamp-on sensors has a determining influence on the precision and {{accuracy of the measurement}} results. A study was made of sound propagation and receiver signal quality as they vary depending on the distance between the ultrasonic transmitter and the ultrasonic receiver. If the positioning of the ultrasonic transducers can be optimized, then the precision of the measuring in <b>clamp-on</b> applications <b>is</b> improved. As a result of studying transducer sensitivity it was possible to implement an automatic positioning system for ultrasonic clamp-on sensor applications. The positioning system automatically finds an optimal transducer position for a particular application, this allows a user to operate a clamp-on sensor without having any special knowledge of the application procedure or needing to set any parameters of the system in advance...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 235 - 256. A {{review of}} slurry {{flowmeters}} {{leads to the}} conclusion that most are unsuited for measuring the flowrate of 	abrasive and corrosive slurries such as are found in the gold mining industry in South Africa. An alternative flowmeter based on cross-correlation techniques 	is thus proposed. Random signals generated by the flowing fluid are measured at two points a known distance apart {{in the direction of the}} flow. Assuming that 	this distance is not "too" large, the downstream signal is a time-delayed replica of the upstream signal. This delay equals the time it takes flow discontinuities 	to travel between the two measuring locations and can be obtained by cross-correlating the two flow signals and finding the position of the correlation peak. 	An analysis to establish a theoretical-basis for the method is performed and an attempt is made to model the flowmeter consisting of the two transducers a known 	distance apart. A review of transducers for converting time-varying spatial flow patterns into electrical signals is undertaken and leads to ultrasonic transducers 	being chosen as most suitable for slurry flowrate measurements. Such transducers are non-intrusive and can <b>be</b> of a <b>clamp-on</b> type. The characteristics and requirements 	of ultrasonic transducers for correlation flowmetering are investigated and a suitable <b>clamp-on</b> design <b>is</b> described...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{practical}} application, some flowmeters are {{not allowed}} to be calibrated off-line periodically, thus on-line calibration is necessary to be implemented in workplace [1]. As a non-invasive flowmeter, the <b>clamp-on</b> ultrasonic flowmeters <b>are</b> widely used in on-line calibration system. As a master flowmeter, ultrasonic flowmeters must be calibrated before or during using. Based on multiple fieldbus control system, an automatic calibration system for the ultrasonic flowmeter was designed. The comparison results between ultrasonic and electromagnetic flowmeter obtained during the process of calibrating manifest that the automatic calibration system is effective and reliable. Because of the good interoperability of the multiple fieldbus, other flowmeters with different protocols can be connected into this system easily. With the high speed development of fieldbus technology, this has great practical significance in flowmeter calibration...|$|R

40|$|The Department of Electrical Engineering in {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the Magister Technologiae in Electrical Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology November 2013 Pole mounted transformers (PMT) in rural areas present an opportunity for local utilities to do current monitoring on these systems. These transformers are exposed to abnormal amounts of stress due to the vast power demand in these areas. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop a more cost-effective condition monitoring system. Transformer current monitoring can be a dangerous practice if not done by suitably trained utility electricians. Hence this study is partly aimed at the elimination of hazardous working environments associated with manual electrical measurements. An investigation to determine a safe and cost-effective way to obtain the electrical measurements required from PMTs is undertaken. Although current measurements can be done with a current clamp-on meter, these measurements still take place at the phases of the transformer and are unsafe. The possibility of implementing wireless data gathering on current <b>clamp-on</b> meters <b>is</b> therefore investigated. This is made possible by a wireless sensor node (WSN) which gathers information and transmits it wirelessly to a WSN base station. This wireless solution is battery powered, necessitating battery replacements, therefore leading to the investigation of magnetic fields, magnetic materials and magnetic induction. A current clamp able to generate a high voltage (HV) output with minimal magnetic field strength is developed. The magnetic fields produced by the transformer’s phase cables are used to generate an alternating voltage. With the help of a microcontroller and an energy harvesting circuit, this voltage is converted and used to charge supercapacitors. The magnetic fields are also used to determine the current flow in the transformer phase cables when the device is not in energy harvesting mode. The device will then undergo comprehensive laboratory testing to determine its accuracy and durability, and is then used to do ‘real life’ current measurements, the results of which are compared against an off-the-shelf current monitoring device...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{exchange}} is generally regarded to occur between the leaf interior and ambient air, i. e. in vertical (anticlinal) directions of leaf blades. However, inside homobaric leaves, gas movement occurs also in lateral directions. The {{aim of the}} present study was to ascertain whether lateral CO 2 diffusion affects leaf photosynthesis when illuminated leaves are partially shaded. Measurements using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging techniques were performed on homobaric leaves of Vicia faba and Nicotiana tabacum or on heterobaric leaves of Glycine max and Phaseolus vulgaris. For homobaric leaves, gas exchange inside a <b>clamp-on</b> leaf chamber <b>was</b> affected by shading the leaf outside the chamber. The quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(PSII)) was highest directly adjacent to a light/shade border (LSB). Phi(PSII) decreased in the illuminated leaf parts with distance from the LSB, while the opposite was observed for nonphotochemical quenching. These effects became most pronounced at low stomatal conductance. They were not observed in heterobaric leaves. The results suggest that plants with homobaric leaves can benefit from lateral CO 2 flux, in particular when stomata are closed (e. g. under drought stress). This may enhance photosynthetic, instead of nonphotochemical, processes near LSBs in such leaves and reduce the photoinhibitory effects of excess light...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of leaf gas-exchange {{characteristics}} using stan¬dard <b>clamp-on</b> leaf chambers <b>are</b> {{prone to}} errors because of diffusion leaks. While some consideration {{has been given}} to CO 2 diffusion leaks, potential water vapour diffusion leaks through chamber gaskets have been neglected. We esti¬mated diffusion leaks of two clamp-on Li-Cor LI- 6400 (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) leaf chambers with polymer foam gaskets and enclosing either 2 or 6 cm 2 leaf area, and conducted a sensitivity analysis of the diffusion leak effects on Farquhar et al. photosynthesis model parameters – the maximum carboxylase activity of ribulose 1 • 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (Vcmax), capacity for photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax) and non¬photorespiratory respiration rate in light (Rd). In addition, net assimilation rate (An) versus intercellular CO 2 (Ci) responses were measured in leaves of Mediterranean ever¬green species Quercus ilex L. enclosing the whole leaf chamber in a polyvinyl ﬂuoride bag ﬂushed with the exhaust air of leaf chamber, thereby effectively reducing the CO 2 and water vapour gradients between ambient air and leaf chamber. For the empty chambers, average diffusion leak for CO 2, KCO 2, (molar ﬂow rate corresponding to unit CO 2 mole fraction difference) was ca. 0. 40 mmol s- 1. KCO 2 increased ca. 50 % if a dead leaf was clamped between the leaf chamber. Average diffusion leak for H 2 O was ca. 5 -to 10 -fold larger than the diffusion leak for CO 2. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the consequence of a CO 2 dif¬fusion leak was apparent enhancement of An at high CO 2 mole fraction and reduction at lower CO 2 mole fraction, and overall compression of Ci range. As the result of these modiﬁcations, Farquhar et al. model parameters were over¬estimated. The degree of overestimation increased in the order of Vcmax < Jmax < Rd, and was larger for smaller cham¬bers and for leaves with lower photosynthetic capacity, leading to overestimation of all three parameters by 70 – 290 % for 2 cm 2, and by 10 – 60 % for 6 cm 2 chamber. Sig¬niﬁcant diffusion corrections (5 – 36 %) were even required for leaves with high photosynthetic capacity measured in largest chamber. Water vapour diffusion leaks further enhanced the overestimation of model parameters. For small chambers and low photosynthetic capacities, apparent Ci was simulated to decrease with increasing An because of simultaneous CO 2 and H 2 O diffusion leaks. Measurements in low photosynthetic capacity Quercus ilex leaves enclosed in 2 cm 2 leaf chamber exhibited negative apparent Ci values at highest An. For the same leaves measured with the entire leaf chamber enclosed in the polyvinyl ﬂuoride bag, Ci and An increased monotonically. While the measurements without the bag could be corrected for diffusion leaks, the required correction in An and transpiration rates was 100 – 500 %, and there was large uncertainty in Farquhar et al. model parameters derived from ‘corrected’ An/Ci response curves because of uncertainties in true diffusion leaks. These data demonstrate that both CO 2 and water vapour diffusion leaks need consideration in measurements with clamp-on leaf cuvettes. As plants in natural environments are often characterized by low photosynthetic capacities, cuvette designs need to be improved for reliable measure¬ments in such species. JRC.
