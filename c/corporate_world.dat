25|$|Representative of the 1900–1930 era, was James M. Beck, {{a lawyer}} under Presidents Roosevelt, Harding and Coolidge, and a congressman from 1927–1933. He espoused {{conservative}} principles such as nationalism, individualism, constitutionalism, laissez-faire economics, property rights, {{and opposition to}} reform. Conservatives like Beck saw the need to regulate bad behavior in the <b>corporate</b> <b>world</b> {{with the intention of}} protecting corporate capitalism from radical forces, but they were alarmed by the anti-business and pro-union proposals of Roosevelt after 1905. They began to question the notion of a national authority beneficial to big capital, and instead emphasized legalism, concern for the Constitution, and reverence for the American past.|$|E
25|$|A {{qualitative}} {{review of}} previous literature looking at self-report data suggests {{that men and}} women use impression management tactics in the <b>corporate</b> <b>world</b> that are consistent with stereotypical gender roles when presenting themselves to others. This research proposes that women are put in a double bind where those who portray themselves as more communal and submissive are overlooked for leadership positions and women who try to utilize male tactics (such as being more aggressive) receive negative consequences for violating normative gender roles. To change this dynamic the authors suggest that managerial positions should be re-advertised to highlight the feminine qualities needed for a position and staff training should involve a segment accentuating gender issues in the office to make everyone aware of possible discrimination.|$|E

25|$|Cultural {{resources}} management has, however, been criticized. CRM {{is conducted}} by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining {{the work to}} be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a <b>corporate</b> <b>world</b> pace.|$|E
25|$|Platforms like LinkedIn {{create an}} {{environment}} for companies and clients to connect online. Companies that {{recognize the need for}} information, originality/ and accessibility employ blogs to make their products popular and unique/ and ultimately reach out to consumers who are privy to social media. Studies from 2009 show that consumers view coverage in the media or from bloggers as being more neutral and credible than print advertisements, which are not thought of as free or independent. Blogs allow a product or company to provide longer descriptions of products or services, can include testimonials and can link to and from other social network and blog pages. Blogs can be updated frequently and are promotional techniques for keeping customers, and also for acquiring followers and subscribers who can then be directed to social network pages. Online communities can enable a business to reach the clients of other businesses using the platform. To allow firms to measure their standing in the <b>corporate</b> <b>world,</b> sites enable employees to place evaluations of their companies.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{with the}} economy in serious {{recession}} and interest rates touching seventeen per cent, Richmond's creditors came knocking. At one point, {{an attempt was made}} to seize the club's 1973 and 1974 premiership trophies as securities for unpaid debts, an embarrassing situation. For a number of years, the exact amount that the club owed was not publicly known. After Bartlett came Allan Jeans, who then passed the job to ex-Richmond premiership player John Northey for 1993. Northey returned the team to the simple long-kicking style of the halcyon days under the legendary Tom Hafey. Along with some draft concessions granted by the AFL, Northey's efforts gradually improved Richmond. The team fumbled an opportunity to make the 1994 finals, then opened 1995 with its best start to a season in 75 years and eventually made it to the preliminary final. With a talented playing list and a strong administration led by Leon Daphne (Richmond's first president from the <b>corporate</b> <b>world,</b> the Alan Bond farce aside), Richmond looked set to become regular finalists again.|$|E
