D. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 126 pages, appendices A-B. Background: Extravehicular activity poses several dangers to astronauts. A major {{concern is the}} regulation of core temperature and thermal comfort {{in the context of}} an impermeable EMU microclimate and elevated energy expenditure rates for prolonged periods. Purpose: To identify the optimal features of each of three LCGs (MACS-Delphi, Russian Orlan, NASA LCVG) for maintaining core temperature and thermal comfort during exercise in mild (24 oC) and hot (35 oC) conditions. Methods: Four male and two female participants (aged 22 - 46 years) performed 10 trials (each with five 20 -minute exercise stages and two rest stages) to account for all garment configurations (with/without hood) and temperature regimes. Metabolic (VO 2, Ve, RER), temperature (core, skin), cardiovascular (HR, SBP, DBP, SaO 2), local sweat rate, and skin wetness data were collected and analyzed during stages five (moderate exercise) and seven (rest). Whole body sweat rate and water flow parameters were collected pre- and post-trial. Results: Significant differences (p < or = 0. 05) between garments were found for: skin temperature, HR, SBP, local and whole body sweat rate, and water flow rate. Discussion: There were several significant, yet few consistent, findings between the garments. Use of a <b>cooling</b> <b>hood</b> had no discernable effect. Amount of tubing coverage was related to whole body sweat rate while flow rate affected skin temperatures and local sweat rate. Conclusion: All three garments were similar in terms of regulating core temperature in a safe range (though not to the NASA standard of 37. 2 oC) during physical exertion in moderate and hot environments. Future research is needed to identify the roles of adding a <b>cooling</b> <b>hood</b> and/or ventilation system to LCGs in addition to determining optimal water temperature, flow rate, tubing arrangement, and ergonomic design...|$|E

25|$|Equipped almost identically to CSX2522, {{this second}} example had {{aluminum}} valve covers, a tuned air cleaner, a Smiths heater, seat belts, {{front and rear}} brake <b>cooling</b> ducts, a <b>hood</b> scoop, brake <b>cooling</b> scoops, side exhausts and a painted roll bar (2522’s roll bar was chromed). Suspension options included Koni shock absorbers, front and rear anti-sway bars, unpolished six-inch magnesium pin-drive wheels, and Goodyear Blue Streak Sports Car Special tires.|$|R

When a vehicle is at higher speed there is enough ram air to <b>cool</b> the under <b>hood</b> engine compartment, but when the vehicle is moving at lower speeds or {{climbing}} a gradient {{there is a need}} of insulating the engine heat to get transferred to other parts around it, e.g. Engine Mounts. With the help of proper thermal analysis and use of heat shields, the engine mount vents can be optimised for the best performances.|$|R
40|$|Increased {{temperature}} is common after brain trauma and stroke, {{considered to be}} detrimental to outcome and usually treated with systemic cooling interventions. However, targeting cooling interventions at the head may be more logical. In addition to arterial blood, the human brain is cooled by heat loss through the skull and heat loss from the upper airways. It is these two mechanisms of heat loss which {{are the subject of}} this thesis. The initial research aim was to find out if restoring ‘normal’ airflow through the upper respiratory tracts of intubated, brain-injured patients could reduce brain temperature. Air at room temperature and humidity replicating normal resting minute volume was continuously administered nasally to 15 such patients. After a 30 minute baseline, they were randomised to receive airflow or no airflow for 6 hours and then crossed over for a further 6 hours. The airflow did not produce significant reductions in intracranial temperature (Mean - 0. 13 °C, SD 0. 55 °C, 95 % CI - 0. 43 to 0. 17 °C). However, some evidence of heat loss through the skull was serendipitously observed. This was investigated formally in a randomised factorial trial, together with nasal airflow with enhancements (unhumidified air at twice minute volume with 20 ppm nitric oxide gas) intended to overcome some of the possible reasons for the neutral results with ‘normal’ airflow. After a 30 minute baseline, 12 intubated, brain-injured patients received enhanced nasal airflow, bilateral head fanning (8 m/s), both together and no intervention in randomised order. Each intervention was delivered for 30 minutes followed by 30 minutes washout. Mean brain temperature was reduced by 0. 15 °C with nasal airflow (p= 0. 001, 95 % CI 0. 06 to 0. 23 °C) and 0. 26 °C with head fanning (p< 0. 001, 95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 34 °C). The estimate of the combined effect of airflow and fanning on brain temperature was 0. 41 °C. Physiologically, this study demonstrated that heat loss through the upper airways and through the skull can reduce parenchymal brain temperature in brain-injured humans, that the effects are additive and the onset of temperature reduction is rapid. The most promising mechanism appeared to be heat loss through the skull and the final piece of research involved developing and initial (phase I) assessment of a convective head cooling device in healthy volunteers, with intracranial temperature measured non-invasively by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After a 10 minute baseline, five healthy volunteers received 30 minutes head cooling followed by 30 minutes head and neck <b>cooling</b> via a <b>hood</b> and neck collar delivering 14. 5 °C air at 42. 5 L/s. The net brain temperature reduction with head cooling was 0. 45 °C (SD 0. 23 °C, p= 0. 01, 95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 74 °C) and with head and neck cooling 0. 37 °C (SD 0. 30 °C, p= 0. 049, 95 % CI 0. 00 to 0. 74 °C). There was no significant reduction in cooling with progressive depth into the brain i. e. core brain was cooled. The main relevance of this research is physiological because it adds to knowledge and understanding of mechanisms of heat loss from the upper airways and through the skull in humans. Clinically, factors which enhance or inhibit these mechanisms may have an effect on brain temperature but the therapeutic relevance of head cooling by these methods requires further research.
