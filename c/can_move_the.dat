5|$|Mitchell Gourley {{was born}} in Geelong, Victoria, on 2 June 1991. He was born a {{congenital}} amputee, with his left forearm ending a few inches below his elbow. Mitchell <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> tiny stump of his forearm and uses it to hold and manipulate objects by gripping them in his elbow. He plays a variety of sports including cricket, Australian rules football, basketball, mountain biking and rock-climbing. He attended at Geelong College, and as of 2014 is studying commerce at the University of Melbourne.|$|E

25|$|Both players <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> rook pawn forward (P-26), or, more commonly, {{advance the}} pawn above {{and to the}} right of the bishop (P-76). The former is known as a rook opening and the latter a bishop opening.|$|E
25|$|It is a finite-state {{machine that}} has an {{infinitely}} long read/write tape. The machine <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> tape back and forth, changing its contents as it performs an algorithm. The machine starts in the initial state, goes through a sequence of steps, and halts when it encounters the halt state.|$|E
25|$|The {{bills of}} many waders have Herbst corpuscles which {{help them find}} prey hidden under wet sand, by {{detecting}} minute pressure differences in the water.

The design includes a fail-safe braking system that automatically halts the pod should the actuators or computers fail, and low speed emergency drive wheels that <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> pod 1m/s.|$|E
25|$|Lao is {{generally}} a subject–verb–object language, but emphasis <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> {{object to the}} beginning of a sentence. The language lacks both agreement and case marking, but word order is very free, with predicate-argument relations determined largely through context. Lao is a right-branching language, much like other Southeast Asian languages and, to a lesser extent, Romance languages.|$|E
25|$|In {{blocking}} games, scoring {{happens at}} the end of the game. After a player has emptied his hand, thereby winning the game for the team, the score consists of the total pip count of the losing team's hands. In some rules, the pip count of the remaining stock is added. If a game is blocked because no player <b>can</b> <b>move,</b> <b>the</b> winner is often determined by adding the pips in players' hands.|$|E

25|$|Dilaceration is an {{abnormal}} bend {{found on a}} tooth, and is nearly always associated with trauma that moves the developing tooth bud. As a tooth is forming, a force <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> tooth from its original position, leaving {{the rest of the}} tooth to form at {{an abnormal}} angle. Cysts or tumors adjacent to a tooth bud are forces known to cause dilaceration, as are primary (baby) teeth pushed upward by trauma into the gingiva where it moves the tooth bud of the permanent tooth.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} views on optimal timing of surgery after a spinal cord injury. The general consensus is {{to operate the}} patient {{when he or she}} is neurologically stable. Some surgeons try to operate a patient as early as possible. The advantages of this are that the patient {{can take advantage of the}} new functional possibilities before new adjustments and apaptations develop. Other surgeons operate when it becomes feasible. This is usually 12–18 months after injury (can be shortened to 6–7 months) and only after stabilization of motor function. Important spasticity (see further) and neurovegetative complications (i.e. bladder function, bowel function, pulmonary function and pressure sores) must have been treated already. The patient must be able to sit in a wheelchair so that he/she <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> arm against gravity. Usually a compromise is found between the patient’s wishes and the surgeon when timing the surgery.|$|E
25|$|However, on May 25, 2011, at {{the annual}} meeting for the Greater Baltimore Committee, the owner of the Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel, local {{business}} and construction magnate, Williard Hackerman, made an offer that {{he would be willing to}} finance more than half of the proposed $900 million price tag and would be willing to build the hotel and the arena which is estimated to cost $500 million and the remainder, $400 million for the convention center expansion would need to be financed by the State of Maryland and Baltimore City, the offer is contingent on whether the city and state <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> convention center expansion project forward. The offer received a positive reception from both Baltimore City Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley who both have submitted requests to the Maryland Stadium Authority to conduct a feasibility study on the project that is due by the end of 2011.|$|E

During the date, Paula becomes {{agitated}} at McGuirk's inappropriate, boring subject matter, and she becomes drunk in order to entertain herself. Meanwhile, Brendon, Melissa, and their friend Jason film a scene from The Dark Side of the Law in Brendon's basement, where Brendon's character is in a French prison, confronted by his mother, played by Melissa. They stop filming when Jason's nose starts running, and he demonstrates how he <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> mucus up and down to their disgust.|$|E

500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>the</b> pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E

2500|$|The static {{friction}} force must {{be overcome by}} an applied force before an object <b>can</b> <b>move.</b> <b>The</b> maximum possible friction force between two surfaces before sliding begins {{is the product of}} the coefficient of {{static friction}} and the normal force: [...] When there is no sliding occurring, the friction force can have any value from zero up to [...] Any force smaller than [...] attempting to slide one surface over the other is opposed by a frictional force of equal magnitude and opposite direction. Any force larger than [...] overcomes the force of static friction and causes sliding to occur. The instant sliding occurs, static friction is no longer applicable—the friction between the two surfaces is then called kinetic friction.|$|E
