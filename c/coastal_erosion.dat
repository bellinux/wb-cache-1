5|$|Some {{other sites}} {{were no longer}} {{considered}} viable at all. West Cowes was decommissioned in 1854 and became the club house of the Royal Yacht Squadron. Sandown Castle in Kent, suffering badly from <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion,</b> began to be demolished from 1863 onwards; Hull Citadel and its 16th-century fortifications were demolished in 1864 {{to make way for}} docks; Yarmouth was decommissioned in 1885, becoming a coastguard signalling station; and Sandgate, also suffering from <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion,</b> was sold off to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888.|$|E
5|$|In 1883 {{architectural}} historian Hayter Lewis {{complained to}} the British Archaeological Association that more {{needed to be done}} to protect the ruins, contrasting their poor treatment with that of the other castles along the coast. Despite this, concerns continued to be raised about the safety of the ruins facing along the sea, and in 1894 the Royal Engineers blew up the bastions and the keep on the seaward side using guncotton. The town of Deal then bought the remains from the government for £35 for use as part of their local sea defences. <b>Coastal</b> <b>erosion</b> continued and between 1988 and 1989 the remains were encased in concrete to form a sea wall, although they remain vulnerable to further <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion.</b> The remains of the castle are protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{the remains}} of the site are {{protected}} under UK law as a scheduled monument. The site was surveyed in 1982 and excavations were carried out between 2002 and 2003, analysing surviving timber structures that had been exposed by <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{coastal region}} is {{recognized}} as one of the most vulnerable disaster-prone regions on the surface of planet earth. A wide range of natural, technological and environmental hazards can lead to disasters in the coastal region.

30|$|Rapid urbanization, oil spills, {{and loss}} of arable land have created several {{environmental}} problems in Nigeria [3]. Among these environmental problems are sheet and gully <b>erosion,</b> <b>coastal</b> and marine <b>erosion</b> and land subsidence, flooding, drought and desertification, oil pollution, urban decay and squatter settlements, industrial pollution and waste, municipal solid waste, biodegradable petrochemical products, concrete jungles or cities, loss of fauna and flora, and climatic change [4].|$|R
5|$|Rider Haggard was {{interested}} in land affairs and wrote several works on the subject; in 1895 he served on a government commission to examine Salvation Army labour colonies, and in 1911 he served on the Royal Commission examining <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion.</b> He was an inveterate letter writer to The Times, and had nearly 100 letters published by the newspaper.|$|E
5|$|The site spans 185 {{million years}} of {{geological}} history, <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion</b> having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. At different times, {{this area has}} been desert, shallow tropical sea and marsh, and the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived here have been preserved in the rocks.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion</b> had {{undermined}} the castle's walls. In 1627, Charles I {{announced that he}} would repair the fortification but instead the ruins were dismantled in 1631 by Sir John Oglander. A new fortification, Sandown Fort was built in its place, positioned further inland, but the possible remains of the foundations of the original castle are still visible along the shore at low tide.|$|E
40|$|The {{coastal region}} {{is one of}} the most {{vulnerable}} disaster-prone regions 	 on the surface of planet earth.

The 2004 tsunami in the 	 Andamans and mainland India has brought to focus the relevance of natural 	 disasters, the vulnerability of people living in the coastal regions, the 	 inadequacy and un-preparedness of the administrative mechanisms to cope 	 with the fall outs and the enormity of the problems and issues in the 	 management and rehabilitation processes...|$|R
50|$|Cliff {{stabilization}} is a <b>coastal</b> management <b>erosion</b> control technique. This is {{most suitable}} for softer or less stable cliffs. Generally speaking, the cliffs are stabilised through dewatering (drainage of excess rainwater to reduce water-logging) or anchoring (the use of terracing, planting, wiring or concrete supports to hold cliffs in place).|$|R
50|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years, {{approximately}} 1 million m³ sand per {{year has been}} lost from the Dutch coast to deep water. In most northern <b>coastal</b> sections, <b>erosion</b> occurs in deep water {{and also in the}} nearshore zone. In most southern sections, sedimentation occurs in the nearshore zone and erosion in deep water.|$|R
5|$|Realignment of the River Glaven {{means the}} ruins are {{now to the}} north of the river embankment, and {{essentially}} unprotected from <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion,</b> since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E
5|$|Sandown Castle was a Device Fort {{built at}} Sandown on the Isle of Wight by Henry VIII in 1545 {{to protect against}} the threat of French attack. Constructed from stone with angular bastions, its design was a hybrid of Italian {{military}} architectural thinking with traditional English military design. The site was raided by a French force that summer while the fortification was still being constructed. The site suffered from <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion</b> and the castle was demolished in 1631.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival at Sigeberht's court, Felix {{established}} a church at Dommoc, his episcopal see, which is widely taken to mean Dunwich, on the Suffolk coast. Dunwich has since been almost totally destroyed by the effects of <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion.</b> Other historians have suggested as an alternative site for Felix's see the coastal Walton, Suffolk near Felixstowe, where {{there was once a}} Roman fort. A church and priory were dedicated to him there by Roger Bigod in 1105.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{shoreline}} is {{an important}} feature for protecting coastal environments and monitoring <b>coastal</b> <b>erosions.</b> This research aims to monitor shoreline changes in East Coast of Korea using multi-temporal Landsat imagery taken in 1994 and 2014. This research is carried out through the following steps: First, we generated the NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) imagery from each given Landsat imagery. Next, a shoreline is generated from each NDWI imagery by using the thresholding method. Finally, the shoreline changes between 1994 and 2014 is assessed using the checkpoints determined along the shorelines generated from the Landsat imagery taken in 1994. The statistical {{results show that the}} 90 % of the shorelines have moved landward between 1994 and 2014, while the 10 % of the shorelines have moved seaward during the same period. This research contributes to monitor the shoreline changes in East Coast of Korea using the multi-temporal Landsat imagery. 1...|$|R

5|$|St Andrew's Castle was an {{artillery}} fort constructed by Henry VIII near Hamble-le-Rice, Hampshire, between 1542 and 1543. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended Southampton Water near the Solent. St Andrew's comprised a keep and a gun platform, protected by a moat. The castle was decommissioned in 1642 during the English Civil War and has been largely destroyed through <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Today, Fort Ricasoli {{remains largely}} intact, {{although}} {{it is in a}} dilapidated state. The headland that it is built upon is prone to <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion,</b> and some of the walls between No. 3 and No. 4 bastions have already collapsed into the sea. In 2004, the Restoration Unit of the Ministry of Resources and Infrastructure removed, restored and re-attached part of the fort's walls, but nothing has been done to restore the entire fort.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{from natural}} {{processes}} or {{the activities of}} man, landscapes and their associated habitats change over time. There are the slow geomorphological changes associated with the geologic processes that cause tectonic uplift and subsidence, and the more rapid changes associated with earthquakes, landslides, storms, flooding, wildfires, <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion,</b> deforestation and changes in land use. Then there are the changes in habitats brought on by alterations in farming practices, tourism, pollution, fragmentation and climate change.|$|E

50|$|Many {{villages in}} the United Kingdom have been {{abandoned}} throughout history. It could {{be the result of}} natural events, such as rivers changing course or silting up, or <b>coastal</b> and estuarine <b>erosion.</b>|$|R
50|$|Along {{the coast}} of the Southeastern United States, tides {{generally}} ran 1 to 2 ft above normal, peaking at 3.5 ft in North Carolina. Moderate to heavy rainfall was reported in the Carolinas, causing flooding of 5 ft deep in New Hanover County, North Carolina. Overall damage was light and primarily limited to <b>coastal</b> beach <b>erosion.</b> In some areas, Dottie helped relieve drought conditions.|$|R
5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly {{from the effects}} of <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion</b> but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was encased in concrete in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th {{century the}} manor of Muchland was {{administered}} from Aldingham Castle. Muchland {{became known as}} Aldingham manor and in 1291 it came into the ownership of the Harrington family. In the 14th century, the Scots attacked the Furness peninsula during the Scottish Wars of Independence; {{around the same time}} <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion</b> threatened Aldingham Motte. These factors may have led to the Harrington family abandoning Aldingham and establishing the administrative centre of the manor at the newly built Gleaston Castle, though the construction work could have been the result of their growing social status, and they may have needed more room for a greater number of servants.|$|E
5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. <b>Coastal</b> <b>erosion</b> around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to be very careful on coastal paths.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coastal</b> defences against <b>erosion</b> are groynes, stone walls, or {{tetrapods}} of concrete, which act as breakwaters. The first {{plants to}} colonise the dunes include sea buckthorn or beach grass which prevent wind erosion.|$|R
50|$|Erosion of {{soils and}} sediments from coastal dune {{habitats}} {{as well as}} from saltmarshes and sand flats is a threat to the structure and composition of these <b>coastal</b> communities. <b>Erosion</b> occurs predominantly from wind and wave actions but can be increased by reducing vegetation cover or reducing stability in other ways. It can also be increased by high levels of human traffic or the public accessing areas of wetland that are off limits to the public.|$|R
25|$|An {{artificial}} reef known as Chevron Reef {{was constructed in}} El Segundo, California in hopes of creating a new surfing area. However, the reef failed to produce any quality waves and was removed in 2008. In Kovalam, South West India, an {{artificial reef}} has, however, successfully provided the local community with a quality lefthander, stabilized <b>coastal</b> soil <b>erosion,</b> and provided good habitat for marine life.

5|$|The ceasefire of 2004 brought {{relative}} peace, {{but in the}} meantime, {{the sinking}} of the Joola in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists for several years. Considering the problems brought on by the conflict along with the threat of <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion</b> on the island, some fear the worst. Thus, after years of development and community outreach, Carabane is experiencing difficulties in a number of ways.|$|E
5|$|The <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion</b> and {{salinization}} {{affecting the}} west of Senegal are also a source of concern on the island; signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849. The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice; each time it was rebuilt, {{the site of the}} building had to be moved further and further inland. The island's erosion is evident when one considers that the original location of the house eventually became flooded, even at low tide. During the dry season the river has a tide-dominated delta, with tidewater reaching 200km upstream, while it is being concentrated 50% by evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} geology of the North Norfolk {{coast is}} Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs {{just to the}} west of the SSSI, but buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast. Unlike the soft, rapidly eroding cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated 1–2mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and <b>coastal</b> <b>erosion.</b>|$|E
