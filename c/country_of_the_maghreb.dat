40|$|This article {{examines}} the reasons why Spain which possesses a consolidated democratic regime continues to promote democracy and even good governance in certain countries in such an uncertain, ambiguous manner.

40|$|There is a {{tendency}} in neo-liberal economics to consider {{the state and the}} private sector as one another's antitheses, as dichotomous and mutually exclusive. Moreover, the prevailing notion is that 'public is bad, private is good', meaning that <b>the</b> retreat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one and <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other work together to provide the necessary conditions for economic growth. This article argues that this approach is not only obviously overly simplistic, but that it is not necessarily relevant in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developing world. It will be argued that the state retains an economic role specific to regions where markets are less perfect and political structures unfavourable to a freely-functioning private sector. Indeed, it may even be appropriate to see the state and the private sector as ends of a sliding scale, with a significant area of overlap arising from specific historic, political, cultural and structural experiences. This is particularly true in the Arab Middle East and North Africa, where pre-colonial hitory, colonialism, Islam, patrimonialism, corporatism, and in some cases rentierism, have left a particular legacy in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> economically reforming states that have nonetheless failed to surrender political power or economic hegemony. A brief survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particular historical experiences of state formation in three <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maghreb</b> (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting state-private sector dynamics will follow, illustrating <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> possible sources of explanation for scenarios that appear to defy neo-liberal logic. ...|$|R
40|$|Temporary ponds are {{the most}} {{peculiar}} and representative water bodies in the arid and semi-arid regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, where they often represent diversity hotspots that greatly contribute to the regional biodiversity. Being indissolubly linked to these ecosystems, the so-called “large branchiopods” are unanimously considered flagship taxa of these habitats. Nonetheless, updated and detailed information on large branchiopod faunas is still missing in many countries or regions. Based on an extensive bibliographical review and field samplings, we provide an updated and commented checklist of large branchiopods in Tunisia, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less investigated <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maghreb</b> as far as inland water crustaceans are concerned. We carried out a field survey from 2004 to 2012, thereby collecting 262 crustacean samples from a total of 177 temporary water bodies scattered throughout the country. Large branchiopod crustaceans were observed in 61 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sampled sites, leading to <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> fifteen species.

But as Zahia Ouadah-Bedidi, Jacques Vallin et Ibtihel Bouchoucha explain, fertility in North Africa has again surprised observers by remaining consistently above the two-child threshold. In the early 1970 s, fertility was still very high in Tunisia and Morocco (6. 5 children per woman) despite the family planning programmes introduced in the mid- 1960 s, while in Algeria it stood at 8 children per woman thanks to a post-liberation baby boom. Nobody imagined that rapid decline was a real possibility in countries with natalist traditions. Yet, contrary to all expectations, Maghrebian fertility had fallen dramatically by the year 2000 – to just 2. 08 children per woman in Tunisia, 2. 2 in Algeria and 2. 5 in Morocco [1] (figure 1) – almost reaching <b>the</b> emblematic level <b>of</b> 2. 1 children per woman needed for a population to replace its numbers over the long term.

40|$|Armas Launis’s {{interest}} in the North African Orient was manifest in three of his professional domains: travel writer, musicologist and opera composer. During his stays in Algiers over two winters between 1924 and 1927 in particular, Launis became personally acquainted with <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maghreb</b> (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco). My article examines how {{in each of these}} professional forms <b>of</b> expression, <b>the</b> immediate, local encounters merge with <b>the</b> discursive practices <b>of</b> European learning in Launis’s representations of Northern Africa.   In a travel book from 1927, containing references to Menemech, Yafil and Bachetarzi, eminent figures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabo-Moorish musical tradition, Launis demonstrates his knowledge and expertise on the Algerian music scene. Written for a wide audience, his observations about popular traditions lack any detailed scholarly apparatus, intentionally so. He expresses respect for the ‘civilisatory mission’ pursued by the French in Northern Africa, and notes <b>the</b> remnants <b>of</b> Roman antiquity, but he also shows an {{interest in}} both historical and contemporary tensions between local tribes, nationalities, cultures, and religions. These were later interwoven in his operas Jehudith and Theodora, the latter unfinished.   In 1928, during a period of intensive operatic composition, Launis applied for a position as music teacher at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Helsinki, albeit in vain. <b>The</b> topic <b>of</b> his presentation lecture, “Features of Arabo-Moorish music”, met with both approval (Ilmari Krohn) and disapproval (Robert Kajanus). <b>The</b> many points <b>of</b> convergence with an existing article “La musique arabe dans le Maghreb” by Jules Rouanet (1922) were not noticed.   Having settled permanently in Nice in 1930, Launis planned the two operas, Theodora and Jehudith. They exhibit the religious universalism already developed in his earlier operas, but now in a new form, where the composer has become intrigued by <b>the</b> conflicts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region and <b>the</b> political developments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time.

Increasing cooperation with <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maghreb</b> and <b>the</b> Sahel is also one the main objectives. But in the long-term, it must be dismantled <b>the</b> narrative <b>of</b> Jihadists and promoted a greater integration of young Muslims living in Europe. Los ataques yihadistas cometidos en Europa desde comienzos de 2015 han puesto de manifiesto que la amenaza del terrorismo islamista late en el corazón del viejo continente. La expansión del Estado Islámico (ISIS) ha incrementado el flujo de europeos que viajan a Siria e Irak para unirse a sus filas. Al menos, 30. 000 combatientes procedentes de todo el mundo han hecho ya este trayecto para luchar bajo las órdenes del autoproclamado "califato". A falta de una política común, los Gobiernos de los países miembros de la Unión Europea intentan coordinar medidas de contraterrorismo. A corto plazo, el objetivo es evitar que ciudadanos europeos viajen a los territorios controlados por ISIS y vigilar a los sospechosos de haberse radicalizado, así como a los retornados. Incrementar la cooperación con los países del sur de Mediterráneo y el Sahel es otra de las prioridades.
