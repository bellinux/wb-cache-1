5|$|The victims' {{bodies were}} found {{floating}} in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989. The first body was found when several people on board a sailboat, crossing under the Sunshine Skyway, saw an object in the water. The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles north from the first. While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body, a <b>call</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards to the east. All three female {{bodies were found}} face down, bound with a rope around the neck, and naked below the waist.|$|E

In Saigon, Navy SEAL Lt. Thomas R. Norris, {{one of just}} three SEAL officers and nine enlisted men remaining in Vietnam, had just completed an assignment in the Mekong Delta. He was waiting for orders when the <b>call</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> for a commando operation to get Hambleton out. Norris was immediately dispatched to lead an operation to rescue Hambleton. He recruited five Vietnamese Sea Commando frogmen from the Lien Doc Nguoi Nhia (LDNN), Naval Advisory Detachment (NAD) in Da Nang.|$|E
25|$|Marie Carthy's <b>call</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> {{response}} to two developments: firstly, the Garda investigation announced {{on the evening}} of the shooting on 20 April 2000 and, secondly, and more importantly, the Gardaí revelation that they would not make this report public.

25|$|Bowie County Sheriff W. H. Presley, {{leader of}} the investigation, was with his old friend Texas City Police Chief Jack N. Runnels when the <b>call</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> and they sped to the scene. They {{immediately}} launched a citywide investigation along with the Texas and Arkansas city police, the Department of Public Safety, Miller and Cass County sheriffs' departments and the FBI.

25|$|Statements {{described}} Murray {{as someone}} using a non-standard CPR technique on Jackson. During {{the tape of}} the emergency call, released on June 26 one day after Jackson's death, the doctor was described as administering CPR on a bed, not on a hard surface such as a floor, which would be standard practice. The doctor's attorney said that Murray placed one hand underneath Jackson and used the other hand for chest compression, where the standard practice is to use both hands for compression. A Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) spokesperson said the 911 <b>call</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> at 12:21:04p.m. PDT (19:21:04UTC). Paramedics reached Jackson at 12:26p.m. and found that he still was not breathing.|$|E
25|$|Mobbing {{calls are}} signals {{made by the}} mobbing species while harassing a predator. These differ from alarm calls, which allow con-specifics {{to escape from the}} predator. The great tit, a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when prey species are in flight, they employ an alarm signal in the 7–8kHz range. This call is less {{effective}} at traveling great distances, but is much more difficult for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which the <b>call</b> <b>came).</b> <b>In</b> the case of the alarm call, it could be disadvantageous to the sender if the predator picks up on the signal, hence selection has favored those birds able to hear and employ calls in this higher frequency range.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} many calls to shut down DJJ/CYA altogether. [...] A spate of such <b>calls</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the wake of scandals arising after a video tape surfaced, in 2004, of a youth being punched in the head {{repeatedly}} by a guard at the Stockton facility and two youths dying there.|$|R
500|$|One log {{shows that}} Bamber rang Chelmsford police station—rather than the {{emergency}} number (999)—and spoke to PC Michael West {{in the information}} room. As a result West began an [...] "event log". This states that Bamber's <b>call</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> at 3.36am on 7 August 1985. The timing is important; Bamber maintains that he telephoned 10 minutes after his father phoned him. But at trial it was accepted that West had misread a digital clock, and that the call had probably come in just before 3:26am, because that was when West asked a civilian dispatcher, Malcolm Bonnett, to send a car to the scene. The car, Charlie Alpha 5, was dispatched at 3:35 am. The event log noted a call from: ...|$|E
2500|$|At 5:41am, a 9-1-1 <b>call</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> from {{a player}} on the charter bus, {{pleading}} for help.

[...] The team coach was treated at Piedmont Hospital.|$|E
2500|$|In the huddle, the Giants were incredulous {{when the}} <b>call</b> <b>came</b> <b>in.</b> [...] "Don't {{give me the}} ball", begged fullback Larry Csonka, the former Dolphins star. Other players asked Pisarcik to change the play, but he demurred. Gibson had berated him for {{changing}} a play the week before and threatened to have him waived if he ever did so again. Gibson {{did not take the}} time to explain his decision to Pisarcik. As a result, the rest of the offense simply viewed Gibson's call as a power trip. Because he was a second-year starting quarterback who still had not totally proven himself, in the era before free agency, Pisarcik lacked the stature to prevail in this kind of dispute.|$|E

Taking the shortest route, he drove his motorcycle over grass between the athletic fields {{and headed toward the}} west entrance. When he saw Deputy Scott Taborsky following him in a patrol car, he abandoned his motorcycle {{for the safety of the}} car. The two deputies had begun to rescue two wounded students near the ball fields when another gunfight broke out at 11:26, as Harris returned to the double doors and again began shooting at Deputy Gardner, who returned fire. From the hilltop, Deputy Smoker fired three rounds from his pistol at Harris, who again retreated into the building. As before, no one was hit.|$|E
60|$|He {{remembered his}} work, the {{wrecking}} car, and the wrecking crew that had toiled under him, {{and he wondered}} {{what had become of}} Clancey, his right- hand man. Came the long day, when, routed from bed {{at three in the morning}} to dig a surface car out of the wrecked show windows of a drug store and get it back on the track, they had laboured all day clearing up a half-dozen smash-ups and arrived at the car house at nine at night just as another <b>call</b> <b>came</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
