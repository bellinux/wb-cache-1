50|$|Most {{industrial}} chillers use refrigeration as {{the media}} for cooling, but some rely on simpler techniques such as air or water flowing over coils containing the coolant to regulate temperature. Water is {{the most commonly used}} coolant within process chillers, although coolant mixtures (mostly water with a <b>coolant</b> <b>additive</b> to enhance heat dissipation) are frequently employed.|$|E
50|$|One {{phenomenon}} {{that can affect}} water-cooled diesel engines is cylinder cavitation and erosion. This {{is due to a}} phenomenon in high-compression engines where the ignition of the fuel in the cylinder causes a high-frequency vibration that causes bubbles to form in the coolant in contact with the cylinder. When these tiny bubbles collapse, coolant impacts the cylinder wall, over time causing small holes to form in the cylinder wall. This damage is mitigated in some engines with coatings, or with a <b>coolant</b> <b>additive</b> specifically designed to prevent cavitation and erosion damage. Engines damaged in this way will require the affected cylinder to be repaired (where possible) or will be rendered unusable.|$|E
5000|$|Pollution: Campbell {{discusses}} the pollution that [...] "traditional" [...] batteries {{put into the}} water when a boat sinks, but Desmond says that electric boats are no more liable to sinking than other types and lists the leakage of fuel, engine oil and <b>coolant</b> <b>additives</b> as inevitable when an internal-combustion-engined boat sinks. Rutter points to the [...] "very nasty cocktail of pollutants" [...] {{that come out of}} a diesel wet exhaust in normal use.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{contamination}} factor values, the overall contamination of soils within study area were moderately contaminated by chromium and very highly contaminated by lead, nickel, cadmium and cobalt. The result of modified degree of contamination {{also indicates that}} the study area is extremely contaminated. This {{may be due to}} different activities viz. dewaxing and cleaning of vehicles; the storage, use and disposal of polluting liquids such as oils, paints, solvents, antifreeze and other <b>coolant</b> <b>additives,</b> brake fluids and solid waste such as oil filters, exhaust systems, batteries and tyres taking place within garage and auto-mechanical workshops. In order to minimize the effect of spikes of individual elements and to have accurate interpretation of the mCd result, the calculation of pollution load index was carried out and its result reveals that the soil quality of study area were deteriorated. Thus urge for immediate interventions to ameliorate the pollution within study area.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} (ZnO NPs) {{have demonstrated}} the ability to improve lubrication and thermal conductivity, and stand as promising metalworking lubricant and <b>coolant</b> <b>additives</b> due to their low cost compared to other NPs. While nanomaterials are a focus of research due to their potential to enable advanced technologies, {{little is known about}} their effects on the environment and human health. This research investigates two main characteristics of ZnO metalworking nanofluids (MWnF™). First, the stability of ZnO NPs (20 nm) is investigated in mixtures of a microemulsion (TRIM® MicroSol® 585 XT) and dispersants, all of which are commercially available. Second, toxicological assessments are conducted to survey the effect of ZnO NPs on MWnF™ safety. The results revealed that none of the dispersants enhanced the stability of ZnO NPs more than the prepared microemulsion alone. Research also revealed that ZnO MWnF™ had a significantly higher toxicity than the prepared microemulsion. This demonstrates the need for precautionary development of metalworking nanofluids. ...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} neutron absorber is 10B as 10B4C in control rods, or boric acid as a <b>coolant</b> water <b>additive</b> in PWRs. Other important neutron absorbers {{that are used}} in nuclear reactors are xenon, cadmium, hafnium, gadolinium, cobalt, samarium, titanium, dysprosium, erbium, europium, molybdenum and ytterbium; all of which usually consist of mixtures of various isotopes—some of which are excellent neutron-absorbers. These also occur in combinations such as Mo2B5, hafnium diboride, titanium diboride, dysprosium titanate and gadolinium titanate.|$|R
40|$|The ISS (International Space Station) ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) {{includes}} two internal coolant loops that utilize an aqueous based coolant for heat transfer. A silver salt biocide {{had previously been}} utilized as an <b>additive</b> in the <b>coolant</b> formulation to control the growth and proliferation of microorganisms within the coolant loops. Ground-based and in-flight testing demonstrated that the silver salt was rapidly depleted, and did not act as an effective long-term biocide. Efforts to select an optimal alternate biocide for the ITCS coolant application have been underway and {{are now in the}} final stages. An extensive evaluation of biocides was conducted to down-select to several candidates for test trials and was reported on previously. Criteria for that down-select included: the need for safe, non-intrusive implementation and operation in a functioning system; the ability to control existing planktonic and biofilm residing microorganisms; a negligible impact on system-wetted materials of construction; and a negligible reactivity with existing <b>coolant</b> <b>additives.</b> Candidate testing to provide data for the selection of an optimal alternate biocide is now in the final stages. That testing has included rapid biocide effectiveness screening using Biolog MT 2 plates to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (amount that will inhibit visible growth of microorganisms), time kill studies to determine the exposure time required to completely eliminate organism growth, materials compatibility exposure evaluations, coolant compatibility studies, and bench-top simulated coolant testing. This paper reports the current status of the effort to select an alternate biocide for the ISS ITCS coolant. The results of various test results to select the optimal candidate are presented...|$|R
