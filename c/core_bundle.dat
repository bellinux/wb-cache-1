The thickness of each TiO 2 nanotube is linearly correlated with {{the extent to which}} the TiO 2 micro-flowers bloom. The blooming of the TiO 2 micro-flowers is due to the severe cleavages of the TiO 2 nanotubes between the top areas and the side walls of the protruding dots. As the anodization time was increased to 5  min, <b>core</b> <b>bundles</b> of nanotubes in TiO 2 micro-flowers were slightly bent in random directions, as shown in Figure  5 a,b,c,d.

40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} formation of actin filament bundles and the elongation of microvilli (MV) after fertilization in sea urchin eggs. In a previous study (1979, J. Cell Biol. 83 : 241 - 248) we demonstrated that increased pH induced the formation of actin filaments in isolated sea urchin egg cortices with the concomitant elongation of MV. On the basis of these results we suggested that increased cytoplasmic pH after fertilization causes a reorganization of cortical actin, which in turn provides the force for MV elongation. To test this hypothesis, we compared the morphology of microvilli in eggs activated with and without the release of fertilization acid. Activation of eggs in normal sea water with the calcium ionophore A 23187 causes the release of fertilization acid and the elongation of MV containing <b>core</b> <b>bundles</b> of actin filaments.

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{belongs to the}} myosin superfamily. Myosins are {{molecular}} motors that, upon interaction with actin filaments, utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical force. Each myosin has a conserved N-terminal motor domain that contains both ATP-binding and actin-binding sequences. Following the motor domain is a light-chain-binding 'neck' region containing 1-6 copies of a repeat element, the IQ motif, {{that serves as a}} binding site for calmodulin or other members of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. At the C-terminus, each myosin class has a distinct tail domain that serves in dimerization, membrane binding, protein binding, and/or enzymatic activities and targets each myosin to its particular subcellular location. The myosin-1a protein is expressed by enterocytes, the epithelial cells that line the luminal surface of the small intestine. In these cells the myosin-1a protein localizes specifically to the brush border. Experiments indicate that the brush border population of the encoded protein turns over rapidly, while its head and tail domains interact transiently with the core actin and plasma membrane, respectively. A rapidly exchanging pool of the myosin-1a protein binds to the actin <b>core</b> <b>bundle,</b> which turns over on a much slower timescale.|$|E

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of cell structure and {{movement has been}} advanced by the application of modern mi-croscopic and biochemical methods {{to the study of}} sev-eral biologic systems. The brush border of absorptive epithelial cells is one such system that historically has provided important information about the interaction between actin and its associated proteins in the cyto-plasm. Recent biochemical studies have identified the actin-associated proteins found in the brush border, but an {{understanding of}} the functional roles of these proteins first requires knowledge of the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the cytoskeleton. Early electron microscopy studies by Millington and Finean (1962) revealed that the brush border is com-posed of a densely packed, hexagonal array of micro-villi and the terminal web. The terminal web is com-posed of a meshwork of filaments which excludes large cell organelles uch as mitochondria nd ribosomes (Fig. 1). An axial core of microfilaments extends from the tip of the microvillus basally into the terminal web. These microfilaments contain actin (lshikawa et al. 1969) as identified by heavy meromyosin (HMM) or S I decoration and are unidirectionally polarized with respect o the membrane, i. e., the arrowheads in SI-decorated microvilli all point away from the distal tip of the microvillus and toward the terminal web (Moo-seker and Tilney 1975; Begg et al. 1978). The core microfilaments are packed into a bundle, which, in turn, is associated with the overlying membrane through two types of attachments. In the first type, the distal end of the <b>core</b> <b>bundle</b> terminates at an electron-dense region in the microvillus tip, whereas in the sec-ond type, the <b>core</b> <b>bundle</b> is connected laterally to the membrane by cross filaments (Mukerjhee and Stae-helin 1971).

We now demonstrate that purified 110 K- calmodulin complex can be readded to ATP-treated, stripped microvillar cores. The resulting bundles display the same helical and periodic arrangement of lateral bridges as is found in vivo. In reconstitution experiments, actin filaments incubated in EGTA with purified fimbrin and villin form smooth-sided bundles containing an apparently random number of filaments. Upon addition of 110 K-calmodulin complex, the bundles, as viewed by electron microscopy of negatively stained images, display along their entire length helically arranged projections with the same 33 -nm repeat of the lateral cross-bridges found on microvilli in vivo; these bridges likewise tilt relative to the bundle. Thus, reconstitution of actin filaments with fimbrin, villin, and the 110 K- calmodulin complex results in structures remarkably similar to native microvillar cores. These data provide direct proof that the 110 K- calmodulin is the cross-bridge protein and indicate that actin filaments bundled by fimbrin and villin are of uniform polarity and lie in register. The arrangement of the cross-bridge arms on the bundle is determined by the structure of the core filaments as fixed by fimbrin and villin; a contribution from the membrane is not required...|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of ATP and deoxycholate (DOC) on the cytoskeletal organization of Triton-demembranated microvilli (MV) isolated from chicken intestine brush borders. Isolated MV are composed of a core of tightly bundled microfilaments from which arms project laterally to the plasma membrane with a 33 -nm periodicity. These lateral arms spiral around the core microfilaments as a helix with a 25 degrees pitch. Demembranated MV consist of four polypeptides with mol wt of 110, 000, 95, 000, 68, 000, and 42, 000, present in molar ratios of 1. 1 : 1. 6 : 1. 3 : 10. 0. After addition of 50 microM ATP and 0. 1 mM Mg++, the cytoskeletons are organized as a tight bundle of microfilaments from which lateral arms are missing. In these ATP-treated cytoskeletons, the 110 -kdalton polypeptide is reduced in amount and the 95, 000, 68, 000, and 42, 000 polypeptides are present in a 1. 3 : 1. 2 : 10. 0 ratio. In contrast, after incubation with 0. 5 % DOC, the core microfilaments are no longer tightly bundled yet the lateral arms remain attached with a distinct 33 -nm periodicity.

We have exploited this natural affinity of BBMI for negatively charged lipids to form two-dimensional (2 D) crystals of this protein which are suitable for structural analysis by electron crystallographic techniques. The 2 D crystals which we have obtained belong to one of two space groups, p 22121 or p 2. We present here projection maps calculated from images of negatively stained crystals for each of these crystal types to a resolution of 20 A and show that the asymmetric unit is the same in both crystal types...|$|E
40|$|Podosomes, {{which are}} formed by {{different}} monocyte derivatives, are small adhesion structures whose coordinated dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization drive their motile and invasive features. Using live-cell microscopy, we explored the temporal molecular {{steps of the}} de novo assembly and disassembly of podosomes in cultured osteoclasts. We demonstrate here that the earliest visible step in podosome assembly is the local accumulation of the plaque protein paxillin, along with cortactin, which stabilizes actin networks, followed by robust polymerization of actin filaments and their association with a-actinin. Only then is a local increase in integrin b 3 levels apparent in the podosome ring domain. Thus, local actin polymerization in cortactin- and paxillin-rich locations nucleates podosome assembly before the local accumulation of b 3 integrin. We further show that actin polymerization is also important for the recruitment and maintenance of plaque proteins in the mature podosome ring domain. Our model implies that <b>core</b> <b>bundle</b> dynamics {{play a central role}} in regulating podosome stability...|$|E
40|$|Receptor {{tyrosine}} phosphatases (RPTPs) {{are required}} for axon guidance during embryonic development in Drosophila. Here we examine the roles of four RPTPs during development of the larval mushroom body (MB). MB neurons extend axons into parallel tracts known as the peduncle and lobes. The temporal order of neuronal birth {{is reflected in the}} organization of axons within these tracts. Axons of the youngest neurons, known as core fibers, extend within a single bundle at the center, while those of older neurons fill the outer layers. RPTPs are selectively expressed on the core fibers of the MB. Ptp 10 D and Ptp 69 D regulate segregation of the young axons into a single <b>core</b> <b>bundle.</b> Ptp 69 D signaling is required for axonal extension beyond the peduncle. Lar and Ptp 69 D are necessary for the axonal branching decisions that create the lobes. Avoidance of the brain midline by extending medial lobe axons involves signaling through Lar...|$|E
40|$|Several {{types of}} {{evidence}} suggest that protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is important during {{the growth of}} neuronal processes, but few specific roles, or subcellular localizations suggestive of such roles, have been defined. We report here a localization of tyrosine-phosphorylated protein at the tips of growth cone filopodia. Immunocytochemistry using a mAb to phosphorylated tyrosine residues revealed intense staining of the tips of most filopodia of Aplysia axons growing slowly on a polylysine substrate, but of few filopodia of axons growing rapidly on a substrate coated with Aplysia hemolymph, which has growth-promoting material. Cytochalasin D, which causes F-actin to withdraw rapidly from the growth cone, caused the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein to withdraw rapidly from filopodia, suggesting that the protein associates or interacts with actin filaments. Phosphotyrosine has previously been found concentrated at adherens junctions, where bundles of actin filaments terminate, but video-enhanced contrast-differential interference contrast and confocal interference reflection microscopy demonstrated that the filopodial tips were not adherent to the substrate. Acute application of either hemolymph or inhibitors of protein-tyrosine kinases to neurons on polylysine resulted in a rapid loss of intense staining at filopodial tips concomitant with a lengthening of the filopodia (and their <b>core</b> <b>bundles</b> of actin filaments). These results demonstrate that tyrosine-phosphorylated protein can be concentrated at the barbed ends of actin filaments in a context other than an adherens junction, indicate an association between changes in phosphorylation and filament dynamics, and provide evidence for tyrosine phosphorylation as a signaling mechanism in the filopodium that can respond to environmental cues controlling growth cone dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{intestinal}} {{epithelial cell}} brush border exhibits distinct localizations of the actin-binding protein components of its cytoskeleton. The protein interactions that dictate this subcellular organization are as yet unknown. We report here that tropomyosin, which {{is found in}} the rootlet but not in the microvillus core, can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores, and can cause the dissociation of up to 30 % of the villin and fimbrin from the cores but does not affect actin binding by ll 0 -kD calmodulin. Low speed sedimentation assays and ultrastructural analysis show that the tropomyosin-containing <b>cores</b> remain <b>bundled,</b> and that ll 0 -kD calmodulin remains attached to the core filaments. The effects of tropomyosin on the binding and bundlin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{an attempt}} to {{identify}} unknown actinbinding proteins in cells of Dictyostelium discoideum that {{may be involved in}} the control of cell motility and chemotaxis, monoclonal antibodies were raised against proteins that had been enriched on an F-actin affinity matrix. One antibody recognized a protein distinguished by its strong accumulation at the tips of filopods. These cell-surface extensions containing a <b>core</b> of <b>bundled</b> actin filaments are rapidly protruded and retracted by cells in the growth-phase stage. The protein of 269 kD turned out to resemble mouse fibroblast talin (Rees et al., 1990) in its primary structure. The fit is best among the first 400 -amino acid residues of the NH 2 -terminal region where identity between the two proteins is 44 % and the last 200 -amin...|$|R
