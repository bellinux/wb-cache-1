5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E

5|$|Hog Island was colonized in the 17th century.

5|$|Outside of the {{seasonal}} variations, the geothermal gradient of temperatures through the crust is 25–30°C (77–86°F) per kilometer of depth {{in most of}} the world. The conductive heat flux averages 0.1MW/km2. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through magma conduits, hot springs, hydrothermal circulation or a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of the distance and proper motion of this system {{can be used to}} compute the transverse velocity of IK Pegasi as 16.9 km/s. The third component, the heliocentric radial velocity, can be measured by the average red-shift (or blue-shift) of the stellar spectrum. The General Catalogue of Stellar Radial Velocities lists a radial velocity of -11.4 km/s for this system. The <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two motions gives a space velocity of 20.4 km/s relative to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two {{opposite}} torques {{creates a}} resulting yaw torque {{on the front}} wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E
5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} the chest is compressed from front to back, causing it to widen from side to side. The lungs adhere to the chest wall because of the negative pressure {{between them and the}} pleural membranes lining the inside of the chest cavity; thus when the chest widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this tensile force exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when the chest is crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> three mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|To {{create the}} sounds he sought, Adams {{augmented}} the orchestra {{with a large}} saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action.|$|E
5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, or a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, {{a lack of knowledge}} means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E
5|$|At the {{confluence}} of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers, young salmon that swim down from spawning gravels in the headwaters of the Clearwater River often delay their migrations because of a significant temperature difference. (Prior to the removal of Lewiston Dam on the main Clearwater and Grangeville Dam on the South Fork Clearwater, the Clearwater was completely unusable by migrating salmon.) Agricultural runoff and water held in reservoirs higher upstream on the Snake warm its waters as it flows through the Snake River Plain, so as the Snake meets the Clearwater, its average temperature is much higher. Directly below {{the confluence}}, the river flows into Lower Granite Lake, formed by Lower Granite Dam, the uppermost dam of the Lower Snake River Project. Paradoxically, the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors gives the young salmon further time to grow and to feed in Lower Granite Lake, so when they begin the migration to the Pacific Ocean, they often have a higher chance at survival, compared to those salmon who migrate to the ocean earlier.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} what {{happened}} to the island's Christians after the Muslim conquest; the traditional view is that most were either converted or expelled. There is evidence from Muslim sources, however, for the continued survival of Christians on Crete, as a subject class, as in other Muslim conquests, although according to the same sources the Muslims, whether descendants of the Andalusians, more recent migrants, or converts (or any <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these)</b> formed the majority. There is also evidence of rival classes on the island as when Theodosius the Deacon reports that the rural Cretans, not rulers of the land but inhabitants of crags and caves, descended from the mountains under their leader Karamountes during the siege of Chandax by Nikephoros Phokas to assist the besieged. It seems that the Byzantine Christian population of the countryside was left relatively alone, while the Muslim element (including native converts) predominated in the cities.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, the WSB's {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} the remaining six members of the patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone, leading negotiators {{to conclude that the}} increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the crisis. At around the same time, teams that had been observing the West Side Boys' base for four days reported that they had seen no sign of the captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault would become more dangerous if the West Side Boys moved the hostages. The <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors led COBRA to order an extraction mission.|$|E
5|$|Some foreign volunteers had no {{military}} experience and {{found themselves in}} a similar situation to the Rhodesian teenagers. These foreigners were generally motivated to enlist by anti-communist political views, hunger for adventure, turbulent personal lives in their home countries or some <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors. The Canadian Mathew Charles Lamb joined 3 Commando, RLI in 1973, having just spent six years in a psychiatric hospital. In June 1966, aged 18, he had killed two strangers in a shooting spree in his home-town, but avoided the death penalty on a court ruling {{that at the time of}} the incident he had been insane. Keeping his past life a secret, he became a popular and well-regarded soldier in 3 Commando, and eventually rose to the rank of Lance-Corporal, taking command of a Fireforce stick on Operation Thrasher shortly before he was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic number}} system {{consists}} of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 using a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E
5|$|The <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{developments}} eventually {{culminated in}} success. On 13 March 1941 Braham achieved a surprise {{attack on a}} Dornier Do 17, knocking out one of its engines before the cannons jammed. His radar operator, Sergeant Ross, eventually unjammed three of the guns. Braham's second burst blew the bomber up at a range of 60 yards and the Beaufighter narrowly avoided colliding with the debris. The engagement lasted 13 minutes. The two aircrew achieved another success on the 9 May. Approaching from slightly below their target, Braham followed his radar operator's instructions until a visual sighting had been made. Identifying an aircraft through a patch of eclipsed stars he could then position himself to attack. Attacking two He 111s he downed one with two close-range and short bursts of cannon fire. The victory was confirmed. The He 111 had crashed in neighbouring Richmond, London. The dead pilot's Iron Cross was sent to Braham and a souvenir along with two Luftwaffe lifejackets which he preferred to the bulkier British design. He wore the lifejacket until he was shot down.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b> Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E
