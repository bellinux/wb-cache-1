40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the {{voluntary}} annual report disclosures, relating to <b>conflict</b> <b>diamonds,</b> for four of the largest diamond mining companies operating in South Africa can be explained through applying legitimacy theory and media agenda-setting theory. Design/methodology/approach – Applying legitimacy theory under the assumption of media agenda-setting theory, the study draws a comparison between the volume of disclosure relating to <b>conflict</b> <b>diamonds</b> made in the annual reports of four of the largest diamond mining companies operating in South Africa and the volume of South African media publications addressing <b>conflict</b> <b>diamonds.</b> Findings – The results of the study suggest that changes in the degree of media attention relating to the issue of <b>conflict</b> <b>diamonds</b> are largely mirrored by the annual report disclosure by one firm, but not by the other firms in the sample. Hence, legitimation motives lend support for only one of the four firms. Research limitations/implications – It should be noted that in relying upon legitimacy theory to examine variations in voluntary annual report disclosures regarding <b>conflict</b> <b>diamonds,</b> the study does not invalidate the likelihood that other theories, such as stakeholder theory or political economy theory, for example, may also hold explanatory power. Originality/value – No prior research combining legitimacy theory and media agenda theory to explain voluntary disclosure of <b>conflict</b> <b>diamonds</b> by South African diamond mining companies could be found.

As such, human rights and conflicts became the primary impetus for establishing the Kimberly Process (KP) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies. The purpose of this quantitative study was to investigate the effectiveness of the KP and CSR policies in deterring the use of conflict diamonds in the U. S. jewelry industry. This study was an investigation as to whether conflict diamonds are entering the U. S. jewelry supply chain and a review of the ethics of the U. S. jewelry industry in light of the <b>conflict</b> <b>diamond</b> issue. Conflict theory provided the theoretical framework used to gather data on <b>conflict</b> <b>diamond</b> protocols and on corporate social responsibilities within the U. S. jewelry industry. The sample was composed of 59 randomly selected participants from the U. S. jewelry industry whose opinions were indicative of that industry. Data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially. Multiple statistical tests were used for the data analysis that included regression and the Mann-Whitney U test. The overall results indicated that the KP and the CSR policies were insignificant in deterring the use of conflict diamonds in the U. S. jewelry industry; therefore, the null hypothesis was retained. This study contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the ethical dimensions of conflict diamonds and the committed management practices of the U. S. jewelry industry. Positive social change can be realized when respect for fundamental human rights is achieved by the global diamond industry and becomes a requisite foundation for every society to bring an end to the flow of conflict diamonds...|$|E

Amidst discussions to change or make additions to the existing <b>conflict</b> <b>diamond</b> policy, as well as rising awareness about other conflict minerals, the creation of future conflict resource related policy appears inevitable. To aid the development of future policy in this industry, this paper studies if the Kimberley Process has had an impact on country level rough diamond competition. Using data compiled from a number of academic and industry sources, we employ a discrete choice oligopoly model to estimate demand and evaluate competition in the rough diamond market while allowing for unobserved product and country characteristics and controlling for endogeneity of price. In this way, we investigate the impacts of the Kimberley Process on competition and estimate own- and cross-price elasticities for top producers. The results suggest that the Kimberley Process has reduced the competitive advantage of autocratic governments and has increased competition among top producing countries...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} consumers, NGOs, and governments alike have become {{increasingly}} concerned {{about the problem of}} `conflict¿ or `blood¿ diamonds in relation to on-going armed conflicts in Angola, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Allegations by NGOs, governments and the UN that many conflicts are fuelled by illicit exports of diamonds have begun to be acknowledged by the diamond industry. Diamonds, and the money they generate, have been used to purchase arms, ammunition, uniforms and other equipment, as well as to pay soldiers and to cultivate strategic alliances for those armed groups in control of territory rich in this lucrative resource. This has facilitated the intensification and protraction of violent conflicts in Africa. Additionally, the wealth to be gained from the illicit extraction and sale of diamonds has contributed to the prominence of economic agendas in many civil wars that motivate faction leaders to continue the conflict in order to protect their businesses. 1 For example, the Angolan rebel group UNITA (União Nacional para a Inedepência Total de Angola) is believed to have received US 3. 7 billion in a six year period during the 1990 s - a far greater amount than the foreign aid received from patrons like the United States and South Africa during the Cold War. This money has both funded large scale arms purchases and swelled the personal coffers of UNITA leaders, thereby contributing to the intransigence of those leaders in agreeing and implementing peace and facilitating continued violence. 2 In Sierra Leone the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has funded its arms acquisitions with illicit diamond revenues and the extraction of diamonds is seen as one of the main factors behind the lack of implementation of the Lomé peace accord and the subsequent resurgence of violence. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) both the government and rebel forces have financed their war efforts through the diamond trade, as have some of the intervening regional powers. As a result the fighting around diamond rich areas and trading centres has been particularly intense. For example, in spite of a unilateral ceasefire declared by Rwanda on the 29 th of May 1999, it is believed to have sent 7, 000 fresh troops to the DRC in June as the battle for the diamond rich area of Mbuji-Mayi escalated. However the prominence of `conflict diamonds¿ in the policy discourse related to these conflicts and their resolution has served to obscure a range of other issues which are equally, if not more, central to finding lasting solutions to these wars. In {{spite of the fact that}} the arms flows which sustain these conflicts are only partly financed by `conflict diamonds¿ they are often only mentioned as one aspect of the illegal diamond trade rather than as a core issue. Even more concerning, perhaps, is that the discourse of `greed¿ rather than `grievance¿ as the foundation and driving force of conflicts obscures the complexity of political, social, and other economic dimensions of these wars. Thus, while efforts to reduce the <b>conflict</b> <b>diamond</b> trade may be an essential element of the resolution of these conflicts, other factors of potentially greater import are pushed down the agendas of many of the governments and NGOs whose input into those processes may be the key to success. In short, therefore, the issue 2 of conflict diamonds is one aspect of the complex dynamics and processes of ongoing African conflicts, not vice-versa...|$|E
5000|$|While the Process {{has been}} broadly welcomed by groups aiming to improve {{human rights in}} {{countries}} previously affected by <b>conflict</b> <b>diamonds,</b> such as Angola, some say it does not go far enough.

Major diamond trading corporations continue to fund and fuel these conflicts by doing business with armed groups. In response to public concerns that their diamond purchases were contributing to war and human rights abuses in central Africa and West Africa, the United Nations, the diamond industry and diamond-trading nations introduced the Kimberley Process in 2002, which is aimed at ensuring that <b>conflict</b> <b>diamonds</b> do not become intermixed with the diamonds not controlled by such rebel groups, by providing documentation and certification of diamond exports from producing countries to ensure that the proceeds of sale are not being used to fund criminal or revolutionary activities.
