25|$|Historical uses of {{hydrogen}} chloride in the 20th century include hydrochlorinations of alkynes in producing the chlorinated monomers <b>chloroprene</b> and vinyl chloride, which are subsequently polymerized to make polychloroprene (Neoprene) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), respectively.

25|$|While rubber {{is still}} used in textile manufacturing, its low {{tenacity}} limits {{its use in}} lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to oxidizing agents and is damaged by aging, sunlight, oil and perspiration. The textile industry turned to neoprene (polymer of <b>chloroprene),</b> a type of synthetic rubber, as well as another more commonly used elastomer fiber, spandex (also known as elastane), because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability.|$|E
25|$|In January 1930, Dr. Elmer K. Bolton became {{assistant}} chemical {{director in}} the chemical department, and thus, Carothers' immediate boss. Bolton wanted practical results in 1930, and his wish was fulfilled. Bolton asked Carothers to examine the chemistry of an acetylene polymer {{with the goal of}} creating synthetic rubber. In April 1930 one of Carothers' staff, Dr. Arnold M. Collins, isolated <b>chloroprene,</b> a liquid which polymerized to produce a solid material that resembled rubber.

25|$|Given a {{reasonably}} accurate model of wind speeds within the 18–25km band, Google {{claims that it}} can control the latitudinal and longitudinal position of high-altitude balloons by adjusting only the balloon's altitude. By adjusting the volume and density of the gas (e.g., helium, hydrogen, or another lighter-than-air compound) in the balloon, the balloon's variable buoyancy system is {{able to control the}} balloon's altitude. Google has additionally indicated that balloons may be constructed from various materials (e.g., metalized Mylar or BoPET) or a highly flexible latex or rubber material (e.g., <b>chloroprene).</b>|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{amounts of}} {{butadiene}} {{are used to}} make the nylon intermediate, adiponitrile, by the addition of a molecule of hydrogen cyanide to each of the double bonds in a process called hydrocyanation developed by DuPont. Other synthetic rubber materials such as <b>chloroprene,</b> and the solvent sulfolane are also manufactured from butadiene. Butadiene is used in the industrial production of 4-vinylcyclohexene via a Diels Alder dimerization reaction. Vinylcyclohexene is a common impurity found in butadiene upon storage due to dimerization. Cyclooctadiene and cyclododecatriene are produced via nickel- or titanium-catalyzed dimerization and trimerization reactions, respectively. Butadiene is also useful in the synthesis of cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes, as it reacts with double and triple carbon-carbon bonds through the Diels-Alder reaction.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chloroprene</b> is {{produced}} in three steps from 1,3-butadiene: (i) chlorination, (ii) isomerization of part of the product stream, and (iii) dehydrochlorination of 3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chloroprene</b> is a monomer for the {{production}} of synthetic rubbers such as Neoprene. It is produced from butadiene in a three-step process. The first step is the liquid- or vapour-phase chlorination of butadiene to a mixture of 3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene and 1,4-dichlorobut-2-ene (both isomers). In the second step, the mixture of 1,4-dichlorobut-2-ene and 3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene is isomerized to pure 3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene by heating to temperatures of 60-120 °C {{in the presence of a}} catalyst. Finally, dehydrochlorination (elimination of hydrogen chloride) of 3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene with dilute sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of polymerization inhibitors gives crude <b>chloroprene.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ira Williams (1894-1977) was a DuPont chemist at DuPont’s Jackson Laboratory in New Jersey, who in 1930 made {{commercial}} Neoprene {{possible by}} producing a soft, plastic form of <b>chloroprene</b> {{that could be}} processed by the rubber industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{most heavily}} practiced {{reaction}} of alkenes, dienes included, is polymerization. 1,3-Butadiene is {{a precursor to}} rubber used in tires, and isoprene is the precursor to natural rubber. <b>Chloroprene</b> is related {{but it is a}} synthetic monomer.|$|E

Polychloroprene is better known to the public as Neoprene, the trade name given by DuPont.|$|E
5000|$|At one time, <b>chloroprene</b> (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene), an industrially {{important}} monomer, {{was produced}} via the intermediacy of vinyl acetylene. [...] In this process, acetylene is dimerized to give vinyl acetylene, {{which is then}} combined with hydrogen chloride to give 4-chloro-1,2-butadiene via 1,4-addition.

5000|$|One {{synthetic}} route to 4dendralene starts from <b>chloroprene.</b> [...] This compound {{is converted to}} a Grignard reagent by action of magnesium metal which is then reacted with copper(I) chloride to an organocopper intermediate which is in turn dimerized using copper(II) chloride in an oxidative coupling reaction to give the butadiene dimer called 4dendralene.|$|E
50|$|Neoprene is {{produced}} by free-radical polymerization of <b>chloroprene.</b> In commercial production, this polymer is prepared by free radical emulsion polymerization. Polymerization is initiated using potassium persulfate. Bifunctional nucleophiles, metal oxides (e.g. zinc oxide), and thioureas are used to crosslink individual polymer strands. Outside of Russia and China, about 300,000 tons of neoprene are produced annually.|$|E
