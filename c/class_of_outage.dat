40|$|The user {{experience}} for networked applications {{is becoming a}} key benchmark for customers and network providers. Perceived {{user experience}} is largely determined by the frequency, duration and severity of network events that impact a service. While today’s networks implement sophisticated infrastructure that issues alarms for most failures, there remains a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> silent <b>outages</b> (e. g., caused by configuration errors) that are not detected. Further, existing alarms provide little information to help operators understand the impact of network events on services. Attempts to address this through infrastructure that monitors end-to-end performance for customers have been hampered by the cost of deployment and by the volume of data generated by these solutions. We present an alternative approach that pushes monitoring to applications on end systems and uses their collective view to detect network events {{and their impact on}} services- an approach we call Crowdsourcing Event Monitoring (CEM). This paper presents a general framework for CEM systems and demonstrates its effectiveness for a P 2 P application using a large dataset gathered from BitTorrent users and confirmed network events from two ISPs. We discuss how we designed and deployed a prototype CEM implementation as an extension to BitTorrent. This system performs online service-level network event detection through passive monitoring and correlation of performance in end-users’ applications...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, new <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> lower bounds on the outage error {{probability}} {{and on the}} mean-square-error (MSE) in Bayesian parameter estimation are proposed. The minima of the h-outage {{error probability}} and the MSE are obtained by the generalized maximum a-posteriori probability and the minimum MSE (MMSE) estimators, respectively. However, computation of these estimators and their corresponding performance is usually not tractable and thus, lower bounds on these terms can be very useful for performance analysis. The proposed <b>class</b> <b>of</b> lower bounds on the outage error probability is derived using Holder's inequality. This class is utilized to derive a new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> Bayesian MSE bounds. It is shown that for unimodal symmetric conditional probability density functions (pdf) the tightest probability <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> error lower bound in the proposed class attains the minimum probability <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> error and the tightest MSE bound coincides with the MMSE performance. In addition, it is shown that the proposed MSE bounds are always tighter than the Ziv-Zakai lower bound (ZZLB). The proposed bounds are compared with other existing performance lower bounds via some examples. Comment: submitted to IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory (Journal paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This paper derives bounds on the {{diversity}} order and high SNR probability <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> behavior <b>of</b> wireless relay networks with arbitrary link connectivity between cooperating terminals. Single and multiple antennas per terminal are considered. Two general codebook generation schemes are analyzed and compared. Common codebook generation involves {{the source and}} all relays sharing a common randomly generated codebook, and encompasses many practical encoding schemes, including both repetition coding and space-time coding. Independent codebook generation involves the source and all relays employing independent randomly generated codebooks, and provides an information theoretic lower bound on the probability <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> <b>of</b> all achievable codebook generation schemes. The results indicate that although independent codebook generation does not offer any diversity gain over common codebook generation, it can offer a significant probability <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> improvement under certain conditions.

30|$|As {{shown in}} both Figures 9 and 10, the number <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> UEs and the UE’s average {{throughput}} change {{depending on the}} ratio of PRBs. This is because bias values that minimizes the number <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> UEs also differ according to the ratio of RBs between MBS and PBS. The number <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> UEs changes depending on the ratio of PRBs. In spite of the rough interval, Q-learning, the red line of Figure 9, has fewer outage UEs than no learning schemes at almost all ratios of RBs. This means if UEs define their own bias values, we can get fewer outage UEs. When the ratio of PRBs is 20 %, no learning schemes have fewer outage UEs than Q-learning scheme. Many UEs have a small difference between macro and pico received powers enough for the common bias value to occupy all RBs at this ratio. Of course, our proposal can also occupy all RBs at this ratio, however its ε-greedy policy’s occasional random actions make a bit more outage UEs. That is why no learning schemes can keep the number <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> UEs smaller {{than that of the}} proposed scheme. In this figure, no learning (best bias value) represents the minimum value of the number <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> UEs among the schemes using common bias value. Since the best bias value changes depending on some factors, no learning (fixed bias value) has more outage UEs than no learning (best bias value).|$|R

Simulation results have shown that the system performance <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> probability with the proposal outperforms the fixed PA algorithms, and much less power is needed to achieve the same outage probability at the same effective rate.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the optimal {{transmission}} rate in ad hoc wireless networks is analyzed. The performance metric {{used in the}} analysis is probability <b>of</b> <b>outage.</b> In our system model, users/packets arrive randomly {{in space and time}} according to a Poisson point process, and are thereby transmitted to their intended destinations using either ALOHA or CSMA as the MAC protocol. Our model is based on an SINR requirement, i. e., the received SINR must be above some predetermined threshold value, for the whole duration of a packet, in order for the transmission to be considered successful. If {{this is not the case}} an outage has occurred. In order to analyze how the transmission rate affects the probability <b>of</b> <b>outage,</b> we assume packets of K bits, and let the packet duration, T, vary. The nodes in the network then transmit packets with a requested transmission rate of Rreq=K/T bits per second. We incorporate transmission rate into already existing lower bounds on the probability <b>of</b> <b>outage</b> <b>of</b> ALOHA and CSMA, and use these expressions to find the optimal packet duration that minimizes the probability <b>of</b> <b>outage.</b> For the ALOHA protocol, we derive an analytic expression for the optimal spectral efficiency of the network as a function of path loss, which is used to find the optimal packet duration Topt.
