40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to assess the {{validity}} and applicability of medical negligence as a novus actus interveniens, with reference to recent South African criminal case law. Such an assessment necessitates an analysis of the most important rules pertaining to causation in South African criminal law.

The judicial 'grading' of <b>criminal</b> medical <b>negligence</b> as 'gross' or 'overwhelming', with reference to relevant case law, is also explored and criticised. It is submitted that the courts should avoid 'grading' medical negligence by way of policy considerations to establish the absence of a novus actus interveniens. They should rather make a principled assessment of medical negligence, with due consideration to the concepts of medical misadventure and professional errors of judgement. More often than not, a principled assessment will lead to a finding that there was no medical negligence and consequently no novus actus interveniens, even in the face of adverse consequences...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{critical}} examination of the boundaries of recklessness and negligence in English and Welsh criminal law and {{of the extent to}} which these mentes reae terms reflect the leading theories of culpability. The general principle requiring mens rea to be established before criminal liability is justified stems from the maxim ‘actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea’, and the historical foundations of this concept will be analysed to assess whether there can be criminal liability for inadvertent conduct whilst still upholding this tenet. The interpretation of recklessness and negligence has proven to be problematic as both have included inadvertent actions and subjective and objective labels have been employed inconsistently, exacerbating an already difficult situation. What becomes clear is that the recent judicial pronouncements that have given rise this state of affairs is the result of a desire for flexibility so that justice can be done in a particular case, but this has culminated in a lack of transparency and some confusion. The aim of this work is to determine appropriate limits for <b>criminal</b> recklessness and <b>negligence</b> with regard to serious offences. Over the last century recklessness has had three main interpretations, none of which are satisfactory as will be demonstrated. This is partly because they cannot be adequately underpinned by the theories of choice and character, the leading theories of culpability. Further, the objective/subjective labels attached to the three interpretations are inaccurate and misleading, with the potential for injustice. Accordingly, other culpability theories are scrutinised and a new interpretation of recklessness is advocated in an attempt to provide a more consistent philosophical and practical approach to determining <b>criminal</b> recklessness and <b>negligence...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a normative yet practical {{account of how}} Scots and English criminal law should assess the culpability of careless persons. At present, the law in both jurisdictions distinguishes between two types of culpable, unjustified risktaking: recklessness and negligence. In everyday language, these concepts have blurred edges: persons are labelled “reckless” or “negligent” with little thought to the difference, if any, that exists between these terms. Although unproblematic in the “everyday” context, this laxity in definition is inappropriate in the <b>criminal</b> courtroom. <b>Negligence</b> is not usually a sufficient form of culpability for serious offences, whilst recklessness typically is. In the most serious crimes, recklessness thus marks the limit of criminal liability. The concept ought, therefore, to be well understood and developed. Unfortunately, courts both {{north and south of}} the border have had difficulty defining and distinguishing between recklessness and negligence. This thesis explores the resulting jurisprudential quagmires and contends that, in both jurisdictions, the absence of a visible theory of culpable carelessness accounts for the courts’ difficulties. It then looks to criminal law theory to construct a defensible account of culpable carelessness which can distinguish clearly between recklessness and negligence and explain the circumstances in which the latter ought to be criminally culpable. Finally, the thesis considers the practical implications of this theory...|$|R

There is a possibility the victim or aggrieved heirs in case of accident does not want the case because there has been a continued peace with the perpetrator of the accident, or because the victim has received compensation from the perpetrator of the accident and felt he had enough and did not bother to prolong the case. 	The {{purpose of this study was}} to obtain data on the post mortem functions for the public prosecutor in the prosecution of <b>criminal</b> cases of <b>negligence</b> that caused the death of people.

40|$|Court {{citation}} {{practice is}} an objective measure of judicial behavior which, {{it can be}} hypothesized, will vary {{with the type of}} issue before the court. Variation in citation practice that can be related to {{the subject matter of the}} suit before the court may provide useful information about the judicial process attorneys and legal scholars alike. What sources of knowledge do courts turn to when providing authority for their decisions? What sources are seen as legitimate, and thus given legitimacy by citation in court opinions? By studying the citation practices of the New York Court of Appeals, the author hopes to quantify the influence of various sources (e. g. cases; statutes; legal treatises; law reviews and legal periodicals; etc.) and the legitimacy of the use of some sources. This information is relevant to two audiences: scholars interested in judicial decision making, and practicing lawyers who seek to understand which legal reasoning sources best persuade the court. In this study, the citation practices of the New York Court of Appeals were analyzed through the use of sample cases from particular areas of law selected from three different years (1963, 1973, and 1983). Cases from four different areas of law were sampled: constitutional, criminal, 2 ̆ 2 concriminal 2 ̆ 2 (cases falling within both the constitutional and <b>criminal</b> categories), and <b>negligence.</b> Differences in citation practice over time and between types of cases were found. Court citation practice in particular areas of law varied widely.

Suits containing negligence issues generally cited to more authority than those involving criminal issues. In all of these groups, differences were found in the types of authority cited by the court.
