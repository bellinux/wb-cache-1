40|$|AbstractObjectivesIt {{is still}} unclear whether {{residual}} defects seen after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) have clinical consequences. We investigated prevalence of residual defects in the carotid artery and their possible impact on clinical and Duplex ultrasound (DUS) follow-up. Materials and methodsSixty-five patients who had undergone CEA were prospectively examined with 1 – 3 month postoperative computed tomographic angiography (CTA), clinical and DUS follow-up. Defects in common (CCA), external (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were scored as <b>clamp</b> <b>marks,</b> intimal step or flap, mural thrombus, kink, microdehiscence suture or residual stenosis. ResultsFifty-eight patients (89. 2 %) had residual defects in CCA, ECA or ICA (143 defects). Intimal steps (n =  39) and residual stenosis (n =  17) were most noted defects. Only residual defects in ECA {{were significantly associated with}} significant higher PSV values both at short-term and long-term follow-up (1990 vs. 1400  mm s− 1 at 1 year and 2000 vs. 1230  mm s− 1 at 2 years, P-values 0. 031 and 0. 016). ConclusionCarotid artery residual defects on CTA after CEA are very common, simple fingerprints of the operative procedure, have no clear consequence. When CTA is performed clinically after CEA, knowledge of high prevalence and type of defects detected on CTA may be of importance for radiologists and clinicians...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To date, the {{incidence}} and clinical relevance of arterial stenosis at clamp sites after femoropopliteal bypass surgery is unknown. METHODS: Ninety-four patients underwent a femoropopliteal bypass {{in which the}} arterial inflow and outflow clamp sites were controlled by the Fogarty-Soft-Inlay <b>clamp</b> and <b>marked</b> with an hemoclip. The number of pre-existing atherosclerotic segments, clamp force, and clamp time were recorded and the occurrence of a stenosis at the clamp site was determined. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 83 months, a significant stenosis was confirmed at 23 of the 178 clamp sites (12. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval 8. 4 to 18. 8). The mean number of pre-existing atherosclerotic segments (P =. 28) and the mean clamp force (P =. 55) was similar between the groups with and without a stenosis. There {{was a significant difference}} regarding clamp time between the group with and without a stenosis (38 minutes and 26 minutes, P =. 001). CONCLUSION: Arterial clamping, even with the Fogarty-Soft-Inlay clamp, can lead to clamp stenosis and seems {{to be related to the}} duration of clamping, but not to pre-existent atherosclerotic burden.

40|$|The genomes of bacteriophages T 4 and RB 69 are phylogenetically related but diverge in {{nucleotide}} sequence at many loci and are incompatible {{with each other}} in vivo. We describe here the biological implications of divergence in a genomic segment that encodes four essential DNA replication proteins: gp 45 (sliding clamp), gp 44 / 62 complex (clamp loader), and gp 46 (a recombination protein). We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed several overlapping segments of the RB 69 gene 46 - 45. 2 -(rpbA) - 45 - 44 - 62 cluster and compared its features to those of the homologous gene cluster from T 4. The deduced primary structures of all four RB 69 replication proteins and gp 45. 2 from this cluster are very similar (80 to 95 % similarity) to those of their respective T 4 homologs. In contrast, the rpbA region (which encodes a nonessential protein in T 4) is highly diverged (∼ 49 % similarity) between the two phage genomes and does not encode protein in RB 69. Expression studies and patterns of high divergence of intercistronic {{nucleotide sequence}}s of this cluster suggest that T 4 and RB 69 evolved similar transcriptional and translational control strategies for the cistrons contained therein, but with different specificities. In plasmid-phage complementation assays, we show that posttranslationally, RB 69 and T 4 homologs of gp 45 and the gp 44 / 62 complex can be effectively exchanged between the two phage replicase assemblies; however, we also show results which suggest that mixed clamp loader complexes consisting of T 4 gp 62 and RB 69 gp 44 subunits are not active for phage DNA replication. Thus, specificity of the gp 44 -gp 62 interaction in the <b>clamp</b> loader <b>marks</b> a point of departure between the T 4 and RB 69 replication systems...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare an in vivo test of whole-body glycolysis, the deuterated-glucose {{disposal}} test (2 H-GDT), with insulin sensitivity measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp and the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) test. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The 2 H-GDT consists of an oral glucose challenge containing deuterated glucose, followed by measurement of heavy water (2 H 2 O) production, which represents whole-body glycolytic disposal of the glucose load. 2 H 2 O produc-tion is corrected for ambient insulin concentration as an index of tissue insulin sensitivity. The 2 H-GDT was compared with euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps in healthy lean sub-jects (n 8) and subjects with the metabolic syndrome (n 9) and with the SSPG test in overweight (n 12) and obese (n 6) subjects. RESULTS — A strong correlation with the clamp was observed for the 75 -g and 30 -g 2 H-GDT (r 0. 95, P 0. 0001 and r 0. 88, P 0. 0001, respectively).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia in {{patients}} undergoing {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) is associated with adverse outcome. Although insulin infusion strategies are increasingly used to improve outcome, a pathophysiological rationale is currently lacking. The present {{study was designed to}} quantify the effects of a perioperative hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp on the neurohumoral stress response during CABG. METHODS: Forty-four nondiabetic patients, scheduled for elective CABG, were randomized to either a control group (n = 22) receiving standard care or to a clamp group (n = 22) receiving additionally a perioperative hyperinsulinemic (regular insulin at a fixed rate of 0. 1 IU. kg(- 1). h(- 1)) normoglycemic (plasma glucose between 3. 0 and 6. 0 mmol. liter(- 1)) clamp during 26 h. We measured the endocrine response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the sympathoadrenal axis, and glucagon, as well as plasma glucose and insulin at regular intervals from the induction of anesthesia at baseline {{through the end of the}} second postoperative day (POD). RESULTS: There were no differences in clinical outcome between the groups. In the control group, hyperglycemia developed at the end of surgery and remained present until the final measurement point on POD 2, whereas plasma insulin levels remained unchanged until the morning of POD 1. In the intervention group, normoglycemia was well maintained during the clamp, whereas insulin levels ranged between 600 and 800 pmol. liter(- 1). In both groups, plasma ACTH and cortisol increased from 6 h after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass onward. However, during the <b>clamp</b> period, a <b>marked</b> reduction in the HPA axis response was found in the intervention group, as reflected by a 47 % smaller increase in area under the curve in plasma ACTH (P = 0. 035) and a 27 % smaller increase in plasma cortisol (P = 0. 002) compared with the control group. Compared with baseline, epinephrine and norepinephrine increased by the end of the clamp interval until POD 2 in both groups. Surprisingly, the area under the curve of epinephrine levels was 47 % higher (P = 0. 026) after the clamp interval in the intervention group as compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: A hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp during CABG delays and attenuates the HPA axis response during the first 18 h of the myocardial reperfusion period, whereas after the clamp, plasma epinephrine is higher. The impact of delaying cortisol responses on clinical outcome of CABG remains to be elucidate...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system and carbohydrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity in essential hypertension has not been investigated systematically. Twenty nondiabetic patients (age, 49 +/- 1 years; body mass index (BMI), 26. 1 +/- 0. 4 kg/m 2) with essential hypertension (blood pressure, 155 +/- 3 / 105 +/- 1 mm Hg) received an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) {{at the end of}} a 1 -month placebo period and again monthly during 3 months of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (cilazapril, 5 mg/day). Furthermore, a two-step euglycemic insulin clamp was performed after placebo and again at the end of treatment. Blood pressure fell by 7 +/- 4 / 10 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0. 001), while BMI remained stable. On the euglycemic clamp, insulin-mediated (plasma insulin, 470 pM) whole body glucose use averaged 42. 5 +/- 1. 6 mumol. min- 1. kg- 1 before and 43. 6 +/- 1. 9 after ACE inhibition (p = NS). Substrate concentrations and oxidative rates and energy expenditure (as estimated by indirect calorimetry) were not altered by ACE inhibition, either in the fasting state or in response to insulin. In contrast, oral glucose tolerance was significantly (p less than 0. 05) improved after treatment (area under OGTT curve (AUC), 240 +/- 24 versus 282 +/- 23 mmol 2 hr. l- 1). The latter change was associated with enhanced (+ 16 %, p less than 0. 05) insulin responsiveness to glucose (estimated as the insulin AUC divided by the glucose AUC) throughout the 3 months of ACE inhibition. At baseline, both the OGTT and the <b>clamp</b> had a <b>marked</b> hypokalemic effect (mean decrements in plasma potassium of 0. 75 +/- 0. 05 and 0. 92 +/- 0. 05 mmol/l, respectively) in association with plasma aldosterone reductions of 30 % and 50 %. Chronic ACE inhibition caused a further 20 % (p less than 0. 03) lowering of plasma aldosterone concentrations but attenuated insulin-induced hypokalemia. Plasma sodium, which was unaltered by the pretreatment tests, fell during the posttreatment tests (by 3 mmol/l, p less than 0. 001). In the urine, the ratio of the fractional excretion of potassium to that of sodium was decreased by both oral glucose (- 22 %, p less than 0. 01) and ACE inhibition (- 21 %, p less than 0. 001). Higher plasma potassium levels before treatment predicted a better blood pressure response to ACE inhibition (r = 0. 60, p less than 0. 005) ...|$|R
