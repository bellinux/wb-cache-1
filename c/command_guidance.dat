25|$|A future goal is {{to develop}} {{projectiles}} that are self-guided - a necessary requirement to hit distant targets or intercepting missiles. When the guided rounds are developed, the Navy is projecting each round to cost about $25,000, though {{it must be noted}} that developing guided projectiles for guns has a history of doubling or tripling initial cost estimates.

25|$|The RP-76 was {{designed}} to fly a pre-programmed trajectory on autopilot, with radio <b>command</b> <b>guidance</b> being optional.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} {{is designed to}} the guidance of rocket-propelled missile with multiple object constraints. It allows the rocket-propelled missile to reach its target with a close to zero falling angle at a least time-of-flight (TOF). Instead of deriving the optimum guidance law {{by a series of}} linear quadratic optimization methods which results in guidance laws being complex, the new guidance law adopts a mixed framework composed of a modified PN <b>guidance</b> <b>command</b> and a TOF <b>guidance</b> <b>command.</b> The modified PN guidance is designed based on measured state information including missile position, flight-path angle and acceleration, which yields zero-miss-distance and zero-falling-angle. The TOF <b>guidance</b> <b>command</b> is determined in quadratic multinomial with respect to TOF error that is estimated with missile velocity reduction due to aerodynamic drag. Simulation results are presented to show that the proposed guidance law performs favorably in multiple object constraints...|$|R
25|$|In 1954 {{the first}} Air Radar Recruit School was activated, the first {{early warning radar}} systems were {{installed}} {{and the concept of}} command & control facilities at mountain summits was introduced; leading to acquisition of the FLORIDA early warning and <b>command</b> <b>guidance</b> system in 1965 followed by the current FLORAKO system in 2003. At the same time, ground-based air defence projects were initiated such as radar-equipped medium-caliber guns with an integrated 63 Superfledermaus (Superbat) fire control system' as well as the BL-64 ‘Bloodhound’ air defence missile system (1964–1999).|$|E
25|$|The primary {{weapon of}} the KingCobra {{was to be}} the new wire-guided BGM-71 TOW {{anti-tank}} missile, which had proven highly effective in combat test firings in Vietnam from Huey gunships. This weapon could be carried in a pack of four missiles, with one pack under each stub wing for a total of eight missiles. On launch, the TOW trailed out wires to communicate <b>command</b> <b>guidance</b> updates. The missile had two infrared flares on its tail to allow the SMS to track it. All the gunner had to do was keep the target in his sight, and the missile fire control system adjusted its flight appropriately. Both the gunner and the pilot had Sperry Univac helmet-mounted sights to allow them to acquire targets for the KingCobra's missiles and gun.|$|E
25|$|T-72B3 (Ob'yekt 184-M3): this upgrade was {{initiated}} in 2010 using old stocks of T-72B tanks held in reserve. In addition to performing a general overhaul of every vehicle, certain tanks were {{equipped with the}} more powerful V-92S2 engines, a new steering system in the driver's compartment and older tracks were replaced with the new universal, twin-pin design. The upgrade program focuses instead on improving the tank's firepower, mainly through {{the implementation of the}} Kalina fire control system, albeit in a simplified form. The tank commander retains an upgraded version of the legacy TKN-3MK sight, which is a passive device with a range of only 600 m at night, but is augmented with a monitor that displays thermal imagery from the gunner's main sight. The commander also has a new turret control panel. The gunner still has the 1A40-4 FCS with 1K13-49 sight, but these are now part of the auxiliary sighting system to complement the new PNM Sosna-U panoramic multi-spectral sensor, which replaced the TPN-3-49 in its mounting. The Sosna-U is a multi-channel, panoramic sight stabilized in both vertical and horizontal axes with a built-in laser rangefinder and <b>command</b> <b>guidance</b> module used with 9M119M missiles. The most advantageous aspect of the Sosna-U is the Thales Catherine-FC thermal imager which extends the detection and identification range of a tank-sized target to 10,500 m and 2,200 m respectively, at night/day and in all weather combat conditions. The T-72B3 series vehicles also received the new 2A46M5 main gun which has a dispersion value significantly lower than previous generations, and reportedly equivalent to the Rheinmetall Rh120 L/44 cannon. The gun laying and stabilization drives were also replaced with the new 2E42-4 system and the AZ ammunition auto-loader was appropriately modified to accommodate newer generations of long-rod (up to 730mm) saboted kinetic energy anti-tank ammunition: the Svinets-1 (using a depleted uranium penetrator) and Svinets-2 (sintered tungsten alloy) rounds, which were fielded in 2002 and reportedly capable of defeating 740–800mm and 660–740mm of RHA at 2,000 m respectively. Only the most recent T-72B3 tanks however feature this capability. Furthermore, the B3 upgrade includes a new explosion and fire suppression system, as well as an advanced VHF radio system designated R-168-25U-2 AKVEDUK. Entered service on 19 October 2012. First delivered to the 20th Field Army in summer 2013 and its Armored Guards Brigade in October 2013. More than 1,000 such tanks are currently in service.|$|E

500|$|To {{ensure the}} {{destruction}} of the RV, or at least render the warhead within it unusable, the W31 would have to be fired when it was within a few hundred feet of the RV. Given the angular resolution of existing radars, this limited range significantly.

500|$|The VB-13, redesignated ASM-A-1 in 1948, was {{developed}} under the project code MX-674. It had an annular wing around the midsection of its body, mounted near the weapon's center of gravity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a neural network assisted entry guidance law {{that is designed}} by applying Bézier approximation. It is shown that a fully constrained approximation of a reference trajectory {{can be made by}} using the Bézier curve. Applying this approximation, an inverse dynamic system for an entry flight is solved to generate <b>guidance</b> <b>command.</b> The <b>guidance</b> solution thus gotten ensures terminal constraints for position, flight path, and azimuth angle. In order to ensure terminal velocity constraint, a prediction of the terminal velocity is required, based on which, the approximated Bézier curve is adjusted. An artificial neural network is used for this prediction of the terminal velocity. The method enables faster implementation in achieving fully constrained entry flight. Results from simulations indicate improved performance of the neural network assisted method. The scheme is expected to have prospect for further research on automated onboard control of terminal velocity for both reentry and terminal guidance laws...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to the derivation of homing guidance laws for interceptor missiles that makes use of linear-quadratic optimal control in a different manner than the traditional approaches. Instead of looking only for the minimization of the miss distance and the integral square of the <b>guidance</b> <b>command,</b> the new criterion penalizes also the "variability" of the <b>guidance</b> <b>command.</b> The solution has the familiar structure of traditional linear-quadratic guidance laws, of a zero-effort-miss term multiplied by a, possibly time-varying, gain. Still it differs in one essential feature: The navigation gain does not only depend on the time to go, but also on the total time of flight. The new guidance law also has an additional design parameter that can be profitably used to avoid acceleration saturation. © 2014 by the authors...|$|R
