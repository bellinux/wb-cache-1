5|$|In 1978 the hijacked 727-100 {{aircraft}} was sold by Northwest to Piedmont Airlines {{where it was}} re-registered N838N and continued in domestic carrier service. In 1984 it was purchased by the now-defunct <b>charter</b> <b>company</b> Key Airlines, re-registered N29KA, and incorporated into the Air Force's civilian charter fleet that shuttled workers between Nellis Air Force Base and the Tonopah Test Range during the top-secret F-117 Nighthawk development program. In 1996 the {{aircraft was}} scrapped for parts in a Memphis boneyard.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Goldstein and Travis Barker began collaborating {{under the}} name TRV$DJAM. They {{performed}} at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards on September 7, 2008. On September 19, after performing at a college event, he and Barker were aboard a Learjet 60 when it crashed upon takeoff in Columbia, South Carolina. The crash killed both crew members {{and the other two}} passengers, a security guard and Barker's assistant, critically injuring Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein suffered third-degree burns to his arm and parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. Moore flew to be by Goldstein's side in hospital, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's <b>charter</b> <b>company,</b> Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence {{on the part of the}} pilots, and a manufacturing defect on part of the plane. He asked for damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement and loss of earnings. The lawsuit was settled by his estate in 2010, a year after his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposal}} of the C-130As took almost a decade, {{with the process}} being subject to a police investigation. Attempts to sell the Hercules by tender during 1978 and 1979 were unsuccessful, and the American law firm Ford and Vlahos was appointed the sales agent for the aircraft in 1981. One was sold to the French Government in 1983 and subsequently transferred to the Chadian Air Force. Another two Hercules were sold to the Colombian <b>charter</b> <b>company</b> Aviaco in 1983, but the US State Department vetoed the deal shortly before {{it was to have}} been completed over suspicions that the aircraft would be used to smuggle drugs into the United States. A C-130A was transferred to the newly established company International Air Aid and leased to the International Red Cross to fly humanitarian supplies into Ethiopia during 1986, but this contract was cancelled after the C-130's pilot was accused by the Ethiopian government of photographing a military area. The Australian Federal Police eventually charged two people with defrauding the Commonwealth and conspiracy in relation to these attempts to dispose of the C-130As. Eventually, four of the C-130As were sold to Aboitiz Air Transport Corporation in May 1988 and another four were acquired by the Fowler Aeronautical Corporation the next year. Two of the remaining three aircraft were retained by the RAAF for training and heritage purposes, and the final C-130A was scrapped.|$|E

25|$|Metro {{production}} {{ended in}} 1998; however {{by this time}} Regional Jets were in vogue and turboprop types were out of favour with airlines, and several airframes remained unsold at the factory. The final aircraft, Metro 23 c/n DC-904B, was not delivered (to air <b>charter</b> <b>company</b> National Jet Aviation Services of Zelienople, Pennsylvania) until 2001. A total of 703 Metro, Expediter, Merlin IV series and C-26 series aircraft were built. In addition, 158 other SA226 and SA227 series aircraft were built as short-fuselage Merlin IIIs, IIIAs and IIIBs.|$|E
25|$|Prince Leo Golitsyn {{escaped from}} Soviet Russia during World War I {{and came to}} settle in Canada by 1929 in Edson, Alberta. He and his wife {{purchased}} 420 acres of land, one-quarter section from M. Silva and a half-section from Neil Armstrong. Most of the property bordered the McLeod River. Other than the 110 acres of farm land, they owned 5 pairs of foxes, poultry, horses and cattle. Golitsyn, together with his wife, an Egyptian Princess, bought an airplane and started a <b>charter</b> <b>company</b> at Bear Lake. After the Princess died during a vacation to Europe, Leo moved to Hollywood where he was seen acting in various films as an extra. His most notable works are The Razor's Edge (1946 film) and The Chocolate Soldier.|$|E

25|$|Air Mail {{was a hit}} and as {{word spread}} about his success in getting through the hangar unscathed, Mantz found more work and his {{professional}} ideas about stunt flying were gradually accepted by the studios. United Air Services, Paul's fledgling company at United Airport in Burbank, offered readily-available aircraft and pilots, standard rates and insurance to protect producers from the financial risks of accidents and downtime. Mantz's company grew steadily along with the public's fascination for flying as the studios made increasing numbers of aviation related films. His Paul Mantz Air Services air <b>charter</b> <b>company</b> (jokingly christened the Honeymoon Express) also flourished and became a favorite among Hollywood stars, many of whom, such as Clark Gable and James Cagney became friends. One of his helicopters appears in the Errol Flynn factual short film, Cruise of the Zaca (1952), as featured on the 2 disc Special Edition DVD of The Adventures of Robin Hood.|$|E
25|$|Other pilots at the <b>charter</b> <b>company</b> told NTSB that pilot Richard Conry {{and first}} officer (co-pilot) Michael Guess had both {{displayed}} below-average flying skills. Conry had a well-known tendency to allow copilots {{to take over}} all aircraft functions {{as if they were}} the sole pilot during flights. After the crash, three copilots told of occasions on which they had had to take control of the aircraft away from Conry. After one of those incidents, only three days before the crash, the copilot (not Guess) had urged Conry to retire. In a post-accident interview, Conry's longtime friend and fellow aviator Timothy Cooney said that he had last spoken to Conry in June 2001 and had expressed concerns about difficulties he had flying King Airs as late as April of that year, 18 months before the accident. Significant discrepancies were also found in the captain's flight logs in the course of the post-accident investigation, indicating he had probably greatly exaggerated his flying experience, most of which had been accrued before a 9–10 year hiatus from flying due to a fraud conviction and poor eyesight. He had had Lasik surgery but it had improved his vision to only 20/50 or 20/30 and he was required by FAA regulations to wear corrective lenses, but the pilot's wife and Cooney said Conry did not wear lenses after the surgery. The coroner who examined his badly burned body was unable to determine whether Conry was wearing contact lenses at the time of the crash.|$|E
