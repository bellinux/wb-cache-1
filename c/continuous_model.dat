50|$|Discontinuous {{dynamical}} systems exist {{everywhere in}} the real world. One used to adopt <b>continuous</b> <b>models</b> for approximate descriptions of discontinuous dynamical systems. However, such <b>continuous</b> <b>modeling</b> cannot provide adequate predictions of discontinuous dynamical systems, and also makes the problems solving be more complicated and inaccurate. In the real world, the discontinuous modeling of dynamical systems is absolute, but the <b>continuous</b> <b>modeling</b> is relative. In other words, the continuous description of dynamical systems is an approximation of the discontinuous problems.|$|R

30|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>models</b> {{simulate}} the agent movement on a coordinate system within the environment. <b>Continuous</b> <b>models</b> re-calculate the coordinates {{of the agents}} at every time-step in order to depict their movement. They offer the flexibility to simulate occupant behaviours which may be sensitive to occupant location, orientation and inter-distance among the agents. These features are important to simulate high-rise building evacuations, in particular for the case where high population densities arise, since <b>continuous</b> <b>models</b> are not sensitive to the type and characteristics of the network employed (Nilsson 2007). The main disadvantage of these tools is the computational time needed to simulate complex scenarios, i.e. generally higher than the time needed with fine and coarse node models.|$|R

These outputs can easily lull the viewer into {{a false sense}} of security, and lead the viewer to forget that every measurement should have an associated uncertainty. The need for uncertainties to be associated with model results and visualisations of results leads to two questions that need to be asked for each visualisation: What is the uncertainty associated with the visualisation process? How can uncertainties derived from <b>continuous</b> <b>models</b> be visualised most effectively? This report aims to answer these questions. Some of the points made are illustrated in a case study derived from a thermal metrology problem. NPL Report CMSC 39 / 0...|$|R

40|$|Fluidification {{constitutes}} a relaxation technique for studying discrete event systems through fluidified approximated models, thus avoiding the state explosion problem. Moreover, {{the class of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>models</b> thus obtained may be interesting in itself. In Petri nets, fluidification leads to the so called continuous Petri nets, that are technically hybrid models. Under infinite server semantics, timing a <b>continuous</b> Petri net <b>model</b> preserves the liveness property, but the converse is not necessarily true, and if the autonomous net model is not live, the timing may transform it into live.

5000|$|Discrete vs. continuous: A {{discrete}} model treats objects as discrete, {{such as the}} particles in a molecular model or the states in a statistical model; while a <b>continuous</b> <b>model</b> represents the objects in a continuous manner, such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows, temperatures and stresses in a solid, and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{psychologists have}} {{characterized}} the temporal properties of {{human information processing}} in terms of discrete and <b>continuous</b> <b>models.</b> Discrete models postulate that component mental processes transmit {{a finite number of}} intermittent outputs (quanta) of information over time, whereas <b>continuous</b> <b>models</b> postulate that information is transmitted in a gradual fashion. These pos-tulates may be tested by using an adaptive response-priming procedure and anal-ysis of reaction-time mixture distributions. Three experiments based on this pro-cedure and analysis are reported. The experiments involved varying the temporal interval between the onsets of a prime stimulus and a subsequent est stimulus to which a response had to be made. Reaction time was measured {{as a function of the}} duration of the priming interval and the type of prime stimulus. Discrete models predict that manipulations of the priming interval should yield a family of reaction-time mixture distributions formed from a finite number of underlying basis distributions, corresponding to distinct preparatory states. <b>Continuous</b> <b>models</b> make a different prediction.

50|$|As {{described}} above, {{experiments have}} used the LRP to generate support for a <b>continuous</b> <b>model</b> of stimulus evaluation and response selection. This model predicts that partial information is continuously available from the environment and information can accumulate to an eventual response or near response that is never actually committed. This {{is in contrast to}} a discrete model that predicts full stimulus evaluation must be complete before response initiation can start. Thus results using the LRP suggest that partial information is accumulated in the sensory systems and is sent to the motor system before and during response preparation (Coles et al., 1988).|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, Pittendrigh's close friend, Aschoff, {{proposed}} a contrasting parametric model of entrainment {{in which he}} proposed that light either lengthened or shortened the endogenous period (τ) while also changing the baseline of oscillation. This parametric model suggested that light may affect the period of circadian oscillation and modify the shape - or waveform - and the level around which the oscillation moved. While Aschoff's <b>continuous</b> <b>model</b> of entrainment has largely fallen to the wayside, {{it is important to}} remember that Aschoff's contributions helped to both address and explain shortcomings in Pittendrigh's nonparametric entrainment model, which is now widely taught and accepted.|$|E

The thesis presents a coherent theory for <b>continuous</b> probabilistic image <b>modeling</b> based on mixture of Gaussians densities. The <b>continuous</b> image <b>modeling</b> is extended to the modeling of an image-set created by a supervised or an unsupervised clustering process. Three ways of obtaining the image-set model are introduced and the difference between them is discussed. Supervised image-set (category) modeling is utilized to compare between the proposed <b>continuous</b> <b>models</b> and the more traditional discrete image modeling based on histograms. The unsupervised image clustering framework is based on a continuous version of a recently introduced information theoretic principle, the information bottleneck (IB).

5000|$|At {{the time}} of Brown's {{graduation}} from Cornell, the theory for magnetic domains was not very developed.

5000|$|These {{approaches}} have one major flaw in common: {{they can only}} detect one emotion from an image, this is generally done by a winner takes it all method. Yet, every day we can perceive more than one emotional category from a single image. Both the categorical and <b>continuous</b> <b>model</b> are unable to identify multiple emotions, so {{a new way to}} model it is to consider new categories as the overlap of a small set of categories.

50|$|In {{cognitive}} science and neuroscience, {{there have been}} two leading models describing how humans perceive and classify emotion. the continuous and the categorical model. The <b>continuous</b> <b>model</b> defines each facial expression of emotion as a feature vector in a face space. This model explains, for example, how expressions of emotion can be seen at different intensities. In contrast, the categorical model consists of C classifiers, each tuned to a specific emotion category.
