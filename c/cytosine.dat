5|$|UV-B light causes {{crosslinking}} between adjacent <b>cytosine</b> and thymine bases creating pyrimidine dimers. This {{is called}} direct DNA damage.|$|E
5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to <b>cytosine.</b> The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas <b>cytosine</b> and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E
50|$|Whole genome {{bisulfite}} sequencing (WGBS), is a next-generation sequencing technology {{used to determine}} the DNA methylation status of single <b>cytosines</b> by treating the DNA with sodium bisulfite before sequencing. Sodium bisulfite is a chemical compound that converts unmethylated <b>cytosines</b> into uracil. The <b>cytosines</b> that haven't converted in uracil are methylated. After sequencing, the unmethylated <b>cytosines</b> appear as thymines.|$|R
50|$|In mammals, 70% to 80% of CpG <b>cytosines</b> are methylated.|$|R

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, {{and one of the}} four bases adenine, <b>cytosine,</b> guanine, and thymine.|$|E
5|$|These codes make {{it easier}} and shorter to write down the amino acid {{sequences}} that make up proteins. The nucleotide bases {{are made up of}} purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (<b>cytosine</b> and thymine or uracil). These nucleotide bases make up DNA and RNA. These nucleotide base codes make the genome of an organism much smaller and easier to read.|$|E
5|$|This {{does not}} appear to be the entire story. Four {{modifications}} to the <b>cytosine</b> residues in human DNA have been reported. These modifications are the addition of methyl (CH3)-, hydroxymethyl (CH2OH)-, formyl (CHO)- and carboxyl (COOH)- groups. These modifications are through to have regulatory functions.|$|E
5000|$|Sequence adapters: Methylated {{sequence}} adapters are ligated to the DNA fragments. The methylated adapter oligonucleotides {{have all}} <b>cytosines</b> replaced with 5’methyl-cytosines, {{in order to}} prevent the deamination of these <b>cytosines</b> in the bisulfite conversion reaction. For reactions to be sequenced using Illumina sequencers, the sequence adapters are used to hybridize to the adapters on the flow cell.|$|R
25|$|Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP), {{which is}} based on a {{chemical}} reaction of sodium bisulfite with DNA that converts unmethylated <b>cytosines</b> of CpG dinucleotides to uracil or UpG, followed by traditional PCR. However, methylated <b>cytosines</b> will not be converted in this process, and primers are designed to overlap the CpG site of interest, which allows one to determine methylation status as methylated or unmethylated.|$|R

The method {{is based on the}} natural degradation processes that occur in ancient DNA: with time, methylated <b>cytosines</b> are degraded into thymines, whereas unmethylated <b>cytosines</b> are degraded into uracils. This asymmetry in degradation signals was used to reconstruct the full methylation maps of the Neanderthal and the Denisovan ...|$|R
5|$|Uracil is {{not usually}} found in DNA, {{occurring}} only as a breakdown product of <b>cytosine.</b> However, in several bacteriophages, Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages PBS1 and PBS2 and Yersinia bacteriophage piR1-37, thymine {{has been replaced by}} uracil. Another phage - Staphylococcal phage S6 - has been identified with a genome where thymine has been replaced by uracil.|$|E
5|$|Building {{blocks of}} DNA (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) {{may have been}} formed extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic {{compounds}} of life, including uracil, <b>cytosine,</b> and thymine, have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, NASA {{scientists}} reported that, for {{the first}} time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, <b>cytosine</b> and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the Universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds, according to the scientists.|$|E
50|$|Besides RNA molecules, {{a plethora}} of {{proteins}} {{are involved in the}} establishment of RdDM, like Argonautes, DNA methyltransferases, chromatin remodelling complexes and the plant-specific Polymerase IV and Polymerase V. All these act in concert to add a methyl-group at the 5' position of <b>cytosines.</b> In contrast to animals, <b>cytosines</b> at all sequence context (CG, CHG, CHH) may get de novo methylated in plants.|$|R

5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and <b>cytosine</b> bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and <b>cytosine.</b> As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|RNA is {{transcribed}} {{with only}} four bases (adenine, <b>cytosine,</b> guanine and uracil), but these bases and attached sugars {{can be modified}} in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I). Inosine {{plays a key role}} in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E

50|$|Sodium {{bisulfite}} {{is used in}} {{the analysis}} of the methylation status of <b>cytosines</b> in DNA.|$|R
50|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{in humans}} {{and most other}} mammals refers to the methylation of a CpG. Methylation of these <b>cytosines</b> are common in DNA, and in sufficient numbers can prevent proteins from attaching to the DNA by obscuring the domain binding site's matching DNA to the protein. Regions in which <b>cytosines</b> prior to guanines are clustered and highly unmethylated are called CpG islands, and often serve as promoters, or transcription start sites.|$|R
5|$|RNAs are a type {{of large}} {{biological}} molecules, whose individual building blocks are called nucleotides. The name poly(A) tail (for polyadenylic acid tail) reflects the way RNA nucleotides are abbreviated, with a letter for the base the nucleotide contains (A for adenine, C for <b>cytosine,</b> G for guanine and U for uracil). RNAs are produced (transcribed) from a DNA template. By convention, RNA sequences are written in a 5' to 3' direction. The 5' end {{is the part of}} the RNA molecule that is transcribed first, and the 3' end is transcribed last. The 3' end is also where the poly(A) tail is found on polyadenylated RNAs.|$|E
5|$|Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a {{polymeric}} molecule {{essential in}} various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute {{the four major}} macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and <b>cytosine)</b> that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.|$|E
5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of <b>cytosine</b> bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E
25|$|High Resolution Melt Analysis (HRM or HRMA), is a post-PCR {{analytical}} technique. The target DNA {{is treated}} with sodium bisulfite, which chemically converts unmethylated <b>cytosines</b> into uracils, while methylated <b>cytosines</b> are preserved. PCR amplification is then {{carried out with}} primers designed to amplify both methylated and unmethylated templates. After this amplification, highly methylated DNA sequences contain a higher number of CpG sites compared to unmethylated templates, which results in a different melting temperature {{that can be used}} in quantitative methylation detection.|$|R
40|$|When human DNA(cytosine- 5) methyltransferase {{was used}} to methylate a series of snapback oligodeoxy-nucleotides of differing stem lengths, each {{containing}} a centrally located CG dinucleotide recognition site, the enzyme required a minimum of 22 base pairs in the stem for maximum activity. Extrahelical <b>cytosines</b> in slipped duplexes that were 30 base pairs in length acted as effective methyl acceptors and were more rapidly methylated than <b>cytosines</b> that were Watson-Crick paired. Duplexes containing hairpins of CCG repeats in cruciform structures in which the enzyme recognition sequence was disrupted by a C. C mispair were also more rapidly methylated than control Watson-Crick-paired duplexes. Since enzymes have higher affinities for their transition states than for their substrates, the results with extrahelical and mispaired <b>cytosines</b> suggest that these structures {{can be viewed as}} analogs of the transition state intermediates produced during catalysis by methyltransferases...|$|R

5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of chromosomes of Azotobacter vinelandii, strain AvOP, is partially determined. This chromosome is a circular DNA molecule which contains 5,342,073 nucleotide pairs and 5,043 genes, of which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of guanine + <b>cytosine</b> pairs is 65 mole percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, {{and in the}} stationary growth phase, cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (one copy) is restored when replanting the culture into a fresh medium. In addition to chromosomal DNA, Azotobacter can contain plasmids.|$|E
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second <b>cytosine</b> and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic amino group, its basicity is low to an extent {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and <b>cytosine</b> bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E
40|$|Methylation‐specific PCR (MSP) is a simple, {{quick and}} cost‐effective method {{to analyze the}} DNA {{methylation}} status of virtually any group of CpG sites within a CpG island. The technique comprises two parts: (1) sodium bisulfite conversion of unmethylated <b>cytosine's</b> to uracil under conditions whereby methylated <b>cytosines</b> remains unchanged and (2) detection of the bisulfite induced sequence differences by PCR using specific primer sets for both unmethylated and methylated DNA.
