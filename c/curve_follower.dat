40|$|AbstractIt {{is shown}} that the extremal {{solutions}} of fixed duration Mayer control problems with implicit terminal constraints {{can be interpreted as}} fixed points of certain function-valued operators F constructed by solving pairs of initial value problems in tandem. A class of simple recursive averaging processes is proposed for approximating the fixed points of F. Results from the theory of monotone Hilbert space operators are used to establish the convergence of the averaging processes for a general linear-quadratic <b>curve</b> <b>follower</b> problem with unbounded control inputs, and for a simple second order bounded control input problem...|$|E

Based on {{the design}} {{parameters}} of disc CAM with the oscillating roller follower and modified trapezoid <b>curve</b> <b>follower</b> motion, by introducing macro program cyclic variable, the mathematical calculation model of macro program about cutter path of disc CAM with the holonomic constraint oscillating roller follower is established. The macro {{program is designed to}} can be adjusted quickly, according to the design parameters and the process parameters. The numerical control program completely parametric design is realized. So it provides programming methods and strategies for numerical control machining macro program design of the oscillating roller follower disc CAM with a complicated movement law...|$|E
40|$|Components {{cannot be}} {{manufactured}} {{according to the}} required nominal dimensions due to inherent variations in workmanship, materials and machine tools. Tolerance specification of part dimensions affects the performance, quality and cost of a product. The proper distribution of tolerance, known as tolerance allocation, reduces the manufacturing cost of a product. Thus, researchers in this field are keenly interested in tolerance allocation. The choice of alternative processes for tolerance allocation also plays {{a vital role in}} reducing manufacturing costs. Near-optimal allocated tolerances are obtained using nontraditional optimization techniques, in which solutions are randomly achieved. However, there is the possibility that a better allocation process will not be discovered because the randomness of the results of successive runs will not yield consistent results. In this work, an attempt has been made to solve the above problem using the Lagrange multiplier (LM) method for complex assembly and the bottom <b>curve</b> <b>follower</b> approach. The methodology has been demonstrated on a wheel mounting assembly. Compared to Singh’s method [14], a 1. 95 % savings in manufacturing cost was achieved after implementing the proposed method. The present method was 30 times faster than the existing methods...|$|E
40|$|The current cam and {{follower}} {{mechanism in}} four stroke internal combustion engine employs a flat follower. In this work an attempt is made to change the flat face of <b>follower</b> to a <b>curved</b> face <b>follower,</b> so that the required point contact can be achieved. As line contact between existing {{cam and follower}} mechanism results in high frictional losses which results in low mechanical efficiency. It is observed that the frequency of vibration in the existing and modified cam and follower mechanism remains almost same. The finite element approach is used to perform the analysis...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a general method for finding the contact point between two moving plane curves. After establishing the general relations, these are applied for real examples, met in engineering. The {{complexity of the}} problem comes out from the fact that, in the general case, the trajectory of the contact point is unknown. Thus, there are considered the rotating cam and oscillating <b>curve</b> face <b>follower,</b> of elliptical profiles; the elliptical rotating cam with flat face –rotating and translating follower mechanism is next analyzed. The case of knife edge follower is obtained as a particular situation of the cases above considered when the trajectory of contact point is known, a straight line for translating follower and a circular one for oscillating follower...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a computer-aided design and manufacturing {{system for the}} design and production of complex profiles for high-performance drum cams within the specified tolerance. The system graphically generates the cam profile on the cylindrical drum after performing {{an analysis of the}} kinematic performance for the prescribed follower motion, using a B-spline representation of <b>follower</b> <b>curves.</b> Eight different types of follower motion for a translating follower are considered. The kinematic performance is based on the criteria of achieving the lowest levels of velocity and acceleration for each curve. The system is also able to simulate the motion of the designed cam graphically. The system also recommends the best cam profile on the basis of comparing the kinematic performance of all the B-spline representations of all the follower motions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control framework for hierarchical coordination of multi-robot system by using leader-follower and region-based approaches. The leader robot is controlled to converge to and circulate along a closed curve that {{is defined by}} an implicit function. In the proposed control framework, only the leader robot has {{the knowledge of the}} desired <b>curve,</b> and the <b>follower</b> robots are controlled to track the curve indirectly through the leader robot. In order to enhance redundancy and flexibility of multi-robot systems in practice the follower robots are controlled to stay freely within a designated regions surrounding the leader robot. Moreover, the group of follower robots are able to circulate in the specified region for the sake of enlarging the sensing areas. The stability and convergence of the proposed multi-robot system with the addressed control algorithms are studied. Simulation and experimental results on mobile robots are presented to validate the performance of the hierarchical control framework for multi-robot systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|A 2 -dimensional lumbar spine {{is modeled}} with 64 back muscles and the static {{behavior}} of the model is predicted using an optimization technique. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate if a follower load can be produced by the back muscles for enhancing the mechanical stability of the lumbar spine in a quiet standing posture. Recent studies demonstrated that the stability of the lumbar spine can be greatly increased with the maintenance of reasonable flexibility when the resultant force of the spinal muscle forces, body weight and external loads is directed along the spinal axis (tangent to the spinal <b>curve).</b> This <b>follower</b> load is suggested as a normal physiological load in the spine based on these findings. However, the roles of back muscles in producing the follower load in the lumbar spine have not been well understood yet. Two-dimensional optimization problem was formulated to investigate the muscle forces required for producing the follower load in the lumbar spine in quiet standing posture. Upper trunk (350 N), 5 lumbar vertebrae, sacrum and pelvis connected by 64 muscle fascicles (22 long and 42 short) were simulated. Summation of joint follower forces and joint moments were minimized to determine the muscle forces. A parametric study was also performed to obtain the optimum follower load path. The effect of increasing external force or the external moment on the follower load was also investigated with the follower load path fixed at the optimum location. Minimum follower forces were predicted when the follower load path was followed the points 7 mm posterior to geometrical centers of each vertebra. Results of this study showed that the back muscles, particularly short segmenta...|$|R
