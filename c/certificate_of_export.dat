The ECJ decided that only goods bearing <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> origin from the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus could be imported by EU member states. The decision resulted in a considerable decrease <b>of</b> Turkish Cypriot <b>exports</b> to the EU: from $36.4 million (or 66.7% of total Turkish Cypriot exports) in 1993 to $24.7 million in 1996 (or 35% <b>of</b> total <b>exports)</b> in 1996. Even so, the EU continues to be the second-largest trading partner of Northern Cyprus, with a 24.7% share of total imports and 35% share <b>of</b> total <b>exports.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} limited immunity for "export cartels" offered by the United States' Export Trading Company Act (1982). We have assembled a data set <b>of</b> 195 <b>Export</b> Trade <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> Review - all those created from when the first certificate was granted in 1983 {{through the end of}} 2004. We provide descriptive statistics on these ETCs, including the types of firms that apply for these certificates {{and the nature of the}} restrictions placed upon them by the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice. We then estimate the determinants of the real value of U. S. product-level manufacturing exports from 1978 through 2004. We find that, controlling for the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> in the industry, on average ETCs do not increase exports. In some estimates, the real value <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> actually falls after receiving an ETC. There are two possible explanations for this. One is that firms choose to obtain an ETC "Certificate of Review" when they are concerned that exports in the sector are going to fall. Receiving an ETC thus precedes this fall in exports, but does not cause it. The second possible explanation is that industries with ETCs can in fact exercise market power and the decline in the real value <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> reflects a strategic reduction in the quantity <b>of</b> goods <b>exported.</b> Given the predominance of ETCs in relatively unconcentrated industries we believe the former explanation is more plausible...|$|R

30|$|Naturally, not all {{of these}} firm {{characteristics}} can immediately be changed by decree. For example, raising the incidence of websites and quality <b>certificates,</b> the share <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> in total sales or their effects on training among MENA firms all require time to change either firm behavior or allow appropriate policy changes to become effective. What MENA governments can control directly, however, are labor regulations, their enforcement and educational expenditures. Raising enforcement for given rigidity of the labor regulations and switching from greater enforcement of hiring rules to that of firing rules by themselves could, according to the results presented here, contribute quite substantially to increased training by firms. 7 In the case of labor regulations, looking across the sample of results for the MENA sample in Tables  4 and 5 and comparing these with the corresponding results for the Non-MENA sample in Table  4, one can see that the effect of perceived obstacles in the form of labor regulations {{is more likely to be}} negative and statistically significant for MENA firms than for Non-MENA firms. Hence, reducing this by way of the actual rigidity of the de jure labor regulations, especially that related to hiring regulations (as shown in Table  5), would also seem to be a direct way to increase the likelihood of training. From the results of Table  4, for the MENA countries at least, an increase in educational spending would also be expected to have a significant positive effect on Training.|$|R
