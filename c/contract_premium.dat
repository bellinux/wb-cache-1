40|$|In {{this paper}} we reconsider the basic notion that an {{insurance}} <b>contract</b> <b>premium</b> must {{be independent of}} the outcome of the insured event. This is done by simply assuming that the parties to an insurance contract may agree that the contract becomes null should the value of the insurable loss fall outside a preestablished support, in which case any premiums corresponding to the contract that have been paid are returned. Using this concept of insurance, we show that the classic deductible contract format is no longer optimal, since the insured will always prefer to purchase supplementary insurance to cover the deductible.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} microeconomic {{evidence on}} the impact of centralization in collective bargaining in Spain on wage levels and on wage inequality. The time period covered by the study is 1995 - 2002. We make use of two waves of a detailed linked employer-employee data set. Descriptive evidence suggests that there is a clear trend towards centralization in the collective bargaining process in Spain over this seven-year period. Results indicate that centralization of wage contracts together with the decrease in the firm-level <b>contract</b> <b>premium</b> has led to a decrease in the growth of average wages. This is consistent with previous studies which conclude that a centralized wage setting tends to restrain wages. For our particular sample, if the level of firm-level contracts and the firm-level contract wage premium had remained at 1995 levels, average wages would have increased by 27 % more for men and 18 % more for women. As regards impact on wage inequality, we find that in terms of the decrease of firm-level contracts in favour of other contracts centralization has led to a decrease in wage variance of around 3 percent...|$|E

Water procurement decision optimisation is essential in order to increase supply reliability and reduce costs. Water markets, such as spot purchases or water supply option contracts, can make this decision process more flexible. We analyse the potential interest in an option contract for an irrigation district that has access to several water sources. We apply a stochastic recursive mathematical programming model to simulate the water procurement decisions of an irrigation district?s board operating in a context of water supply uncertainty in south-eastern Spain. We analyse what role different option contracts could play in securing its water supply. Results suggest that the irrigation district would be willing to accept the proposed option contract in most cases subject to realistic values of the option contract financial terms. Of nine different water sources, desalination and the option contract are the main substitutes, where the use of either depends on the contract parameters. The <b>contract</b> <b>premium</b> and optioned volume are the variables that have a greater impact on the irrigation district?s decisions.

Contingency generally refers to initial contingency amount estimated before bidding and {{will be included in}} original <b>contract.</b> <b>Premium</b> cost also will be issued to pay non-value additional works. As a result, additional works, which also refers to change orders, are paid mainly by initial contingency, supplemental agreements and premium cost. This paper mainly aims to compare initial amount of contingency to later investment paid for change orders by means of supplemental agreements or premium cost. If estimation of initial contingency is rather precise, even the initial contingency is high and will increases the original contract amount, it might still be beneficial to projects because it eliminates the cost-related influence caused by unforeseen additional works paid by fund prepared as contingency in advance. This paper is designed to testify correlation between initial contingency and cost overrun, moreover, to compare this correlation to the ones between supplemental agreement amount, premium cost and cost overrun, with which it could demonstrates whether initial contingency is less costly than amount issued by supplemental agreements or premium cost.

Employers and employees can also negotiate firm-specific contracts. We use a large matched employer-employee data set to {{study the effects of}} firm-level contracting on the structure of wages. Employees covered by firm-specific contracts earn about 10 percent more than those covered by sectoral <b>contracts.</b> The estimated <b>premium</b> is about the same for men in different skill groups, but higher for more highly skilled women, suggesting that firm-level contracts raise wage inequality for women. At the establishment level, we compare average wages under firm-level and sectoral bargaining, controlling for the propensity to negotiate a firm-specific contract. Consistent with the worker-level models, we find that firm-specific contracting raises average wages, with a pattern of effects that tends to increase inequality relative to sectoral bargaining for women. Although we cannot decisively test between alternative explanations for the firm-level <b>contracting</b> <b>premium,</b> workers with firm-specific contracts have significantly longer job tenure, suggesting that the premium is at least partially a non-competitive phenomenon...|$|R

30|$|Congress first {{authorized}} {{crop insurance}} in the 1930 ’s {{in the period}} after the Great Depression {{that was the beginning}} of many agricultural policies that still exist today (Glauber, 2013). Crop insurance was mostly limited to major crops (e.g., corn) in the primary producing areas until the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Risk Management Agency USDA-RMA 2013 c). The 1980 Act expanded crops and areas eligible for insurance and authorized a 30 percent subsidy of the crop insurance premium. Even though crop insurance expanded, ad hoc disaster payments remained common. In 2000 legislation was enacted which expanded the role of the private sector in developing new <b>contracts,</b> <b>premium</b> subsidies were increased, and restrictions on the development of livestock (and dairy) insurance products were removed. The result is that acres covered by crop insurance increased from 45 million in 1981 to 272 million in 2008 (Goodwin and Smith, 2013). The majority of U.S. corn, soybeans and wheat acres have been insured in recent years. Thus, the largest crops by acres cultivated and sales have been largely covered by crop insurance policies. The same cannot be said, however, for specialty crops, livestock, and dairy production.|$|R

30|$|In 2007, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation {{approved}} {{the establishment of}} the Livestock Gross Margin insurance program for dairy farms (LGM-Dairy). This program became available in August 2008 for dairy producers in 31 states. In July 2010, LGM-Dairy availability was expanded to all of the lower 48 states (Gould and Cabrera, 2011). LGM-Dairy allows dairy farm operators to purchase insurance to protect against unanticipated low gross milk margins defined as the difference between estimated milk revenue and feed costs. Under this insurance policy, an indemnity at the end of coverage period is the difference, if positive, between the market anticipated gross margins at contract purchase and actual gross margins. The milk revenues and feed costs protected are based on current futures contract settle prices that exist at insurance sign-up. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Class III milk, corn, and soybean meal futures and options markets are used as an information source in the setting of premiums and to determine insurance indemnities {{at the end of the}} <b>contract.</b> The <b>contract</b> <b>premiums</b> are established to be actuarially sound in the sense that over the long-run, the expected indemnities paid equal premiums before subsidy is applied (Gould and Cabrera, 2011).

40|$|Many {{countries}} in Latin America and the Caribbean {{are interested in}} diversifying their energy sources for energy security and in contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases. Non-traditional renewable energy (NTRE) sources, which include wind, solar, geothermal and small-scale hydropower, have {{received a lot of}} attention towards meeting these goals. To foster the expansion of NTRE, different countries have pursued different legal and regulatory approaches, but there remains very limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of different approaches. In this paper, we use a unique dataset that combines information on NTRE growth rates and information on the legal and regulatory framework, as well as other control variables, for 27 countries over the period 2001 - 2010. Legal and regulatory instruments include legally binding and non-binding quantity targets, <b>contracts</b> guaranteeing <b>premium</b> prices, fiscal incentives and import duty waivers, and guaranteed access to the grid. Using an information-theoretic Markov Chain analysis, results indicate that fiscal incentives and guaranteed access have relatively high impacts on transitions into high growth rates, whereas fiscal incentives and import duty waivers have relatively high impacts on transitions into moderate growth rates. Binding and non-binding agreements increase transitions out of negative and zero growth rates, but to relatively low positive growth rates. <b>Contracts</b> with <b>premium</b> subsidies also have limited impacts on transitions into high growth rates, though they are associated with transitions into the low growth category. These results provide additional evidence on which regulatory instruments have been most effective in aiding {{countries in}} expanding their NTRE...|$|R

The results show that the Romanian financial market components are differentially affected by the degree of risk and uncertainty, while having different degrees of sensitivity to the modifications of the macroeconomic parameters. We argue that the insurance market is the most immune component of the financial market, being the most rigid in regard to macroeconomic variations.

Spatial stochastic models of catastrophes can bypass these difficulties. Catastrophic models combine the simulation of realistic and geographically explicit catastrophic events with the differentiation of property values and insurance coverages in different locations of the region. Catastrophic models can be combined with stochastic optimization techniques to aid decision making on the spatial diversification of <b>contracts,</b> insurance <b>premiums,</b> reinsurance requirements, effects of mitigation measures, an [...] ...|$|R
