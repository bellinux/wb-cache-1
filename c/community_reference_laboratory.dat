40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{increased}} {{need for}} accurate influenza laboratory surveillance {{data in the}} European Union required formalisation of the existing network of collaborating national influenza <b>reference</b> <b>laboratories</b> participating in the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS). OBJECTIVE: To establish a <b>Community</b> Network of <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratories</b> for Human Influenza in Europe (CNRL). METHODS: Virologists in EISS defined the objective and tasks of the CNRL. Performance of the laboratories in the tasks was monitored by questionnaire-based inventories and quality control assessments (QCA). Subsequently, actions were defined to improve {{the performance of the}} CNRL. RESULTS: The CNRL started in April 2003 and included as of May 2004 32 laboratories in 24 European countries. The objective is to provide high quality reference services for human influenza surveillance, early warning and pandemic preparedness in Europe. The defined basic tasks are direct detection, culture, typing, subtyping and strain characterisation of influenza virus, diagnostic influenza serology and storage of clinical specimens and virus isolates. The questionnaire-based inventories and QCAs revealed that the majority of CNRL laboratories perform well in most of the basic tasks, although improvements are needed in certain areas of virus testing. Therefore, task groups have been established to further improve the methods used in the network. The CNRL has proven its usefulness during the 2003 - 2004 season by the reporting of accurate data concerning the flu epidemic caused by A/Fujian/ 411 / 2002 (H 3 N 2) -like viruses and by the rapid sharing of information, protocols and reagents during the A(H 5 N 1) and A(H 7 N 3) epizootics in Asia and Canada. CONCLUSION: EISS has established a functioning <b>Community</b> Network of <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratories</b> for Human Influenza in Europe and laid the foundation for further enhancement and collaborations. Important next steps include improving the laboratories to carry out all basic tasks and collaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|The European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) {{is based}} on an {{integrated}} clinical and virological surveillance model. To assess the comparability of virological data, a questionnaire was sent to participants in June 2002 enquiring about specimen collection, laboratory diagnosis of influenza and tests for other respiratory infections. The results showed differences, but also uniformity in virological data collection methods. Similarities were reported for the specimen collection procedures; the type of swab and the transport conditions were comparable. The diagnostic methods were diverse; differences were seen in the (sub) typing methods, with PCR used most often in western countries. The findings will be helpful for the interpretation of virological data collected by sentinel physicians and {{for the creation of a}} <b>Community</b> Network of <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratories</b> for Human Influenza in Europe. Important objectives of the Community Network include the harmonisation of virological methods and the application of quality assurance assessments for the national <b>reference</b> <b>laboratories.</b> (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|European <b>Community</b> {{national}} <b>reference</b> <b>laboratories</b> {{participated in}} two inter-laboratory comparison tests in 2006 {{to evaluate the}} sensitivity and specificity of their 'in-house' ELISA and RT-PCR assays {{for the detection of}} bluetongue virus (BTV) antibodies and RNA. The first ring trial determined the ability of laboratories to detect antibodies to all 24 serotypes of BTV. The second ring trial, which included both antisera and EDTA blood samples from animals experimentally infected with the northern European strain of BTV- 8, determined the ability of laboratories to detect BTV- 8 antibodies and RNA, as well as the diagnostic sensitivity of the assays. A total of six C-ELISAs, six real-time RT-PCR and three conventional RT-PCR assays were used. All C-ELISAs were capable of detecting the BTV serotypes currently circulating in Europe (BTV- 1, 2, 4, 8, 9 and 16), however some assays displayed inconsistencies in the detection of other serotypes, particularly BTV- 19. All C-ELISAs detected BTV- 8 antibodies in cattle and sheep by 21 dpi, while the majority of assays detected antibodies by 9 dpi in cattle and 8 dpi in sheep. All the RT-PCR assays were able to detect BTV- 8, although the real-time assays were more sensitive compared to the conventional assays. The majority of real-time RT-PCR assays detected BTV RNA as early as 2 dpi in cattle and 3 dpi in sheep. These two ring trails provide evidence that national <b>reference</b> <b>laboratories</b> within the EC are capable of detecting BTV antibodies and RNA and provide specificity and sensitivity information on the detection methods currently available...|$|R
40|$|Multi-groups and multi-residues {{test methods}} will be developed, for the {{purposes}} of the official control of pesticides in foodstuffs and vegetables. In particular, our goal is to develop 2 methods for animal derived products, 1 for vegetables and 1 for feeds. Animal derived foods will be selected on the basis of their fat content. The active compounds will be chosen according to the following criteria: - the matching matrix-pesticide indicated by the Regulation 1213 / 2008 /EC - the maximum residue limits (MRL) set by the Regulation 396 / 2005 /EC - the suggestions from the <b>Community</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratories</b> (CRLs) - the pesticides used in agriculture in Italy - the pesticides monitored within the IIZZSS network in the framework of the National Monitoring Plans for drug residues(PNR) and Feeds (PNAA The Regulation 1213 / 2008 /EC states to pay particular attention to the monitoring of organophosphates, carbamates, triazoles and pyretroids. The test methods will be developed according to the suggestions from the CRLs, above all considering recently introduced techniques for both sample treatment (extraction, purification) and determination of pesticides (LC-MS/MS and GCMS/ MS using triple quadrupole detectors). The methods will be: multi-group and multi-residue, able to determinate a lot of compounds exhibiting different chemical and physical properties, applicable to several matrices. During the first step of the project, a practical workshop organised by e CRL will be carried out, to transfer the scientific and technical know how already available. For sample treatment, the potency and relative merits of SPE, ASE, QUECHERS system will be tested for extraction and purification steps. This approach should also allow for reducing analysis time, costs and wastes of solvents. Test methods will be validated according to the SANCO/ 2007 / 3131 guideline from the Commission, integrated with the requirements of the Regulation 882 / 2004 /EC and the Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, with particular reference to the case of feeds. Regarding speciation of mercury and its organic form, test methods will be developed for determination of methyl-mercury in seafood and feeds for aquaculture, based on LC-ICP/MS, LC-FIMS/AAS techniques. The methods will be validated according to the Regulation 882 / 2004 /EC. The ratio total mercury /methyl- mercury in some seafood will be evaluated.

40|$|All {{laboratories}} {{participating in}} the <b>Community</b> Network of <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratories</b> for Human Influenza in Europe (CNRL) co-ordinated by the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) {{should be able to}} perform a range of influenza diagnostics. This includes direct detection, culture, typing, subtyping and strain characterisation of influenza viruses, diagnostic serology and the creation of archives for clinical specimens and virus isolates. To improve the capacity and quality of the laboratories of the CNRL and to increase the consistency in performance among all 25 European Union countries plus Norway, Romania, and Switzerland, five task groups were set up in February 2005. These task groups developed work programmes in the areas of virus isolation, antibodies, molecular virology, quality control assessment and antiviral susceptibility testing. This report outlines the programmes and the results achieved in the first half-year of operation of the task groups. The action plans are challenging and it is expected that these efforts will lead to considerable improvements in the performance of the laboratories and in the standardisation of methods employed in Europe with regard to routine influenza surveillance and early warning for emerging viruses.
