40|$|Abstract. With {{regard to}} the climate change {{as well as the}} {{shortage}} and increase in price of natural resources, efficient resource management becomes more and more important, also for production processes. More than half of the sheet metal used in the automotive industry is wasted. Considering the amount of energy and the added value associated to the discards, enormous savings are possible. The approach of this research work is to avoid waste during a forming process by means of a continuous process monitoring and a self-learning intelligent tool interacting with the servo press. The flexibility of the servo press, which is so far used to optimize the single press stroke, only, shall be exerted to respond on altering material properties of blank sheets and the thereby changing forming behaviour. The sample process includes a two-tiered bending process, in which a conventional punch performs the pre-bending in the first step and an independent servo axis the compensation-bending in the second step. If an inadmissible bending angle is measured after the second step, the servo press stops automatically and the additional servo axis performs a teaching-stroke to adjust the <b>compensation</b> <b>angle.</b> After that, the continuous process starts again. This paper presents the springback compensation strategy which uses flexible correction algorithms based on data of the on-line process monitoring as well as data of the previous bending steps.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{literature review}} on the AWJ cutting technology and associated sciences {{has been carried}} out and reported. It has been found that little research effort has been made to the AWJ cutting process for AMM laminations. As a result, the first comprehensive study on AWJ cutting of AMM laminations using various cutting techniques is presented in this thesis, with a view to understanding and improving the cutting performance, i. e. the depth of cut, the top kerf width and the kerf taper angle. An experimental study in the traditional way of AWJ operation (i. e. placing the nozzle perpendicularly to the work surface without nozzle oscillation) was carried out first to gain the basic understanding of the cutting process and cutting performance. Studies with cutting performance enhancement techniques, i. e. the nozzle oscillation and kerf taper compensation techniques, were then undertaken. The experimental studies included about 200 test runs to provide sufficient data for statistical analysis. Plausible trends of the cutting performance measures with respect to the process parameters have been found from the statistical analyses of the experimental data. In general, an increase in the water pressure and a decrease in the nozzle traverse speed and abrasive mass flow rate within the tested ranges increase the depth of cut. An increase in the kerf taper <b>compensation</b> <b>angle</b> decreases the kerf taper angle almost linearly. Nozzle oscillation cutting can reduce the kerf taper angle to less than 1 o, and the kerf taper compensation cutting technique can eliminate the kerf taper if the process parameters are properly selected. Recommendations have been made on the selection of the most appropriate process parameters to be used in practice for each cutting technique. Predictive models for the various cutting performance measures have finally been developed. The depth of cut models were developed using the energy conservation approach, while those for the top kerf width and kerf taper angle were developed empirically. The models were then assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. It has been found that the model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data and can give adequate predictions of the cutting performance measures...|$|E

However, the analysis of impact of voltage phase angle jump on the FRT control capability of DFIGs is insufficient, and the effective FRT control strategy of DFIGs considering voltage phase angle jump needs to be designed.|$|R
40|$|A time {{division}} multiplexing and a quadraphase combining dual channel system were analyzed, designed, and tested. Analyses performed include the following: (1) boresight error {{as a function of}} the error channel bandwidth; (2) error channel interference with the sum channel functions; (3) threshold performance; and (4) error channel crosstalk, linearity, and drift as a function of signal level, Doppler, and environment. Test results indicate that the {{time division}} multiplexing system meets the design goals of the program. However, careful selection and alignment of all gain controlled amplifiers are required along with temperature <b>compensation</b> of the <b>angle</b> channel gain. The quadraphase system crosstalk performance is comparatively poor (- 15 dB) with respect to the - 30 dB requirements and this consequently affects gain tracking performance. Gain tracking was found to be + or - 20 percent rather than the + or - 5 percent specification. Data for the two systems is compared and recommendations are presented...|$|R
