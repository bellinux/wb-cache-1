40|$|Soil {{originating}} from old wood preservation industries is often contaminated by {{a mixture of}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and heavy metals, from the simultaneous utilization of creosote and CCA salts (<b>copper,</b> <b>chromium,</b> <b>arsenic),</b> respectively. Multi-element contaminated sites are usual and pose large difficulties for remedy selection, most techniques were not developed for these situations and stepwise or combined techniques are often required. Choice of a remediation technique depends primarily on target contaminant/s and soil properties but site specific conditions and economics are always to be considered. Thermal treatment is effective for organic contaminants but tend to increase leaching of chromium (Cr) and arsenic (As), while the leaching of copper (Cu) decreases. Soil washing is primarily most effective for solely inorganics or organic contaminants. Soil washing applications efficient for the simultaneous removal of inorganic and organic contaminants are rare. In these applications the soil washing extractant solutions could be recalcitrant and toxic in nature. Whenever treatment goals are not fulfilled after these treatments chemical stabilisation could be an option for contaminant immobilization. Choice of an appropriate amendment for chemical stabilisation could {{be based on the}} affinity of As, Cr and Cu for different soil fractions such as metal oxides and sulphides. Aim for this study was to develop an extractant in a soil washing application efficient for simultaneous removal of inorganic and organic contaminants with environmental concern taken. For the stabilisation of remaining contaminants this study also aimed to evaluate how the addition of certain products (iron compounds, fly ash, gypsum and zeolite) prior to thermal treatment could effect leaching of As, Cu and Cr. Leaching was evaluated in oxidizing or anoxic conditions. The addition of these products was also evaluated with no prior thermal treatment. Results were compared with EU landfill regulations and guideline values for contaminated soil. Leaching of As, Cu and Cr was reduced by all amendments after thermal treatment, most prominent exception is a raised leaching of Cr due to an addition of fly ash which raised pH in soil. The most significant leaching element in anoxic conditions was As. Gypsum and metallic iron were chosen based on their inherent content of Ca, S and Fe which could bind As in certain conditions. A mixture of gypsum and iron reduced leaching most extensively in anoxic conditions. Gypsum decreased leaching of As at a higher extent in anoxic than oxidized conditions. Leaching of As was most extensively reduced by an addition of iron compounds and increased in a fly ash mixture in soil with no prior thermal treatment. All amendments decreased leaching of Cu and Cr except for fly ash which increased leaching of Cr. Leaching of soil with no prior thermal treatment was evaluated solely in oxidized conditions. A two-step soil washing test was performed for the evaluation of a humic acid (HA) extract in remediating soil contaminated with high levels of trace metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). pH was initially set to 11 in the first step and 7 in the second step. Heated soil washing solutions of a humic acid extract, pH-adjusted water and solely water were compared. Humic acid extract significantly enhanced the extraction of PAH and Cu, Cr and As in comparison with other solutions tested but solely to a minor extent. The enhancement was most prominent concerning high molecular weight PAH. PAH was removed at a higher extent than trace metals using extractants containing HA. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|In this study, three {{possible}} improvements to a remediation process for chromated-copper-arsenate (CCA) treated wood were evaluated.

40|$|Abstract: Substantial {{progress}} has been made in remediation of preservative treated waste wood by chemical extraction with several mineral and organic acids and biodegradation using bacteria and fungi in recent years. Non-conventional low-cost adsorbents are used to bind the metal ions in extremely stable complexes in heavy metal contaminated soils or polluted waters and thus to remediate such substrates. In this study, various adsorbents from industrial and agricultural processes were evaluated in removal of <b>copper,</b> <b>chromium,</b> and <b>arsenic</b> from chromated copper arsenate (CCA) - treated wood by using batch extracting experiments. Most adsorbents used in the study had the potential to remove copper ele-ment from CCA-treated wood, while chromium was the most resistant element against removal in most cases. In general, as amount of adsorbents in the extraction process and extraction duration increased, the percentage of elements removed increased. The adsorbents used in the study could be important in the remediation of wood treated with organic or water-borne wood preservatives containing copper since the use of the adsorbents is one key to unfix copper from treated wood treated...|$|R

The emitted <b>chromium,</b> <b>copper</b> and <b>arsenic</b> were found mainly in the inhalable (< PM 10) aerosol fraction. These concentrations were below the advised healthy levels and maximum permissible risk levels for inhalable exposure of these compounds. The estimates for oral and dermal exposure were found negligible. Relatively high levels of hexavalent <b>chromium</b> and <b>arsenic</b> were found for a few short measurements near one of the autoclaves. From the occupational health point of view, this might require more specific focus. The concentrations of <b>copper,</b> <b>arsenic</b> and total <b>chromium</b> in the soil and surface water near the plants were calculated using an atmospheric transport model. These calculated concentrations did not exceed the Dutch target, intervention and background values for soil, and the limit and background values for surface water...|$|R
40|$|Bioremediation {{processes}} for recovery and reuse of CCA-treated wood invariably increase {{the cost of}} any secondary products manufactured from the remediated fiber. Microbial remediation using either bacteria or fungi {{has been shown to}} remove heavy metals from CCA-treated southern yellow pine (SYP). In a two-step remediation process utilizing oxalic acid extraction and the metal-tolerant bacterium Bacillus licheniformis, 70 - 100 % of the <b>copper,</b> <b>chromium</b> and <b>arsenic</b> can be removed from CCA-treated SYP, but the liquid culture medium used to support the bacterial growth renders this process costly. Processing costs could be partially offset if the culture medium were replaced with an industrial by-product. In this study, an abundant by-product of the brewing industry, malted barley, was evaluated as a replacement for commercial nutrient broth in the bioremediation process for CCA-treated SYP. Malted barley’s high moisture and nutrient content should support bacterial growth. When malted barley was substituted as a growth substrate for nutrient broth, it was discovered that either the culture inoculum or wood itself provided sufficient nutrients for the growth of B. licheniformis. Seventeen percent of the copper and 15 % of the arsenic was removed from an aqueous slurry o...|$|R
40|$|The {{burning of}} wood treated with {{chromated}} copper arsenate (CCA) preservative produces an ash that contains {{high concentrations of}} <b>copper,</b> <b>chromium,</b> and <b>arsenic.</b> The subsequent leaching of these metals from burn sites can produce soil and water contamination. Soils have varying natural abilities to reduce leaching and impact metals speciation and toxicity, by sorption, conversion and sedimentation related mechanisms. Recent regulations have resulted in increased quantities of CCA-treated lumber entering the waste stream, making the study of metals leaching from ash, and the amendment of soils to more effectively immobilize metals, important areas of investigation. The performance of various soil amendments to immobilize or retard Cu, Cr, and As species in soil/CCA-ash mixtures was studied. The amendments evaluated were agricultural lime (CaCO 3 /MgCO 3), soil softener (CaSO 4 ∙ 2 H 2 O), and iron sulfate (FeSO 4). The evaluation was performed using batch and column leaching studies and pH studies. The control soil {{used in this study}} is from the Ultisol soil order, the dominant soil order in the Southeastern U. S. Ultisols form under humid, tropical conditions and are dominated by kaolinitic clay and lesser so b...|$|R
