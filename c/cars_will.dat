5|$|BP in its 2017 Energy Outlook {{forecasts}} {{that the}} number of plug-in electric <b>cars</b> <b>will</b> rise from 1.2 million in 2015 to around 100 million by 2035 representing about 5.5% of the global fleet of passenger cars. Around 25% of these plug-in electric vehicles will be plug-in hybrids and 75% will be pure battery electric cars. The oil company also projects that automotive fuel demand for use in <b>cars</b> <b>will</b> continue to rise, despite efficiency improvements in conventional internal combustion engines and increased plug-in car adoption due to growth in demand for car travel from the growing middle class in emerging economies.|$|E

50|$|How {{does the}} system perform: When all {{differentials}} are unlocked, the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> {{not be able}} to move if one wheel (front or rear) loses traction (is on ice or raised in the air). When center differential is locked with rear differential unlocked, the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> {{not be able to}} move if one front wheel and one rear wheel lose traction. When rear differential locked with center unlocked, the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> not be able to move if two rears or one front loses traction. When both center and rear differentials are locked, the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> not be able to move if two rears and one front lose traction.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{inherent}} conflict in suspension design - if the springs are soft, the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> be comfortable but dramatically affected by load. If the springs are hard, the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> be uncomfortable, but less affected by load.|$|R
50|$|Not a lot {{is known}} about the design, but Mercedes-Benz's teaser images of the car shows the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> have an LMP1-inspired {{exterior}} design.

5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling <b>cars</b> <b>will</b> stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and {{residential}} buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy {{features such as}} solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of <b>cars</b> <b>will</b> run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.|$|E
50|$|To be {{lightweight}} (400 kg) and safe, the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> be {{made with}} sustainable composite biomaterials and carbon fibers. Uniti <b>car</b> <b>will</b> have 2 electric motors delivering a total output 15 kW (40 kW peak), which allows the vehicle to reach 0 to 80 km/h in less than 3.5 seconds with {{a top speed of}} 90 km/h to 120 km/h depending on the version. The urban electric <b>car</b> <b>will</b> have a Li-Ion battery which supports induction and plug-in charge, and capable of supplying 11 to 20 kWh of energy. Depending on the version, the range per charge varies from 150 km to 300 km.

5|$|High-school student Wendy Christensen visits an {{amusement}} park with boyfriend Jason Wise, her best friend Carrie Dreyer and Carrie's boyfriend Kevin Fischer for their senior-class field trip. As they board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the hydraulics securing the seat belts and coaster <b>cars</b> <b>will</b> fail during the ride and kill everyone on board. She panics, a fight breaks out and several people leave or are forced off the ride. They include Kevin; best friends Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin; alumnus Frankie Cheeks; athlete Lewis Romero; and goth couple Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. They see the roller coaster derail, killing the remaining passengers, including Jason and Carrie, leaving Wendy and Kevin devastated.|$|E
5|$|One week later, Mrs. Mallard {{leads the}} ducklings ashore and {{straight}} to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the <b>cars</b> <b>will</b> not yield to her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive {{had yet to be}} constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic {{to make way for the}} ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and go to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Research {{published}} by Bloomberg New Energy Finance in February 2016 predicts that as battery prices continue to fall, light-duty electric vehicles without government subsidies {{will be as}} affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by the mid-2020s. As a result, the study forecasts that annual sales of electric vehicles will hit 41 million by 2040, representing 35% of new light duty vehicle sales. In another scenario the study considers that if new carsharing services are successful, together with the adoption of autonomous cars, they could boost electric-vehicle market share to 50% of new car saless by 2040. On the other hand, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in its 2015 World Oil Outlook projected that the market share of battery electric cars and fuel cell <b>cars</b> <b>will</b> remain below 1% in 2040, while the share of hybrid electric cars is projected to grow from 1% in 2013 to 14% in 2040.|$|E

50|$|If {{the drive}} wheels aquaplane, {{there may be}} a sudden audible rise in engine RPM and {{indicated}} speed as they begin to spin. In a broad highway turn, if the front wheels lose traction, the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> suddenly drift towards the outside of the bend. If the rear wheels lose traction, the back of the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> slew out sideways into a skid. If all four wheels aquaplane at once, the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> slide in a straight line, again towards the outside of the bend if in a turn.

5|$|There {{are also}} vacuum trains that are {{designed}} to remove trash off of the tracks, but are ineffective and often broken. A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country {{based on the number of}} viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan that will dramatically reduce the amount of trash on the tracks and in the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train delays. The frequency of station track cleaning will be increased. In a two-week period, 94 stations will be cleaned, an increase from 34 stations. Starting on September 12, 2016, the MTA launched an intensive two-week, system-wide cleaning from all of the tracks at all of the system's stations. New portable track vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 2018, and 27 new refuse <b>cars</b> <b>will</b> be part of the operation.|$|E
