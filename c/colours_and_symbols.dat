50|$|The <b>colours</b> <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> of {{the flag}} carry cultural, political, and {{regional}} meanings. The blue epitomises {{the sky and the}} sea, specifically the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea which encircle the country. The black and white allude to the harmonious relationship between the black and white races. The yellow symbolises the sunshine, as well as prosperity. The triangles represent the Pitons, which are twin volcanic cones located in the southwest part of the island and unity; Gros Piton and Petit Piton are a national symbol of Saint Lucia.|$|E

5000|$|A later proposal, {{created by}} Michael Garber, {{retained}} the locally-meaningful <b>colours</b> <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> {{featured in the}} original design by Nash Ford. The Nash Ford design was deemed unsuitable as a flag because the gold charge on white breaks the rule of tincture, by which two lighter colours do not contrast well and thus the gold charge loses visibility from any distance. It has also been deemed as confusing because the curved form of the oak tree which resembles a letter [...] "C", thereby leads some people to think it represents a county name also beginning with [...] "C".The Garber proposal thus aims to retain all the design criteria of the original proposal in a more effective arrangement and was completed after extensive consultation with the Flag Institute.|$|E

His first passion was sculpture, and he created abstract, surreal and Symbolic pieces, using mostly welded copper and iron. In 1966 he moved to Milan and decided to explore other media, turning to painting, oil and acrylic. Totems, figures, mythological creatures become the symbolic expression of the themes which were dear to his philosophical and spiritual research. He studied mathematics, <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> universal <b>symbols.</b> Tomshinsky travelled a lot, and exhibited his works in Paris, Milan, Vienna, Zurich, Düsseldorf, Brussels, London, and Rome.|$|R

It has been a courtly colour, a romantic colour, a dangerous <b>colour,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>symbol</b> of fecundity. For their exhibition ‘The Language of Green’, SoCo artists have been challenged to make a personal response to this colour through their own practice as painters, printmakers, sculptors, mixed media and textile artists.

40|$|Pomen barv in simbolov v mandalah Namen naloge je bil raziskati pomen barv in simbolov v mandalah. Temeljni simbol mandale je krog, ki pomeni celoto. Mandala navdušuje človeštvo že tisočletja s svojo sporočilnostjo in s svojo preprosto obliko – krog. Cilj naloge je bil prikazati mandalo v prvobitni pojavnosti, njene spremembe v različnih kulturah in kakšno moč ima v Zahodnem svetu. Pri delu so bile uporabljene metode analize pisnih virov. Ugotovili smo, da se za prvobitno mandalo skrivajo nauki budizma. Ostale kulture so glede na namen in sporočilnost prikazovale simboliko barv in oblik na drugačen način. V Zahodnem svetu pa se psihološki globlji pomen izgubi, saj mandala nima budističnega ozadja in ne potekajo molitve k Budi, kakor je praksa v vzhodnjaški kulturi. V Zahodnem svetu mandala ponuja večinoma le etstetske užitke. The {{meaning of}} <b>colours</b> <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> in mandalas The purpose of my diploma work was to {{research}} the meaning of <b>colours</b> <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> in mandalas. The circle, fundamental symbol of mandala, represents wholeness. Mandala is known by the humans {{for thousands of years}} and inspires us with its simple form – the circle. The goal of my diploma work was to show how mandala appears in its primal form, its changes in different cultures and its power in the Western world. At my work I used the method of analysing written documents. I discovered that behind the primal mandala the lessons of Buddhism are hidden. All the other cultures adopted mandala and showed the colours and forms in different ways according to the purpose and the expressed content. The deep psychological meaning of the Eastern mandala is lost in the Western world as it lost the Buddhist background of prayers to Buddha, the purpose of mandala in Eastern cultures, and it offers only aesthetic pleasures in the Western world...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{advertising}} campaign of Generali, which was never putted into practise. The campaign was created for insurance group Generali as an essay in school subject called 3 MG 321 Marketing Communications, that was teached in spring semester 2011 at the University of Economics in Prague. Campaigns authors are Jan Klusoň, Filip Mikschik, Hedvika Pajerová and Petra Pištěková. The new communication strategy proposed communication mix including TV, radio, internet, outdoor, indoor, print and direct mail. The practical part of this thesis examines the form of this campaign in that media and interprets them from a semiotic perspective. The analysis emphasis on the <b>colours</b> red <b>and</b> white and also {{on the character of}} a lion. These <b>colours</b> <b>and</b> the <b>symbol</b> are used by the Generali insurance company since its inception and are part of its logo also. The practical part is based on theoretical grounds, which include the interpretation of the character of the lion from biological, mythological, heraldic and dreamlike aspects.

40|$|With ESSA, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} of RNA secondary structure analysis based on extensive viewing within a friendly graphical interface. This computer program is {{organized around the}} display of folding models produced by two complementary methods suitable to draw long RNA molecules. Any feature of interest can be managed directly on the display and highlighted by a rich combination of <b>colours</b> <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> with emphasis given to structural probe accessibilities. ESSA also includes a word searching procedure allowing easy visual identification of structural features even complex and degenerated. Analysis functions {{make it possible to}} calculate the thermodynamic stability of any part of a folding using several models and compare homologous aligned RNA both in primary and secondary structure. The predictive capacities of ESSA which brings together the experimental, thermodynamic and comparative methods, are increased by coupling it with a program dedicated to RNA folding prediction based on constraints management and propagation. The potentialities of ESSA are illustrated by the identification of a possible tertiary motif in the LSU rRNA and the visualization of a pseudoknot in S 15 mRNA...|$|E
40|$|We {{report an}} {{experiment}} investigating whether {{dancing to the}} same music enhances recall of person-related memory targets. The experiment used 40 dancers (all of whom were unaware of the experiment’s aim), 2 -channel silent-disco radio headphones, a marked-up dance floor, two types of music, and memory targets (sash <b>colours</b> <b>and</b> <b>symbols).</b> In each trial, 10 dancers wore radio headphones and one of 4 different coloured sashes, half of which carried cat symbols. Using silent-disco technology, one type of music was surreptitiously transmitted to half the dancers, while music at a different tempo was transmitted to the remaining dancers. Pre-experiment, the dancers’ faces were photographed. Post-experiment, each dancer was presented with the photographs of the other dancers and asked to recall their memory targets. Results showed that same-music dancing significantly enhanced memory for sash colour and sash symbol. Our findings are discussed {{in light of recent}} eye-movement research that showed significantly increased gaze durations for people observing music-dance synchrony versus music-dance asynchrony, and in relation to current literature on interpersonal entrainment, group cohesion and social bonding...|$|E
40|$|Throughout life, {{human beings}} are {{continuously}} in contact with <b>colours</b> <b>and</b> shapes. Some people {{are well aware of}} and understand their influence, while others are not aware or do not pay attention. Our feelings are often associated with certain colours. We tend to paint our living environment in mood-enhancing shades and cover ourselves with our favourite <b>colours</b> <b>and</b> materials. The <b>colour</b> that attracts my emotions is white, therefore I set out to dedicate my research to its nature and {{to find out more about}} its interconnection with architecture. This thesis discusses the colour white, the act of subjective perception of <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> shape, and the connection between the two. Different cultures around the world perceive white in various ways, however white always appears to elicit a definite influence on a person's spiritual and social life within a culture itself. Various religions and philosophies throughout history have used <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> shape as <b>symbols</b> of their power. One of the most prominent media for this is architecture. In the first part, I discussed <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> its vastness. I researched the appearance of white in certain cultures that appear to pay special attention to it, especially concerning architecture. An in-depth historical overview shows many interesting and strongly varying examples of architecture. My focus was on <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> its influence on man. To this end, I looked into the work of prominent architects whose legacy is closely connected to the colour white, such as Le Corbusier and Santiago Calatrava Valls. My research method consisted of literary and pictorial analysis, as well as a student questionnaire. The aim of this thesis is to expose the interconnection between architecture <b>and</b> the <b>colour</b> white. This has yielded a deeper understanding of history, materials and cultures where white is prominent, emphasising its meaning, with which it hopes to be of help to others as well. ...|$|R
40|$|Alarm systems play a {{vital role}} in {{maintaining}} the safe operation in process plant. Moreover, the safety and efficiency of a plant's operation is assured by the usage of a reliable and user friendly alarm system. In this project, the main objective is to introduce an alarm feature inside the SCADA system. Identification of suitable guidelines in designing a good alarm system display is also part of the project's objective. Introduction of alarm feature inside the SCADA system is done by putting the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system to Assembly Cell- 200 Trainer. Here, the SCADA system is equipped with an alarm system as the mean to monitor and control the trainer. The alarm design adopts the available alarm system guidelines as to figure out and judge the most suitable guidelines to be applied in this project. This exercise proves that general guidelines (e. g., use of an alarm philosophy) are essential in developing this projects. However, detailed guidelines (e. g., <b>colour</b> coding <b>and</b> <b>symbol</b> features) should be used more carefully and consistent to ensure the creation of understandable and recognizable display. From this project, a properly designed alarm system is developed, which provides the operators with enough information to prevent any abnormalities, fault conditions or undesired errors in the plant. This project also summarizes the principal guidelines to consider when designing and developing alarms in SCADA environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{creative}} {{expansion of}} user interface design and software {{development in the}} global market is a challenge for designers, businesses and users. While there is the Internet and interactive systems for project management, {{it is crucial to}} understand the requirements for specific cultures, especially through the utilization of gamification as a strategy to motivate people to perform tasks inside the system. For this reason, considering the psychological and sociological factors that affect the level of engagement of target users is an essential component for the success of gamified products. Therefore, cultural preferences affect the acceptability of the functionality provided by software systems. As a result, this paper presents the design criteria followed to localize a gamified system to Arabic cultures by considering the cultural and linguistic requirements to design the user interface and the functionality of the system. For that, we outline the issues and prior applications of cross-cultural Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), user interfaces and gamified applications for project management. Then we analyse the Arabic conditions and perform the employment of the design standards, through the description of GSCRUM elements, such as badge design. Some implementation includes linguistic requirements and visual elements, like <b>colours,</b> typography <b>and</b> <b>symbols.</b> In the final section, we discuss and outline the specific characteristics of the design for the localisation of gamified Arabic system, based on GSCRUM and cultural considerations...|$|R
