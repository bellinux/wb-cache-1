30|$|We {{suggest that}} the 4 I- 1 magma chamber and the {{underlying}} amphibole-bearing <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> part were separated by a lower-T amphibole-free <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> layer. The interstitial melt in the amphibole-free <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> may have filled the thermal–compositional gap between the 4 I- 1 melt and the melts in equilibrium with amphiboles. In addition, the lower-T amphibole-free <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> layer was also clinopyroxene-free {{because of the lack}} of ortho- and clinopyroxene pair revealing temperature <[*] 900  °C (Kaneko et al. 2007). This is supported by the results of high-P-T equilibrium experiments for hydrous dacitic system (Costa et al. 2004); the results show that (1) ortho- and clinopyroxenes coexist at relatively high temperatures (>  900  °C), (2) orthopyroxene crystallizes without both clinopyroxene and amphibole under relatively low temperature (<[*] 900  °C) and intermediate–low H 2 O content conditions (<[*]ca. 4.5  wt% H 2 O in melt), and (3) amphibole crystallizes even at lower temperature (<[*] 900  °C) under H 2 O-rich condition (<[*]ca. 4.5  wt% H 2 O in melt), although the boundary T–H 2 O conditions may shift slightly with the change in melt composition. The absence of amphibole with T < 910  °C indicates that the amphibole-free mush layer was not H 2 O-rich. This is consistent with the estimation of H 2 O content in the 4 I- 1 melt (ca. 4.1 - 5.7  wt%) based on plagioclase–melt element partitioning (Kaneko et al. 2007), which is near the lower limit of amphibole stability field. Interstitial melt in the underlying hotter <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> is inferred to be less evolved and less hydrous than the 4 I- 1 melt. Consequently, we think that the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> underlying the 4 I- 1 melt chamber was under intermediate–low H 2 O content condition and included orthopyroxene at lower T and two-pyroxene assemblage was limited to higher-T conditions. In the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush,</b> H 2 O-rich part including amphibole without pyroxenes locally existed (Fig.  5 a). Similar model of heterogeneous mushy reservoir was suggested for Central Snake River Plain ignimbrites (Ellis et al. 2014). In the case of the Aso- 4 eruption, partial collapse of the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> may have occurred immediately prior to eruption. This is because the 4 I- 1 pyroclasts include both amphiboles and pyroxenes stored in separated parts of the underlying <b>crystal</b> <b>mush,</b> and residence times of amphiboles in the 4 I- 1 melt were short. If we assume all phenocrysts were derived from the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> and the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> contained > 60 vol% of crystals, the volume ratio of collapsed <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> to the 4 I- 1 melt is estimated to be less than ~[*] 0.15. Therefore, the collapsed mush was limited to the part only near the 4 I- 1 melt chamber. We attribute this collapse to the injection of mafic magma prior to eruption, as inferred from the Al-enriched amphiboles of the 4 I- 1 pyroclasts, which are in equilibrium with higher-T andesitic melt (Fig.  4). Among the four caldera-forming ignimbrites, only the Aso- 4 pyroclasts contain amphibole phenocrysts. We attribute this to the following: (1) The <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> had an amphibole-bearing part locally only before Aso- 4 eruption and/or (2) because of the larger magnitude of the Aso- 4 eruption compared to other ignimbrite eruptions, the collapsed mush was large volume enough to include a locally distributed amphibole-bearing part.|$|E
30|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that some phenocrysts in caldera-forming magma are derived from <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> surrounding the magma chamber (e.g., Cooper 2017; Ellis et al. 2014). This is also the case for the Aso- 4 magma, as (1) amphibole, plagioclase, and Fe–Ti oxide minerals sometimes occur as crystal clots, (2) both amphiboles and some pyroxenes were in disequilibrium with the 4 I- 1 melt, (3) amphiboles and pyroxenes in the 4 I- 1 pyroclasts were crystallized in the discrete melts of different H 2 O contents and/or compositions, and (4) amphiboles not enriched in Al are common in the 4 I- 1 magma. These evidences indicate that they were incorporated into the 4 I- 1 melt from <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> that accumulated beneath the 4 I- 1 magma chamber. The <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> was formed by the accumulation of mineral phases that crystallized within the Aso- 4 magma reservoir. The accumulated <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> formed a thermal conduction layer {{at the base of the}} reservoir that inhibited cooling from the base. As a result, the magma reservoir cooled only from the roof and the underlying <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> layer had a higher temperature than the overlying magma chamber (e.g., Nishimura 2012). Therefore, the temperatures of the underlying crystal-mush-derived amphiboles are higher than those of the overlying 4 I- 1 melt.|$|E

This thesis explores this question through research at the Unzen Volcanic Complex (UVC), southwestern Japan, where a 500 ka history of crystal-rich dacitic dome eruptions has built the Unzen Volcanic Complex. Zircon geochronology has revealed the protracted history and evolution of the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> zone at the Unzen Volcanic Complex. Individual zircon surface-interior age pairs, together with zircon age spectra, suggest that portions of this <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> have been present in the crust {{since at least the}} late Older Unzen period (≥ 200 ka). Significant zircon growth appears to occur throughout the eruptive hiatus (200 - 100 ka), suggesting that magmatic activity continued uninterrupted through this period. Increasing hafnium contents and decreasing titanium contents with time suggest that the system has evolved towards an overall more evolved system since the late Older Unzen Period. Additionally, Older Unzen eruption samples show restricted chemistry, suggesting that crystallization may have occurred in a more homogenous, less evolved and possibly warmer <b>crystal</b> <b>mush,</b> compared to zircon of Younger Unzen (100 ka – present) that record variable storage conditions skewed towards a more evolved, poorly-mixed <b>crystal</b> <b>mush.</b> These results lead to the conclusion that eruptions at Unzen are tapping a mature and long-lived, multi-cycle mush of significant longevity...|$|E
40|$|Regarded as {{a classic}} example of a {{vertically}} differentiated intrusion, the ∼ 300 m thick Palisades sill of New Jersey has a thick floor zone and a thin roof zone and the rocks range in composition from Mg-rich diabase to Fe-rich diorite to granophyre. Differentiation of the sill is proposed to have occurred by two main igneous processes; transfer of <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> from the roof {{to the floor of the}} sill in the form of dense plumes and compaction of <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> in a thickening cumulate pile. ^ Rocks are pyroxene-phyric in the lower part of the sill, are of near-cotectic composition at the 100 -m level, and are plagioclase-phyric in the upper part of the sill. This change in composition suggests a process of plume transfer of an originally pyroxene-saturated magma. Some neutrally buoyant plagioclase phenocrysts were lost from the earliest descending plumes only to be caught up in later descending plumes to form the plagioclase-rich rocks in the upper part of the sill. ^ Plumes of <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> that deposited on the floor generated a thick cumulate pile that underwent compaction, expelling residual liquid upward to form coarse-grained segregation sheets at high levels in the sill. Bent and broken crystals provide physical evidence of compaction of <b>crystal</b> <b>mush,</b> and the degree of compaction is estimated by directly measuring the deformation of the plagioclase-chain network present in the rocks. ^ Cm-scale modal layering observed at the 100 -m level develops in rocks with a near-cotectic composition. Each couplet in the layering is defined as an overlying plagioclase-rich layer and an underlying pyroxene-rich layer. Detailed analysis shows that the modal layers are more complicated than variation in the abundance of pyroxene and plagioclase. Plagioclase-rich layers contain plagioclase crystals that are imbricated and specific types of pyroxene that are present in the pyroxene-rich layers are absent in the plagioclase-rich layers. Modal layering of the type in the Palisades ill is proposed to form from the redistribution of pyroxene in response to compact on along the base of deposited plumes of <b>crystal</b> <b>mush.</b> Pyroxene dissolves and diffuses downward to form a pyroxene-rich layer below and leaving a plagioclase-rich layer above. ...|$|E
30|$|Most of the magmas {{that erupted}} {{after the last}} caldera-forming {{eruption}} have basaltic–andesitic compositions (Miyoshi et al. 2012), and the present-day magma chamber is thought to contain mafic magma (Unglert et al. 2011). This suggests that the present magma plumbing system was formed after the Aso- 4 eruption. The consistency between {{the depths of the}} Aso- 4 and the present-day magma reservoirs may imply that the depth of the present-day magma reservoir is strongly influenced by the structure of the Aso- 4 magma reservoir. We suggest that the relic of the Aso- 4 magma reservoir created a density barrier that inhibited the ascent of newly supplied post-caldera mafic magmas, meaning that they resided at the depth (Fig.  5 e, f). After caldera collapse, the collapsed magma reservoir was filled by low-density breccia (e.g., Lipman 1984), which is less dense than mafic magma and hence acted as a density barrier. The <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> layer that remained beneath the collapsed magma reservoir further inhibited the ascent of post-caldera mafic magmas. The Aso- 4 ejecta are crystal-poor (~[*] 5 – 10 vol%; Kaneko et al. 2007; with the exception of scoriae); consequently, {{a large part of the}} <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> layer is thought to have remained. The <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> consisted of andesitic–dacitic melt, plagioclase, and mafic minerals, with density similar to, or lower than, that of mafic melt. As a result, sills of dense mafic magma formed at a similar depth to that of the 4 I- 1 magma chamber. The post-caldera mafic magmas may have chemically interacted with the remaining <b>crystal</b> <b>mush,</b> although the Aso- 4 and post-caldera basaltic–andesitic magmas have similar isotopic compositions (Miyoshi et al. 2011 b); consequently, their interaction is difficult to detect using isotopic data. The formation and differentiation of mafic sills at depth also created additional barriers for the ascending mafic magma. Our results indicate that the post-caldera magma plumbing system was strongly influenced by the collapsed silicic magma reservoir that remained after the Aso- 4 caldera-forming eruption.|$|E
40|$|Examples of {{reworked}} sedimentary structures (asymmetric ripple forms, planar cross-stratification, and a scour structure) {{and modified}} sedimentary structures (load casts) are described from the layered, gabbroic Kalka Intrusion in central Australia. The reworked structures {{are thought to}} be produced by the action of vigorous, unidirectional, localized currents of convectional origin. Current velocities have been estimated at between 0 - 001 and 5 cm sec" 1 for the lower flow regime structures, and greater than 01 cm sec" 1 for the scour structure. These compare well with theoretical convection velocities in magmas. Pyroxene/pla-gioclase mobility within basaltic magmas is greater than sand mobility in aqueous systems. The advent of the current activity which produced the scour is associated with a change from discontinuous to continuous nucleation (Goode, 1976), probably due to the increased turbulence in the crystallization zone.

40|$|Ureilites {{containing}} homogeneous Fo 76 olivine cores in intimate co-existence with graphite {{must have}} recrystallized at pressures {{of at least}} approximately 100 bars to suppress smelting of the fayalite component of the olivine to Fe metal. Smelting of olivine and pyroxene-saturated magmatic liquids produces orthopyroxene-without-olivine crystalline derivatives unlike those in ureilites. Thus the Mg# compositional variation within the ureilite suite, which is commonly attributed to partial smelting, cannot plausibly be produced by assemblages rich in liquid. In situ smelting of graphitic olivine + pigeonite <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes</b> can produce the correct crystal assemblage, but fails to provide a plausible account {{for the removal of}} metal from ureilites or for the correlation of Mg# with Delta O- 17.

40|$|Mafic magmas {{are common}} in {{subduction}} zone settings, yet their high density restricts their ascent to the surface. Once stalled in the crust, these magmas may differentiate, and assimilate crust and other melts and <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes</b> to produce hybridized intermediate magmas. The Soufrière Hills Volcano on Montserrat is a ‘type locality’ for such hybridization processes and yet, just 3 ?km south of the crater, voluminous basalts have erupted from the South Soufrière Hills volcano within {{the same time period}} as the Soufrière Hills Volcano was erupting hybrid andesites (131 – 128 ?ka). Basaltic South Soufrière Hills magmas have 48 – 53 ?wt % SiO 2 and 4 – 6 ?wt % MgO. They were hot (970 – 1160 °C), volatile-rich (melt inclusions contain up to 6 · 2 ?wt % H 2 O) and were stored at 8 – 13 ?km depth prior to eruption (based on olivine- and pyroxene-hosted melt inclusion volatile geochemistry). Melt inclusions do not preserve basaltic liquids: they are andesitic to rhyolitic in composition, related to one another by a line of descent controlled by simple closed-system fractionation. Whole-rock compositions, however, are best described by a hybridization model involving ‘back-mixing’ of andesitic to rhyolitic melts with mafic crystal phases such as magnetite, olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene. Phenocryst zoning illustrates repeated mixing events between evolved melts and mafic phenocrysts; this feature, when coupled with the heterogeneity of crystal compositions, strongly suggests that although the bulk compositions are basaltic (containing Fo 80 olivine), they were assembled from disparate ingredients, probably derived from mafic <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes</b> and more evolved melt lenses of variable composition. The mixing events occur days to weeks prior to eruption. We propose that the South Soufrière Hills basaltic magmas, with their higher bulk density relative to andesites from neighbouring volcanoes, ultimately may have been eruptible owing to both the transtensional tectonics imposed by offshore grabens (related to oblique subduction in the Lesser Antilles arc) and surface unloading caused by large-scale edifice collapse. Our observations support the idea that compositional changes in arcs might reflect not only changes in source compositions, but also effects caused by variations in crustal strain and tectonics...|$|R
40|$|Zircon {{ages and}} trace element {{compositions}} from recent silicic eruptions in the Lassen Volcanic Center (LVC) allow for {{an evaluation of}} the timing and conditions of rejuvenation (reheating and mobilization of crystals) within the LVC magmatic system. The LVC is the southernmost active Cascade volcano and, prior to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, was the site of the only eruption in the Cascade arc during the last century. The three most recent silicic eruptions from the LVC were very small to moderate-sized lava flows and domes of dacite (1915 and 27 ka eruptions of Lassen Peak) and rhyodacite (1. 1 ka eruption of Chaos Crags). These eruptions produced mixed and mingled lavas that contain a diverse crystal cargo, including zircon. 238 U- 230 Th model ages from interior and surface analyses of zircon reveal ages from ∼ 17 ka to secular equilibrium (> 350 ka), with most zircon crystallizing during a period between ∼ 60 - 200 ka. These data support a model for localized rejuvenation of <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> beneath the LVC. This <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> evidently is the remnant of magmatism that ended ∼ 190 ka. Most zircon are thought to have been captured from "cold storage" in the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> (670 - 725 °C, Hf > 10, 000 ppm, Eu/Eu* 0. 25 - 0. 4) locally remobilized by intrusion of mafic magma. A smaller population of zircon (> 730 °C, Hf 0. 4) grew in, and are captured from, rejuvenation zones. These data suggest the dominant method to produce eruptible melt within the LVC is small-scale, local rejuvenation of the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> accompanied by magma mixing and mingling. Based on zircon stability, the time required to heat, erupt and then cool to background conditions is relatively short, lasting a maximum of 10 s- 1000 s years. Rejuvenation events in the LVC are ephemeral and permit eruption within an otherwise waning and cooling magmatic body...|$|E
40|$|Ciomadul is the {{youngest}} volcano in the Carpathian-Pannonian region produced crystal-rich high-K dacites that contain abundant amphibole phenocrysts. The amphiboles in the studied dacites are characterized by large variety of zoning patterns, textures, and {{a wide range of}} compositions (e. g., 6. 4 - 15 wt% Al 2 O 3, 79 - 821 ppm Sr) often in thin-section scale and even in single crystals. Two amphibole populations were observed in the dacite: low-Al hornblendes represent a cold (900 °C) mafic magma. Amphibole thermobarometry suggests that the silicic <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> was stored in an upper crustal storage (~ 8 - 12 km). This was also the place where the erupted dacitic magma was formed during the remobilization of upper crustal silicic <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> body by hot mafic magma indicated by simple-zoned and composite amphiboles. This includes reheating (by ~ 200 °C) and partial remelting of different parts of the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> followed by intensive crystallization of the second mineral population (including pargasites). Breakdown textures of amphiboles imply that they were formed by reheating in case of hornblendes, suggesting that pre-eruptive heating and mixing could take place within days or weeks before the eruption. The decompression rim of pargasites suggests around 12 days of magma ascent in the conduit. Several arc volcanoes produce mixed intermediate magmas with similar bimodal amphibole cargo as the Ciomadul, but in our dacite the two amphibole population can be found even in a single crystal (composite amphiboles). Our study indicates that high-Al pargasites form as a second generation in these magmas after the mafic replenishment into a silicic capture zone; thus, they cannot unambiguously indicate a deeper mafic storage zone beneath these volcanoes. The simple-zoned and composite amphiboles provide direct evidence that significant compositional variations of amphiboles do not necessarily mean variation in the pressure of crystallization even if the Al-tschermak substitution can be recognized, suggesting that amphibole barometers that consider only amphibole composition may often yield unrealistic pressure variatio...|$|E

The anorthositic suite can be accounted for by three magma types, the composition of which are basaltic, jotunitic and charnockitic. Each magma generates part of the suite, with some overlapping. The basaltic magma is mantle-derived in an undefined geodynamic environment. The alkali to alkali-calcic jotunitic magma is generated as distinct batches with variable crustal signatures, due to contamination by deep-crustal material or direct partial melting of this material. The charnockitic magma can be produced by fractionation of the jotunites but can also result from direct partial melting in granulite facies conditions. For both magma types partial melting is triggered by the hot anorthosite diapirs en route to their final level of emplacement. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The internal flow structure of the orebody is studied here using the low-field anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) method. Partial anhysteretic remanent magnetization (pAARM) indicates that coarse magnetite is the main mineral responsible for the magnetic fabric.

40|$|The Marginal Border Series of the Skaergaard {{intrusion}} (East Greenland) crystallized in situ on {{the vertical}} {{walls of the}} magma chamber. It is subdivided into an outer Unbanded Division and an inner Banded Division. The Banded Division contains abundant centimetre- to decimetre-thick bands dominated by fine-grained mafic minerals, with a morphology evolving from almost planar to deeply scalloped and fingered with increasing distance from the intrusion margin. The morphology of these bands {{is reminiscent of the}} reaction fronts described in sedimentary basins infiltrated by reactive fluids. We propose that the banding in the Skaergaard Marginal Border Series is produced by chemical disequilibrium resulting from the suction of primitive liquid from the main magma body into the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush,</b> driven by shrinkage of the mush during solidification. Liquid porous flow results in partial dissolution of evolved pre-existing mafic minerals in the mush. This changes the mush liquid composition to one capable of crystallizing mafic rocks with a very minor plagioclase component. Abrupt solidification of this liquid, resulting {{in the formation of the}} colloform bands, is explained by supersaturation of some mafic mineral components (e. g. olivine, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides) in the infiltrating melt.

An anorthosite layer locally transgresses several 10 s of meters into its footwall, forming what {{is referred to as}} a “pothole” in the Bushveld Complex. It is proposed that the anorthosites formed from plagioclase-rich <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes</b> that originally accumulated at or {{near the top of the}} cumulate pile. The slurries were mobilised during tectonism induced by chamber subsidence, a model that bears some similarity to that generally proposed for oceanic mass flows. The anorthosite slurries locally collapsed into pull-apart structures and injected their hostrocks. The final step was down-dip drainage of Fe-rich intercumulus liquid, leaving behind anorthosite adcumulates...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{rheology}} of suspensions of ice crystals at moderate to high volume fractions in a sucrose solution {{in which they}} are partially soluble, a model system for a wide class of <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes</b> or slurries. Under step changes in shear rate, the viscosity changes to a relaxed value over several minutes, in a manner well fitted by a single exponential. The behavior of the relaxed viscosity is power-law shear thinning with shear rate, with an exponent of − 1. 76 ± 0. 25, so that shear stress falls with increasing shear rate. On longer time scales, the crystals ripen (leading to a falling viscosity) so that the mean radius increases with time to the power 0. 14 ± 0. 07. We speculate that this unusually small exponent is due to the interaction of classical ripening dynamics with abrasion or breakup under flow. We compare the rheological behavior to mechanistic models based on flow-induced aggregation and breakup of crystal clusters, finding that the exponents can be predicted from liquid phase sintering and breakup by brittle fracture.

40|$|The Platreef is a {{platinum}} group {{elements and}} base metal enriched mafic/ultramafic layer situated along {{the base of}} the northern limb of the Bushveld Complex. The present study contains a detailed petrographic and geochemical investigation of a borehole core intersection through the Platreef on the farm Townlands. At this locality, the Platreef rests on metasedimentary rocks of the Silverton Formation of the Transvaal Supergroup, and is comprised of three medium-grained units of gabbronorite/feldspathic pyroxenite that are separated by hornfels interlayers. We refer to the three platiniferous layers as the Lower, Middle and Upper Platreef. The Middle Platreef is the main mineralised layer, with total PGE contents up to 4 ppm. The Lower and Upper Platreefs are less well mineralised (up to 1. 5 ppm). Trace element and S-isotope data show compositional breaks between the different platiniferous layers suggesting that they represent distinct sill-like intrusions of pyroxene and sulphide enriched <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes.</b> The study also reveals a reversed differentiation trend of more primitive rocks towards the top of the succession. For example, orthopyroxene shows an increase in Cr (sub 2) O (sub 3) from 0. 07 to 0. 37 weight...|$|R
40|$|Fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges (MOR) are {{underlain}} by a thin, quasi-steady-state melt or <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> body at {{the base}} of the sheeted dykes, referred to as the axial melt lens (AML). Although the AML is thought to play a key role in the development of MOR basalts (MORB), debate persists regarding the composition of the AML and the role it plays in the accretion of the lower crust. I address this question by studying a suite of varitextured gabbronorites from the Hess Deep rift valley in the equatorial Pacific Ocean which are interpreted to have formed in the AML of the East Pacific Rise. This unique sample set provides an unparalleled opportunity to conduct the first comprehensive investigation of the AML at a fast-spreading MOR. To facilitate this study, I here develop a method for the quantitative assessment of compositional distribution (QACD) in whole-thin-section element maps. QACD facilitates rapid data collection and processing to generate mineral modes, element and molar-ratio maps, and quantifying full-sample compositional distributions. My application of QACD to the Hess Deep AML suite reveals that mineral phases within the AML here are too evolved to be in equilibrium with MORB. I test the broader applicability of this conclusion by conducting detailed mapping and sampling of an analogous AML horizon in the Oman Ophiolite (Wadi Saq, Ibra Valley). This section is characterised by an evolved sheeted dyke complex rooting into a quartz diorite-hosted AML, supporting the supposition that the AML accommodates the fractionation of highly-evolved melts. I propose a model wherein the AML is predominantly fed by small volumes of evolved interstitial melts expelled from the underlying <b>crystal</b> <b>mush.</b> In the months preceding decadal eruption events, short-lived, focused injections of primitive melts into the AML mix with the extant highly-fractionated melt and trigger eruptions. This model reconciles the apparent mismatch between the volcanic and plutonic records and inferences made on geophysical and petrological grounds. I suggest that the AML is an active player in the development of MORB, permitting the fractionation and storage of evolved melts expelled from the underlying <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> and recording the mixing of that material with primitive melt, hence fulfilling more of a passive role with respect to lower crustal accretion than previously proposed...|$|E
40|$|A petrologic {{study of}} twenty new {{silicate}} inclusions (15 gabbroic, 5 cryptocrystalline) in the Miles IIE iron was undertaken {{in order to}} help clarify the petrogenesis of this meteorite and its relationship to other IIE irons with silicates, as well as H-group chondrites. Nine of the inclusions were analyzed by the INAA method, which is presented in a companion paper. The results indicate that Miles was formed by shock events on an H-group chondrite parent body. It formed silicate melt and Fe-Ni-S-P melt by about 25 % partially melting, and left behind olivine-orthopyroxene residues. The silicate melt was a <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> which consisted of phenocrysts of high-Ca pyroxene, orthopyroxene and plagioclase, and residual melt. The phenocryst-enriched mush formed irregular-shaped gabbroic inclusions, which also contain minor olivine, inverted pigeonite, antiperthite, K-feldspar, tridymite, glass, chromite, rutile, ilmenite, armalcolite, chlorapatite, whitlockite, kamacite, taenite, schreibersite, troilite and pentlandite. The residual melt formed round- to ellipsoidal-shaped cryptocrystalline inclusions, which contain microphenocrysts of alkali feldspar or phenocrysts of pyroxene. The <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> was mixed with abundant Fe-Ni-S-P melt, from which most of the sulfur escaped, and from which some of the phosphorus reacted with the silicate melts, resulting in their reduction. This reduction produced Ca-poor magnesian orthopyroxene and Ca-poor plagioclase in the gabbroic inclusions. The degree of reduction was, however, more intense in the cryptocrystalline inclusions than in the gabbroic inclusions. The remaining phosphorus in the solid host metal exsolved as schreibersite around the silicate inclusions...|$|E

40|$|The Uitkomst {{intrusion}} is a tubular mafic-ultramafic {{layered body}} that hosts one of South Africa’s largest Ni-Cu-Cr-PGE deposits, Nkomati. The sulphide ore {{occurs in the}} form of massive lenses in the immediate quartzitic footwall and as disseminations within peridotite. The chromite ore forms an up to ∼ 10 -m-thick layer in the lower portion of the intrusion. Uitkomst has generally been interpreted as a magma conduit, possibly related to the Bushveld event. Here, we present a new high-precision U-Pb zircon date of 2057. 64 ± 0. 69 Ma that overlaps with the age of the Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex and thus demonstrates a coeval relationship between the intrusions. Based on incompatible trace elements as well as O- and Nd isotope data (εNd − 4. 5 to − 6. 2), we show that the Uitkomst parent magmas were contaminated with up to 20 % Archean upper crust prior to emplacement, and with up to 15 % dolomitic country rock during emplacement. Ore formation at Nkomati was critically aided by substantial devolatisation and removal of dolomitic floor rocks leading to hydrodynamic concentration of sulphide and chromite during slumping of <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes</b> into the trough-like centre of the subsiding intrusion and its footwall...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{relationships}} of four analyzed granitic rocks which comprise a late-stage felsic body sequence intruding the Mesozoic granodiorites and tonalites of the Needle Point pluton, Wallowa Batholith, Oregon, have been determined {{in the presence}} of 15 wt percent water at pressures to 3 kbar. Pressure-temperature curves were located for the beginning of melting, and for the disappearance of K-feldspar, quartz, plagio-clase, biotite, and hornblende in granodiorite no. 678, quartz monzonites nos. 685 and 774, and granite no. 705. Compositions and structural states of plagioclases from the granitic rocks, basic masses intruding the batholith, and mafic inclusions, as well as the compositions of coexisting feldspars, were determined using the electron microprobe analyzer. Variations in each of these parameters throughout the melting interval of each granitic rock were measured at 2 kbar pressure. Although experimental conditions (excess H_ 2 O present; fO_ 2 regulated but not controlled) forbid detailed comparison with natural occurrences, the results indicate that, at 2 kbar pressure, temperatures of at least 730 ° C and 780 ° C are required to generate liquids of granite and quartz monzonite composition. Several factors suggest that the normal product of partial fusion of many crustal rock types is a H_ 2 O-undersaturated granite liquid; <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes</b> with this type of liquid are probably involved if intermediate magmas are derived from crustal sources...|$|R
40|$|Protracted pre-eruptive zircon {{residence}} {{is frequently}} detected in continental rhyolites and can conflict with thermal models, indicating briefer magma cooling durations if scaled to erupted volumes. Here, we present combined U-Th and (U-Th) /He zircon ages from the Acigöl rhyolite field (Central Anatolia, Turkey), {{which is part}} of a Quaternary bimodal volcanic complex. Unlike other geochronometers, this approach dates crystallization and eruption on the same crystals, allowing for internal consistency testing. Despite the overall longevity of Acigöl rhyolite volcanism and systematic trends of progressive depletion in compatible trace elements and decreasing zircon saturation temperatures, we find that zircon crystallized in two brief pulses corresponding to eruptions in the eastern and western part of the field during Middle and Late Pleistocene times, respectively. For Late Pleistocene zircon, resolvable differences exist between interior (average: 30. 7 ± 0. 9 ka; 1 σ error) and rim (21. 9 ± 1. 3 ka) crystallization ages. These translate into radial crystal growth rates of ~ 10 ^(− 13) to 10 ^(− 14) cm/s, broadly consistent with those constrained by diffusion experiments. Rim crystallization and (U-Th) /He eruption ages (24. 2 ± 0. 4 ka) overlap within uncertainty. Evidence for brief zircon residence at Acigöl contrasts with many other rhyolite fields, suggesting that protracted zircon crystallization in, or recycling from, long-lived <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes</b> is not ubiquitous in continental silicic magma systems. Instead, the span of pre-eruptive zircon ages is consistent with autochthonous crystallization in individual small-volume magma batches that originated from basaltic precursors...|$|R
40|$|Post-collapse rhyolites of the Long Valley {{in eastern}} California {{are the product}} of {{remelting}} of <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> bodies via mafic rejuvenation following the eruption of the Bishop Tuff. This is supported by mineral textures and major element geochemistry from the Resurgent Dome rhyolite, the Moat rhyolite, the Hot Creek Flow, and the Deer Mountain rhyolite. New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar eruptive ages are reported for the Moat rhyolites (525 ka, 333 ka, 118 – 94 ka), Hot Creek Flow (312 – 295 ka), and the Deer Mountain rhyolite (65 ka). The initial post-collapse eruptions, resulting in the Resurgent Dome rhyolite, appear to be derived from the residual Bishop Tuff magma chamber and are characterized by euhedral, juvenile plagioclase and orthopyroxene phenocrysts in crystal poor rhyolites. At 525 ka, Moat rhyolites mark a major increase in mafic rejuvenation inducing rhyolitic magma production. Reverse zonation (An 18 – An 39) present in plagioclase populations indicates mafic magma injecting into the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> zone. Similarly, anti-rapakivi textures and plagioclase cores with labradorite compositions (An 56) found within 333 ka Moat rhyolites indicate mixing between mafic and rhyolitic melts. Spatially and temporally related Hot Creek Flow rhyolites appear to be the results of crystal poor rhyolitic melt extracted from the same magma body. A decrease in mafic inputs is exhibited the youngest Moat rhyolite where andesine core and oligoclase rim overgrowths are separated by dissolution surfaces in plagioclase populations. This relationship is displayed again in the culminating Deer Mountain eruption, but decrease in mafic input indicates a waning of the Long Valley magmatic system...|$|E
40|$|The sphene-centered ocellar texture {{consists}} of leucocratic ocelli with sphene (titanite) crystals at the center, enclosed in a biotite-rich matrix. This texture {{has been recognized}} worldwide in hybrid intermediate rocks. On the basis of structural, petrological, and geochronological data from selected outcrops of the Variscan Ribadelago pluton (NW Iberian Massif), we propose that the ocelli were formed by migration and accumulation of a residual melt through a plagioclase- and biotite-dominated crystalline framework. At the late stage of crystallization, the magma acted as a hyperdense suspension and reacted to the pressure gradient caused by the regional stress field, entering the domain of grain-supported flow. Microstructures reveal that aligned crystal domains arose in the crystal framework from the shearing and compaction of the <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> and behaved as magmatic microshears. Relative displacement of adjacent crystal clusters along these microshears corresponded to the onset of Reynolds dilatancy that generated {{an expansion of the}} <b>crystal</b> <b>mush,</b> involving melt migration and pore aperture. The mineralogy of the ocelli, dominated by andesine and sphene, represents the composition of the migrating melt. The chemistry of this late, Ti-rich melt stems from the incongruent melting of biotite. Magmatic sphene from the ocelli yields a U-Pb age of 317 +/- 1 Ma, which represents the final crystallization of the hybridized magmatic system. Moreover, this texture offers an opportunity to better understand the rheological behavior of highly crystallized magmas.

40|$|Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) provide {{fundamental}} {{information about}} the composition and melting processes in the Earth’s upper mantle. To use MORB to further {{our understanding of the}} mantle, is imperative that their crustal evolution is well understood and can thus be accounted for when estimating primary melt compositions. Here, we present the evidence for the occurrence of reactive porous flow, whereby migrating melts react with a <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> in mid-ocean ridge magma chambers. This evidence comprises both the textures and mineral major and trace element geochemistry of rocks recovered from the lower oceanic crust, and occurs on a range of scales. Reaction textures include dissolution fronts in minerals, ragged grain boundaries between different phases and clinopyroxene–brown amphibole symplectites. However, an important finding is that reaction, even when pervasive, can equally leave no textural evidence. Geochemically, reactive porous flow leads to shifts in mineral modes (e. g. the net replacement of olivine by clinopyroxene) and compositions (e. g. clinopyroxene Mg–Ti–Cr relationships) away from those predicted by fractional crystallization. Furthermore, clinopyroxene trace elements record a progressive core–rim over-enrichment (relative to fractional crystallization) of more-to-less incompatible elements as a result of reactive porous flow. The fact that this over-enrichment occurs over a distance of up to 8 mm, and that clinopyroxenes showing this signature preserve zoning in Fe–Mg, rules out a diffusion control on trace element distributions. Instead, it can be explained by crystal–melt reactions in a <b>crystal</b> <b>mush.</b> The data indicate that reactive flow occurs not only on a grain scale, but also on a sample scale, where it can transform one rock type into another [e. g. troctolite to olivine gabbro, olivine gabbro to (oxide) gabbro], and extends to the scale of the entire lower oceanic crust. Melts undergoing these reactive processes change in composition, which can explain both the major element and trace element arrays of MORB compositions. In particular, reactive porous flow can account for the MORB MgO–CaO–Al 2 O 3 relationships that have previously been interpreted as a result of high-pressure (up to � 8 kbar) crystal fractionation, and for over-enrichment in incompatible elements when compared with the effects of fractional crystallization. The finding of a significant role for reactive porous flow in mid-ocean ridge magma chambers fits very well with the geophysical evidence that these magma chambers are dominated by <b>crystal</b> <b>mush</b> even at the fastest spreading rates, and with model predictions of the behaviour of crystal mushes. Together, these observations indicate that reactive porous flow is a common, if not ubiquitous, process inherent to mushy magma chambers, and that it has a significant control on mid-ocean ridge magmatic evolution...|$|E
40|$|The Great Dyke {{contains}} the world's second largest platinum resource after the Bushveld Complex. Isotopic and trace element {{data from the}} interval straddling the contact between the Ultramafic and Mafic Sequences of the Great Dyke indicate a less enriched composition than in the Bushveld Complex (Great Dyke: Sri 0. 7024 – 0. 7028, εNd mostly − 1 to + 1, Ce/Sm 2 – 6; Bushveld: Sri 705 – 0. 709, εNd − 5 to − 7, Ce/Sm 5 – 15). These data are interpreted to reflect relatively moderate amounts of contamination of the Great Dyke parent magma. All analyzed isotopes show little variation across the Main Sulfide Zone and the ultramafic–mafic contact. This corroborates earlier work by other researchers that the Great Dyke crystallized from a single magma type. Mixing of compositionally distinct magmas, proposed to have caused sulfide melt saturation in the Bushveld Complex, seemingly played little or {{no role in the}} formation of the PGE mineralization in the Main Sulfide Zone, and neither did enhanced crustal contamination of specific magma batches. Instead, sulfide melt saturation of the magma was likely triggered by silicate fractionation. The mechanism of concentration of the sulfide melt remains uncertain, but theoretical considerations suggest that phase sorting in response to slumping of <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes,</b> possibly caused by chamber subsidence, played an important role. This model is consistent with the highly irregular, undulating nature of the contact between the mafic and ultramafic zones of the intrusion, in the hanging wall of the Main Sulfide Zone...|$|R

The cored sequence consists predominantly or olivine gabbro and troctolite and lesser amounts of gabbro, and gabbronorite rich in oxides. The section contains live major blocks of relatively primitive olivine gabbro and troctolite, composed of many smaller igneous bodies. Each Of these composite blocks shows a small upward decrease in Mg# [defined as 100 x Mg/(Mg + Fe 2 +) ] and contains more fractionated Fe- and Ti-rich gabbros near the top. Small, crosscutting bodies of olivine gabbro and troctolite with diffuse boundaries may represent conduits through <b>crystal</b> <b>mushes</b> for melts migrating upward and feeding individual intrusions. Oxide gabbros and gabbronorites are commonly associated with shear zones of intense deformation, which crosscut the section at all levels, However, oxide-rich rocks decrease in abundance downward and are nearly absent in the lower 500 m of the section. The gabbros and gabbronorites appear to have formed from late-stage, Fe- and Ti-rich, intercumulus melts that were expelled out of fractionating olivine gabbros into the shear zones. The fabrics of the recovered gabbros are consistent with synkinematic cooling and extension of the crustal section in a mid-ocean ridge environment. However, thick intervals of the core have only a weak magmatic foliation. The magmatic foliation is commonly overprinted by a weak, parallel, deformational fabric probably reflecting {{the transition from a}} largely magmatic to a largely crystalline state.
