50|$|This applies once an {{infestation}} is established. In many {{circles the}} first response to cutaneous myiasis once the breathing hole has formed, is {{to cover the}} air hole thickly with petroleum jelly. Lack of oxygen then forces the larva to the surface, where it can more easily be dealt with. In a <b>clinical</b> <b>or</b> <b>veterinary</b> setting {{there may not be}} time for such tentative approaches, and the treatment of choice might be more direct, with or without an incision. First the larva must be eliminated through pressure around the lesion and the use of forceps. Secondly the wound must be cleaned and disinfected. Further control is necessary to avoid further reinfestation.|$|R
30|$|The anti-adhesion {{property}} showed by SP 1 against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa strains is {{very interesting}} considering that the two opportunistic pathogens are able to form biofilms in open wounds, such as chronic diabetic foot ulcers, or infected wounds in clinical and veterinary medicine. New antimicrobial agents that are effective against staphylococci and P. aeruginosa to treat infected wounds are needed, and a potential topical application of SP 1 could be supposed. Moreover, the two species are also involved in food spoilage and biofilm formation of food transmitted pathogens and an application of SP 1 in the food processing is possible and closer, {{at this stage of}} our study, than application in <b>clinical</b> <b>or</b> <b>veterinary</b> health.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntegration of {{exogenous}} DNA into modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) {{is often}} accomplished using mapped deletion {{sites in the}} viral genome. Since MVA has a large capacity (≥ 30 kb) for foreign gene inserts and {{a limited number of}} unique integration sites, development of additional integration sites is needed {{to take full advantage of}} the extraordinary capacity for foreign gene insertion. In this report, we evaluate an alternative insertion site known as intergenic region 3 (IGR 3). Recombinant MVA carrying the cytomegalovirus pp 65 gene in IGR 3 (rMVA-pp 65 -IGR 3) demonstrated expression and genetic stability of the insert gene upon passage. Immunization of transgenic HLA-A 2 mice with rMVA-pp 65 -IGR 3 induced robust antigen-specific immune responses. Moreover, rMVA-pp 65 -IGR 3 -infected human EBV-transformed B cell lines were able to stimulate high levels of pp 65 -specific memory T cell responses in human PBMCs. These data support the usage of IGR 3 for the development of highly immunogenic rMVA vaccines for <b>clinical</b> <b>or</b> <b>veterinary</b> use...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Infectious {{diseases}} {{were one}} of the first health threats confronted by Coalition troops deployed to the Arabian desert in August 1990. On the basis of experiences in World War II, the major endemic infectious disease risks were thought to be sandfly fever, cutaneous leishmaniasis, diarrheal disease, and malaria. Although there was active surveillance, no case of sandfly fever and few other endemic infectious diseases were identified among over 500, 000 U. S., British, and Canadian ground troops. In addition, there was no diagnosis of biological warfare (BW) exposure, and BW agents were not detected in <b>clinical,</b> environmental, <b>or</b> <b>veterinary</b> samples. The most common infectious disease problems were those associated with crowding (acute upper respiratory infections) and reduced levels of sanitation (travelers-type diarrhea). Only one endemic infectious disease has been confirmed as causing chronic health problems: visceral Leishmania tropica infection (viscerotropic leishmaniasis). However, this protozoan infection was diagnosed in only 12 U. S. veterans, and no new cases have been identified during the last 8 years. Infectious diseases were not a serious problem for Gulf War troops because of extensive preventive medicine efforts and favorable weather and geographic factors. Moreover, it is unlikely that an endemic infectious disease or a BW agent could cause chronic health problems and remain undetected over a 10 -year period...|$|R

40|$|Ear {{base and}} rectal {{temperature}} of 21 multiparous sows were measured {{in order to}} detect estrus for optimal insemination time. A thermistor was implanted in the ear base and wire-connected to a data-acquisition system, allowing time-sampling with a measuring accuracy of 0. 1 degrees C. Air temperature {{in the neighborhood of}} the sows was measured with the same equipment. Rectal temperature was measured each day in the afternoon with a <b>veterinary</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Following the rectal temperature measurement, a blood sample was taken to determine oestradiol- 17 beta content. The combination of the physiological measurement with the observation of the standing reflex of the sows made estrus detection very reliable. A statistically significant rise of ear base (1. 1 +/- 0. 12 degrees C) and rectal (0. 65 +/- 0. 3 degrees C) temperature was observed two days before estrus. Moreover, when relating variation in ear base temperature to environmental temperature, estrus detection and environmental temperature control may be improved. These results offer new possibilities for introduction of injectable electronic identification and monitoring systems for sow management. status: publishe...|$|R
