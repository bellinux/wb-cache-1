25|$|The {{early studies}} of {{archaeology}} and genetics Sardinia {{may have been}} plagued by incorrect assumptions.

In addition, if African contributions to Sardinia were largely a consequence of small numbers of founders prior to the Holocene, given rise in sea levels and low population densities, archaeological observations may not represent early occupation or cultural patterns.

These algae mineralize their carbonate during short periods in summer. Throughout the Palaeogene, we compare the δ 18 O variation {{of these two}} taxa to identify a possible common factor influencing their isotopic composition, i. e. temperatures variations, from a local environmental signal. We sampled and isotopically analyzed eight species of charophytes and seven species of dasycladales from 23 formations ranging from the Palaeocene to the Oligocene series of the Paris Basin. By comparing the δ 18 O of these two groups living in different environment with that of shallow-marine mollusks from a previous study, we show that temperature variations are the main factor influencing their δ 18 O compositions and that local environmental effects do not screen the global thermal signal. Maximum annual palaeotemperatures are calculated from the δ 18 O of the dasycladales and indicate by comparison with the data from mollusks previously analyzed that dasycladales species used probably mineralized their carbonate in equilibrium with sea-water. Dasycladales recorded the global climatic events already known for the Palaeogene, with high temperatures reached during the Early Eocene and Middle Eocene <b>climatic</b> <b>optimums</b> and relative cooling intervals during the Lutetian, the Priabonian and the Rupelian. Charophyte gyrogonites also recorded temperature variations in their δ 18 O compositions but reconstituting reliable temperature values in non-marine environments is not directly possible and requires constraining δ 18 O of local continental water using other proxies. These promising results show that carbonates mineralized from algae constitute a reliable support for palaeoclimatic information and should be more widely used in the fossil record...|$|R

25|$|The {{final blow}} {{may have come}} when the {{favorable}} agricultural conditions during the Holocene <b>climatic</b> <b>optimum,</b> which lasted from 7000 to 3200 B.C., quite suddenly changed, resulting in the arid Sub-Boreal phase, which created the worst and longest drought in Europe {{since the end of}} the last Ice Age. The large Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements, which relied entirely on subsistence agriculture for support, would have faced very nasty Dust Bowl conditions, making it impossible to continue their way of life. It is theorized that the combination of this drought and the existence of neighboring nomadic pastoralist tribes led to the complete collapse of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, and the abandonment of their settlements, as members of the culture left behind the plow to take up the saddle of a nomad, as pastoralists are better equipped to eke out a living in an arid environment. The results were that by 2750 B.C. the Proto-Indo-European culture completely dominated the area. The primitive trade network of the Cucuteni-Trypillia society that had been slowly growing more complex was thus abruptly ended, along with the culture that supported it. Or, rather, it was supplanted by another more advanced trade network as the Proto-Indo-Europeans moved in to take the land, and to bring with them an entirely new society with division of labor, a ruling and religious elite, social stratification, and, in a word, civilization.|$|E

Durations inside and outside an <b>optimum</b> <b>climatic</b> range and of extreme climatic conditions were calculated over a 5 -year period (1999 / 2000 to 2003 / 2004) to quantify a climatic profle related to grapevine physiological requirements. <b>Climatic</b> requirements for <b>optimum</b> photosynthetic activity were defned as follows: temperature 25 °C to 30 °C, windspeed 35 °C, > 4 m/s, 80 %. A coeffcient was assigned to each climatic parameter according to an assumed importance level for physiological processes. Optimum temperature requirements for other physiological parameters were also investigated. A diurnal minimum/maximum temperature range of 25 °C to 30 °C was used for sugar content and organic acid levels and a maximum night/day temperature range of 15 °C/ 25 °C for colour and favour. Light intensity was accepted as being suffcient. Stations were classifed according to their potential for meeting the climatic requirements of each physiological parameter.

Only the movement of {{the last ice}} sheet in this period left a visible effect on the features of the region. About 11,500 years ago a spruce dominated forest began to emerge in its place, with some of the vegetation being ash, juniper, sedges, buffaloberry, and trembling aspen.

40|$|This study records {{all known}} legume (Leguminosae/Fabaceae) species {{indigenous}} to South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland to establish distribution patterns and <b>optimum</b> <b>climatic</b> and soil conditions for growth. The main {{purpose was to}} propose a list of legume species for further evaluation of their pasture potential. Collection data supplied by the National Herbarium (PRE) Computerised Information System were recorded to establish the distribution patterns of species based on the bioregions vegetation map. A total of 1 654 species {{are known to be}} indigenous, representing 24 tribes and 122 genera. The grouping of legume species into five main clusters and 16 Leguminochoria is ecologically described, with the highest legume species richness found in the Northern Mistbelt Forest. Key and diagnostic species are provided for each Leguminochorion. Soil pH and mean annual minimum temperature were found to be the main drivers for distinguishing between legume assemblages. The <b>optimum</b> <b>climatic</b> and soil conditions for growth are described as well as the available descriptive attributes for species recorded. Information on the range of tolerance of most species to abiotic factors is presented. Mean annual rainfall and soil pH are highly correlated with the distribution pattern of most species, followed by mean annual minimum temperature. Legume species adapted {{to a wide range of}} soil pH levels and low soil phosphorus levels are recorded. Existing data on the cultivation and grazing or browsing status of indigenous legumes were used to select 584 species found mainly in the Central Bushveld, Mopane and Lowveld Bioregions to be further evaluated for their pasture potential. Known characteristics were used to categorise species. Species contained in the tribe Phaseoleae are of special interest since it contains most of the genera with present-day agricultural value, i. e. Eriosema, Rhynchosia and Vigna species are listed as having high potential as pasture species. This study has shown that the descriptive and distribution data accumulated by botanists (notably taxonomists) could be of beneficial use in meeting agricultural objectives. Indigenous legumes are adapted to a wide range of soil and climatic conditions and represent a valuable but largely unexploited natural resource for pasture development and soil conservation practices.

40|$|Carbon and {{nitrogen}} stable isotopes in bone collagen can provide valuable {{information about the}} diet and habitat of mammal species. However, bone collagen degrades in normal circumstances very rapidly, and isotope analyses are therefore usually restricted to fossil material with a Late Pleistocene or Holocene age.

In this context, a regional assessment of biomass availability for energy use has been carried out for the south west region of England.
