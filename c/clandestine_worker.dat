50|$|The {{persisting}} {{labour shortage}} in the cacao, coffee and logging industries {{led to a}} booming trade in illegal canoe-based smuggling of Igbo and Ibibio workers from the Eastern Provinces of Nigeria. The number of <b>clandestine</b> contract <b>workers</b> {{on the island of}} Fernando Po grew to 20,000 in 1942. A labour treaty was signed with the British Crown in the same year. This led to a continuous stream of Nigerian workers going to Spanish Guinea. By 1968 at the time of independence, almost 100,000 ethnic Nigerians were living and working in Spanish Guinea.|$|R
40|$|In 1998, {{researchers}} in Burkina Faso enrolled 300 women {{more or less}} involved in commercial sex work in an open cohort to determine whether adequate management of their sexually transmitted infections and exposure to well-designed, well-delivered, and plentiful communication for behaviour change (CBC) might reduce their vulnerability to HIV. In 2000, they observed that the non-professional sex <b>workers</b> (occasional or <b>clandestine</b> sex <b>workers)</b> were more difficult to reach, to mobilize and to keep involved in the project's different activities. This group was also infected at the same or higher rates than professional sex workers {{because they did not}} use condoms routinely. To accomplish the project objectives, they therefore chose to recruit more non-professional sex workers in the new cohort of 700 women. This social-anthropological study was conducted to help them to enrol young <b>clandestine</b> sex <b>workers.</b> The overall objective {{of this study was to}} understand the life of this category of sex workers and to identify strategic actors to reach them. Using a qualitative method, social anthropologists reviewed literature, identified and geo-referenced all local places suitable to encountering these women, obtained life stories from some of them and interviewed key informants and participants in the field. The results showed that in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) : - most young women who are <b>clandestine</b> sex <b>workers</b> are Burkinabé, and girls entering the sex trade are increasingly young and increasingly uneducated; - most of them come from families with low capital (financial, cultural, or social). The parents' socioeconomic status (contextual poverty) results in unmet financial needs, which in turn exposes them to starting work early, including commercial sex work; - of all the income-generating activities available to unskilled young girls, commercial sex work is one of the most profitable and easily accessible; - in the three-fold context of an HIV epidemic, poverty, and unemployment, clandestine commercial sex work is a rational action, insofar as condom use reduces the risk of HIV infection, "clandestinity" reduces the risk of social stigma, and earnings increase financial capital; - girls are coopted into sex work through an initiation process and the initiator explains to the initiate how sex workers think, act, and live, as well as the rules of the trade; - young <b>clandestine</b> commercial sex <b>workers</b> use various strategies to do their work in secret, unidentified, by changing the time, place, period, district, city or country of their work; - young <b>clandestine</b> commercial sex <b>workers</b> maintain friendly relations with men or boys in but have no or conflictual relationships with women and girls. Thus, only other participants in this trade, peer counsellors, and room renters can serve as strategic actors to reach, mobilize and keep these young girls in HIV programmes. Social anthropologists have concluded that one problem in the fight against official or professional commercial sex work is the development of clandestine commercial sex work, which is more dangerous, firstly for its practitioners, who are harder to reach by messages about HIV and thus do not change their behaviour, secondly, for their sexual partners who do not use condoms systematically, and finally for society as a whole, to the extent that social actors are embedded in an informal network, more or less extensive, of sexual partners.

40|$|Clandestine {{prostitution}} {{has become}} a way of survival as many women struggle economically without family or governmental aid. Clandestine or survival sex is practiced when women are facing an economic dilemma. These women are non-literate and have no job skills. Further, they do not see themselves as sex workers because they only “go out” (colloquial for prostituting) occasionally. In light of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it is important to reach these women as they are exposed to HIV infection and violence. Based on literary research, observations, focus groups and interviews with the personnel working with registered and <b>clandestine</b> sex <b>workers</b> in Senegal in 2009, my paper discusses clandestine prostitution and its impact on HIV/AIDS prevention.

30|$|Migration {{from rural}} to urban areas {{has been the}} norm since colonial times for some groups in West Africa. Historically, {{migrants}} regarded the sub-region as an economic unit within which the trade in goods and services have typically flowed, and where people moved freely (Adepoju 2005). Migration from and within the West African sub-region has included temporary cross-border workers, traders, farm laborers, professionals, <b>clandestine</b> <b>workers</b> and refugees. Overall migration in West Africa has essentially been an intra-regional and short-term response to the interdependent economics of neighboring countries (Adepoju 2005). Historically, males dominated short-to-long-distance migrations in West Africa, though some women traders and farm laborers {{were part of the}} migrant force during colonial times, such that, recently, female migration has grown faster in contrast to male population shifts. Migration from and within West Africa is now increasingly feminized (Adepoju 2004). A growing number of recent studies on migration with a focus on gender (Beauchemin and Bocquier, 2004; Collinson et al. 2006; Reed et al. 2010) have provided data that show the feminization of migration in sub-Saharan Africa. Until recently, many studies examined the impact of male migration in Africa in general or West Africa in particular, but less work has focused on women’s migration in West Africa. Sudarkasa (1977) and Hill (1972) reveal the substantial female migration in West Africa especially from rural to urban communities; other studies have focused on different patterns of women's migration depending on the cultural groups (Olofson 1976; Pittin 1984). Most of the studies reveal that some of the factors that condition women’s migration in West African countries are due to education, labor, marriage, trading, etc. Female migrants are also increasingly drawn to the wage labor market (both formal and informal) as a survival strategy to augment meager family income. Among the educated, emigration of unaccompanied married females has blossomed, this being a particular phenomenon in the sub-region’s migration scene. However, among the undereducated and uneducated women, migration tends to be more a common phenomenon of married women accompanying their husbands.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence and risk factors of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female sex workers (FSWs) in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 2002. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted among FSWs presenting for the first time at the STI clinic of Matonge, Kinshasa. The women were interviewed about sociodemographic characteristics, type of sex work, and sexual behavior. Blood was taken for HIV, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus type 2 serology. Vaginal secretions were collected on swabs for the diagnosis of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. RESULTS: The overall HIV prevalence was 12. 4 % but varied within the different categories of FSWs: 11. 8 % in hotel-based, 24. 0 % in home-based, and 20. 0 % in street-based FSWs; 10. 0 % in homeless FSWs; and 6. 6 % in Masquées (<b>clandestine</b> sex <b>workers).</b> The overall herpes simplex virus type 2 seroprevalence was 58. 5 %.

50|$|Between 1926 and 1959 Bioko and Rio Muni {{were united}} as the colony of Spanish Guinea. The economy {{was based on}} large cacao and coffee {{plantations}} and logging concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant contract labour from Liberia, Nigeria, and Cameroun. Military campaigns were mounted to subdue the Fang people in the 1920s, {{at the time that}} Liberia was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929. However, Rio Muni had a small population, officially put at a little over 100,000 in the 1930s, and escape over the frontiers into Cameroun or Gabon was very easy. Moreover, the timber companies needed growing amounts of labour, and the spread of coffee cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes. Fernando Po thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The French only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be Igbo smuggled in canoes from Calabar and Oron, Nigeria. The persisting labour shortage in the cacao, coffee and logging industries was only overcome by the mushrooming illegal canoe-based smuggling of Igbo and Ibibio workers from the Eastern Provinces of Nigeria. The number of <b>clandestine</b> contract <b>workers</b> on the island of Fernando Po grew to 20,000 in 1942. A labour treaty was signed in the same year, and a continuous stream of workers arrived in Spanish Guinea. It was this treaty which really permitted Fernando Po to become one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the Second World War. By 1968 there were almost 100,000 Nigerians in Spanish Guinea.|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} effects of World War I on {{the port city of}} Alexandria, Egypt through the investigation and trial of a serial murder case that took place in 1920 - 21. The victims of the serial murders were seventeen women who had engaged in clandestine sex work in Alexandria during the war, and their death marked the rise of domestic trafficking networks in interwar Egypt. Two of the female accomplices to the murders, Raya and Sakina, became scapegoats for the crime and were the first women in Egyptian history to receive the death penalty. Numerous Egyptian films, TV shows and comedies have been produced about these murders in recent decades, and the case is still widely known throughout the Middle East today as "Raya and Sakina. " Despite the many afterlives of this case, no historian has studied the two thousand pages of handwritten legal records that were produced about these murders. My dissertation utilizes the records of the Egyptian National Archives and Library, the microfilm collection of the National Judicial Studies Center in Egypt, and the digitized materials of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina to analyze the case in its broader historical context. I argue that the murder of the <b>clandestine</b> sex <b>workers</b> and the execution of Raya and Sakina marked the formation of new relationships of power between workers, the state, and an expanding middle class, and new discursive relationships between gender, sexuality, class and criminality. This study examines how these relationships were institutionalized legally, materially, spatially, and discursively, leading to the spread of middle-class modernity in Egypt {{and the beginning of the}} end of cosmopolitan Alexandria...|$|R
40|$|Euro-Mediterranean Consortium for Applied Research on International Migration (CARIM) At the {{crossroads}} of Asia, Africa and Europe, Turkey faces irregular migration flows, both as a country of destination and of transit: the irregular migration flows to the country consist mainly of transit migrants, <b>clandestine</b> immigrant <b>workers,</b> asylum seekers and refugees. In the last decade, the major migration flows into Turkey have come from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, while significant numbers have also arrived from Moldova, Romania, Ukraine, the Russian Federation and Georgia. Migrants from the former countries are mainly transients heading for Europe or other more developed parts of the world. They stay in Turkey only on a temporary basis. Migrants from the latter group of countries are foreign nationals who intend to work illegally in Turkey, for a limited period of time. Turkey’s position over the 1951 Geneva Convention, excluding non-European asylum seekers, further complicates the situation as non-Europeans account {{for the majority of}} asylum seekers in Turkey. Another feature of migration to Turkey is the national diversity of the immigrants: authorities in Turkey have identified 163 nationalities that have arrived in the country in the last decade. Clearly, Turkey has become a country with multiple roles in irregular migratory movements. Utilising a relatively revealing data set on the apprehending of irregular migrants provided by the security forces together with the findings of several surveys conducted in the country, this paper, first, documents the irregular migration experience in Turkey over the last 30 years. It also relates the phenomenon of irregular migration in Turkey to the wider context of European international migratory regimes. Then the paper outlines the developments associated with irregular migration in the country. The role of Turkey’s EU affairs within these changes is complex and contradictory, and not yet fully explored. After describing irregular migration, the paper explores, finally, {{the way in which the}} political construction of irregular migration is associated with the securitisation and economisation of international migratory regimes in Europe and around its peripheries...|$|R
40|$|In June of {{this year}} »Migracijske teme« and the Centre for Migration and Nationalities Studies {{organized}} a round table on occasion of the Yugoslav publication of Giinter Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s latest book Ganz unten (in Croatian translation: »Na samom dnu« (At the very bottom), Zagreb, Liber, 1986). Besides participants from the host institution (Milan Mesić, Melita Švob, Sreća Perunović), researchers and experts were invited from other Yugoslav centres — Peter Klinar (Faculty of Sociology, Political Sciences and Journalism, Ljubljana), Silva Mežnarić (Emigration Institute of the Slovene Academy of Arts and Sciences, Ljubljana), Živan Tanić (Institute for Social Research, Belgrade), Đorđe Zelmanović (Vjesnik, Zagreb), Aleksa Milojević (Institute of Economics, Banja Luka), Rade Milovanović (Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, Administration for workers abroad, Belgrade), Ivo Sremac (Selfmanaging Community of Interest — Pension and Disability Insurance of the Workers of Croatia, Regional Service Zagreb). Although discussion focused on Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s book, broader problems relating {{to the position of}} migrant workers in Europe were also treated. In the Introductory part of the discussion, Milan Mesić noted that Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s method (disguise as the Turkish migrant Ali) was very similar to observation with participation, a known approach in social research, yet due to the author 2 ̆ 7 s full identification with Turkish migrant workers his method could be more adequately designated as participation with observation. Furthermore, Mesić emphasized that Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s book illustrated how capita-lism had not overcome modes of primary capital accumulation and that it continued to draw unorganized and unprotected contingents of labour force into its net of segmented markets. During the discussion other participants also noted that scenes from Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s book evoked images of ninteenth century capitalism. Peter Klinar stated that sociological research had already confirmed certain details described by Wallraff, namely that the category of clandestine seasonal migrants pre-sented a typical example of sub-proletarian status subjected to the worst forms of exploitation, that the social insecurity of migrants had increased in the present crisis, that ethnic stratification was present and, finally, that immigration societies tried to keep migrants trom forming cohesive groups. Forms of political organization virtually do not exist among migrants. Klinar argued that emigration countries, as well as countries of immigration, were responsible for this. The former fear that the political organization of their workers abroad may lead to conflicts in the host countries and subsequently to mass return. Proceeding from the concept of boundary, defined as a structural cleavage within a given community, Silva Mežnarić claimed that Wallraff in fact treated three deeply-rooted European dimensions in which boundaries were typically set up. These occur in the relations between 1) capital and labour force, 2) God and the believer, and 3) death and the object of death. Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s AM alternatively placed himself on the marginal side of these relations as a marginalized (Turkish <b>clandestine)</b> migrant <b>worker,</b> a marginalized believer (a Mo 2 ̆ 7 slem wishing to convert to Christianity) and as a marginalized worker about to die of cancer. The Church, according to Silva Mežnarić, is a paradigm in Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s book, illustrating European concepts of universalism. Hence, in the scenario of tension between Al 2 ̆ 7 i (Wallraff) and the Church, especially in his discourse with various priests, almost everything was said regarding the present policy of integration of immigrants in West Germany. Živan Tanić considered Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s book as a sociological essay or study and felt that the author had completed what sociological and other analyses could not complete. Wallraff, according to Tanić, demystified so-called charitable and humanized capitalism, whe¬reas social research has so far been less critical and less open. Tanić opened up the question of why Wallraff had chosen the image of a Turkish migrant instead of the more drastic case of African immigrants in Europe. Turkish culture is, after all, relatively fami-liar to Europeans. In this regard, Silva Mežnarić mentioned that the Turkish example could be connected to a well-known sociological lesson — that stereotypes function most fully where distance is the greatest, yet that the concrete practice of segregation functions best where a foreign culture is well known. Đorđe Zelmanović, {{on the basis of his}} personal acquaintance with Wallraff, expressed the idea that Wallraff had chosen the figure of a Turk as a »pure« culture in the bacteriological sense. In regard to Germans, Turks have a completely different cultural and confessional basis. Zelmanović felt that Wallraff had chosen them as a drastic example. Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s book, according to Aleksa Milojević, illustrates what cannot be seen from sociological research. In this sense it essentially changes our knowledge of migration. The relationship between capital and labour is presented, and in it clandestine migration is shown not as an excess but as the final essence of migration. Milojević mentioned that up till now research generally treated the fate of individuals and more seldom approached the overall system. Hence dialectic relationships have been lost in research, and this has naturally led to unsatisfactory knowledge and practical results. Rade Milovanović centred his discussion on the legal and political position of mi¬rant workers. Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s text made him think about the meaning of the concepts of unequality, discrimination and equal treatment. Western European countries already uphold the principle of equality of citizens. Discrimination generally appears in regard to certain minorities in actions deriving from national, political and economic stimuli. Yet distinguishing one 2 ̆ 7 s own from foreign citizens is not usually considered as discrimination. The State, hence, guarantees its citizens the priority of certain rights. Furthermore, equal treatment, according to Milovanović, is not only a question of employment, but it relates to the enjoyment of civil, political and cultural rights as well. Milovanović posed the question: Can migrant workers influence the bodies that decide on their rights and duties? Generally, employers are advantaged by the judicial, police and bureaucratic systems. Milovanović expressed the opinion that barriers to the realization of the principle of equal treatment were posed by the question of citizenship as a legal and political status. Proceeding from Milovanović 2 ̆ 7 s theme, Milan Mesić noted that the State as a source of legitimacy was a historical consequence. In history, sources of legitimacy for rights and duties have changed. Mesić questioned whether the interests of immigrants could be reduced to the state legitimacies of either immigration or emigration societies. Do immigrants not perhaps have new authentic interests that surpass such a concept of state legitimacy? If migrants were to form an international movement, continued Mesić, a new source of legitimacy for their civil rights would result from their own struggle. Tanić continued his earlier discussion by stating that discrimination could not be eliminated as long as migrant labour functioned as a polit-economic category, as long as it was an instrument for the functioning of the System. Towards the end of the round table discussion, Peter Klinar formulated several theses for further research. First, research should stem from a model that combines class aspects with aspects of ethnic stratification. Migration should be studied in regard to postindustrial society, within the global relations between developed countries and developing countries. Thirdly, research should treat the question of the quality of living. The problematics of civil society and movements is a further important topic. Differences between indigenous and immigrant ethnic minorities constitute yet another theme that should be treated. Klinar mentioned that more research should be carried on in examining the transformation of emigration societies into societies of immigration (this relates to Yugoslavia in the future). Certain fictions should be discarded in Yugoslav migration research, namely the term »temporary employment abroad«, the idea of mass return, the notion that migrants are part of the domestic working class, the policy of integration. Finally, institutions that function abroad (consulates, banks, schools, clubs, mass media) should be studied and the migration policies of both immigration and emigration countries should be fully evaluated. Tanić claimed that the essential message of Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s book was that research should take on new aspects, new theoretic and value-oriented approaches. Furthermore, migration cannot be studied without the inclusion of one 2 ̆ 7 s own values, since it constitutes a tragedy for a great many people. Đorđe Zelmanović maintained that Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s text presented an excellent status praesens of the migrant worker situation and that further elaboration (»therapy«) depended on other experts. According to Zelmanović, Wallraff himself has a general philanthropic solution to the matter. Somewhat different from the discussions of most of the participants at the round table were the comments of Melita Švob and Ivo Sremac. Both focused on the health situation of migrants abroad, one of the important themes in Ganz unten. Sremac noted that German health authorities, familiar with the general iconography of Turkish migrant workers, often confused Yugoslavs with Turks and would note such things as the patient 2 ̆ 7 s reek of garlic, etc. In his exposition Sremac gave some interesting cases from the medical history of Yugoslav migrants abroad. At the end of the round table discussion, Sreća Perunović noted that Wallraff 2 ̆ 7 s work described a society structured around the profit motive. It is a powerful testament of life »at the bottom« and the antagonisms between the social milieu and the immigrants cannot be reduced to the non-culture of the latter since class distinctions are primary. Nevertheless, as Sreća Perunović pointed out, the society that had produced a culture in which guest workers were subordinated and subjected to exploitation was the same society into which Wallraff himself was born and in which three million copies of his book had been sold. Being unable to attend the round table in person, Emil Heršak (Centre for Migration and Nationalities Studies) sent a written comment for inclusion in this number of »Migracijske teme«...|$|R
