2500|$|On {{the morning}} of July 13, Lee became {{frustrated}} waiting for Meade to attack him and was dismayed {{to see that the}} Federal troops were digging entrenchments of their own in front of his works. He said impatiently, [...] "That is too long for me; I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> for that. ... They have but little courage!" [...] By this time Confederate engineers had completed a new pontoon bridge over the Potomac, which had also subsided enough to be forded. Lee ordered a retreat to start after dark, with Longstreet's and Hill's corps and the artillery to use the pontoon bridge at Falling Waters and Ewell's corps to ford the river at Williamsport.|$|E

6000|$|He who {{sleeps in}} continual noise is wakened by silence, [...] And Pordenone was roused from these {{thoughts}} anon {{by the sudden}} [...] Hush that had fallen upon the garrulous group of his pupils; [...] And ere he turned half-way with instinctive looks of inquiry, [...] He was already warned, with a shock at the heart, of a presence [...] Long attended, not feared; and he laid one hand on his sword-hilt, [...] Seizing the sheath with the other hand, that the pallet had dropped [...] from. [...] Then he fronted Titian, who stood with his arms lightly folded, [...] And with a curious smile, half of sarcasm, half of compassion, [...] Bent on th' embattled painter, cried: [...] "Your slave, Messere Antonio! [...] What good friend has played this bitter jest with your humor? [...] As I beheld you just now full-armed with your pencil and palette, [...] I was half awed by your might; but these sorry trappings of bravo [...] Make me believe you less fit to be the rival of Titian, [...] Here in the peaceful calm of our well-ordered city of Venice, [...] Than to take service under some Spanish lordling at Naples, [...] Needy in blades for work that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> for the poison." ...|$|E

30|$|Although {{the above}} {{researches}} cover most {{contents of the}} transfer behavior, there is less study for the walking time prediction by pedestrian facilities. Besides transfer speed characteristics, this paper analyzes the passenger walking behavior with respect to different pedestrian facilities in subway transfer stations. In “Transfer time prediction function” section, the time prediction model of the platform, the elevator and the horizon passage is established based on transfer flow volume and walking time on different facilities. In “Parameter estimation” section, model parameters are estimated according to the learning set. In “Transfer time model validation” section, the accuracy of transfer time model is validated by testing set including four transfer stations. Calculation {{results indicate that the}} transfer time prediction model <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only reduce <b>waiting</b> time for passengers, but also improve the subway operation efficiency.|$|R
6000|$|Accordingly, on {{the first}} {{favorable}} opportunity, he addressed the empress on the subject, and cautiously made known his design. [...] "I wish to have you wholly mine," [...] said he [...] "and although the emperor is growing old, we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> safely <b>wait</b> for his death. We are, in fact, continually exposed to danger. We have gone quite too far to be safe where we are, and by taking the remaining steps necessary to accomplish fully our ends we shall only be completing what we have begun, and by so doing, far from incurring any new penalties, we shall be taking the only effectual method to protect ourselves from the dangers which impend over us and threaten us now. Let us, therefore, devise some means to remove the emperor out of our way. I will then be proclaimed emperor in his place, and be married to you. The power which you now enjoy will then {{come back to you}} again, undiminished, and under such circumstances as will render it permanently secure to you. To accomplish this will be very easy; for the emperor, superannuated, infirm, and stupid as he is, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> protect himself against any well-planned and vigorous attempt which we may make to remove him; though, if we remain as we are, and any accidental cause should arouse him from his lethargy, we may expect to find him vindictive and furious against us to the last degree." ...|$|R

5000|$|After having {{irregular}} performances {{with the}} jersey of Universitario de Deportes,with {{which he was}} champion of Decentralized Tournament 2013, the Argentinian defender signed a contract in Europe, specifically with the Greek Super League side Asteras Tripolis, starting {{to play in the}} group stage of 2014-15 UEFA Europa League. The former centre-back of Universitario de Deportes signed for Asteras Tripolis for three years."Asteras Tripolis is my big chance. I really wanted to play in Europe, especially in a club with European standards. I saw the club matches for Europa League. I saw the game against Tottenham in London.

5000|$|Before {{the premiere}} of series, Mann Mayal was listed {{as one of the}} most {{anticipated}} serials of 2016. Writing for Dawn News, Sadaf Haider moderately reviewed the series saying, [...] "Hum TV back to more family-oriented viewing. The recent fervor at Hum TV to make dramas like Sangat and Gul-e-Rana which glamourise rapists may thankfully have abated." [...] She concluded that, [...] "This is a well-made drama worth watching. Anyone who sees the first episode <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> to see the next. If Mann Mayal can steer clear of obvious clichés, it has the potential to not only be a blockbuster, or a 'must watch', but something iconic. All the ingredients are there." [...] In April issue of The Express Tribune, Mann Mayal was ranked second behind Dillagi.|$|E

5000|$|The song has {{received}} general acclaim from music critics. James Montgomery of MTV praised the video, noting: [...] "Paramore are coming home, looking back, wrapping things ... It's {{a story that}} began with the band's future in serious doubt and ends with them stronger, happier and better than ever." [...] He also stated; [...] "So if [...] "God" [...] really {{is the end of the}} BNE line, well, then it's a fitting farewell. It is time for the band to turn the page, move on." [...] His conclusion was that the video [...] "was a bit of professionalism and fun, and I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> to see where they go from here." [...] Emma Gaedeke Billboard magazine said: [...] "'Playing God' plays off the same momentum that the video for 'Ignorance' did, as Williams is seen poisoning, detaining and interrogating her male bandmates with a magnifying glass in a dark basement ... While the video is an accurate representation of the ill-harbored feelings that the band once shared, there is no doubt that Paramore has since recovered. By the end of the video, Williams has untied the guys just enough so they can still rock out together, suggesting that while she may not be forgetting the past, she's definitely forgiving." ...|$|E
