5000|$|Dedicated in {{the midst}} of the Great Depression on June 14, 1931, the church was {{designed}} by John G. Steinbach who later partnered with another local architect to form the noted firm of Worthmann and Steinbach which drew up the architectural plans for many of the Northwest Side's Polish American churches as well as parts of the campus of Loyola University Chicago. Its Gothic architecture clearly differentiates it from the Renaissance style favored by the Resurrectionist Order, representing the more populist nature of the Polish National Catholic Church. Measuring only 63 feet in width, Steinbach's design makes effective use of the site. Built in the form of a cross, its two towers are each 135 feet in height while the <b>center</b> <b>frame</b> reached a height of 54 feet. Like most other Polish Cathedrals, it was originally designed with an exterior of brick and terracotta, which was later changed to white imitation cement stone. Although more expensive than natural limestone, the material is also more durable, giving the church the appearance of Joliet Limestone that decorates such famous Chicago area landmarks such as the Chicago Water Tower or the old Statesville Prison. Set among the intricate carving above the main entrance is the emblem of the Polish National Catholic Church adopted at the Synod of Scranton in 1904 which depicts a book, above which rises the bright sun of freedom, light and warmth, surrounded to the right by the cross and to the left by the palm. Emblazoned on the streamer beneath is an inscription in Polish: Prawdą, Pracą, Walką, which translates into English as [...] "with truth, with work, with struggle", a motto by which Christian values are to be brought into life.|$|E
5000|$|The {{framework}} of the bottom consists of three strips of wood, either hemlock, spruce, or pine (the first mentioned being the most durable), {{a little longer than}} the width of the pot, about 2¾ inches wide and 1 inch thick. In the ends of each of the outer strips a hole is bored to receive the ends of a small branch of pliable wood, which is bent into a regular semicircular curve. These hoops are made of branches of spruce or hemlock, or of hardwood saplings, such as maple, birch, or ash, generally retaining the bark. Three of these similar frames, straight below and curved above, constitute the {{framework of}} each pot, one to stand at each end and one in the center. The narrow strips of wood, in general ordinary house laths of spruce or pine, which form the covering, are nailed lengthwise to them, with interspaces between about equal to the width of the lathe. On the bottom the laths are sometimes nailed on the outside and sometimes {{on the inside of the}} cross pieces. The door is formed by three or four of the laths running the entire length near the top. The door is hinged on by means of small leather strips, and is fastened by a single wooden button in the center, or by two buttons, one at each end. The openings into the pot ... are two in number, one at each end, are generally knit of coarse twine and have a mesh between three-fourths of an inch and 1 inch square. They are funnel-shaped, with one side shorter than the other, and at the larger end have the same diameter as the framework. The smaller and inner end measures about 6 inches in diameter and is held open by means of a wire ring or wooden hoop. The funnels are fastened by the larger ends to the end frames of the pot, with the shorter side uppermost, so that when they are in place they lead obliquely upward into the pot instead of horizontally. The inner ends are secured in position by one or two cords extending to the <b>center</b> <b>frame.</b> The funnels are about 11 or 12 inches deep, and therefore extend about halfway to the center of the pot. They taper rapidly and form a strongly inclined plane, up which the lobsters must climb in their search for the bait. A two-strand manila twine is most commonly used for the funnels. Cotton is also used, but is more expensive and less durable. John N. Cobb ...|$|E
