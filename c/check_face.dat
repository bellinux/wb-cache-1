40|$|Aim: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a questionnaire {{to explore the}} perceptions of nurses about {{the implementation of a}} computerised information system in clinical practice. Background: A growing interest in understanding nurses' experience of developing and implementing clinically relevant Information Technology systems and the lack of measurement tools in this area, justifies further research into the development of instruments to provide an insight into nurses' experience. Design: Survey and questionnaire development. Method: An initial draft of the questionnaire was developed based on the literature and expert opinion. The questionnaire was piloted by ten nurses to <b>check</b> <b>face</b> validity, reliability and test-retest reliability. A revised version of the questionnaire was distributed to nurses working in the in-patient area of a university hospital in Spain (n = 227). Principal components analysis with oblique rotation was carried out to test theoretically developed underlying dimensions and to test construct validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to determine internal consistency. Results: Cronbach's alpha for all the items included in the different scales was 0 center dot 88 in the pilot questionnaire and test-retest reliability was adequate. Principal components analysis of items related to mechanisms produced a three-component structure ('IT support', 'usability' and 'information characteristics').

40|$|BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab {{improves}} {{survival in}} HER 2 + breast cancer patients, with {{some evidence of}} adverse cardiac side effects. Current recommendations are to give adjuvant trastuzumab for one year or until recurrence, although trastuzumab treatment for only 9 or 10 weeks has shown similar survival rates to 12 -month treatment. We present here a multi-arm joint analysis examining the relative cost-effectiveness of different durations of adjuvant trastuzumab. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Network meta-analysis (NMA) {{was used to examine}} which trials' data to include in the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). A network using FinHer (9 weeks vs. zero) and BCIRG 006 (12 months vs. zero) trials offered the only jointly randomisable network so these trials were used in the CEA. The 3 -arm CEA compared costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with zero, 9 -week and 12 -month adjuvant trastuzumab durations in early breast cancer, using a decision tree followed by a Markov model that extrapolated the results to a lifetime time horizon. Pairwise incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were also calculated for each pair of regimens and used in budget impact analysis, and the Bucher method was used to <b>check</b> <b>face</b> validity of the findings. Addition of the PHARE trial (6 months vs. 12 months) to the network, {{in order to create a}} 4 -arm CEA including the 6 -month regimen, was not possible as late randomisation in this trial resulted in recruitment of a different patient population as evidenced by the NMA findings. The CEA results suggest that 9 weeks' trastuzumab is cost-saving and leads to more QALYs than 12 months', i. e. the former dominates the latter. The cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF) favours zero trastuzumab at willingness-to-pay levels below £ 2, 500 /QALY and treatment for 9 weeks above this threshold. The combination of the NMA and Bucher investigations suggests that the 9 -week duration is as efficacious as the 12 -month duration for distant-disease-free survival and overall survival, and safer in terms of fewer adverse cardiac events. CONCLUSIONS: Our CEA results suggest that 9 -week trastuzumab dominates 12 -month trastuzumab in cost-effectiveness terms at conventional thresholds of willingness to pay for a QALY, and the 9 -week regimen is also suggested to be as clinically effective as the 12 -month regimen according to the NMA and Bucher analyses. This finding agrees with the results of the E 2198 head-to-head study that compared 10 weeks' with 14 months' trastuzumab and found no significant difference. Appropriate trial design and reporting is critical if results are to be synthesisable with existing evidence, as selection bias can lead to recruitment of a different patient population from existing trials. Our analysis was not based on head-to-head trials' data, so the results should be viewed with caution. Short-duration trials would benefit from recruiting larger numbers of participants to reduce uncertainty in the synthesised results...|$|E

In our approach, interfaces for the components that are outside the scope of the current verification effort are specified using an interface specification language based on grammars. Specifically, an interface grammar for a component specifies the sequences of method invocations that are allowed by that component. Using interface grammars, one can specify nested call sequences that cannot be specified using interface specification formalisms that rely on finite state machines. Moreover, ou...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{extension}} of the Rebeca language {{that can be used to}} model distributed and asynchronous systems with timing constraints. We provide the formal semantics of the language using Structural Operational Semantics, and show its expressive-ness by means of examples. We developed a tool for automated translation from timed Rebeca to the Erlang language, which provides a first implementation of timed Rebeca. We can use the tool to set the parameters of timed Rebeca models, which represent the environment and component variables, and use McErlang to run multiple simulations for different settings. Timed Rebeca restricts the modeller to a pure asynchronous actor-based paradigm, where the structure of the model represents the service oriented architecture, while the computational model matches the network infrastructure. Simulation is shown to be an effective analysis support, specially where model <b>checking</b> <b>faces</b> almost immediate state explosion in an asynchronous setting. ...|$|R

A series of brass checks, numbered to correspond to the workmen's numbers, were hung on a board at the gatekeeper's lodge or outside the watchman's office, and as the men entered in the morning each one would take his own check off its hook and drop it into a box kept for that purpose at the watchman's office. The board on which the checks were hung, being arranged on a pivot, was turned around when the beginning whistle blew so that the side containing the <b>checks</b> <b>faced</b> into the office.

This issue {{is caused by}} the explosion of the number of states during system’s execution, as it may easily exceed the amount of available computing or storage resources. This thesis designs and experiments a set of methods for the development of scalable verification based on the property-driven approach. We propose efficient approaches based on model checking to verify real-time requirements expressed in large scale UML-MARTE real-time system designs. We rely on the UML and its profile MARTE as the end-user modeling language, and on the Time Petri Net (TPN) as the verification language. The main contribution of this thesis is the design and implementation of a property-driven verification prototype toolset dedicated to real-time properties verification for UML-MARTE real-time software designs. We validate this toolset using an avionic use case and its user requirements. The whole prototype toolset includes five contributions: definition of real-time property specific execution semantics for UML-MARTE architecture and behavior models; specification of real- time requirements relying on a set of verification dedicated atomic real- time property patterns; real-time property specific observer-based model checking approach in TPN; real-time property specific state space reduction approach for TPN; and fault localization approach in model checking...|$|R
