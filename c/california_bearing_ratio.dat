40|$|Abstract This study {{describes}} {{experimental results}} achieved {{on the use}} of Grand Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) and Lime in stabilising desert silty sand for possible use in geotechnical engineering applications, especially for roadways and railways constructions. The GGBFS and lime were added in percentages of 5, 10 and 15 % and 1, 3, and 5 % respectively, by dry weight of sand. Different laboratory tests such as mechanical aggregation test, hydrometer analysis, liquid-plastic limit, pH value test, compaction, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), <b>California</b> <b>bearing</b> rat io test CBR, were performed on samples to understand the engineering characteristic of soil and influences of mixtures on the silty sand soil.

2500|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of soil {{is the average}} contact stress between a foundation and the soil which will cause shear failure in the soil.

Various empirical formulas {{have been used in}} international codes relating the bearing strength of concrete to the compressive strength and the ratio of the total surface area to load bearing area (A/Ab) (known as <b>bearing</b> <b>ratio).</b> This study presents a new approach developed for the bearing strength of concrete loaded through rigid steel plate by way of analyzing the final failure pattern of concrete prism and cube specimen under axial compression considering slip planes direction, mechanical properties of normal weight concrete, relative element height and the effect of the <b>bearing</b> <b>ratio.</b> The main objective of the present paper is thus an attempt to put forward an analytical approach which conservatively predicts the bearing strength of normal weight concrete and accounts for all of the parameters mentioned above. The method depends on the final failure pattern mechanism of concrete prism and cube under axial compression load and considers the possible failure mode of diagonal shear failure, direction of shear failure planes, characteristic compressive strength of normal weight concrete, relative element height and the effect of the A/Ab ratio.

The increase indicated the volume of everything present above the surface, which is the volume of the pillars. It appeared that the bSi- 1 and bSi- 2 samples reached a constant bearing area level at approximately 500  nm, while the bSi- 3 samples reached a constant bearing area level at approximately 800  nm, highlighting the nanopillar height present on each surface.|$|R
