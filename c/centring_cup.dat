5000|$|Start {{with three}} cups nested in a stack. The cups are set {{down in a}} line with three balls visible. One of the balls is put {{on top of the}} <b>centre</b> <b>cup</b> and the other two cups nested above. With a tap of the wand, the three cups are lifted, {{revealing}} that the ball has [...] "penetrated" [...] the cup. Again the cups are set in a line, the middle cup covering the ball which has already penetrated. Another of the visible balls is placed on top of the <b>centre</b> <b>cup</b> and covered with the other two cups, the cups being tapped and lifted to show the second ball has penetrated. This is repeated with the third ball.|$|R
5000|$|An {{interior}} upgrade {{that would}} be carried over in its entirety to the subsequent BF range was the change from black to brushed silver instrument dials and dash clock, and the silver shifter surround, <b>centre</b> <b>cup</b> holder, and ICC fascia became [...] "piano black" [...] with the ICC buttons changed accordingly from black to silver. Chrome door handles, vent tips and door lock barrels were also added. The original wood grain trim was retained until the BF.|$|R

40|$|The {{submicroscopic}} {{anatomy of}} the eye in female Eupulvinaria is described. This scale insect has no compound eyes but simple pericerebral eyes composed of one pair of ocelli. The ocelli, located dorsolaterally to the brain, are of rhabdomeric type. They are situated in the subepidermal region underneath the basement membrane of the epidermis. Each ocellus consists of a cup made of a layer of numerous pigmented cells enclosing a few photoreceptive cells. The cuticular lens is facing {{the opening of the}} pigment-cup, while the optic nerve is emerging {{from the bottom of the}} cup. Pigmented cells show characteristic pigment granules. They are linked to each other by interdigitations or by desmosomes junctions. Both dendrites and cell body of the photoreceptor cell lie inside the eyecup, while the axon lies outside. The dendritic processes consist of large shaft-shaped rhabdomeres with microvilli extending perpendicular to the direction of the shaft. These microvilli are enveloped by digitiform cytoplasmic extensions of pigmented cells. These latter strands are free of pigment granules but contain microtubules orientated to the <b>centre</b> of the <b>cup.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The ageing {{population}} {{has become more}} active and live longer, these patients require hip replacement surgery at a younger age. Artificial hip implants, consisting of the acetabular cup and femoral head, affect {{the lives of many}} people, and the longevity of these implants pose significant concerns (rarely longer than 17 years). To help understand the lubricating performance of such a system, a hip joint model was built based on the Reynolds equation; the model developed simulated hydrodynamic lubrication. A steady-state angular rotation model was built whereby it was concluded that such motion would not support any load due to the anti-symmetric nature of the resultant pressure distribution (anti-symmetric about the axis of rotation). The pressure distribution from the steady-state rotation simulation contained a pressure source and sink which converged to the <b>centre</b> of the <b>cup</b> and whose pressure value increased in magnitude, as the eccentricity ratio increased. Infeasible results were obtained when the intermediary pressure constraint, allowing only positive pressure values, was implemented. The results obtained were not representative of the problem and it is recommended that this constraint not be implemented. The transient walking cycle model showed that a fluid with viscosity of 0. 0015 Pa. s is not sufficient to support a load in the walking cycle under conditions representative of hydrodynamic lubrication. Increasing the fluid viscosity promoted better results in the hydrodynamic model. Increasing the femoral head radius and decreasing the radial clearance between the components also improves the possibility of hydrodynamic lubrication. It is recommended that the model should be extended to investigate elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication. If possible, the effects of a boundary lubrication model should be investigated, as it is believed to be a major contribution to the lubrication of hip joints.

60|$|Internal Structure of the Cup.--When the cup is {{dissolved}} in acid, each shelly layer {{is represented by}} a rather tough, pale-brown membrane, itself composed of numerous fine laminæ, which, under a one-eighth of an inch object glass, exhibit generally only {{the appearance of a}} mezzotinto drawing; but there often were layers of branching vessels, (like moss-agate,) less than the 1/10,000th of an inch in diameter, and of a darkish colour; these vessels are not articulated, but otherwise resemble the same peculiar structure in the valves of the capitulum. The exterior yellow membrane is marked, or rather composed of successive narrow rims, which, in fact, are the lines of termination of the laminæ of membrane, which in a calcified state form the cup itself. In most parts, both on the borders and under the <b>centre</b> of the <b>cup,</b> but not everywhere, there are imbedded in the yellow membrane, elongated, irregular, top-shaped masses of bright yellow chitine, each furnished with a tubulus, which penetrating the calcareous laminæ leads to the corium; the little apertures thus formed, are clearly visible in the layers of membrane, left after exposure to acid. In L. Nicobarica, the innermost shelly layer of the cup was punctured, like the surface of the shell in Chthamalus and many other sessile Cirripedes, by the internal orifices of these tubuli. The top-shaped masses often have star-shaped summits; and they differ in no essential respects from those on {{the lower part of the}} peduncle, excepting that they are quite imbedded in the membrane covering the under surface of the cup, whereas those on the peduncle project freely. I found these top-shaped bodies in the outer membrane of the cups in L. dorsalis, L. cauta, and L. Rhodiopus, which alone I was enabled to dissolve in acid; and I mention this fact, as indicating the probable presence of the more important star-headed projections on the lower parts of the peduncle in these same species. The basal calcareous cup resembles, in essential structure, the valves of the capitulum; the chief difference being that in the former there is a larger proportion of animal matter or membranous layers.|$|R
