50|$|If the tip {{is moved}} across the sample in the x-y plane, the changes in surface height and density of states causes changes in current. These changes are mapped in images. This change in current with respect to {{position}} can be measured itself, or the height, z, of the tip corresponding to a constant current can be measured. These two modes are called constant height mode and <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> <b>mode,</b> respectively. In <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> <b>mode,</b> feedback electronics adjust the height by a voltage to the piezoelectric height control mechanism. This leads to a height variation and thus the image comes from the tip topography across the sample and gives a constant charge density surface; this means contrast on the image is due to variations in charge density. In constant height mode, the voltage and height are both held constant while the current changes to keep the voltage from changing; this leads to an image made of current changes over the surface, which {{can be related to}} charge density. The benefit to using a constant height mode is that it is faster, as the piezoelectric movements require more time to register the height change in <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> <b>mode</b> than the current change in constant height mode.
