50|$|The bradoon rein {{should be}} {{wider than the}} rein used on the curb bit and in sport horse {{disciplines}} is often a bit more grippy (laced or, less often, rubber reins are popular), while the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> is thinner and smooth. This {{makes it easy for}} the rider to distinguish the two by feel. The extra grip provided by the snaffle rein also helps prevent the horse from pulling it through the rider's hands, which would make the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> shorter in comparison and encourage the rider to over-use the <b>curb</b> <b>rein.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Curb</b> rein: The <b>rein</b> {{used at the}} end of {{the shank}} of a curb bit or pelham. Modern <b>curb</b> <b>reins</b> usually buckle {{together}} at the ends, though reins of the classical curb were sewn together at the ends to create a single rein.|$|R

5000|$|Curb strap or curb chain, used {{primarily}} on bridles with a curb bit, a small strap or chain, usually flat, {{that runs from}} one side of the bit to the other, and puts pressure on the chin groove when <b>curb</b> <b>reins</b> are tightened.|$|R
50|$|A pelham {{works on}} several {{parts of a}} horse's head, {{depending}} on which rein is applied. The mouthpiece acts when either the snaffle or <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> is applied and puts pressure on the bars, tongue, and lips of the horse. The curb chain and design of the mouthpiece can alter the degree of pressure placed on the horse's mouth. The roof of the mouth is affected if the bit mouthpiece of the pelham has a high port {{or if it is}} jointed. Pressure on the poll occurs when the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> is engaged, and pressure {{is directly related to the}} length of the upper shank (purchase arm) in relation to the lower shank (lever arm). All pelhams apply some pressure on the poll. Pressure is applied to the chin groove by the curb chain when the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> is used. Direct rein pressure from the snaffle rein may put some pressure on the sides of the horse's mouth, depending on the specific bit design.|$|E

50|$|Two of {{the mild}} forms {{of this type}} of hold involve the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> either under the fourth finger, or between the fourth and third finger, while holding the bradoon between the second and third fingers.|$|E
50|$|In the 3 to 1 rein hold, {{one hand}} (historically, the left hand) holds three reins {{and the other}} only one rein. The three-rein hand {{controls}} both <b>curb</b> <b>reins</b> and the bradoon rein which belongs to that side, and the other hand simply holds the other bradoon rein and the whip. It is a hold that was common to the classical dressage tradition. Today the 3 to 1 rein hold is used while training, rather than competition, although it is still seen used by the Spanish Riding School.|$|R
50|$|The curb bit places {{pressure}} on the bars, the palate (especially if the port of the curb bit is fairly large), and via the curb chain, the poll and chin groove. It is used to regulate vertical flexion (cresting the neck and collecting the body through an arched spine), and the poll pressure asks the horse to lower the poll and telescope the neck to raise {{the base of the}} neck. If the horse tries to push his nose outward without permission from the rider, the <b>curb</b> <b>reins</b> will automatically come into play and tighten, asking the horse to flex. If the horse stiffens, adding slight poll and tongue pressure with the curb can ask him to relax at the poll.|$|R
50|$|The bridoon reins are {{dropped on}} the neck near the withers, and contact is kept only with the <b>curb,</b> both <b>reins</b> being held in the left hand. This means that the rider must have good hands, a {{well-developed}} seat, and the horse must accept the bit, or else the horse will end up overbent. The rider can only create bend in the horse with the seat and legs, not the hands.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: This photo shows all {{possible}} {{elements of a}} western shanked bit, including loose cheek, [...] "slobber bar," [...] mouthpiece, <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> ring, snaffle rein slot, and curb chain that applies leverage to the chin groove.|$|E
5000|$|The curb chain applies {{pressure}} to the curb groove under a horse's chin when the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> of the bit is used. When the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> is pulled, the shank of the bit rotates back towards the chest of the horse and the cheek (upper shank) of the bit rotates forward (since it is a lever arm). The curb chain {{is attached to the}} rings {{at the end of the}} cheek, so, as the cheek moves forward, the chain is pulled and tightened in the curb groove. Once it comes in contact with the curb groove of the horse it acts as a fulcrum, causing the cannons of the bit mouthpiece to push down onto the horse's bars, thus amplifying the bit's pressure on the bars of the horse's mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Fillis {{was also}} {{accredited}} {{with a particular}} style of holding the reins of a double bridle, whereby the snaffle rein passes over the index finger and the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> under the little finger, however, he himself referred to this as the [...] "French" [...] way in his book Breaking and Riding.|$|E
60|$|One of {{them had}} the rigid {{precision}} of bearing which denotes military training: {{he was young and}} slight of build, with unruly dark hair fluttering round the temples from beneath his white sugar-loaf hat, and escaping the trammels of the neatly-tied black silk bow at the nape of the neck; he held himself very erect and rode his horse on the <b>curb,</b> the <b>reins</b> gathered tightly in one gloved hand, and that hand held closely and almost immovably against his chest.|$|R
5000|$|A pelham bit {{is a type}} of bit {{used when}} riding a horse. It has {{elements}} of both a curb bit and a snaffle bit. In this respect a pelham bit functions similar to a double bridle, and like a double bridle it normally has [...] "double" [...] reins: a set of <b>curb</b> <b>reins</b> and a set of snaffle reins. [...] Because it has a bit shank and can exert curb-style pressure on the horse, it is considered a curb bit. Like all curb bits, a pelham bit has a mouthpiece, shanks with both purchase and lever arms, a ring for rein attachment {{at the bottom of the}} shank, and a curb chain. But like a snaffle bit, a pelham bit also has a bit ring on either side of the mouthpiece. Like some curb bits, a pelham bit usually has [...] "loose" [...] shanks - hinged at the mouthpiece in the same way that the rings of a snaffle bit are hinged. When two sets of reins are used, the snaffle rein generally is wider, to help distinguish it from the curb. A [...] "cowboy pelham" [...] is a western style of loose-jawed curb bit with additional rings at the mouthpiece allowing a second set of reins to be added.|$|R
60|$|My {{favourite}} {{seat was}} a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry {{from the very}} middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original, and partly {{because she had a}} manner which set me at my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing <b>curb</b> or <b>rein</b> on anything I said. She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.|$|R
50|$|A pelham is a {{leverage}} bit, {{meaning that}} is increases the force but reduces {{the extent of}} movement applied by the rider. Unlike a snaffle bit, the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> can amplify the rein pressure several times over, depending on the geometry and length of the shank. Shank lengths are 2 in ("Tom Thumb") and longer, although most are less than 4 in.|$|E
50|$|When first {{learning}} to use the double bridle, it can be helpful to gain experience holding and manipulating two reins without actually using the more severe curb. To do so, the rider may place two reins on the snaffle. A rider may also ride on contact with the snaffle rein, keeping the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> loose until the hold becomes comfortable and familiar.|$|E
5000|$|Double reins: The {{combined}} use of {{two pairs}} of reins, a <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> and a snaffle rein. This is usually two single (buckled or sewn) reins, though sometimes split reins may be seen on western-style bridles. Double reins are used with a double bridle, with bits such as the Pelham bit and, less often, on some gag bits used for polo.|$|E
50|$|A curb bit is a {{leverage}} bit, {{meaning that}} it multiplies the pressure applied by the rider. Unlike a snaffle bit, which applies direct rein pressure from the rider's hand to the horse's mouth, the <b>curb</b> can amplify <b>rein</b> pressure several times over, depending {{on the length of}} the curb's bit shank. Shank sizes vary from the Tom Thumb (2 inches long) to more than 5 inches. The longer the bit shank, the more powerful its potential effect on the horse. For this reason, overall shank or cheek length, {{from the top of the}} cheek ring to the bottom of the rein ring, usually cannot exceed 8½ inches for most horse show disciplines.|$|R
6000|$|I sat {{out this}} [...] "lecture pieuse" [...] for some nights {{as well as}} I could, and as quietly too; only once {{breaking}} off the points of my scissors by involuntarily sticking them somewhat deep in the worm-eaten board of the table before me. But, at last, it made me so burning hot, and my temples, and my heart, and my wrist throbbed so fast, and my sleep afterwards was so broken with excitement, that I could sit no longer. Prudence recommended henceforward a swift clearance of my person from the place, the moment that guilty old book was brought out. No Mause Headrigg ever felt a stronger call to take up her testimony against Sergeant Bothwell, than I--to speak my mind in this matter of the popish [...] "lecture pieuse." [...] However, I did manage somehow to <b>curb</b> and <b>rein</b> in; and though always, as soon as Rosine came to light the lamps, I shot from the room quickly, yet also I did it quietly; seizing that vantage moment given by the little bustle before the dead silence, and vanishing whilst the boarders put their books away.|$|R
50|$|The {{double bridle}} was once used {{frequently}} by fox hunters, {{as they could}} employ the bradoon {{at the beginning of}} the hunt, and then use the curb if the horse became excessively excited and forward as the hunt continued. Additionally, it allowed women, confined to riding sidesaddle at the time, to ride hotter horses, with the option of using the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> if the horse began to pull too much.|$|E
50|$|A rider may {{increase}} {{pressure on the}} curb alone by lifting their hands forward and upward. The hands remain the same distance from the bradoon because they move around a circle that is a radius {{equal to that of}} the bradoon rein. Therefore, the action of the bradoon does not come into play. However, because the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> is several inches below the bradoon, raising the hands pull upward on the bit and engages the shank.|$|E
50|$|In both cases, {{the ends}} of the reins usually leave the fist between the thumb and index finger, as seen when riding with just a snaffle rein. However, another {{variation}} allows the end of the snaffle rein to leave {{between the first and second}} fingers, and the end of the curb to leave between the thumb and first finger. This allows the rider to easily identify each rein and adjust the tension on each. It also helps to avoid too much tension on the <b>curb</b> <b>rein.</b>|$|E
50|$|In polo, a pelham bit {{is one of}} the two bits most {{commonly}} used (the other being a gag bit). Double reins are held in one hand. Neck reining is used almost exclusively, and riders have little or no need to adjust the reins while riding. Draw reins are commonly used, on the snaffle ring. The rein lengths are adjusted so that the rein used normally is the snaffle rein, with the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> only coming into effect when needed. Such techniques are not legal in show disciplines and are exclusive to polo.|$|E
5000|$|... "2 to 2 holds" [...] {{involve the}} rider holding two reins in each hand. The two most {{commonly}} used in the United States allow for softer use of the <b>curb</b> <b>rein.</b> In one such hold, the rider holds the bradoon rein under the fourth finger (pinkie or little finger), and the curb between {{the third and fourth}} fingers. In the second method, the bradoon is held between the third (ring) and fourth finger, and the curb between the second and third fingers. The latter is in some ways preferable, because the rider continues to hold the snaffle rein between the ring finger and pinkie, {{in the same manner as}} when riding with a snaffle alone, and so will already have the feel developed for that use. Additionally, pressure from the bradoon rein pushing on the underside of the little finger can encourage riders to raise their hands, because it will feel as if there is not longer a perfectly straight line from elbow to bit. In either case, the reins cross one another, the rider should be sure that the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> crosses under the bradoon when the horse is viewed from the side, so that it is closer to the neck. Both these holds allow for the rider to flex his or her hand and apply slightly more contact to the bradoon than to the curb, allowing it to be softer.|$|E
50|$|If {{a running}} {{martingale}} is {{used with a}} double bridle, only the snaffle reins should run through the rings. Running curb reins through the martingale creates excessive amounts of leverage and can cause pain to the horse if misused. While fox hunters once were known to ride with a running martingale attached to the <b>curb</b> <b>rein,</b> today this practice is relatively non-existent, partly because the double bridle is only common in equestrian disciplines that usually do not use a running martingale. However, if a running martingale is used on the curb, however ill-advised, it is extremely important to use rein stops, as the martingale ring is sometimes larger than the ring on the curb bit shank, and can get caught on the bit with potentially disastrous consequences.|$|E
5000|$|The term shank is {{generally}} used interchangeably {{with the term}} [...] "cheek" [...] to describe the entire sidepiece of the bit, but shank also may refer just to the lever arm, {{the portion of the}} bit that extends from the mouthpiece to the rein ring. The purchase of the bit is the upper portion of the cheek that extends from the mouthpiece to the headstall rings. All shanks have a rein ring at the bottom for the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> and a cheek ring at the top to attach the headstall. Some shanks may also add rings or slots to attach a snaffle rein at the mouthpiece, allowing the bit to be used with two sets of reins, making it a pelham bit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most extreme}} {{form of this}} is called the [...] "Fillis Hold", named after James Fillis. It {{involves}} the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> being held under the pinkie, and the bradoon rein held like a driving rein, between the thumb and first finger. The two reins therefore insert into the hand as far away as they possibly could and allow each set to be used with considerable leverage. Therefore, either rein can be used without the influence of the other, simply by rotating the lower or upper part of the hand back. This hold is commonly seen used (correctly) by the dressage rider Philipe Karl. However, when used incorrectly, which can be extremely easy to do even by excellent riders, it causes the horse to flex at the third vertebra instead of the poll, a major fault.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} rein holds which {{increase}} {{the ratio of}} curb to bradoon pressure. In all these cases, the <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> is held lower down in the hand than the bradoon, so that the two reins do not cross when the horse is viewed from the side. As the distance increases between where the two reins insert into the hand, the curb reins {{becomes more and more}} prominent when rein pressure is applied. This is because the curb has greater action when {{the lower part of the}} hand is flexed back. This hold is usually used if the horse is especially hard-mouthed, easily distractible, or needs a bit more curb action because he tries to raise his head. It should only be applied by riders with exceptionally soft hands who have a good foundation in using the double bridle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{left hand}} holds the left bradoon rein below the fourth finger (pinkie), {{the left hand}} <b>curb</b> <b>rein</b> between {{the third and fourth}} fingers, and the right hand curb between the second and third fingers. It is held right over the pommel of the saddle. The right hand holds the bradoon as it would {{normally}} hold a snaffle (between the third and fourth fingers), and the hand is held very close to the left hand. This hold has several important consequences: it decreases the action of the curb, it prevents the rider from riding with their hands too wide or performing an overzealous opening rein with their left hand, and it shows when the horse is not properly straight, because the rider can no longer make the rein pressure {{on one side of the}} mouth any stronger than the other, since reins from both sides are held in the left hand. The rider must ride off the seat and legs to bend the horse, and the horse must therefore be properly [...] "through".|$|E
5000|$|In modern dressage, most riders {{employing}} the double bridle [...] "ride on the bradoon." [...] In other words, they keep a steady {{contact with the}} bradoon bit and only engage the curb bit to when necessary to encourage the horse to collect. As a result, the bradoon rein keeps slightly more pressure, and the <b>curb</b> <b>rein,</b> although in contact, is much softer. In competition, total loss of rein contact of the curb (which {{will result in the}} rein being bowed) will cause a severe deduction from the rider's score. To ride mainly from the bradoon while still keeping a soft contact on the curb, the rider must have steady, soft hands and a correct hand position. To activate the bradoon separately from the curb, if the rider is using the most common rein holds (described below), the rider simply rotates the lower fingers into the hand and slightly upward, which will tighten pressure on the bradoon. The upper part of the hand, where the curb is held, remains in the same point in space and acts as a pivot, so that the pressure on the curb does not change.|$|E
