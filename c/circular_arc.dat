5|$|Similar {{applications}} of 2-satisfiability {{have been made}} for other geometric placement problems. In graph drawing, if the vertex locations are fixed and each edge must be drawn as a <b>circular</b> <b>arc</b> with one of two possible locations (for instance as an arc diagram), then the problem of choosing which arc to use for each edge {{in order to avoid}} crossings is a 2-satisfiability problem with a variable for each edge and a constraint for each pair of placements that would lead to a crossing. However, in this case it is possible to speed up the solution, compared to an algorithm that builds and then searches an explicit representation of the implication graph, by searching the graph implicitly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the problem}} of digital <b>circular</b> <b>arcs</b> {{recognition}} is investigated in a new way. The main contribution is a simple and linear-time algorithm for solving three subproblems: online recognition of digital <b>circular</b> <b>arcs</b> coming from the digitization of a disk having either a given radius, a boundary that is incident with a given point, or a center that is on a given straight line. Solving these subproblems is interesting in itself, {{but also for the}} recognition of digital <b>circular</b> <b>arcs.</b> Indeed the proposed algorithm can be iteratively used for the recognition of <b>circular</b> <b>arcs.</b> Moreover, since the algorithm is online, it provides a way for segmenting digital curves. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} measure an angle θ, a <b>circular</b> <b>arc</b> {{centered}} at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. {{with a pair}} of compasses. The ratio of the length s of the arc by the radius r of the circle is the measure of the angle in radians.|$|E

It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents.

40|$|The task of {{approximation}} of points with <b>circular</b> <b>arcs</b> is performed in many applications, such as polyline compression, noise filtering, and feature recognition. However, development of algorithms that perform {{a significant amount}} of <b>circular</b> <b>arcs</b> fitting require an efficient way of fitting <b>circular</b> <b>arcs</b> with complexity O(1). The elegant solution to this task based on an eigenvector problem for a square nonsymmetrical matrix is described in [1]. For the compression algorithm described in [2], it is necessary to solve this task when two points on the arc are known.

25|$|Bolo punch : Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which {{owes its}} power to the {{shortening}} of a <b>circular</b> <b>arc</b> rather than to transference of body weight; it tends {{to have more of}} an effect due to the surprise of the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power of the punch. This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the Ali shuffle. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former welterweight champions Sugar Ray Leonard, and Kid Gavilan. Middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.|$|E

By geometrical methods which were an early use of calculus, he showed it to be a cycloid, rather than the <b>circular</b> <b>arc</b> of a pendulum's bob, and therefore that pendulums are not isochronous. He also solved a problem posed by Mersenne: how to calculate the period of a pendulum made of an arbitrarily shaped swinging rigid body. This involved discovering the center of oscillation and its reciprocal relationship with the pivot point. In the same work, he analysed the conical pendulum, consisting of a weight on a cord moving in a circle, using the concept of centrifugal force.|$|E
