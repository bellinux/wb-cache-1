40|$|Abstract. —Since {{the first}} Indochinese war, natural populations of Leiolepis guttata have been hunted for their meat in southeastern Vietnam as a {{subsistence}} meal; nowadays, {{it has become}} a luxury deli-cacy. Commercial farms have become established since 2004 because of wild population declines and increasing demand for meat. We interviewed farmers and restaurateurs about the breeding and trade of the species to better understand the impact on wild populations. The results highlight the recent flourishing expansion of farming with rapidly increasing product prices and number of farms, as well as the ease and profitability of this activity. Wild population declines are widely acknowledged by au-thorities and local communities. Farms are being regarded as <b>conservation</b> <b>pools</b> to offset wild stock depletion, in addition to an important source of income. We discuss the risks associated with this trade development and we emphasize the conservation implications. Demand for lizards as founders for farms and for meat are likely to increase further, but risks exist that the development of new farms would saturate the market causing prices to ultimately fall. Habitat destruction and over-collecting severely reduce wild populations, but the high densities of farmed lizards raise serious genetic and sanitary issues. We suggest that further information should be collected to assess the sustainability of this trade. Priority should be given to the assessment of natural population densities and huntin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{stoichiometric}} matrix, S, {{represents a}} mapping of reaction rate vectors {{into a space}} of concentration time derivatives. The left null space of the stoichiometric matrix contains the dynamic invariants: a combination of concentration variables, referred to as metabolic pools, whose total concentration does not change over time. By analogy to the traditional reaction map formed by S, a compound map {{can be derived from}} −ST. The analogy to flux analysis of the (right) null space of S enables us to classify the metabolic pools into three categories: Type A that contains chemical elements and their combinations in the form of certain moieties, Type B that contains such moieties in addition to cofactors carrying such moieties that are internal to the network, and Type C that contains only the cofactors. A convex formulation of the basis for the left null space allows us to directly classify the metabolic pools into these three categories. Type B metabolic <b>pools</b> include <b>conservation</b> <b>pools</b> that form conjugates of moiety-occupied and moiety-vacant concentration states of metabolites and cofactors. Type B metabolic pools thus describe the various states of moiety exchange between the primary substrates and the cofactors that capture properties like energy and redox potential. The convex basis gives clear insight into this exchange for glycolytic pathway in human red blood cell, including the identification of high and low energy pools that form conjugates. Examples suggest that pool maps may be more appropriate for signaling pathways than flux maps. The analysis of the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix allows us to define the achievable states of the cell and their physiological relevance...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal forest {{pools in}} the northeastern USA are unique {{ecosystems}} whose functions are intimately associated with adjacent upland habitats. This connection, coupled with their small size and ephemeral surface water, has made <b>conservation</b> of <b>pool</b> resources challenging. Seasonal pools provide optimal breeding habitat for animals adapted to temporary waters including ambystomatid salamanders (Ambystoma spp.), wood frogs (Rana sylvatica LeConte), and some invertebrates and plants. To date, wetland conservation efforts have been primarily limited to 2 pathways: land use regulation and pres-ervation. Although both of these pathways {{have the potential to}} conserve some pool resources, they are often insufficient to maintain an array of pools in the landscape that support local population dynamics of amphibians. We propose a third pathway – local land-use planning – that can complement regulatory and preservation efforts. This suite of strategies, embodied in our Best Development Practices (BDPs), recognizes that not all pools will be conserved; local governances will need to develop priorities for conservation. The BDPs encourage local governances to (1) proactively identify their pool resources, (2) rank those pools according to their relative ecological value, and (3) establish management procedures and apply recommended guidelines in accordance with the relative rankings. We recommend that pool...|$|R
40|$|Mire pools - {{permanently}} water-filled depressions on peatlands - {{provide important}} habitats for myriad organisms. Recently, water balance change and eutrophication resulting from agricultural development are increasingly evident in mire pools of alluvial lowlands. <b>Conservation</b> of mire <b>pool</b> hydrochemistry is necessary. We investigated the hydrological and chemical budgets of a pristine mire pool, Akanuma Pool (95, 280 m 2 area; 1. 8 m mean depth), located in Kushiro Mire in Hokkaido, northern Japan, during its ice-free period (April-November) in 2007 - 2008. Thereby we elucidated the hydrochemical characteristics of mire pools formed on alluvial lowlands. Surface water inflow and surface water outflow dominated the hydrological budget, respectively representing 18. 3 and 20. 2 mm day^[- 1]. Groundwater seepage through the pool bottom and surface water inflow mainly supplied the lake water with total nitrogen and Ca 2 +. Total phosphorus was supplied mostly by groundwater seepage through the bottom. These chemical constituents were run {{off from the}} pool mostly by surface water outflow. The input and output fluxes of water were 16 - 20 times greater than those of North American mire pools because of Hokkaido's higher values of precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-ET). Moreover, the Ca 2 + input into the Akanuma Pool was several times greater than those reported from North American studies. Alluvial mineral soil under the peat layer supplied large amounts of nutrients and mineral ions including Ca 2 +. These results demonstrate that Hokkaido mire pools' hydrochemical characteristics differ greatly from those of pools in North America. Furthermore, each hydrological budget component maintained a constant fraction throughout the two year study period, although the absolute flow rate varied concomitantly with the precipitation level. Maintaining this budget stability {{is important for the}} <b>conservation</b> of mire <b>pool</b> hydrochemistry...|$|R
