Deciding slice between sector and room structure according to affinity <b>axis</b> <b>line</b> {{is one of the}} way to decide slice by using algebra approach.

The research aimed to find how to decide broad slice between sector and room structure according to its affinity <b>axis</b> <b>line</b> equation. Deciding slice broad between sector and room structure could be found by using triangle broad, when the slice structure shaped was a other structure beside triangle, the broad could be found by dividing the slice structure into several triangle. Steps in deciding slice broad and room structure according to affinity <b>axis</b> <b>line</b> were: (1) each points of room structure corner decided in room coordinate, then decided the affinity <b>axis</b> <b>line</b> equation; (2) deciding points coordinate divided line with certain composition; (3) deciding room equation through three points; (4) deciding line equation through two points; (5) deciding slicing point coordinate between line and sector; (6) deciding slice broad using triangle broad...|$|R

40|$|SummaryUsing our “echo-dynamography”, {{blood flow}} {{structure}} and flow dynamics during ventricular systole were investigated in 10 normal volunteers. The velocity vector distribution demonstrated blood flow during ejection was laminar along the ventricular septum. The characteristic flow structure {{was observed in}} each cardiac phases, early, mid- and late systole and was generated depending on the wall dynamic events such as peristaltic squeezing, hinge-like movement of the mitral ring plane, bellows action of the ventricle and dimensional changes in the funnel shape of the basal part of the ventricle, which were disclosed macroscopically by using the new technology of high speed scanning echo-tomography and microscopically by the strain rate distribution measured by phase tracking method. The pump function was reflected on {{the changes in the}} flow structure represented by the flow <b>axis</b> <b>line</b> distribution and the acceleration along the flow <b>axis</b> <b>line.</b> The acceleration of the ejection had three modes, “A”, “B” and “C”, and generated by the wall dynamic events. “A” appeared from the apical to the outflow area along the main flow <b>axis</b> <b>line,</b> “B” along the anterior mitral leaflet and the branched flow <b>axis</b> <b>line,</b> and “C” generated by the high speed vortex behind the mitral valve. The magnitude of the acceleration was estimated quantitatively from the velocity gradient along the flow <b>axis</b> <b>line.</b> Macroscopic and microscopic asynchrony in the myocardial contraction and extension appeared systematically in the local part of the ventricular wall, which was helpful for making the flow structure and for performing the smooth pump function...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of Laser cladding technology is nowadays widely extended {{in the industrial}} environment due to its advantages for high added value parts manufacturing and repairing. At the moment, the process is applied to 3 axis or 3 + 2 axis strategies, being numerous works focused on the obtainment of process parameters. The industrial development imposes the use of five <b>continuous</b> <b>axis</b> kinematics to perform complex parts that require new tuning methodology processes {{for this type of}} machines. The presented work develops a method for the study of 5 <b>continuous</b> <b>axis</b> laser cladding optimal parameters. Firstly, the design of the part for the experimental tests is carried out, taking into account the movements of the machine kinematics. Afterwards, both, the process control parameters and the tool path strategies are studied. Besides, the optimization methodology of process conditions is also presented. The work explains the steps to be followed for the tuning process before its industrial application...|$|R

40|$|Existing 3 -dimensional {{acoustic}} {{target tracking}} methods that use wired/wireless networked sensor nodes to track targets based on four sensing coverage {{do not always}} compute the feasible spatio-temporal information of target objects. To investigate this discrepancy in a formal setting, we propose a geometric model of the target tracking problem alongside its equivalent geometric dual model that is easier to solve. We then study and prove some properties of dual model by exploiting its relationship with algebra. Based on these properties, we propose a four coverage <b>axis</b> <b>line</b> method based on four sensing coverage and prove that four sensing coverage always yields two dual correct answers; usually {{one of them is}} infeasible. By showing that the feasible answer can be only sometimes identified by using a simple time test method such as the one proposed by ourselves, we prove that four sensing coverage fails to always yield the feasible spatiotemporal information of a target object. We further prove that five sensing coverage always gives the feasible position of a target object under certain conditions that are discussed in this paper. We propose three extensions to four coverage <b>axis</b> <b>line</b> method, namely, five coverage extent point method, five coverage extended <b>axis</b> <b>lines</b> method, and five coverage redundant <b>axis</b> <b>lines</b> method. Computation and time complexities of all four proposed methods are equal in the worst cases as well as on average being equal to Θ(1) each. Proposed methods and proved facts about capabilities of sensing coverage degree in this paper can be used in all other methods of acoustic target tracking like Bayesian filtering methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Under the {{condition}} of high dynamic, there is a “pixel shift ” phenomenon which is called smear in the star image sampled by star sensor. The recovery algorithm of star energy distributing for star sensor {{is presented in the}} paper. The quaternion of next frame is calculated with the previous continuous quaternion. All the ideal star coordinates of star image in the FOV is calculated with the quaternion of next frame. Then the angle between the two previous <b>continuous</b> <b>axis</b> directions is calculated with the previous <b>continuous</b> <b>axis</b> directions calculated with the previous continuous quaternion. The radius of threshold scan window of star image is calculated according to the angle. Finally, within the star image radius of the threshold scan window, shift the original star image to make the shifted star energy distribution continuous. So the star image distribution subjects to 2 -D Gaussian distribution, and the star coordinates is obtain with centroiding algorithm. A star sensor featuring a recovery algorithm of star energy distributing for star sensors proposed in this paper was for demonstration at night sky experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{rotary machine}} with multi-supporting, such as rotary kiln and rope laying machine, {{is the key}} equipment in the architectural, chemistry, and agriculture industries. The body, rollers, wheels, and bearings constitute a chain multibody system. <b>Axis</b> <b>line</b> deflection is a vital parameter to determine mechanics state of rotary machine, thus body axial vibration needs to be studied for dynamic monitoring and adjusting of rotary machine. By using the Riccati transfer matrix method, the body system of rotary machine is divided into many subsystems composed of three elements, namely, rigid disk, elastic shaft, and linear spring. Multiple wheel-bearing structures are simplified as springs. The transfer matrices of the body system and overall transfer equation are developed, {{as well as the}} response overall motion equation. Taken a rotary kiln as an instance, natural frequencies, modal shape, and response vibration with certain exciting <b>axis</b> <b>line</b> deflection are obtained by numerical computing. The body vibration modal curves illustrate the cause of dynamical errors in the common <b>axis</b> <b>line</b> measurement methods. The displacement response can be used for further measurement dynamical error analysis and compensation. The response overall motion equation could be applied to predict the body motion under abnormal mechanics condition, and provide theory guidance for machine failure diagnosis...|$|R
