UV <b>contact</b> <b>mask</b> lithography was used to directly pattern metallic nanocrystals on glass and polyimide surfaces without vacuum or etching processes {{or the use of}} photoresist layers. Direct electron beam lithography of nanocrystalline metals was used to pattern multiple layer, multiple material, structures with minimum feature sizes of 100 nm.

40|$|Two {{methods were}} {{examined}} for the fabrication of dielectric mirror masks. In the first method, a commercial laser mirror was patterned with photoresist and the dielectric film etched with ammonium bifluoride. The ammonium bifluoride etch showed strong kinetic anisotropy with the fastest etch {{rate in the}} vertical direction. However, horizontal etching still resulted in significant undercutting of the photomask. In the second method, a photoresist coated laser mirror was etched with an argon plasma. The argon plasma caused significant damage to the photoresist and underlying dielectric layer without adequate removal of the dielectric film in the open areas of the mask. Neither of the two methods examined were able to produce usable dielectric masks. During {{the course of this}} project, it was discovered that a foreign company, Balzers AG of Liechtenstein, had recently developed successful fabrication procedures for dielectric mirror masks. A mask purchased from Balzers for testing showed distinguishable pattern features down to 2 {mu}m in size. This mask was used in ablative projection etching experiments to form microstructures in Mylar polymer films. A thin film resistor pattern with 7. 0 {mu}m wide lines was etched 5. 4 {mu}m deep into a Mylar substrate. The etch pattern showed uniform linewidths but exhibited some thinning of the lines in areas where U-turns occurred.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Distributed feedback, DFB, lasers are a major source for long haul optical fibre based telecommunication systems. They rely on ultrahigh precision gratings to reduce mode competition within the laser cavity, thereby making single frequency operation possible. Techniques applied to DFB grating manufacture tend to be either holographic, or a direct serial write process using slow and expensive electron beam lithographic machines. An entirely new approach is proposed which compliments {{the accuracy of the}} electron beam systems with the high throughput and relatively low cost of a conventional <b>contact</b> <b>mask</b> regime. The new process relies on a group of materials which are able to retain an embossed relief upon curing with ultraviolet radiation. The main manufacturing stages of this new technique are presented including details of the embossing tool fabrication using reactive ion etching, and characterisation of material properties. It is proposed that the technique, whilst intended for DFB manufacture, could find applications in many other areas, for instance as a route to low cost replication of photomasks. In addition a new grating assessment technique, based on normal reflectance measurements, has been developed. The technique has been used to investigate hitherto unmeasured effects in electron beam lithography on a variety of substrate materials before and after semiconductor overgrowth. Details of a theoretical exercise which agrees closely with experimental results are included. The technique is non-destructive and should be of interest to all areas of microlithography and holographic imaging where {{it is important to have}} control over a wide range of process stages or where the feature size rules out the use of conventional optical microscopes...|$|E
30|$|CIGS-based {{photovoltaic}} devices were fabricated with {{the structure of}} soda-lime glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/AZO/Al contact. The p-type CIGS films were deposited by the process described previously [14], employing one-stage deposition cycle and a final heat treatment at 550 °C. The cell is completed by a chemical bath deposited CdS buffer layer and a RF-sputtered ZnO/AZO transparent front contact (window layer). Finally, a grid of Al used as a top contact was deposited by sputtering with a <b>contact</b> <b>mask.</b> In order to fabricate the antireflection coating on the top surface of the non-selenized CIGS solar device, ZnO nanostructures were grown by the hydrothermal method. The reaction chemicals were prepared by mixing zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO 3) 2 [*]·[*] 6 H 2 O) and hexamethylene tetramine (C 6 H 12 N 4, HMT) in aqueous solution. After the solution was stirred for 10  min, bare non-selenized CIGS solar cells were immersed vertically in this solution, and the sealed reaction bottle was heated up to 90 °C. The pH value of the chemical solution was adjusted to the desired value from 6.5 to 8 by using 1, 3 -diaminopropane (DAP, Acros) solution [15]. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images were taken using a JEOL JSM- 7401  F instrument (Tokyo, Japan). In order to obtain cross-sectional images, samples were broken mechanically. The surface and cross-sectional microstructures of the films were investigated by FESEM operating at 10  kV. The crystalline structure of the ZnO films was observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with an automated Bruker D 8 advance X-ray diffractometer (Madison, WI, USA) with CuKα radiation (40  kV and 30  mA) for 2 θ values of over 20 ° to 60 °. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) with standardless calibration, using an accelerating voltage of 10  kV, and a dead time of approximately 20 %, was performed to determine the composition of deposited ZnO nanorods. Optical transmittance and reflectance were measured at normal incidence in the wavelength range of 400 to 1, 200  nm with a Cary 500 UV-visible-near infrared spectrophotometer equipped with an integrated sphere. The current-voltage characteristics of solar cells were measured by a Keitheley 4200 semiconductor analyzer under the irradiation of simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with the power density of 100  mW/cm 2 at 25 °C using a temperature controller.|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} powder {{blasting}} as {{a technique to}} structure brittle materials like glass using an erosion resistant mask. The study of the erosion rate shows that the erosion of glass is maximum at a normal incidence of the powder beam while the erosion rate of metals and elastomers is minimum. A metallic <b>contact</b> <b>mask</b> is very resistant, easy to use, but its resolution as defined by its manufacturing process (laser ablation) is limited. The resolution of the mask depends on {{the thickness of the}} metal piece. However due to the stress generated by the powder blasting technnique, the metal mask used must have an important thickness (about 0, 5 mm), which limits the resolution (50 μm). The photolithographic masking method we developed allows to increase the resolution. We have demonstrated that the erosion resistance of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), an elastomer very frequently used in microsystems realisation is excellent, and that the use of a photosensitve epoxy resist like SU 8 allows to define high-resolution structures. The replication quality is good as the majority of structures defined in PDMS have the same size compared to the features defined by the SU 8. In our process, the SU 8 is patterned into a mould structure that is filled with PDMS. The SU 8, has a similar erosion behavior as glass and is quickly removed by powder blasting. The resolution of the process determined by the particle size; we have used particles with 10 μm diameter to explore the ultimate limits of powder blasting. The study of the etching by powder blasting shows that the etching rate changes with the width of the channel and the etching time. Furthermore, dimensions of channels or hole structures change during powder blasting, they are increased by the underetching effect. This underetching depends on the depth of the channels and can induce changes in resolution. The erosion mask resistance is function of the thickness of the mask, of the etching time and of the applied pressure. We typically have chosen a PDMS mask thickness of 50 μm. When the applied pressure of the powder jet increases, the PDMS erosion is more important. When an energetic particle impacts on the PDMS, the glass underneath the mask can be damaged and the resolution of the structures is decreased. Experimentally, this PDMS/SU 8 mask is resistant and efficient for an applied pressure up to 200 kPa and for a glass erosion depth of 300 μm for large channels. The minimum feature size is 20 μm, but this depends also on the shape; for example triangular holes are only well defined for a minimum dimension of 60 μm...|$|E
