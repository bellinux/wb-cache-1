40|$|Given the {{spectral}} mechanism of color constancy (Part I of this series), the remaining nonspectral mechanism is formulated here in Part II by the constraint of correlation with known spectral illuminant–invariant functions, i. e., invariant wavelength ratios between constant hues, which plot straight parallel {{lines in the}} plane of wavelength and reciprocal illuminant color temperature (MK 21). The same is assumed to apply to nonspectral constant hues in the same plane and dominant wavelength scale extended to cover the nonspectrals (see accompanying article ‘‘Relative wavelength metric for the complete hue cycle [...] . ’’). To simplify analysis, stimuli are optimal aperture colors; their monochromatic stimuli lie between 442 and 613 nm, common boundaries with optimal compound stimuli (nonspectrals). It is shown that the wavelengths and invariant ratios of spectral constant hues can be formulated exactly (60. 5 %) from the ratios of an harmonic period, which shifts wavelength with MK 21. The formula implies this color-constant hue cycle is isomorphic across illuminants and allows prediction of nonspectral constant hues. To identify these colorimetrically, their spectral <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are specified for various illuminants. This completes the global color constancy mechanism for the illuminant color temperature range 2800 to 25, 000 K. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Organic small {{molecule}} (SM) acceptors {{containing a}} perylene diimide (PDI) moiety, F 2 B-T 2 PDI and T 2 PDI are synthesized, {{and the effects}} of their molecular geometry on the performance of fullerene-free organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are investigated. The SM acceptors possess a PDI-core-PDI structure in which the PDI wing is connected to conjugated core units. By incorporation of a 2, 5 -difluorobenzene (F 2 B) moiety within the core unit, the planarity of the conjugated core is enhanced and the energy levels of the SM acceptor are down-shifted. In terms of molecular geometry, the F 2 B-containing SM acceptor, F 2 B-T 2 PDI, has a rigid core, which can symmetrically align the two PDI wings and enhance molecular packing. As a result, improved electron transport and bulk heterojunction morphology of the active layers are achieved. Furthermore, the incorporation of the F 2 B moiety effectively down-shifts the HOMO energy level, preventing back-transfer of holes from the acceptor to the cathode and enhancing the absorption of <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of the donor polymer, PTB 7 -Th. Leveraged by the beneficial geometric and energetic effects from the incorporation of F 2 B units, the power conversion efficiency of fullerene-free OPV devices using F 2 B-T 2 PDI reached 5 %, whereas that using T 2 PDI was 3. 63 %. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistryclos...|$|R

The wavelength at which the line intersects the spectrum locus is identified as the color's dominant wavelength if the point is {{on the same side}} of the white point as the spectral locus, and as the color's <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelength</b> if the point is on the opposite side.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that since}} purples (mixtures {{of red and}} blue/violet) cannot be pure {{spectral}} colors, no color mixture perceived as purple in hue can be assigned a proper dominant wavelength. However, purple mixtures can be assigned a dominant hue as coordinates {{along the line of}} purples. See CIE for the standard representation of color space, where the border is composed of a horseshoe curve representing the pure spectral colors, with a straight line completing the perimeter along the bottom and representing the mixtures of extreme red and blue/violet that give the pure purples. The same argument applies to complementary colors; for many coordinates in the green area of CIE color space, no <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelength</b> exists, but there is a complementary pure purple.|$|E

40|$|On May 13, 1998 the EIT (Extreme {{ultraviolet}} Imaging Telescope) {{on board}} of SoHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) and TRACE (Transition Region And Coronal Explorer) instruments produced simultaneous high cadence image sequences {{of the same}} active region (AR 8218). TRACE achieved a 25 s cadence in the Fe IX (171 Angstrom) bandpass while EIT achieved a 15 s cadence (operating in "shutterless mode", SoHO JOP 80) in the Fe XII (195 Angstrom) bandpass. These high cadence observations in two <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelengths</b> have revealed the existence of weak transient disturbances in an extended coronal loop system. These propagating disturbances (PDs) {{seem to be a}} common phenomenon {{in this part of the}} active region. The disturbances originate from small scale brightenings at the footpoints of the loops and propagate along the loops. The projected propagation speeds roughly vary between 65 and 150 km s(- 1) for both instruments which is close to and below the expected sound speed in the coronal loops. The measured slow magnetoacoustic propagation speeds seem to suggest that the transients are sound (or slow) wave disturbances. This work differs from previous studies in the sense that it is based on a multi-wavelength observation of an entire loop bundle at high cadence by two EUV imagers. The observation of sound waves along the same path shows that they propagate along the same loop, suggesting that loops contain sharp temperature gradients and consist of either concentric shells or thin loop threads, at different temperatures. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study forests {{at the global}} scale, a {{detailed}} link budget for a lidar system onboard satellite is presented. It {{is based on an}} original approach coupling airborne lidar observations and an end-to-end simulator. The simulator is initialized by airborne lidar measurements performed over temperate and tropical forests on the French territory, representing a wide range of forests ecosystems. Considering two <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of 355 and 1064 nm, the end-to-end simulator computes the performance of spaceborne lidar systems for different orbits. The analysis is based on forest structural (tree top height, quadratic mean canopy height) and optical (forest optical thickness) parameters. Although an ultraviolet lidar appears to be a good candidate for airborne measurements, our results show that the limited energy is not favorable for spaceborne missions with such a wavelength. A near infrared wavelength at 1064  nm is preferable, requiring ~ 100 mJ laser emitted energy, which is in agreement with current and future spaceborne missions involving a lidar. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio at the ground level to extract both the structural and optical parameters of forests must be larger than 10. Hence, considering the presence of clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere and assuming a stationary forest, a good detection probability of 99 % can be reached when 4 or 5 satellite revisits are considered for a lidar system onboard the ISS or ICESat, respectively.

Using <b>complementary</b> multi <b>wavelength</b> data from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared, we use SED fitting to determine the AGN and host properties at $z< 1 $, and compare to a well-matched control sample. We confirm the trend previously observed that the variability amplitude decreases with AGN luminosity, {{but on the other}} hand, we observe that the slope of this relation steepens with wavelength resulting in a "redder when brighter" trend at low luminosities. Our results show that AGN are hosted by more massive hosts than control sample galaxies, while the restframe, dust-corrected $NUV-r$ color distribution of AGN hosts is similar to control galaxies. We find a positive correlation between the AGN luminosity and star formation rate (SFR), independent of redshift. AGN hosts populate the whole range of SFRs within and outside the Main Sequence of star forming galaxies. Comparing the distribution of AGN hosts and control galaxies, we show that AGN hosts {{are less likely to be}} hosted by quiescent galaxies, but more likely to be hosted by Main Sequence or starburst galaxies.

40|$|In recent research, it {{has been}} {{increasingly}} necessary to employ an extended wavelength metric to cover the complete hue cycle so as to research or represent data {{as a function of}} relative wavelength rather than psychological scales such as CIELAB or Munsell hue angle. This article describes such a relative wavelength metric and its derivation from <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelength</b> functions. The metric provides a useful psychophysical, wavelength-based, ratio scale for the hue cycle allowing nonspectrals to be treated in the same coherent scale as spectral hues. Several indicators, e. g., color order hue cycles, infer the (optimally efficient) spectral hues comprise about 71 % and the nonspectrals about 29 %, of the hue cycle interval. This gives a hue cycle whose relative wavelength interval is about 240 nm for illuminant D 65. To relate to CIE colorimetry, spectral complementary wavelengths to the nonspectrals’ relative wavelengths are identified for seven illuminants including D 65, D 50, C, and A.

40|$|The {{wavelengths}} of several constant hues over four illuminants (D 95, D 65, D 50, A) {{are derived from}} several sets of published data. In the plane of wavelength and reciprocal illuminant color temperature (MK 21), the {{wavelengths of}} constant hues plot straight approximately parallel lines whose mean slope is about 878. Parallel lines give invariant wavelength ratios, hence constant hues in this plane are near-invariant wavelength ratios across illuminants. As recently demonstrated, the complementary wavelengths to a constant hue (across illuminants) represent the complementary constant hue; these complementary wavelengths also plot a near-parallel line to the first constant hue. To confirm and further define the constant slope of these lines, it is shown that <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelength</b> pairs, per CIE data, can only plot parallel straight lines at the angle of 878 6 1.

We find that the FIR spectral energy distribution is best represented by a continuum that is the sum of three greybody curves from dust at temperatures of 90, 44. 5, and 23 K. We obtain temperature and molecular hydrogen column density maps of the region. We estimate the mass of the inner part of the CND to be 5. 0 x 10 e+ 4 Msum, with luminosities: Lcavity 2. 2 x 10 e+ 6 Lsun and Lcnd 1. 5 x 10 e+ 6 Lsun in the central 2 pc radius around SgrA*. We find from the Herschel and ISO data that the cold component of the dust dominates the total dust mass, with a contribution of 3. 2 x 10 E+ 4 Msun; this important cold material had escaped the notice of earlier studies that relied on shorter wavelength observations. The hotter component disagrees with some earlier estimates, but is consistent with measured gas temperatures and with models that imply shock heating or turbulent effects are at work.

Under coloration, the mixed-valence iron(III) hexacyanoruthenate(II) chromophore is formed on oxidation of iron(II) hexacyanoruthenate(II), with simultaneous reduction of the methyl viologen dication to form a mixture of the radical cation monomer/dimer. Using the CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) system of colorimetry, the color stimulus of such ECDs and the changes that take place on reversibly switching between the colored and colorless states have been calculated from in situ visible spectra recorded under electrochemical control. On ECD color switching, with the excellent color-matching between the two purple states, sharp and reversible changes in the hue and saturation occur, as shown by the minimal hysteresis of the track of the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates. Extrapolation of the xy track to the color locus gave a <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelength</b> (λc) of 565 (± 5) nm in close agreement with values obtained for the individual electrochromic materials. The concentration of the solution-phase methyl viologen and its diffusion to the cathode controlled both the proportion of surface-confined Ruthenium purple (RP) that is switched to the intense purple form and the overall ECD changes.

40|$|Complementary colours {{have been}} {{researched}} for 340 years but {{little is known}} of their role in colour vision. Complementary colours are defined {{as a pair of}} colour stimuli which admix a given white (i. e. cancel all hue). This chapter aims to describe recent research of the roles of complementary colours in colour vision. Presently, only one role for complementary colours is accepted in the scientific literature: a colorimetric role in colour mixture. A second role, in chromatic induction, was generally accepted until (erroneously) usurped 50 years ago by the opponent colours theory of chromatic induction. The visual system develops many functions from complementary colours (whose physiological basis is color-opponent cells in retina and cortex.) For a start, two of the cones (S and L, peaks about 445 and 568 nm) are complementary. The third cone (M, peak about 530 nm) complements the nonspectral hues. This chapter shows complementarism structures ten visual functions. First, complementary colours are shown to form hue cycle structure. Second, a relative wavelength scale is derived from dominant and complementary wavelengths, extended into nonspectral hues to form an overarching wavelength-based metric over the;whole hue cycle. Third, complementary wavelengths are shown to structure a colour constancy mechanism where constant hues and complementary constant hues form, remarkably, parallel straight lines (related by invariant wavelength ratios) in the plane of wavelength and reciprocal ilIuminant colour temperature. The relative wavelength scale is used to extend this grid-like mechanism into the nonspectrals. A key paper establishes a further seven roles, six by formulating math models for wavelength discrimination, u. mform hue, spectral sensitivity, saturation, chromatic adaptation, chromatic induction, from tbe ratio of either <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelength</b> intervals or complementary radiant powers. Complementary colours' II varied roles (including the colorimetric role) extend over the visual process from cones to cortex. These discrete roles have an overall structural role, in shaping functions to a trimodal framework (ROB peaks, complementary CMY troughs) which facilitates adapting functions to the illuminant. Thus the general role is evidently chromatic adaptation, for the purpose of colour constancy and improved image recognition in different iIIuminants. Given the role of complementary colours in colour constancy and hue discrimination, they may prove to be central to the visual process. 44 pages(s...|$|E

Complementary colours have been studied in science for over 300 years but little is known of their role in colour vision. Complementary colours are defined {{as a pair of}} colour stimuli which, with appropriate complementary wavelengths and ratios of radiant powers, admix a selected white (e. g. that of the illuminant). The thesis aim is to find and describe roles of complementary colours in colour perception. Only one role is generally accepted in the scientific literature: a colorimetric role in colour mixture and matching. A second role, in chromatic induction, was widely accepted until (erroneously) usurped 50 years ago by the opponent colours theory of chromatic induction. This thesis stemmed from signs that the visual system structures various visual functions from complementary colours. [...] Complementarism is shown to structure ten functions. For six of the functions, math models are formulated from complementary colours. The first three, closely related, papers describe three roles in colour constancy (see Appendix: Definitions), hue cycle structure, and hue cycle relative wavelength metric. Paper 1 describes complementary wavelengths' central role in a spectral mechanism of colour constancy, where constant hue and its complementary constant hue form parallel straight lines. Paper 2 establishes the roles of complementary colours in forming hue cycle structure and its wavelength-based metric. Dominant wavelength is extended into the nonspectrals/purples to form a relative wavelength scale over the whole cycle. Paper 3 utilises this scale to extend Paper 1 's spectral mechanism of colour constancy into the nonspectrals to complete the global mechanism. Paper 4 argues that chromatic induction is governed by complementary colours rather than opponent colours. Paper 5 formulates math models for six roles, in chromatic induction, wavelength discrimination, uniform hue, spectral sensitivity, saturation, and chromatic adaptation, from the ratio of either <b>complementary</b> <b>wavelength</b> intervals or of complementary powers; a seventh role, in three-dimensional color discrimination, is described. The total eleven varied roles (including the known colorimetric role) have a wide influence over the visual process from cones to cortex. These discrete roles indicate an overall role of complementary colours is structural, in shaping functions to a trimodal framework (RGB peaks and complementary CMY troughs), whose implicit purpose is to adapt functions to the illuminant.

The new advanced sensors (currently airborne, but eventually shuttle-based) have more limited areal extent than LANDSAT, but greater spatial and spectral resolution. The Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS) has spectral resolution of about. 01 microns and, typically, has 10 m/pixel spatial resolution. This improved spectral resolution means that diagnostic spectral features may now be identified, which in turn means that actual identification of mineral phases present can be addressed (of either monominerallic or composite materials). Another new sensor, the Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanners (TMS), obtains data in the 8 to 12 micron range. The information from the various sensors (e. g., LANDSAT, AIS, and TIMS) is <b>complementary,</b> covering different <b>wavelength</b> regions and consequently sensitive to different materials or physical properties of materials. In addition, the new sensors also produce a higher volume of data, which must be cleverly and efficiently handled...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} emitter is {{a well-known}} technology for producing highly doped areas under the metallization grid to improve the solar cell performance. In this work, the influence of laser irradiation on phosphoric acid coated multicrystalline silicon PV-wafers on the wafer surface structure, the phosphorous depth distribution and the electrical contact resistance within the laser treated area {{as well as the}} electrical series resistance of laserprocessed solar cells was evaluated. Different laser processing settings were tested including pulsed and continuous wave (cw) laser sources (515 nm, 532 nm, 1064 nm <b>wavelength).</b> <b>Complementary</b> numerical simulations using the finite element method (FEM) were conducted to explain the impact of the laser parameters on the melting behavior (melt duration and geometry). It was found that the melt duration is a key parameter for a successful laser doping process. Our simulations at a laser wavelengths of 515 nm reveal that low-repetition rate (< 500 kHz) laser pulses of 300 ns duration generate a melt duration of ~ 0. 35 µs, whereas upon scanning cw-laser radiation at 532 nm prolongates the melt duration by at least one order of magnitude. Experimentally, the widely used ns-laser pulses did not lead to satisfying laser irradiation results. In contrast, cw-laser radiation and scan velocities of less than 2 m/s led to suitable laser doping featuring low electrical resistances in the laser treated areas...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{separating}} the spectral signatures of the Martian surface and atmosphere {{was developed and}} is applied to multiple emission angle data returned from the MGS TES instrument. This method includes correlated-k and index gas removal algorithms that may be applied to all nadir-pointing TES data. Initial results have provided new and refined measurements of the spectral shapes of atmospheric dust and the Martian surface. Surface temperatures and atmospheric dust opacities are also retrieved with improved accuracy over single observation temperature and opacity retrievals. Low-albedo surfaces display absorptions consistent in both shape and depth with previous studies. These surfaces may be closely modeled {{using a combination of}} previously derived basalt, andesitic, and high-albedo surface spectral shapes. Short wavelengths display no significant absorptions, indicating both the coarse particulate nature of the surface and the lack of significant amounts of carbonate. Moderate- and high-albedo surfaces have spectral shapes distinctive of fine particulate silicate materials. No single material can match the entire high-albedo surface spectrum, though there are clear indications of a material that closely matches intermediate to calcic plagioclase and an emission peak at 1620 cm 1 due to bound water. The lack of residual restrahlen silicate absorptions indicates that minerals such as olivine or pyroxene are not present in high-albedo surfaces at significant (but unknown) abundances. High-albedo surface results presented here are in agreement with and <b>complementary</b> to shorter <b>wavelength</b> observations. The Martian dust is composed of both primary and secondary minerals. Either chemical weathering has not completely altered its source material or the soil is a mixture of altered and unaltered sources. Further laboratory studies are needed to better establish detection limits and behavior of mineral mixture...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{study the}} {{structure}} of nearby (< 500 pc) dense starless and star-forming cores with the particular goal to identify and understand evolutionary trends in core properties, and to explore the nature of Very Low Luminosity Objects (< 0. 1 L_sun; VeLLOs). METHODS: Using the MAMBO bolometer array, we create maps unusually sensitive to faint (few mJy per beam) extended (approx. 5 arcmin) thermal dust continuum emission at 1. 2 mm <b>wavelength.</b> <b>Complementary</b> information on embedded stars is obtained from Spitzer, IRAS, and 2 MASS. RESULTS: Our maps are very rich in structure, and we characterize extended emission features (``subcores'') and compact intensity peaks in our data separately {{to pay attention to}} this complexity. We derive, e. g., sizes, masses, and aspect ratios for the subcores, as well as column densities and related properties for the peaks. Combination with archival infrared data then enables the derivation of bolometric luminosities and temperatures, as well as envelope masses, for the young embedded stars. CONCLUSIONS: (abridged) Starless and star-forming cores occupy the same parameter space in many core properties; a picture of dense core evolution in which any dense core begins to actively form stars once it exceeds some fixed limit in, e. g., mass, density, or both, is inconsistent with our data. Comparison of various evolutionary indicators for young stellar objects in our sample (e. g., bolometric temperatures) reveals inconsistencies between some of them, possibly suggesting a revision of some of these indicators.

40|$|Accurate {{mapping of}} land cover at {{continental}} to global scales is currently limited by {{our ability to}} exploit the spatial, temporal, and radiometric characteristics of the available satellite data. Many ecologically and biogeochemically important landscape features are spatially extensive, but occur at scales {{much smaller than the}} ∼ 1 -km footprint of wide-swath, polar orbiting radiometers. This is especially true for land cover changes associated with human activities. Satellite instruments that offer the appropriate spatial detail have much smaller swaths and longer repeat times, resulting in compositing intervals that are too large to resolve the time scales of these changes. In addition, the cost and effort associated with acquisition and processing of high-resolution data for large areas is often prohibitive. Methods for taking advantage of information contained in multiple-scale observations by combining data from high-resolution and moderate resolution sensors are thus of great current interest. In this paper, we retrieve land cover distributions in two different parts of the Brazilian Amazon region by estimating relationships between land cover fractions derived from 30 -m resolution ETM+ and reflectance data from ∼ 1 -km resolution MODIS and MISR. The scaling relationships are derived using a Bayesian-regularized artificial neural network (ANN) and compared to results using linear unmixing (LU). We explore the simultaneous use of two significant independent variables in terrestrial optical remote sensing, wavelength, and sun-sensor geometry, by combining nadir-adjusted MODIS reflectances in seven bands (VIS-SWIR) with multiangular (− 71 ° to + 71 °) bidirectional reflectance data from MISR. This research was motivated by evidence from modeling and field studies demonstrating that: (a) the angular dependence of reflectance (e. g., from MISR) contains information about the structural composition of canopies that is <b>complementary</b> to the <b>wavelength</b> dependence; and (b) the SWIR portion of the spectrum (e. g., from MODIS) is sensitive to canopy moisture and shading conditions and, therefore, to the successional status of the ecosystem. This case study, using the Bayesian artificial neural network with combined MODIS-MISR data to estimate sub-pixel land cover fractions, yielded a quantitative improvement over spectral linear unmixing of single-angle, multispectral data. Our results suggest potential for broad-scale applicability despite a number of challenges related to tropical atmospheric conditions...|$|R
