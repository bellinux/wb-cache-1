The postage paid on mail to/from MPOs only covers the cost of transporting the mail within the U.S. All military mail between the U.S. and overseas locations is subject to customs inspection in the country of destination, and customs declarations must normally be attached to packages and larger mail pieces.|$|E

2500|$|The Court also {{disagreed}} with the U.S. Solicitor General's argument that requiring further effort when the government learns that notice was unsuccessful would cause the government to favor methods [...] "that do not generate additional information," [...] such as relying entirely on regular mail instead of <b>certified</b> <b>mail.</b> The Court considered this unlikely because the government is always being asked to prove that notice is sent and received, and the documentation that <b>certified</b> <b>mail</b> provides gives the State protection against false claims that notice was never received.

40|$|The Economic Census {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} activities that the U. S. Census Bureau performs. It is critical for updating firm ownership/structure and industry information for a large number of businesses in the Census Bureau’s Business Register, impacting most other economic programs. Also, it feeds into Bureau of Economic Analysis products, such as benchmark inputoutput accounts and Gross Domestic Product. The overall check-in rate for the 2007 Economic Census was just over 86 %. Establishments owned by multi-location companies returned over 90 % of their forms, as compared to the roughly two million single-establishment firms sampled in the Census that returned just over 80 %. We model the check-in rate for single-establishment firms by using a large number of variables that might be correlated with whether or not a firm returns a form in the Economic Census. These variables are broadly categorized as the characteristics of firms, measures of external factors, and features of the survey design. We use the model for two purposes. First, by including many of the factors that may be correlated with returns we aim to focus limited advertising and outreach resources to low-return segments of the population. Second, we use the model to investigate the efficacy of an unplanned intervention expected to increase return rates: using <b>certified</b> <b>mailing</b> for one of the form follow-ups.

2500|$|The Commissioner {{also argued}} that further {{measures}} were not required because Jones had a legal obligation to keep his address updated, {{that he was on}} inquiry notice after failing to receive a tax bill and pay his property taxes, and that he was obliged to ensure that the occupants of his property would alert him if it were in jeopardy. Though acknowledging that Jones should have been more diligent regarding his property, the Court rejected that any of those conditions could amount to a [...] of his due process right to receive adequate notice. [...] The method of <b>certified</b> <b>mail</b> furthermore made it impossible for the occupant to notify Jones, because only Jones could have signed for the letter.|$|E
2500|$|Though the Commissioner {{argued that}} even those {{additional}} steps were burdensome, the Court countered {{that it had}} instead undertaken [...] "the burden and expense of purchasing a newspaper advertisement, conducting an auction, and then negotiating a private sale of the property."

2500|$|According to Thomas, the Court's inquiry {{should have}} {{ended with the}} {{conclusion}} that the State's chosen method of notice by <b>certified</b> <b>mail</b> was reasonably calculated to inform Jones of proceedings affecting his property interest. He argued that this finding was [...] "reinforced by the well-established presumption that individuals, especially those owning property, act in their own interest." [...] The State was accordingly free to assume that the address it had on record was correct and up-to-date, or that he had left a caretaker at the house who would inform him of the notice. [...] Whether a method is reasonably calculated to give notice is furthermore determined at the time the notice is sent, a principle Thomas believed followed from Court precedent. He argued that the Court had abandoned this by basing its decision on information that was unavailable when notice was sent, and that all of its suggested reasonable methods were [...] "entirely the product of post hoc considerations." ...|$|E

40|$|Local {{governments in}} the United States still rely on real {{property}} taxation as a dominant source of revenue. Rather than establish a clear, uniform model of tax collection, the federal government allows each state to develop its own form of governance, resulting in over 150 different tax collection systems within the United States. Unfortunately, not all property taxes are paid, and the county government must seize the delinquent taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s property {{in order to fulfill}} the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s obligation. The Constitution requires the government to give the delinquent taxpayer notice of the pending action. Although recently it appears that the Supreme Court has been increasing the due process requirements for notice before a tax foreclosure sale, the Court has never clearly stated a due process standard for what constitutes constitutionally adequate notice. One of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s most recent attempts to provide guidelines for sufficient notice before a tax foreclosure proceeding was Jones v. Flowers, in which the Court sought to answer the question whether due process requires a state to take additional reasonable steps to provide a property owner with notice of a tax sale when a <b>certified</b> <b>mailing</b> notice of the sale is returned with the state 2 ̆ 2 unclaimed. 2 ̆ 2 This note explores the historical development of the due process notice requirement for tax foreclosure procedures in the United States Supreme Court and Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 s development of the notice requirement. Next, this note discusses the Jones case itself, in which in essence, the Court fails to consider the interests of the state in requiring additional steps after the post office returns attempted notice 2 ̆ 2 unclaimed 2 ̆ 2 without providing some indication of what direction the state should follow to meet the due process requirement. Finally, it analyzes some of the problems with the Jones case as well as some questions the Court leaves unanswered and outlines some of the immediate effects the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision has within the state of Arkansas...|$|R

[...] Though the method of using <b>certified</b> <b>mail</b> was in itself reasonably calculated to give notice, the knowledge that the State gained when the mail was returned unclaimed obligated it to take additional reasonable steps. However, [...] "n response to the returned form suggesting that Jones had not received notice {{that he was about to}} lose his property, the State didnothing." [...] The Court believed that [...] "someone who actually wanted to alert Jones that he was in danger of losing his house would do more when the attempted notice letter was returned unclaimed, and there was more that reasonably could be done." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{organization}} {{reported having}} collected 11,020 signatures, {{but neither the}} Constitution nor any complementary law authorizes a proposal of law by citizens without proving their right to vote. Article 88 of the Constitution does not refer to any signature, and the Article 64 of the Rules of the National Assembly clearly request as quantum of proof a notarized affidavit. Thus, the legal requisite for consideration by Cuban National Assembly is not a number at all, but {{the legal status of}} voter. [...] The Cuban National Assembly's Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee did not suspend consideration of the Varela Project citizens' initiative, but responded to it with an expert opinion, dated on November 1, 2002, and forwarded to the promoters by courier on November 18 and by <b>certified</b> <b>mail</b> on November 26. This expert opinion dismissed the Varela Project because of formal and substantial grounds. Formally, the Varela Project did not prove the voter status of those who had provided their names, national identification numbers, addresses, and signatures. Also it wasn't presented as a proposal of law, but as a mix of allegations regarding legal issues that should be articulate as separate laws. Moreover, the Varela Project mixed up referendum and popular consultation, which are two different constitutional issues. The Cuban regime did not respond to the Varela Project with its own counter initiative, providing that the Cuban Constitution be amended to make permanent the socialist nature of the Cuban state. Such was the response to the U.S. President's speeches on May 20, 2002, and the foreign media broke the news that the huge mobilization [...] — a typical resource of the Cuban regime against the U.S. — for irrevocable socialism was the response to the Varela Project. In fact, the response was limited since the very beginning to the expert opinion by the aforementioned Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee. [...] A BBC reporter noted that many Cubans said they felt pressured into signing the government's petition. [...] According to the United States State Department, [...] "activists reported increased harassment by State Security agents. Authorities arrested and detained Varela activists, confiscated signatures, fined and threatened activists and signers, and forced signers to rescind signatures. State Security impersonated canvassing volunteers and increasingly infiltrated the ranks of activists. In May and June, Oswaldo Paya reported State Security agents visited and pressured more than 50 Varela Project signatories to retract their signatures and denounce the Varela Project activists who had collected their signatures." ...|$|E

50|$|Acceleration is {{a clause}} {{that is usually}} found in Sections 16, 17, or 18 of a mortgage. Not all {{accelerations}} are the same for each mortgage, as {{it depends on the}} terms and conditions between lender and obligated mortgagor(s). When a term in the mortgage has been broken, the acceleration clause goes into effect. It can declare the entire payable debt to the Lender if the Borrower(s) were to transfer the title at a future date to a purchaser. The clause in the mortgage also instructs that a notice of acceleration must be served to the obligated mortgagor(s) who signed the Note. Each mortgage gives a time period for the debtor(s) to cure their loan. The most common time periods allot to debtor(s) is usually 30 days, but for commercial property it can be 10 days. The notice of acceleration is called a Demand and/or Breach Letter. In the letter it informs the Borrower(s) that they have 10 or 30 days from the date on the letter to reinstate their loan. Demand/Breach letters are sent out by <b>Certified</b> and Regular <b>mail</b> to all notable addresses of the Borrower(s). Also in the acceleration of the mortgage the lender must provide a payoff quote that is estimated 30 days from the date of the letter. This letter is called an FDCPA (Fair Debt Collections Practices Acts) letter and/or Initial Communication Letter. Once the Borrower(s) receives the two letters providing a time period to reinstate or payoff their loan the lender must wait until that time expires in to take further action. When the 10 or 30 days have passed that means that the acceleration has expired and the Lender can move forward with foreclosing on the property.|$|R
