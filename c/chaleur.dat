Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to <b>Chaleur</b> Regional Hospital in Bathurst.

25|$|The {{original}} {{meaning of the}} word dimension, in Fourier's Theorie de la <b>Chaleur,</b> was the numerical value of the exponents of the base units.

Only slightly later, King James VI and I laid claim to what is today Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and part of Maine and made it part of the Scottish Crown's dominion, calling the area Nova Scotia. James' son, Charles I, later issued the Charter of New Scotland, which created the Baronets of Nova Scotia, many of which continue to exist today.

25|$|Fourier {{used the}} work of Laplace and Lagrange to solve the heat {{equation}} by separation of variables in his famous 1822 book Théorie analytique de la <b>chaleur.</b> Sturm developed Fourier's ideas further and {{brought them to the}} attention of Cauchy, who combined them with his own ideas and arrived at the fact that real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues. This was extended by Hermite in 1855 to what are now called Hermitian matrices. Around the same time, Brioschi proved that the eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices lie on the unit circle, and Clebsch found the corresponding result for skew-symmetric matrices. Finally, Weierstrass clarified an important aspect in the stability theory started by Laplace by realizing that defective matrices can cause instability.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{consumption}} of halieutic products has many health benefits. However, their contaminants loads {{need to be}} addressed to better understand the risk from consuming these products. The aquatic biota from the Baie des <b>Chaleurs</b> in New Brunswick is contaminated by cadmium, zinc and lead. In spite of this, no study has examined the heavy metal concentrations in commercial halieutic products sold in this Canadian region. The objective of this pilot study was to characterize the species and origin of fish and seafood sold in the Baie des <b>Chaleurs</b> region by using an ecosystemic approach. Additionally, a baseline picture of the heavy metal levels found in these products has been determined. In 2008, interviews were carried out in markets located in the Baie des <b>Chaleurs</b> area. Species that were identified as the most purchased were then bought for analysis. Samples were freeze-dried and homogenized before nitric acid digestions. Aluminum, copper, cadmium, iron, manganese, and zinc concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Results show that 36 % of seafood species sold in markets were caught in the Baie des <b>Chaleurs.</b> Lobsters, shrimps, scallops and oysters are the most purchased species regardless of the season. High amounts of cadmium exceeding tolerable daily intake are found in lobster hepatopancreas and can cause deleterious effects on health, in particular in vulnerable populations such as children and heavy consumers. The ecosystemic approach to health used in this pilot study shows the feasibility of an exhaustive study on the exposure of coastal population to heavy metal from fish and seafood consumption and the source of halieutic products sold in markets...|$|R
