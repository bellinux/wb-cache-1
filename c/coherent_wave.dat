Over long distances of propagation, the multiply scattered elastic waves exhibit a diffusive character of transport after configurational averaging. We studied elastic properties of dry and wet granular materials by measuring <b>coherent</b> elastic <b>wave</b> velocities as function of externally applied load and wetting liquid content. Experimental data associated with <b>coherent</b> <b>waves</b> agree quite well with the effective medium theory based on the Hertz-Mindlin contact mechanics.

50|$|Similarly, {{multiple}} scattering {{can sometimes}} have somewhat random outcomes, particularly with coherent radiation. The random {{fluctuations in the}} multiply scattered intensity of coherent radiation are called speckles. Speckle also occurs if multiple parts of a <b>coherent</b> <b>wave</b> scatter from different centers.

In the particular case of a finite number of <b>coherent</b> <b>waves,</b> we show that the threshold for stochastic diffusion is reduced in comparison with the threshold in the one-wave case, and that the ensuing particle diffusion in velocity space occurs in periodic bursts along the time evolution. In the more general case of a set of waves with random phases, we have obtained even more efficient long-term diffusion in velocity space, for the same number of waves, although the initial diffusion rate can be smaller than in the case of <b>coherent</b> <b>waves...</b>|$|R

50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the most}} robust {{interference}} phenomena that survives multiple scattering, and it is regarded as an aspect of a quantum mechanical phenomenon known as weak localization (Akkermans et al. 1986). In weak localization, interference of the direct and reverse paths leads to a net reduction of light transport in the forward direction. This phenomenon is typical of any <b>coherent</b> <b>wave</b> which is multiple scattered. It is typically discussed for light waves, for which it is similar to the weak localization phenomenon for electrons in disordered (semi)conductors and often seen as the precursor to Anderson (or strong) localization of light. Weak localization of light can be detected since it is manifested as an enhancement of light intensity in the backscattering direction. This substantial enhancement is called the cone of coherent backscattering.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} work, Y. D. Chong et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 053901 (2010) ] {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} a coherent perfect absorber (CPA) as the time-reversed counterpart of a laser, in which a purely incoming radiation pattern is completely absorbed by a lossy medium. The optical medium that realizes CPA is obtained by reversing the gain with absorption, and thus it generally differs from the lasing medium. Here it is shown that a laser with an optical medium that satisfies the parity-time (PT) symmetry condition ϵ(-r) =ϵ^*(r) for the dielectric constant behaves simultaneously as a laser oscillator (i. e. it can emit outgoing <b>coherent</b> <b>waves)</b> and as a CPA (i. e. it can fully absorb incoming <b>coherent</b> <b>waves</b> with appropriate amplitudes and phases).

50|$|The {{concepts}} underlying {{this theory}} {{derive from the}} physicists, Hiroomi Umezawa and Herbert Fröhlich in the 1960s. More recently, their ideas have been elaborated by Mari Jibu and Kunio Yasue. Water comprises 70% of the brain, and quantum brain dynamics (QBD) proposes that the electric dipoles of the water molecules constitute a quantum field, {{referred to as the}} cortical field, with corticons as the quanta of the field. This cortical field is postulated to interact with quantum <b>coherent</b> <b>waves</b> generated by the biomolecules in neurons, which are suggested to propagate along the neuronal network. The idea of quantum <b>coherent</b> <b>waves</b> in the neuronal network derives from Frohlich. He viewed these waves as a means by which order could be maintained in living systems, and argued that the neuronal network could support long-range correlation of dipoles. This theory suggests that the cortical field not only interacts with the neuronal network, but also to a good extent controls it.|$|R
40|$|Propagation of P and SV {{waves in}} an elastic solid {{containing}} randomly distributed inclusions in a half-space is investigated. The approach {{is based on}} a multiple scattering analysis similar to the one proposed by Fikioris and Waterman for scalar waves. The characteristic equation, the solution of which yields the effective <b>wave</b> numbers of <b>coherent</b> elastic <b>waves,</b> is obtained in an explicit form without the use of any renormalisation methods. Two approximations are considered. First, formulae are derived for the effective wave numbers in a dilute random distribution of identical scatterers. These equations generalize the formula obtained by Linton and Martin for scalar <b>coherent</b> <b>waves.</b> Second, the high frequency approximation is compared with the Waterman and Truell approach derived here for elastic waves. The Fikioris and Waterman approach, in contrast with Waterman and Truell's method, shows that P and SV waves are coupled even at relatively low concentration of scatterers. Simple expressions for the reflected coefficients of P and SV waves incident on the interface of the half space containing randomly distributed inclusions are also derived. These expressions depend on frequency, concentration of scatterers, and the two effective wave numbers of the <b>coherent</b> <b>waves</b> propagating in the elastic multiple scattering medium.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of antiplane waves in an unbounded linearly elastic solid {{that contains a}} distribution of flat cracks is considered. The cracks are parallel to each other, the distribution is dilute, and a wave is obliquely incident on the planes of the cracks. It is assumed that the multiple scattering produces a <b>coherent</b> <b>wave</b> that loses energy as it propagates. The attenuation coefficient is specified {{in terms of the}} power scattered by a single crack and the number of cracks per unit volume. Using the Kramers-Kronig relations, the speed of the <b>coherent</b> <b>wave</b> in the cracked solid is derived {{as a function of the}} frequency and of the crack density.

40|$|Results are {{reported}} from an {{experimental study of}} the threshold effect in the <b>coherent</b> <b>wave</b> instability in which a combination of simulated VLF noise 200 Hz wide, superimposed on a variable amplitude constant frequency test signal (about 3 kHz) is transmitted from Siple Station, Antarctica, and received at Lake Mistissini, Quebec. As the test signal is slowly ramped up in power a 'threshold' level at which growth and triggering of emissions begin (<b>coherent</b> <b>wave</b> instability) is reached. It is shown that sufficiently strong simulated noise supresses the <b>coherent</b> <b>wave</b> instability, which corresponds to increasing the threshold level. This experiment is repeated at progressively lower levels of the simulated noise, until the threshold level for growth and triggering on the test signal no longer changes. At this point the simulated noise power is estimated to equal typical background noise levels due to magnetospheric hiss in the interaction region.
