The industries which most often manufactures free-form surfaces are basically aerospace, automotive, die mold industries, bio medical and power sector for turbine blades manufacturing.

The geometry can also be not described explicitly so errors and discontinuities occurrence in the solid structure cannot be avoided. Free-form surfaces are machined with the help of different tool path generation method like adaptive iso-planar tool path generation, constant scallop tool path generation, adaptive iso-parametric method, iso-curvature, isophote and by other methods.

It allows simultaneous generation of allinformation required to satisfy machining requirements of the design such as its machinability and availabilityof the required tooling resources.

In thisdirection, further integration of the system developed with systems such as MRP, MRP II and assembly sequenceplanning packages are highly desirable. Originality/value: CAD/CAM integration is regarded as a solution for bridging the gap between design andmanufacturing, one of the ultimate goals for concurrent engineering. Since the advent of CAD and CAMnumerous attempts have been made to integrate these technologies; however, a full CAD/CAM integration isnot yet achieved. In addition, most of the systems developed focus only on turning, leaving room for furtherinvestigation on other machining operations including milling.

40|$|In modern {{machining}} applications, {{with the}} developments in {{computer aided manufacturing}} (<b>CAM)</b> <b>technology,</b> predictive modeling of milling operations has gained momentum.

Cutting force and stability simulations are used in identification of feasible regions of cutting parameters and comparison of machining strategies for productivity. Cutting force simulation throughout a toolpath is performed through extended Z-mapping approach, where a previously developed generalized cutting force model is utilized. Stability diagrams are generated in frequency domain. Dynamic programming (DP) approach is adapted for machining strategy comparison, which takes into account several constraint curves such as chatter stability, cutting torque, spindle power, tool deflection, and surface roughness.

40|$|The issues {{analyzed}} {{in this paper}} are {{the extent to which}} unit costs and production labor requirements might be reduced in manufacturing industries if there were more widespread use of industrial robots and flexible manufacturing systems. These issues are analyzed from two perspectives. The technological focus of the first perspective is confined to the use of robotic manipulators. The percent of the production worker jobs that could be replaced by robots is estimated. Reductions in unit cost are calculated by assuming that a given percentage of labor costs is reduced. The technological focus of the second perspective is the integration of robots with other types of computer assisted manufacturing (<b>CAM)</b> <b>technologies</b> into flexible manufacturing systems. Potential increase in output that could be realized in low-, medium-, and high-volume plants, if machines were fully utilized, is estimated.

Under the title seamless architecture this paper is seeking to study relationships (on a literal and conceptual level) with the existence or not in architecture of “seams”.

Metal is currently widely used as cladding material. In antithesis to previous notions of steel being the “bones” of architecture, expressing “strength” and “sturdiness” textile quality of metal surfaces. Digital fabrication of sheet metals has contributed towards this shift. However, architectural metal skins presently lack this seamless quality of a “differentiated-single” object.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, mass {{customization}} and {{computer aided manufacturing}} (<b>CAM)</b> <b>technologies</b> have transformed off-site building component fabrication. At the same time, traditional repetitive manufacturing still dominates building component production. Bricks, bathroom fixtures, window mullions, and door hardware are all repetitively manufactured. Ironically, CAM’s computer numerical controlled (CNC) machines have made the fabrication of custom molds for repetitive manufacturing easier. This allows architects to customize repetitively manufactured architecture components. I am using the term customized repetitive manufacturing (CRM) to refer {{to this type of}} work. Through my ongoing research, I have identified a wide range of historic and contemporary examples of CRM for architecture components. Designs for repetitive manufacturing architecture components involve coordination between the architect and the manufacturer. Both must balance capital costs with production runs, mold complexity with manufacturing parameters, and size restrictions with manufacturer’s abilities. How these issues are balanced depends on the application of the architectural component. I have identified three categories of custom designed architecture components based on application—custom components, architecture prototypes, and architecture products. This paper presents the three categories of application in reference to CRM. I define each category, provide multiple examples, and analyse particular case studies. Analysis of the case studies provides the architectural and manufacturing impacts on CRM within each category...|$|R
