25|$|The {{families}} of Cypriniformes are traditionally {{divided into two}} superfamilies. Superfamily Cyprinioidea contains the carps and minnows (Cyprinidae) and, according to some, also the mountain carps as the family Psilorhynchidae. In 2012 Maurice Kottelat reviewed the superfamily Cobitioidea and under his revision it now consists of the following families: hillstream loaches (Balitoridae), Barbuccidae, Botiidae, suckers (<b>Catostomidae),</b> true loaches (Cobitidae), Ellopostomatidae, Gastromyzontidae, sucking loaches (Gyrinocheilidae), stone loaches (Nemacheilidae), Serpenticobitidae and long-finned loaches (Vaillantellidae).|$|E
500|$|River otters consume an {{extensive}} assortment of fish species {{ranging in size}} from [...] that impart sufficient caloric intake for a minute amount of energy expenditure. River otters generally feed on prey that is in larger supply and easier to catch. As a result, slow-swimming fish are consumed more often than game fishes when both are equally available. Slow-moving species include suckers (<b>Catostomidae),</b> catfish, sunfish and bass (Centrarchidae); and daces, carp, and shiners (Cyprinidae). For instance, <b>Catostomidae</b> are the primary dietary component of river otters in Colorado's Upper Colorado River Basin. Likewise, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a preferred fish species for the otter in other regions of Colorado. Fish species frequently found in the diets of the North American river otters include: <b>Catostomidae,</b> which consists of suckers (Catostomus spp.) and redhorses (Moxostoma spp.); Cyprinidae, made up of carp (Cyprinus spp.), chubs (Semotilus spp.), daces (Rhinichthys spp.), shiners (Notropis and Richardsonius spp.), and squawfishes (Ptychocheilus spp.); and Ictaluridae, which consists of bullheads and catfish (Ictalurus spp.). Other fish {{an integral part of the}} river otters' diets are those that are often plentiful and found in large schools: sunfish (Lepomis spp.); darters (Etheostoma spp.); and perches (Perca spp.). Bottom-dwelling species, which have the tendency to remain immobile until a predator is very close, are susceptible to river otters. These include mudminnows (Umbra limi) and sculpins (Cottus spp.). Game fish, such as trout (Salmonidae) and pike (Esocidae), are not a significant component of their diets. They are less likely to be prey for the North American river otters since they are fast-swimming and can find good escape cover. However, river otters will prey on trout, pike, walleye (Sander vitreus vitreus), salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and other game fish during spawning.|$|E
2500|$|The Cyprinidae in {{particular}} are important {{in a variety of}} ways. Many species are important food fish, particularly in Europe and Asia. Some are also important as aquarium fish, of which the goldfish and koi are perhaps the most celebrated. The other families are of less commercial importance. The <b>Catostomidae</b> have some importance in angling, and some [...] "loaches" [...] are bred for the international aquarium fish trade.|$|E
2500|$|Catostomoidea {{is usually}} {{treated as a}} junior synonym of Cobitioidea. But it seems {{that it could be}} split off the <b>Catostomidae</b> and Gyrinocheilidae in a {{distinct}} superfamily; the Catostomoidea might be closer relatives of the carps and minnows than of the [...] "true" [...] loaches. While the Cyprinioidea seem more [...] "primitive" [...] than the loach-like forms, they were apparently successful enough never to shift from the original ecological niche of the basal Ostariophysi. Yet, from the ecomorphologically conservative main lineage apparently at least two major radiations branched off. These diversified from the lowlands into torrential river habitats, acquiring similar habitus and adaptations in the process.|$|E
2500|$|Holdings of {{freshwater}} fishes are greatest from the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. In addition, an {{effort has been}} made to obtain as complete a taxonomic and geographic coverage {{of freshwater}} species as possible from throughout North America. As a result, over 90 percent of the freshwater fish species from the United States and Canada are represented in the collection. Best represented are members of the <b>Catostomidae,</b> Centrarchidae, Cyprinidae, Elassomatidae, Fundulidae, Ictaluridae, Lepisosteidae, Percidae, Petromyzontidae and Poeciliidae. Freshwater fishes from Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, Hispaniola, Guatemala, Panama and Costa Rica are currently represented in moderate to large numbers in the collection. The Florida Museum of Natural History's Hispaniolan holdings are unsurpassed and the Venezuelan holdings are growing continuously. A wide spectrum of characoid, gymnotoid and siluroid families, cichlids, and poeciliids are especially well represented ...|$|E
2500|$|Balitoridae and Gyrinocheilidae are {{families}} of mountain stream fishes feeding on algae and small invertebrates. They are {{found only in}} tropical and subtropical Asia. While the former are a speciose group, the latter contain {{only a handful of}} species. The suckers (<b>Catostomidae)</b> are found in temperate North America and eastern Asia. These large fishes are similar to carps in appearance and ecology. Members of Cobitidae common across Eurasia and parts of North Africa. A mid-sized group like the suckers, they are rather similar to catfish in appearance and behaviour, feeding primarily off the substrate and equipped with barbels to help them locate food at night or in murky conditions. Fishes in the families Cobitidae, Balitoridae, Botiidae, and Gyrinocheilidae are called loaches, although it seems that the last do not belong to the lineage of [...] "true" [...] loaches but are related to the suckers.|$|E
