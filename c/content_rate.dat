These four purposes vary in terms of the relative importance of the <b>content,</b> <b>rate,</b> duration and the focus of the interaction. It is important that the AAC systems selected also reflect the priorities of the individual and their family. In Western cultures, professionals may see a communication device as helping to promote an individual's self-determination, i.e., the ability to make one's own decisions and choices. However, cultural and religious factors may affect the degree to which individual autonomy is a valued construct, and influence family attitudes towards AAC.|$|E

50|$|SAIC Volkswagen's Shanghai {{plant was}} by the far the winner among all new JVs, as it {{produced}} cars that could function as taxis, vehicles for government officials and transport for the newly emerging business elite. SAIC Volkswagen began automobile production in 1985. As car imports fell to some 34,000 in 1990, SAIC Volkswagen's production of its Santana models reached nearly 19,000 vehicles that year. By 1993 SAIC Volkswagen’s output had reached 100,000 vehicles. Volkswagen was aided by some Shanghai municipal efforts. Various restrictions on engine size, as well as incentives to city taxi companies, helped ensure a safe market in the company’s relatively wealthy home arena. Volkswagen also encouraged its foreign parts suppliers to create joint ventures in China, and their resulting product helped SAIC Volkswagen achieve an 85 per cent local <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> by 1993.|$|E

40|$|The {{internationalization}} {{of production}} requires each multinational firm {{to determine the}} local <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> for his product that is made and sold in a foreign country. In this thesis, we investigate the local <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> and pricing decisions for a multinational firm who competes with a local firm in a market without and with a local content requirement (LCR). We develop and solve a two-stage decision problem in which the multinational firm determines his optimal local <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> and the two firms then make their pricing decisions. Our analytical {{results show that the}} multinational firm sets a lower local <b>content</b> <b>rate,</b> when the competition between the product of the multinational firm and that of the local firm intensifies, consumers 2 ̆ 7 valuation is more strongly affected by the quality of the product of the multinational firm, and the reduction in consumers 2 ̆ 7 marginal utility is smaller. We also show that an LCR may induce the multinational firm to increase local <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> and transfer benefits from the multinational firm to the local firm. However, a very high LCR threshold will cause the multinational firm to adopt a low local <b>content</b> <b>rate,</b> resulting in a low demand and profit for both the multinational firm and the local firm...|$|E

40|$|We study a three-country three-firm {{free trade}} area (FTA) trade model with rules of origin (ROO) under {{international}} R&D competition. The external tariff is chosen by the country importing final goods in the FTA. If the FTA chooses a higher <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> of ROO, the country importing final goods chooses a higher tariff in order to compensate for lower consumer surplus. We have three results. First, if the FTA raises the <b>content</b> <b>rate,</b> it raises the costs of exporters within the area, but if the R&D cost is sufficiently low, the exporters actually increase exports and their profits also increase. Second, if the firms within the FTA are less efficient than outsiders, the social welfare of countries importing final goods {{is affected by the}} <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> in a U-shaped fashion. A tightening of ROO may reduce the social welfare of importing countries since it may replace productive firms outside the FTA with less productive local firms. Third, if the productivity within an FTA is relatively high, the optimal <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> of ROO for the importing country within the FTA is 100 %. In that case, the country importing final goods does not need to rely on imports from outside. Since an increase in the <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> of ROO increases external tariff, the most stringent ROO requirement is desirable for that country.

40|$|This study {{estimated}} the wheat yield, quality, and growth conditions using hyperspectral {{data of the}} later grain filling and heading stages. The study area {{is located in the}} suburbs of Mullewa, Western Australia. Various data used included spectral reflectance of wheat measured from the ground and those measured using airborne sensors, wheat growth conditions data, such as LAI, SPAD values, and wheat height, and sample analysis data, including biomass, grain nitrogen <b>content</b> <b>rate,</b> leaf nitrogen <b>content</b> <b>rate,</b> and ash content, of the later grain filling and heading stages. This study consisted of (1) selection of estimation items regarding the wheat yield, quality, and growth conditions by correlation analysis of sample data, (2) definition of estimate equations for selected items, (3) verification of estimation accuracy, and (4) development of estimation maps. As a result, head moisture, which is related to the wheat growth conditions, was well estimated using hyperspectral data of the later grain filling stage. At the same time, grain weight, which is related to the wheat yield, and grain nitrogen <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> and ash content, which are related to the wheat quality, were well estimated using hyperspectral data of the heading stage. This study implies {{that it is possible to}} visualize the wheat yield, quality, and growth conditions on a regional scale using hyperspectral data...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Biphasic calcium {{phosphate}} (BCP) ceramics, {{a mixture of}} hydroxyapatite (HAp) and beta-tri{{calcium phosphate}} (β-TCP), of varying HAp/β-TCP ratios were prepared from fine powders. Porous BCP ceramic materials with HAp/β-TCP weight rations of 20 / 80, 40 / 60, and 80 / 20 were prepared. In this study, the bioactivity is reduced at a bigger HAp <b>content</b> <b>rate,</b> which is likely related to the high driving pore {{for the formation of}} a new phase, and the reaction rate was proportional to the β-TCP. The porous BCP ceramics having a bigger porosity rate can easily under up dissolution. The powder having a bigger β-TCP <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> can easily generate a new phase. The dissolution results confirmed that the biodegradation of calcium phosphate ceramics could be controlled by simply adjusting the amount of HAp or β-TCP in the ceramics and porosity rate...|$|E

While the existing literature of ROO considers models of perfect or monopolistic competition, we consider an oligopolistic trade model. Our model consists of three final-good producers - one in an importing country and two in an exporting country - and one intermediategood producer, {{which is in the}} importing country and has monopoly power. We show that, within the range of parameter values for which some exporters comply with ROO, the <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> affects the output of the final-good producer in the importing country and the country's social welfare in an U-shaped fashion. The <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> levels that allow the coexistence of compliers and non-compliers minimize social welfare. Rules of origin (ROO), Compliance, Free trade area (FTA) ...|$|E

40|$|A growth {{experiment}} {{for developing}} better growth method of Oryza sativa 'Koshihikari' made in Fukui {{was carried out}} in 2015 by using 4 rice pods in a glass house under the collaboration with Fukui University of Technology, Fukui prefectural agricultural experiment station, Sakai agricultural high school and Yamada-Giken Co., Ltd. Our aim in the experiment was to make sure the effectiveness of hyper-spectral information ingrowth diagnosis of rice. As a first step for developing useful remote sensing technique to produce good taste rice in Fukui prefecture, we selected leaf color and <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> of protein in harvested rice as the targets of estimation. During the period of experiment, the leaf color of rice had been directly measured once a week by SPAD- 502 which is well-used in-situ leaf color measurement instrument. Simultaneously, the spectral information of leaf had been observed by using a hyper-spectral camera HSC 1702. In addition, the <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> of protein after the harvest was measured by Fukui prefectural agricultural experiment station. The result of correlation analyses between leaf color data and NDSI spectral indices derived from the hyper-spectral data shows that NDSI spectral indices using near-infrared and green wavelengths are effective for estimating leaf color of rice through different growing stages. The results also show that NDSI indices using reflectance of blue region are effective for estimation of <b>content</b> <b>rate</b> of protein. These results are basically consistent with those of previous studies, which indicates our measurement and data analyses were carried out successfully. However, a further study is needed to decide the optimal combination of wavelengths in NDSI index and to confirm the reproducibility of coefficient of regression line obtained in this study...|$|E
