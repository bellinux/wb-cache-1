5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances.

5|$|The {{challenge}} with Kibble balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards {{down the hall to the}} Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more.

25|$|Many {{of these}} {{reactions}} {{have a strong}} temperature dependence, with higher temperatures typically accelerating exchange. However, different mechanisms may prevail at each temperature window. Ionic exchange, for example, has the most significance at low temperatures. In such low temperature environments, there is potential for preserving the original hydrogen isotope signal over {{hundreds of millions of}} years. However, many rocks in geologic time have reached significant thermal maturity. Even by the onset of the oil window it appears that much of the hydrogen has exchanged. Recently, scientists have explored a silver lining: hydrogen exchange is a zero order kinetic reaction (for carbon bound hydrogen at 80-100°C, the half-times are likely 104 - 105 years). Applying the mathematics of rate constants would allow extrapolation to original isotopic compositions. While this solution holds promise, there is too much disagreement in the literature for robust <b>calibrations.</b>|$|E

These <b>calibrations</b> took place from 1985 until 1989.

In order to solve these problems, a new <b>calibration</b> method based on the combined target for line-structured light multi-vision sensor is proposed. Each line-structured light multi-vision sensor is locally calibrated by combined target with high precision. On the basis of global <b>calibration</b> principle and the characteristics of the combined target, global <b>calibration</b> and local <b>calibration</b> are unified. The unification avoids the precision decrement caused by coordinate transformation. And the occlusion problem of 3 D reference objects can be avoided.

To improve the <b>calibration</b> accuracy, the method of acquiring <b>calibration</b> points with high precision and error factors in <b>calibration</b> are analyzed.

25|$|Before Jaffe, Neubauer {{described}} a similar precipitation reaction by mixing creatinine with zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and performing a Weyl's test—the addition of SNP to NaOH and then incubating with acetic acid (CH3CO2H) {{to develop a}} color change. Until Folin developed Jaffe's reaction into a clinical procedure, Neubauer's method was how creatinine was measured. As Folin's method evolved, various techniques were implemented to remove Jaffe-reacting substances, mostly protein, from the sample and increase specificity. By the 1950s, precipitated aluminum silicate, called Lloyd's reagent, was being used to remove protein from serum, further improving accuracy. Fuller's earth was also used for protein-binding, but the reference method until the 1980s was adsorption with Lloyd's reagent. New concerns arose due to non-standardization of procedures; different labs were reading results at different endpoints. This problem was resolved {{with the advent of}} automated analyzers in the 1960s and 1970s, which introduced a kinetic reading of results rather than a specific endpoint. Kinetic Jaffe methods involve mixing serum with alkaline picrate and reading the rate of change in absorption spectrophotometrically at 520nm. This not only standardized the procedure, but also removed the need for sample deproteinization. It also introduced two new problems—analyzers used an algorithmic compensation to correct for pseudochromogens, and <b>calibrations</b> were not yet standardized between instruments.|$|E

However, the approach is problematic, both from an analytical (it is not internally consistent) and an empirical point of view (there's no guarantee that the parameter, even if it makes conceptual sense, remains stable when a new policy – the government's subsidy – is introduced). <b>Calibrations</b> of models of industry structure on the other hand have generally found that most industry are neither Cournot (in which case the Brander–Spencer policy prescription would be an export subsidy) nor Bertrand (in which case the optimal policy is an export tax).

500|$|Beyond {{the simple}} wear that check {{standards}} can experience, {{the mass of}} even the carefully stored national prototypes can drift relative to the IPK {{for a variety of}} reasons, some known and some unknown. Since the IPK and its replicas are stored in air (albeit under two or more nested bell jars), they gain mass through adsorption of atmospheric contamination onto their surfaces. Accordingly, they are cleaned in a process the BIPM developed between 1939 and 1946 known as [...] "the BIPM cleaning method" [...] that comprises firmly rubbing with a chamois soaked in equal parts ether and ethanol, followed by steam cleaning with bi-distilled water, and allowing the prototypes to settle for [...] days before verification. Before the BIPM's published report in 1994 detailing the relative change in mass of the prototypes, different standard bodies used different techniques to clean their prototypes. The NIST's practice before then was to soak and rinse its two prototypes first in benzene, then in ethanol, and to then clean them with a jet of bi-distilled water steam. Cleaning the prototypes removes between 5 and 60µg of contamination depending largely on the time elapsed since the last cleaning. Further, a second cleaning can remove up to 10µg more. After cleaning—even when they are stored under their bell jars—the IPK and its replicas immediately begin gaining mass again. The BIPM even developed a model of this gain and concluded that it averaged 1.11µg per month for the first 3 months after cleaning and then decreased to an average of about 1µg per year thereafter. Since check standards like K4 are not cleaned for routine <b>calibrations</b> of other mass standards—a precaution to minimize the potential for wear and handling damage—the BIPM's model of time-dependent mass gain has been used as an [...] "after cleaning" [...] correction factor.|$|E
