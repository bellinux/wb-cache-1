This {{concept was}} introduced by Huang and Zhang [3] and it {{is known to be}} the most general among all commutativity concepts in fixed point theory. For example every pair of weakly commuting self-maps and each pair of compatible self-maps are weakly compatible, but the converse is not always true. In fact, the notion of weakly compatible maps is more general than <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> type (A), <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> type (B), <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> type (C), and <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> type (P). For a review of those notions of commutativity, see ([11, 12]).|$|R

The main use of intrusion detection systems (IDS) is to detect attacks against information systems and networks. A main difficulty in the field of intrusion detection is the organization <b>of</b> <b>alerts.</b> Normally IDS’s produced numerous alerts, which cannot provide a clear idea to the analyst about what type <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> occur, which type <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> is generated etc. because of the huge number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> generated by these systems. One solution of this problem is classifying the alerts. During this paper, we try to represent an overview <b>of</b> IDS <b>alerts</b> classification techniques...|$|R

In the paper a method to evaluate territorial <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> pipeline is described. This approach can be useful for a responsible development of oil and gas pipeline networks. The evaluation criteria is a quali/quantitavive method and it is homogeneous with those utilized in the case of fixed installations (Liquefied Natural Gas, LNG, storage systems). The criteria described to evaluate territorial <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> pipelines makes use of a specific check list and an index system and arrives to the determination of a pipeline risk index, easy to be considered when different technical solutions are compared under the environmental and safety aspects...|$|R

In order to solve highmortality rate problem, the government of Daerah IstimewaYogyakarta (DIY), including District of Sleman, is carrying outthe policy <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> village. Method: The study used literature review based onreferences and field data which were issued by Health Office. Result: The policy <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> village has less positive impact indecreasing maternal mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate,because health assurance scheme still does not meet theneeds of the people, both physical and non-physical. Thedegree of health still has not improved significantly. The policyof alert village needs inter-sectoral financial support. Financialallocation is still mistargeting. People needs vary from onevillage to another, so {{it is necessary to}} have competent andsmart health workers as the implementing agents of HealthDepartment. The policy <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> village is still not able to satisfyall stakeholders (government, health workers, and people),because the concept of satisfaction is closely related to theprinciple of justice. Conclusion: The policy <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> village is an effort to empowerthe people to be independent in overcoming their healthproblems. But, in District of Sleman the policy <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> village isclassified into unsuccessfull policy. This failure is caused byinsufficiet support in implementating the policy.
