Both free and protein-incorporated amino acids were analysed. Labelled nitrogen was incorporated into a range of free amino acids, the principal sinks for assimilation being alanine, aspartate/asparagine and glutamate/glutamine. The spectrum of labelling in protein-incorporated amino acids was wider with significant incorporation into the above compounds but additional assimilation of nitrogen as glycine, valine, serine, leucine, isoleucine and arginine. In total 78 % of the nitrogen assimilated was incorporated into proteinaceous material. Label was incorporated from both nitrogen sources but the levels of enrichment in most free and protein-bound amino acids were usually higher in systems supplied with ammonium than in those supplied with nitrate.

To alter the chemical composition of the renal medulla, water intake was reduced in rats to one-half the normal daily intake. Water restriction increased the incidence of coliform pyelonephritis. Systemic acidosis, produced by giving a 300 mM solution of <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> increased urinary osmolality to values comparable to water restriction and also predisposed to pyelonephritis.

40|$|In a {{summation}} {{of the experimental}} work presented herein, the following points are believed significant: (1) The fermentation of dextrose by maceration extract of yeast is stimulated by <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> and magnesium sulfate. (2) The activity of zymin preparations will vary greatly depending upon {{the source of the}} yeast and upon the length of time the yeast is stored at 5 °C. (3) Mixtures of zymins of different activities gives a resultant activity which is lower than the theoretical activity of the mixture. (4) The washing of a fresh yeast which normally would yield a zymin of low activity produces considerably higher activity. (5) Zymins respond differently toward <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> and the differences range from definite inhibition to stimulation as high as 80 percent. There also is a fairly good correlation between the activity of a zymin and the degree of stimulation by <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride.</b> The less active a zymin is, the more than zymin is stimulated by <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> and the higher the optimum concentration of <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> will be. (6) In a series of studies with methyl <b>ammonium</b> <b>chlorides,</b> stimulation is observable which is similar to that observed with <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> but the degree of stimulation is progressively less according to the following series: NH 4 + CH 3 NH 3 + (CH 3) 2 NH 2 + (CH 3) NH+. (7) The effect of magnesium sulfate appears to be rather consistently the same regardless of the activity of the zymin. (8) A substance was separated from a zymin of low activity which had an inhibitory effect on the activity of more active zymins. Its action was, in turn, strongly depressed by small concentrations of <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride.</b> (9) The effects of magnesium sulfate and <b>ammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> were inhibitory in the fermentation of sodium hexosediphosphate.
