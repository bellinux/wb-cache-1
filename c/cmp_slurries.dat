The planarization becomes effective if the material removal rate (MRR) is optimal and the surface defects are minimal. The pH of the slurry plays a very important role in removing the selective layer by CMP, and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is the most common oxidizer used in <b>CMP</b> <b>slurry.</b> The purpose of this paper is the analysis of the pH effect on the etching rate (ER) and on the behavior of selective layer polishing by a constant concentration of H 2 O 2 and the influence of nanoparticles size and concentration on selective layer surface CMP.

Currently, α-Alumina (α-Al 2 O 3) particle, {{as a kind of}} abrasive, has been widely used in <b>CMP</b> <b>slurries,</b> but their high hardness and poor dispersion stability often lead to more surface defects. After being polished with composite particles, the surface defects of work pieces decrease obviously. So the composite particles as abrasives in slurry have been paid more attention. In order to reduce defect caused by pure α-Al 2 O 3 abrasive, α-alumina-g-polystyrene sulfonic acid (α-Al 2 O 3 -g-PSS) composite abrasive was prepared by surface graft polymerization. The composition, structure and morphology of the product were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy(TOF-SIMS), and scanning electron microscopy(SEM), respectively. The results show that polystyrene sulfonic acid grafts onto α-Al 2 O 3, and has well dispersibility. Then, the chemical mechanical polishing performances of the composite abrasive on glass substrate were investigated with a SPEEDFAM- 16 B- 4 M CMP machine.
