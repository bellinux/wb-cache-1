5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> this was a terrible idea.|$|E
5|$|When Tillman {{entered the}} Senate in 1895, he {{was opposed to}} {{expansion}} of the United States Navy, fearing the expenditure would cause the issuance of bonds by the president, which he felt would only enrich the wealthy. Tillman sat on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and soon <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> South Carolina could benefit from naval appropriations steered towards her. A flow of federal funds to his home state resulted, beginning in 1900, followed by the establishment, in 1909, of the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Once Democrats {{took control of the}} Senate {{for the first time in}} Tillman's tenure, in 1913, he became chairman of the committee and allied with others from the southeast (such as Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, a North Carolinian) to see that the bulk of naval appropriations would be spent there. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (57th through 59th Congresses) and on the Committee on Five Civilized Tribes of Indians (61st and 62nd Congresses). Strokes in 1908 and 1910 decreased his influence and ability in the Senate; his seniority entitled him to become Senate Appropriations Committee chairman in 1913, but his health did not permit it.|$|E

On 7 November 1942 she described her [...] "contempt" [...] for {{her mother and her}} inability to [...] "confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness," [...] before concluding, [...] "She's not a mother to me." [...] Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: [...] "Anne, is it really you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?" [...] She <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.|$|E

[...] "No {{one who was}} in Spain during the months when people still {{believed}} in the revolution will ever forget that strange and moving experience.

[...] In the words of a recent biographer, Gordon Bowker, [...] "the people that had effaced that reality, the Soviet Communists, now had an implacable enemy they would come to regret having made." [...] Christopher Hitchens: [...] "The narrative core of Homage to Catalonia, it might be argued, is a series of events that occurred in and around the Barcelona telephone exchange in early May 1937. Orwell was a witness to these events, by the relative accident of his having signed up with the militia of the anti-Stalinist POUM upon arriving in Spain ... he became convinced that he had been the spectator of a full-blown Stalinist putsch ... Moreover, he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> much of the talk about discipline and unity was a rhetorical shield for the covert Stalinization of the Spanish Republic." ...|$|E

[...] Because HRC was so new {{at the time of}} Laudan's book, she only briefly touches upon it: [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> what people in Hawaii eat is a mixture of four distinct kinds of food, introduced at distinct periods, but now all coexisting. [...] The first three reflect the three diasporas that have terminated in Hawaii: the great marine diaspora of the Pacific Islanders that probably reached the Hawaiian Islands sometime in the third century A.D..; the European voyages of discovery that finally came upon the Islands in the late eighteenth century; and the long migration of the Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Koreans, Filipinos, and lately, Southeast Asians, most of whom came to work on the plantations. [...] From these diverse traditions, a fourth, an East-West-Pacific food, is now being created, known in the Islands as Local Food. [...] But there is another cuisine in the Islands that attracts attention, Hawaii Regional Cuisine... was created by forces quite different from those that drive Local Food...although the forces creating Hawaii Regional Cuisine and Local Food were different, their current cross-fertilization can be nothing but mutually beneficial, creating a firm regional base for the cuisine of the restaurants and increasing sophistication for the cuisine of the home and the street." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1654, Groseilliers {{was sent}} west {{along with an}} unknown partner, to journey west to the new Huron lands. The voyage took two years to {{complete}} and upon returning in August 1656, they carried in their canoes reports of contact with several First Nations, among them the Sioux, Pottawattomi, Winnebago and Fox peoples and furs worth [...] "14 to 15 thousand livres". Leaving in August 1659, Groseilliers and Radisson traveled west {{to the far end}} of Lake Superior and wintered at Lac Courte Oreilles in what is now known as Wisconsin. According to Radisson's account of the voyage, they helped repel an Iroquois attack along the Ottawa River and that the idea for trading furs from Hudson Bay came to them at this time. They returned to [...] in summer 1660 and upon return to New France, they were fined most of their profits by the colonial government because they had left New France without a license. This journey demonstrated that the French could find riches in the interior of the continent and this led to more Frenchmen go west, with seven heading to Lake Superior within the year. From Cree traders, the French men <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the main source of furs lay northwest of the lake. In 1661, Groseilliers traveled to France to appeal the fine without success and returned to New France the same year. Groseilliers and Radisson proposed creating a trading company for the furs to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the French minister of finance under King Louis XIV. Colbert thought it a waste of resources and refused to support the project. In Spring 1662, Groseilliers and Radisson intended to journey to the west via the Hudson Bay region. In order to get to Hudson Bay from Isle Percée, Groseilliers intended to charter a vessel. However, the plans fell through and Groseilliers and Radisson instead searched further south in New England in hope of finding a suitable vessel.|$|E
