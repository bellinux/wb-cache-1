5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> the ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions {{so they could}} all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E

5|$|Madden {{said that}} <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> filming in India {{included}} the street noise, {{as well as}} the people's curiosity and hospitality when they saw him producing a camera. The cast and crew were well received by the locals, as was the director who, along with the cast, was invited by Arvind Singh Mewar, the Maharaja of Udaipur, to attend his lavish Diwali celebrations and firework display, as well as attend a royal wedding held at the Rambagh Palace Hotel in Jaipur.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} mathematical <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> chess is the development of algorithms that can play chess. The idea of creating a chess-playing machine dates to the 18thcentury; around 1769, the chess-playing automaton called The Turk became famous before being exposed as a hoax. Serious trials based on automata, such as El Ajedrecista, were too complex and limited to be useful.|$|E

30|$|Small firms {{usually have}} good {{internal}} communications {{and many have}} a dynamic and entrepreneurial management style (Jones and Rowley, 2011). SMEs usually explore new technical spaces. In sum, innovation in small firms can be (more) efficient and effective (Lu and Chen, 2010). On the other hand, many SMEs are not innovative at all. In response to this question, researchers identified key challenges to SMEs innovation including: the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> human resource (proficiency and skill) and learning {{on a small scale}} to increase innovation speed and decrease cost; the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> research and development (R&D) and identifying new emerging technologies; the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> macro-technologies, the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> National Policy and Regulatory Environment; and the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> lack of market information.|$|R
5|$|Parker next {{performed}} {{in a pair of}} low budget movies: Felon and Tunnel Rats. Despite these early light roles, Parker's onscreen charisma and general je ne sais quoi showed, earning Parker comparisons to Paul Newman. In Felon, Parker played a rookie guard dealing with inner turmoil. In 2008's The Secret Life of Bees, Parker played the good-hearted love interest of Alicia Keys' character. Parker's character has to deal with the <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> spurned love. The movie was written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood based on the book of the same name by Sue Monk Kidd.|$|E
5|$|The Allied command {{structure}} in the South West Pacific Area faced the <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> coalition warfare in several ways, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The benefits of the wartime alliances proved to be substantial, but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA proved to be a formative and informative one, with many political and military lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces would fight together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War and the War on Terror.|$|E

50|$|Erik H. Erikson (1902-1994) {{explained}} the challenges throughout the life course. The first {{stage in the}} life course is infancy, where babies learn trust and mistrust. The second stage is toddlerhood where children around {{the age of two}} struggle with the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> autonomy versus doubt. In stage three, preschool, children struggle to understand the difference between initiative and guilt. Stage four, pre-adolescence, children learn about industriousness and inferiority. In the fifth stage called adolescence, teenagers experience the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> gaining identity versus confusion. The sixth stage, young adulthood, is when young people gain insight to life when dealing with the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> intimacy and isolation. In stage seven, or middle adulthood, people experience the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> trying to make a difference (versus self-absorption). In the final stage, stage eight or old age, people are still learning about the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> integrity and despair.|$|R
5|$|The Wyberghs {{were able}} to retain Clifton Hall, despite the <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> the English Civil War, but the house {{was caught up in}} the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the freeway over Vail Pass is also listed as an engineering marvel. One of the <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> this portion is {{the management of the}} wildlife that roams this area. Several parts of the approach to the pass feature large fences that prevent wildlife from crossing the freeway and direct the animals to one of several underpasses. At least one underpass is located along a natural migratory path and has been landscaped to encourage deer to cross.|$|E
