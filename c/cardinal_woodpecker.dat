50|$|The Abyssinian {{woodpecker}} (Dendropicos abyssinicus), {{also known}} as the golden-backed woodpecker or the golden-mantled woodpecker, is a species of bird in the woodpecker family, Picidae. It is native to Africa, where it occurs in Eritrea and Ethiopia. It appears to be a close relative of the <b>cardinal</b> <b>woodpecker</b> Dendropicos fuscescens.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cardinal</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Dendropicos fuscescens) is a {{widespread}} and common resident breeder in much of Sub-Saharan Africa. It occurs {{in a wide range}} of habitats, ranging from dense forest to thorn bush. They are fairly vocal and are easily identified by their call notes. The sexes are distinguishable by their head patterns.|$|E
50|$|It obtains most food by probing and gleaning, {{but also}} hammers dead or {{infected}} wood rather {{more frequently than}} other Campethera species. It feeds mostly on arboreal ants and termites, but also takes millipedes, wood-boring larvae and leaf-feeding moth larvae. It occurs alongside the <b>Cardinal</b> <b>woodpecker</b> which to some extent exploits thinner branches.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} birdlife in the Sauk Valley makes for very {{interesting}} bird watching. The forests and grasslands {{are home to}} most of the birds native to central Minnesota. <b>Cardinals,</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and many songbirds are common. Grouse, pheasant and partridge are some of the more popular gamebirds found near the Sauk. Birds of prey such as various hawks, owls and an occasional bald eagle can also be seen when canoeing the river. Along most of the river it is common to see great blue herons.|$|R
50|$|Vegetation varies {{mostly by}} {{altitude}} and soil type {{and how much}} moisture the area receives. However almost all species are those adapted to desert and semi-desert zones. The highest elevations have pine forests. Wildlife is varied and includes mammals such as badgers, skunks, coyotes, foxes, pumas and other wild cats, deer, raccoons, rabbits, bats and various rodents. Bird species include quail, doves, <b>cardinals,</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> swallows and marine species such as pelicans and seagulls. There are over 850 species of aquatic animals off the coast such as marlin, sailfish, swordfish, tuna, dorado and whales. Many species and subspecies of both plants and animals are endemic only to Baja California.|$|R
50|$|The Eastern Great Lakes lowland {{forests are}} very rich in wildlife. Birds include <b>cardinals,</b> downy <b>woodpecker,</b> wood duck and eastern screech owl. Large mammals {{including}} American black bear (Ursus americanus), moose (Alces alces), and gray wolf (Canis lupus) {{have been removed}} from this ecoregion and remaining mammals include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cardinal</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is {{native to}} {{tropical}} parts of western and central Africa. Its range includes Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cardinal</b> <b>woodpecker</b> often {{occurs in}} small family groups or may join small mixed flocks. Forages {{mainly in the}} lower storeys of trees and among shrubs and vines, on maize stalks and reeds. Pecks rapidly and probes dense vegetation, clambering along and hanging from small twigs. Like other woodpeckers, this species is an insectivore. It is {{frequently}} seen, and regularly drums softly. The call is a high-pitched krrrek-krrrek-krrrek. It nests in a tree hole, unlined apart from wood chippings.|$|E
50|$|The Abyssinian {{woodpecker}} is a {{very small}} woodpecker with a relatively long and broad bill. It has a golden yellow back and mantle with a bright red rump and barred wings and barred tail, the underparts are pale and heavily streaked with black. The head is striped and the male is distinguished by having a red nape and crown. The brown stripe through the eye and the golden mantle separate this species from the related <b>Cardinal</b> <b>Woodpecker.</b> It measured 16 cm in length and weighs 23-26g.|$|E
50|$|The berries ripen in September through October {{and are a}} {{favorite}} among wild bird species including <b>cardinals,</b> mockingbirds, finches, <b>woodpeckers</b> and more. Beautyberry is commonly planted in landscape designs to attract wildlife because of the food source the berries provide and the cover animals get from the shrub itself.|$|R
5000|$|Birds exhibiting genetic xanthochromism, {{especially}} deliberately bred mutations {{of several}} species of parrot in aviculture, are termed [...] "lutinos". Wild birds in which xanthochromism has been recorded include yellow wagtail, wood warbler, Cape May warbler, rose-breasted grosbeak, evening grosbeak, red-bellied woodpecker, scarlet tanager, northern <b>cardinal,</b> great spotted <b>woodpecker,</b> common tailorbird, crimson-breasted shrike, kākāriki and kea.|$|R
50|$|Major {{sources of}} {{predation}} of Mischocyttarus mexicanus cubicola are birds such as wrens, blue jays, yellowthroats, <b>cardinals,</b> mockingbirds, and <b>woodpeckers.</b> Spiders such as Argiope aurantia and Nephila clavipes are also {{known to be}} predators of this species. Ant raids are also common to this species, {{even though it is}} rare that ants will raid a nest that hasn’t already been abandoned. With that said, it is most common that a single ant will encounter a nest and be successfully deterred. Ant species such as Campanotus floridanus, Crematogaster ashmeadi, and Pheidole floridana have been observed to raid live nests and eat the wasp colony’s brood.|$|R
50|$|Stierling's {{woodpecker}} forages for insects, centipedes {{and other}} invertebrates {{in the middle}} and upper parts of the canopy. It mostly searches on branches between 4 and 12 cm in diameter; this may prevent undue competition between it and the <b>cardinal</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (D. fuscescens), which forages mainly on smaller branches and twigs. It sometimes flies into the air to catch winged termites, but it is less adept at this than are some other species of woodpecker. Breeding is thought to take place between July and October, the nest being made in a hole in a tree.|$|E
5000|$|The Greenbelt {{is one of}} {{the most}} biologically diverse places in New York City. It is home to several species of amphibians; such as the eastern redback salamander, the green frog, the American bullfrog, and the grey tree frog; reptiles; such as the eastern garter snake, the eastern box turtle, and the {{northern}} water snake, as well as New York's state reptile, the common snapping turtle. On occasion northern [...] "black" [...] racer and eastern milksnakes are reported here. Both species are threatened elsewhere on Staten Island due to habitat destruction due to development. The Greenbelt provides year-round habitat native mammals like the gray squirrel, eastern chipmunk, eastern cottontail, and the white-tailed deer. Permanent bird residents include the blue jay, northern <b>cardinal,</b> downy <b>woodpecker,</b> and black-capped chickadee, while northern flickers and other migrants use the Greenbelt as a stopover on seasonal migration routes. Raptors such as Cooper's hawks, redtail hawks, and great horned owls also call the greenbelt home. The waterways are rich in fish life, and such species found here include the largemouth bass, bluegill, green sunfish, brown bullhead, black crappie, yellow perch, chain pickerel, as well as several darter species.|$|R
500|$|The {{remaining}} [...] {{were given}} to Pennsylvania and became State Game Lands 252. Many of the 149 concrete bunkers remain, but it is [...] "a diverse mix of mature forest, impoundments, and brushy thickets, {{as well as a}} local hotspot for a variety of birds during migration". The watershed is a haven for wildlife. Common animals in the game lands include painted and common snapping turtles, muskrats, frogs, eastern cottontails, red foxes, and white-tailed deer, while birds include golden-winged, hooded, and blue-winged warblers, red-shouldered hawks, wood ducks, tundra swans, pied-billed grebes, American bitterns, herons, and belted kingfishers. The first barn owls to be banded in Lycoming County were in a barn near Elimsport in 2006. Gray squirrels, groundhogs, raccoons, crows, red-tailed hawks, downy <b>woodpeckers,</b> <b>cardinals,</b> blue jays, American robins, nuthatches, titmice, and sparrows are also found in the White Deer Hole Creek watershed.|$|R
50|$|Cardinal Beaufort was foaled in 1802 at Lord Egremont's estate Petworth House. Cardinal Beaufort's sire, Gohanna, {{was also}} owned by Egremont and was second to Waxy in the 1793 Epsom Derby. In {{addition}} to Cardinal Beaufort, Gohanna also sired Election, {{the winner of}} the 1807 Derby. Cardinal Beaufort's dam, Colibri (foaled in 1793), was a full sister to the mare Young Camilla, the grandam of St. Leger winner Altisidora and Epsom Oaks winner Manuella. Colibri was bred by Lord Egremont and was sired by the successful stallion <b>Woodpecker.</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Beaufort was Colibri's third foal and one of two sired by Gohanna, the other being Canopus. She produced four foals, dying at ten-years of age in 1803 two weeks after foaling Canopus. Canopus later sired an unnamed mare (the Canopus Mare) that produced the Derby winners Lap-dog and Spaniel.|$|R

5000|$|In the Desert Zone, {{guests can}} see animals found in deserts {{from all around}} the world. A mixed species exhibit with the zoo's African crested porcupines Jack and Blanche and two female Von der Decken's {{hornbills}} is in the Desert Hall. The Desert Zone also has a sand cat, two bat-eared foxes, a group of meerkats, and a colony of short-tailed leaf-nosed bats. A red-tailed boa, gila monsters, and common spider tortoises are some of the reptiles in the Desert Zone. In spring of 2016, the zoo's first spider tortoise hatched. The Desert Zone also features a Sonaran Desert exhibit. the Sonaran Desert Exhibit includes white-winged doves, <b>cardinals,</b> a Gila <b>woodpecker,</b> and masked bobwites. The Sonaran desert Exhibit also is the home of the desert tortoises during the winter. The Desert Zone is also home to a group of burrowing owls. The zoo has been successful in breeding these owls with their first brood hatching in June 2015 and their second in May 2016 and third in May 2017 ...|$|R
