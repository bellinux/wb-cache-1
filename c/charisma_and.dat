5|$|Mother Gothel {{has been}} mostly well {{received}} by film critics, who enjoyed the character's humor, complexity, <b>charisma</b> <b>and</b> showmanship, dubbing her a scene stealer, while praising Murphy's performance enthusiastically. However, some critics felt that Gothel {{was simply too}} passive – a weaker, less intimidating Disney villainess than Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty (1959) and Cruella de Vil from One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).|$|E
5|$|Promoted by {{the music}} press for a melodic pop-influenced sound, the Strokes {{garnered}} critical acclaim and commercial attention. Is This It was praised for its <b>charisma</b> <b>and</b> rhythm, which often referenced the works of 1970s garage rock bands. The record is considered crucial {{in the development of}} other alternative bands and of the post-millennial music industry. It has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 2000s and of all time.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great <b>charisma</b> <b>and</b> force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.|$|E

5|$|By June, {{the band}} had {{performed}} another Italian tour (the third that year) {{and wanted to}} start recording new material (some of which ended up on Hammill's 1973 solo album Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night). However, the combination of working for too long without a break, combined {{with a lack of}} support from Stratton-Smith and <b>Charisma</b> <b>and</b> continued financial difficulties caused the band to implode, and Hammill left to pursue a solo career in mid-1972.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1906, most {{leaders from}} Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission. These {{missions}} were largely composed of immigrant or ethnic groups. The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of growth for the movement, since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate {{that had already been}} taking root in those areas. Other new missions were based on preachers who had <b>charisma</b> <b>and</b> energy. Nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants and the poor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the ACLU, Baldwin {{continued}} as its leader. His <b>charisma</b> <b>and</b> energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks. Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a very small salary. The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, but it was not particularly democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state. Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the Garland Fund.|$|E

Determined to keep Sideshow Bob from becoming mayor, Bart and Lisa decide to campaign for Mayor Quimby.

5|$|Inspired by the Evil Queen in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Lady Tremaine in Disney's Cinderella (1950), Gothel was {{developed}} by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard into a much more complex villain than the fairy tale witch upon whom she is based because the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, <b>charisma</b> <b>and</b> intelligence as opposed to sorcery in order to survive. The film's most difficult character to develop, Gothel's exotic appearance, whose beauty, dark curly hair and voluptuous figure were deliberately drawn {{to serve as a}} foil to Rapunzel's, was inspired by both Murphy and American singer Cher.|$|E

Parker's character has to deal with the challenges of spurned love. The movie was written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood based on the book of the same name by Sue Monk Kidd.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} two main {{characters}} was planned {{since the beginning}} of the game's development. Nomura tried to create a contrast between Laguna's and Squall's occupations; thus, Laguna became a soldier with a light-hearted <b>charisma,</b> <b>and</b> Squall became a reserved mercenary student. The designers intended Laguna to be more similar to the previous protagonists in the series to complement Squall, who is different from previous main characters. Laguna is ranked seventh in Electronic Gaming Monthlys list of the top ten video game politicians.|$|E
5|$|Eve {{suffered}} from low viewership {{in spite of}} its high ratings among young Hispanic women; it was canceled following UPN's merger with The WB Television Network (The WB) to launch The CW in 2006. The series' cancellation, along with that of other black sitcoms, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African American characters and the number of roles for African American actors on television. Critical response to Eve was mixed; some praised its inclusion as a part of UPN's line-up of black sitcoms, but others felt Eve lacked <b>charisma,</b> <b>and</b> that the series was inferior to other black sitcoms. Despite the negative reception, the show and Eve received several award nominations. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video.|$|E
5|$|Well {{established}} in the imperial capital, Honório Hermeto campaigned in 1829 to become a general deputy (member of the Chamber of Deputies, the national lower house) as a representative for his native Minas Gerais. He was elected to {{a seat in the}} legislature for the term beginning April 1830. He {{became a member of the}} Liberal Party, which stood in opposition to PedroI and his policies. As a general deputy, Honório Hermeto had an unobtrusive role for the first couple of years, having been overshadowed by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, the leader of the deputies representing Minas Gerais. Short, slim and with a speech impediment, the dark-haired Honório Hermeto appeared an unimpressive figure at first glance. Like his father, he was headstrong, opinionated and often scathing. However, he had self-confidence and a powerful <b>charisma,</b> <b>and</b> was energetic, intelligent, perspicacious and a natural born leader.|$|E

5|$|Goebbels {{first took}} an {{interest}} in Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1924. In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began {{in the wake of his}} failed attempt to seize power in the Beer Hall Putsch of November 8–9, 1923. The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda. Hitler was sentenced to five years prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year. Goebbels was drawn to the NSDAP mostly because of Hitler's <b>charisma</b> <b>and</b> commitment to his beliefs. He joined the NSDAP around this time, becoming member number 8762. In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to Karl Kaufmann, who was Gauleiter (NSDAP district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with Gregor Strasser, a leading Nazi organizer in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and to do secretarial work for the regional party offices. He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for Rhineland-Westphalia. Members of Strasser's northern branch of the NSDAP, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich. Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.|$|E
5|$|Tychus J. Findlay is {{a marine}} and past {{associate}} of Raynor's who becomes {{affiliated with the}} Raiders. He appears in the novel Heaven's Devil and in Wings of Liberty {{as one of the}} main characters. Findlay is known for his <b>charisma</b> <b>and</b> toughness, and by his friendship with James Raynor. He is voiced by Neil Kaplan. Findlay is introduced in the cinematic trailer for StarCraft II, in which he is shown being encased into powered combat armour. According to Blizzard's Nick Carpenter, the marine in the trailer lacked any identity but eventually evolved into Findlay, allowing the cinematic team to flesh out the trailer with the character's personality. Findlay is surrounded by rumours regarding his reputation; on the one hand, he is held as a loyal soldier who risks his life to save his comrades, while on the other, he is regarded as an amoral scoundrel. Findlay and Raynor fought together for the Confederacy several years prior to the events of StarCraft before becoming outlaws; Findlay was eventually captured and incarcerated. By Wings of Liberty, Findlay escapes from prison, tracks down Raynor, and recruits him to work for the secretive Moebius Foundation, where, according to Metzen, Findlay acts as the metaphorical devil on Raynor's shoulder.|$|E
