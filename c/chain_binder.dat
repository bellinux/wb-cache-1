50|$|Snow pusher designs vary {{across the}} industry. They are {{typically}} between 3 ft m and 5.5 ft m high and range from 6 ft m to 40 ft m wide. Snow pushers are typically mounted on wheel loaders, skid steers, or backhoes. For wheel loaders and backhoes, they are mounted using a universal mounting system {{that consists of}} a set of posts (or plates) between which the machine bucket is placed. Chains are attached to the snow pusher and the bucket and tightened using a <b>chain</b> <b>binder.</b> This system allows for snow pushers to be mounted on any machine without regard for brand-specific mounting brackets. Skid steer loaders can use the universal mounting system; however, most manufacturers typically offer skid steer snow pushers with a universally accepted quick-attach system. Though the snow pusher might seem like a simple product, there are many variations across the industry in areas such as moldboard height and angle, sidewall support system (post, wedge, or unsupported), trip edge system, shoe thickness, and rubber cutting edge quality, to name a few.|$|E
50|$|The Friedrich Binder {{company was}} founded by the skilled <b>chain</b> maker, Friedrich <b>Binder,</b> in Mönsheim in March 1910. For {{more than half a}} century, {{jewellery}} chains were predominantly hand crafted and a variety of chains were produced as piece work for the neighboring Pforzheim jewellery industry.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{battery separator}} for alkaline battery cells has low resistance to electrolyte ion transfer and high resistance to electrode ion transfer. The separator is formed by applying an improved coating to an electrolyte absorber. The absorber, preferably, is a flexible, fibrous, and porous substrate that is resistant to strong alkali and oxidation. The coating composition includes an admixture of a polymeric binder, a hydrolyzable polymeric ester and inert fillers. The coating composition is substantially free of reactive fillers and plasticizers commonly employed as porosity promoting agents in separator coatings. When the separator is immersed in electrolyte, the polymeric ester {{of the film}} coating reacts with the electrolyte forming a salt and an alcohol. The alcohol goes into solution with the electrolyte while the salt imbibes electrolyte into the coating composition. When the salt is formed, it expands the polymeric <b>chains</b> of the <b>binder</b> to provide a film coating substantially permeable to electrolyte ion transfer but relatively impermeable to electrode ion transfer during use...|$|R
40|$|Stretchable {{conductive}} ink {{is a key}} enabler for stretchable electronics. This thesis research focuses {{on the development of}} a new stretchable and screen printable {{conductive ink}}. After print and cure, this ink would be capable of being stretched by at least 500 cycles at 20 % strain without increasing its resistance by more than 30 times the original resistance, while maintaining electrical and mechanical integrity. For a stretchable and screen-printable conductive ink, the correct morphology of the metal powder selected and the ability of the binder to be stretched after the sintering process, are both indispensable. This research has shown that a bi-modal mixture of fine and large-diameter silver flakes will improve stretchability. While the smaller flakes increase the conductivity and lower the sintering temperature, the larger flake particles promote ohmic connectivity during stretching. The bi-modal flake distribution increases connection points while enhancing packing density and lowering the thermal activation barrier. The polymer binder phase plays a crucial role in offering stretchability to the stretchable conductive inks. The silver flakes by themselves are not stretchable but they are contained within a stretchable binder system. The research demonstrates that commonly used printable ink binder when combined with large-chain polymers through a process known as ‘elastomeric chain polymerization’ will enable the conductive ink to become more stretchable. This research has shown that the new stretchable and screen printable silver conductive ink developed based upon the two insights mentioned above; (1) bi modal flakes to improve ohmic connectivity during stretching and (2) elastomeric <b>chain</b> polymerized <b>binder</b> system which could stretch even after the ink is sintered to the substrate, can exhibit an ink stretchability of at least 500 cycles at 20 % strain while increasing the resistance by less than 30 times the original resistance. Wavy print patterns can enhance the stretchability of stretchable conductors. The research also demonstrates that FEA modeling, simulating the total principal strain on the printed patterns, can be used to estimate the comparative resistance changes caused by stretching and these changes can be explained by some basic equations from Percolation Theory...|$|R
