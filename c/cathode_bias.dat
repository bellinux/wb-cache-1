50|$|Moody Amps were notable at {{the time}} for their styling and their {{predominantly}} <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> circuits. A good summary of their valve (or tube) guitar amplifiers {{can be found at}} this website.|$|E
25|$|Later circuits, after tubes {{were made}} with heaters {{isolated}} from their <b>cathodes,</b> used <b>cathode</b> <b>biasing,</b> avoiding {{the need for a}} separate negative power supply. For <b>cathode</b> <b>biasing,</b> a relatively low-value resistor is connected between the cathode and ground. This makes the cathode positive with respect to the grid, which is at ground potential for DC.|$|R
50|$|Unusual for a Fender amplifier, the Deluxe (models 5D3 and 5E3) {{has both}} a feedback-less and <b>cathode</b> <b>biased</b> output stage (a {{distinctive}} combination it shares with the Vox AC30). Most push-pull Fenders use feedback tapped from the output transformer's speaker winding to enable more headroom before power stage distortion starts, {{and in the}} quest for more volume use the more efficient negative voltage biasing (which also runs the power valves at a cooler temperature). These aspects of the circuit make a key contribution to the complex, wild and ragged sound of an overdriven 5E3 Deluxe, especially in comparison to other Fender amplifiers. The earlier 5C3 model did use feedback although it too was <b>cathode</b> <b>biased.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Early sets used a {{grid bias battery}} or [...] "C" [...] battery {{which was}} {{connected}} to provide a negative voltage. Since virtually no current flows through a tube's grid connection, these batteries had very low drain and lasted the longest. Even after AC power supplies became commonplace, some radio sets continued to be built with C batteries, as they would almost never need replacing. However more modern circuits were designed using <b>cathode</b> <b>biasing,</b> {{eliminating the need for}} a third power supply voltage; this became practical with tubes using indirect heating of the cathode.|$|R
5000|$|To {{assure that}} proper <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> is maintained, many non-A.V.C. volume {{controls}} are usually {{equipped with a}} [...] "stop" [...] that maintains {{a small amount of}} resistance between the center wiper and the high end connection.|$|E
50|$|The Fender Tremolux was {{a guitar}} {{amplifier}} made by Fender. It {{was introduced in}} the summer of 1955 with a rated power output of 15 watts, <b>cathode</b> <b>bias,</b> two 6V6 output tubes, and a 5V4 tube rectifier. The Tremolux was the first Fender amp with a built in effect, tremolo.|$|E
50|$|Battery bias, however, is not self-adjusting, {{and does}} not {{accommodate}} differences between a new tube and one that has aged, differences between various tubes of the same type, or substitutions that may be made in tube type by repair technicians. <b>Cathode</b> <b>bias</b> automatically accounts for all these possibilities. It {{is inherent in the}} technique that the bias level is set by the operation of each individual tube.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The density {{collapse}} {{was observed}} in the improved confinement mode sustained by the hot <b>cathode</b> <b>biasing</b> in Tohoku University Heliac (TU-Heliac). The density profiles showed the steep gradient around the core plasma region before the collapse. The steep density profile collapsed accompanied with the bursting high frequency fluctuation (100 < f < 500 kHz), which had m = 2 ~ 3 poloidal mode number and the frequency agreed well with the E x B plasma rotating frequency. After the collapse the steep gradient in the density profile disappeared and the density outside the core region increased in the level consistent with the decrease of the core region. 1...|$|R
50|$|The use of grid leak bias {{competed with}} use of a {{so-called}} C battery for providing a fixed negative voltage on the grid. When vacuum tubes came to be constructed with cathodes electrically isolated from their filaments, it became possible to use <b>cathode</b> <b>biasing.</b> This involved use of a resistor from the cathode to ground, which provides better control of anode current through negative feedback. This method also requires a relatively large capacitor across the cathode resistor to avoid losing AC gain (through negative feedback), {{and the cost of}} a sufficiently sized capacitor was an issue in the pre-war years, as capacitors had low capacity per volume and per cost.|$|R
5000|$|Though widely {{believed}} to be a class A amplifier, the AC30 is in fact class AB. [...] It uses a quartet of cathode-biased EL-84 output tubes in push-pull configuration. The high bias condition is believed by some to be the source of the amplifier's famous immediate response and [...] "jangly" [...] high-end, though the lack of negative feedback, minimal preamp circuit, simple low loss tone stack, and the use of <b>cathode</b> <b>biasing</b> on the output stage play at least as large a role, if not larger. [...] The Celestion [...] "Blue" [...] speakers that are integral to the AC30 also contribute much {{to the sound of the}} unit. The two 12" [...] 15-watt speakers, often overdriven and at the brink of their power handling capability, provide a cutting mid-range speaker sound that is immediate and sharp and a distinction from the Marshall or Fender-style amplifier.|$|R
50|$|In some designs, the {{degenerative}} feedback {{inherent in}} <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> may be desirable. In this case, two carefully designed successive stages may be employed, {{such that the}} distortion introduced by the first stage is exactly cancelled by that introduced in the second. This technique is not recommended, as the design considerations become very complex. Other degenerative feedback techniques are easier to design, and should be used.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike many {{amplifiers}} {{marketed as}} [...] "Class A", the Prosonic truly {{functions as a}} Class A power amplifier in the [...] "A" [...] position. Class A refers {{to the amount of}} current flowing through the power tubes with zero audio signal, with Class A meaning maximum current flow even with zero signal. This makes the tubes run hotter, and gives the power section even more gain at the cost of tube life and noise. The Class-A designation for guitar amplifiers is often a misnomer; Few amps outside of the heralded Vox AC-30, also with <b>cathode</b> <b>bias,</b> operate in a true Class-A mode it only did so up to ≈21 watts RMS. While the Prosonic featured <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> in the Class A mode and fixed bias in the Class AB mode, not all class A tube amplifiers are cathode-biased, and not all fixed biased amplifiers are Class AB. Fixed bias amps, however, require lower B+ Voltages to stay within the Plate Dissipation of the power tubes used; Cathode biasing [...] "throws away" [...] this voltage using conventional Higher Voltage power supplies.|$|E
5000|$|To {{establish}} <b>cathode</b> <b>bias,</b> {{a resistor}} is placed between the emitting element, or cathode {{and the negative}} return of the [...] "B" [...] or HT supply. Current drawn through this resistor by tube conduction places the cathode slightly more positive than the negative return. The grid input is returned directly to the negative supply, causing it to be negative {{with respect to the}} cathode. Thus, changes in tube conduction are automatically compensated by changes in bias.|$|E
40|$|Substrate {{bias and}} specimen-to-target {{distance}} are two important parameters {{that can be}} manipulated during preparation of TiN films using a cathodic are ion plating system. Experiments were carried out to deposit TiN on a type 304 stainless steel for different <b>cathode</b> <b>biases</b> ranging from 100 to 300 V and specimen-to-target distances from 150 to 175 mm. Characterization of the microstructure of the TiN-coated steel was done both by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The {{results show that the}} thickness of the TiN coatings increases with decreasing specimen-to-target distance. The TiN coatings exhibit a tapered columnar microstructure and the cone shape of the grains is influenced by the substrate bias. The resistance to deformation of the TiN coatings was evaluated by a Vickers microhardness indenter. It is found that the hardness of the coatings, ranging from 2200 +/- 40 to 1880 +/- 10, decreases with specimen-to-target distance for different substrate biases ranging from 100 to 300 V.

40|$|Large‐signal time‐domain {{modeling}} (simulation) of rf glow discharges is a {{very useful}} and potentially accurate tool {{for the study of}} low‐pressure (50 – 500 ‐mT) gaseous electronics at high frequencies. Unfortunately, the computational limitations imposed for stability, accuracy, and efficiency can often hinder the production of useful, cost‐effective results. This paper describes a self‐consistent argon rf glow‐discharge simulation at 13. 56 MHz for equal‐ and unequal‐area parallel‐plate electrode geometries. Some of the numerical problems associated with this type of simulation are identified and the numerical methods used to overcome them are described. To illustrate the usefulness of this modeling scheme, the plasma potential and the <b>cathode</b> dc <b>bias</b> are examined as functions of electrode area ratio and rf power...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{problem is}} a slight {{reduction}} in gain. The <b>cathode,</b> or <b>bias</b> resistor appears in series with the plate, or load resistor. The bias voltage must be subtracted from the total [...] "B" [...] or HT voltage in gain calculations. In most circuits, this problem is easily overcome by selecting a load impedance at least two orders of magnitude greater than the bias resistance. For example, a 1K bias resistor will have virtually no effect if the load impedance is at least 100K. These values were, in fact, used by Leo Fender in many of his guitar amplifier designs. Refer to [...] "The Tube Amp Book" [...] by Gerald Weber, schematic section.|$|R
50|$|In {{electronics}} <b>cathode</b> <b>bias,</b> {{also called}} self-bias, is a circuit used with amplifying vacuum tubes (valves) such as triodes, tetrodes and pentodes {{to provide a}} steady negative DC bias voltage on the control grid electrode of the tube, to set the operating point. It consists of a resistor connected between the tube's cathode and ground, in parallel with a bypass capacitor. Used with indirectly-heated tubes, {{it is one of}} the most widely used biasing circuits in vacuum tube electronic equipment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cathode</b> <b>bias</b> is {{also used}} to achieve phase inversion. In a more simple circuit, which has less than unity gain, the cathode and plate {{resistors}} are made equal. In accordance with Kirchhoff's law, the current through both resistors will be equal, thus the voltage across them will also be equal. As the plate becomes more negative, the cathode will become more positive, and conversely. The resulting signals are capacitively coupled to any succeeding stages, providing a pair of signals 180° out of phase.|$|E
50|$|This scheme {{inherently}} introduces dynamic, even harmonic distortion. As {{the input}} signal becomes more positive, cathode current increases, increasing bias and reducing gain. As the input signal becomes more negative, cathode current decreases, decreasing bias and increasing gain. The {{result is a}} plate signal with positive excursions greater than the negative input and negative excursions smaller than the positive input. It must be borne {{in mind that the}} input and output signals are ideally exactly out of phase. Since <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> is normally employed at audio or very low radio frequencies, issues such as transit time and interelectrode capacitance may be disregarded and the ideal assumed.|$|E
50|$|A typical triode audio power {{amplifier}} {{will have a}} driver that provides voltage gain, coupled to a triode (like 2A3 and 300B) or a pentode or kinkless tetrode such as EL34 or KT88 connected as a triode, connected to the loudspeaker through an audio transformer in a common cathode arrangement. The triode is biased to Class A operation by applying a suitable negative bias voltage to its input control grid (see diagram), or by raising the <b>cathode</b> potential with <b>biasing</b> components.|$|R
5000|$|Vox {{entered the}} [...] "lunchbox" [...] amp market in 2009 when it {{introduced}} the Night Train (NT15H) head. This compact, all valve amp is a 15W head with two 12AX7 preamp tubes, {{a pair of}} push-pull EL-84 valves in its power section, and a solid state rectifier. It uses a cathodyne splitter, and its power section is <b>cathode</b> <b>biased.</b> The amp is solidly constructed on a black steel chassis with a bright mirror chrome finish, diamond-perforated steel tube cage, giving it a physical appearance reminiscent of a lunchbox (some comparisons to a toaster have been made as well). The NT15H also set the cosmetic and operational template for two additional releases, also all valve heads, that book-ended its output power: the 2W Lil Night Train (NT2H) in 2010, which uses two 12AX7 preamp tubes and a 12AU7 dual triode as its power section, and the 50W Night Train 50 (NT50H) in 2011, a two channel head with four 12AX7 preamp tubes {{and a pair of}} EL-34 valves in its power section. All models feature the ability to choose between the familiar [...] "chimey" [...] Vox voice and a high gain voice that bypasses the EQ section, via the Bright/Thick switch. Note though that each Night Train model's feature set also provides some unique capability apart from its siblings. For example, the NT15H output power can be switched between 15W pentode and 7.5W triode modes. The NT2H provides a headphone/line out jack with on-board speaker emulation (for practice or direct recording use). Lastly, the NT50H offers two channels by adding a second,optionally foot-switchable, higher gain [...] "Girth" [...] channel, a [...] "Tone Cut" [...] control and a [...] "Tight" [...] switch in its master section, plus a bypassable, JFET-driven effects loop. All models were designed for use with most any 8 ohm or 16 ohm cabinet, although Vox also offers a matching cabinet (NT15H/V112NT, NT2H/V110NT, NT50H/V212NT) for each model.|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} for {{spinning}} unmagnetized plasma is demonstrated experimentally. Plasma is confined by an axisymmetric multi-cusp magnetic field and <b>biased</b> <b>cathodes</b> {{are used to}} drive currents and impart a torque in the magnetized edge. Measurements show that flow viscously couples momentum from the magnetized edge (where the plasma viscosity is small) into the unmagnetized core (where the viscosity is large) and that the core rotates as a solid body. To be effective, collisional viscosity must overcome the ion-neutral drag due to charge exchange collisions...|$|R
5000|$|During November 1954, Fender {{introduced}} the newly designed 5D6 Bassman amplifier offering four ten inch speakers and was designed utilizing two rectifier tubes. The 5D6 {{was a major}} departure from the earlier 5B6 Fender Bassman model. Designed by Freddie Tavares, longtime R&D man at Fender, the new circuit included two rectifier tubes and {{became known as the}} Dual Rectifier Bassman. Instead of the single 15" [...] speaker, four 10" [...] Jensen Alnico P10R speakers were used. The circuit had two innovations: a fixed bias for the power tubes, which increased power in comparison to the earlier <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> design, and a cathodyne phase inverter, using half of the 12AX7 tube and allowing a third gain stage on the other half.|$|E
50|$|A {{different}} approach, using a Variac or a power scaling circuit, {{reduces the}} B+ supply voltage {{available to the}} power tubes thus producing power tube distortion at a reduced level such that all available output power {{is sent to the}} guitar speaker. The Variac method is not without risk, as the reduced heater voltage applied to the tubes can damage the filament and/or cathode if not operated within the manufacturer's specifications. In a power scaling circuit, by decreasing just the B+ plate voltage, the <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> and screen grid voltage decrease proportionately, while the filament voltage stays constant. However the term power attenuator may be a misnomer for this type of power control because lowering B+ voltage tends to increase distortion, whereas according to convention, an attenuator should not introduce distortion.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Vox {{introduced}} {{a new series of}} amplifier called the AC30 Custom Classic. It claims to combine attributes of the original AC30 with what Vox sales literature refers to as a [...] "boutique" [...] of features.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} of the coupling of an electron beam into a magnetically confined plasma have been undertaken at the Marshall Space Flight Center using the Marshall Magnetic Mirror (M 3) system. The M 3 system is composed of the following: two magnet coils; a cylindrical vacuum vessel; microwave source; and electron beam source. The magnet coils, which form the magnetic mirror, have an inner diameter of 25. 4 cm and an outer diameter of 50. 8 cm. The coils are composed of 9 coil segments with 33 turns in each segment. Each coil segment is connected in series. To create the target plasma, a 2 kW microwave source (2. 45 gHz) is coupled into the vacuum chamber via waveguide. The electron beam source is a hollow cathode device created by the EPL Corporation. The hollow cathode is capable of producing a 50 amp beam with a pulse length of 1 second. It is also capable of continuous operation at 5 amps. The hollow cathode is mounted {{on one end of}} the cylindrical vacuum vessel 24 cm outside of a magnet coil.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the XENON 100 data analyses {{used to assess the}} target-intrinsic background sources radon (^ 222 Rn), thoron (^ 220 Rn) and krypton (^ 85 Kr). We detail the event selections of high-energy alpha particles and decay-specific delayed coincidences. We derive distributions of the individual radionuclides inside the detector and quantify their abundances during the main three science runs of the experiment over a period of ∼ 4 years, from January 2010 to January 2014. We compare our results to external measurements of radon emanation and krypton concentrations where we find good agreement.

40|$|Chemical effects also {{contribute}} to trench formation. For example, in 20 and 50 % C 12 plasmas, trenches of different depths were formed on wafers etched at the same time. There was a correlation between the trench depth and the concentrations of both reactant' and dopant. Despite the lower <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> in 50 % C 12, compared with 20 % C 12 the trenches were deeper after RIE in 50 % C 12. In 100 % CI~, however, the lower <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> {{seems to be the}} dominant factor; trenches were shallow and the same for all the arsenic-doped wafers despite the higher reactant supply. The authors cannot explain the results obtained in the CC 14 plas-mas; the extent of trenching followed no consistent pattern with respect to <b>cathode</b> <b>bias,</b> reactant supply, or dopant concentration. Conclusions Doping of silicon with arsenic increases the chemical component of etching relat ive to the ion-assisted com-ponent when reactive ion etching silicon in chlorinated plasmas. As the chemical component becomes more important, the dependence of etch rate on temperature becomes more pronounced and etch profiles become more isotropic. The exact dependencies of etch rate and etch profile on temperature, reactant concentration, reactant flow, and wafer load are different for CC 14 and C 12 plasmas, but both plasmas exhibit a combination of free radical and ion-assisted reactions as the arsenic concentration exceeds 102 ~ 3. The mechanism by which arsenic enhances the re-action rate of silicon is in question. The etch rate does not correlate with free electron density which could enhance C 1 adsorption. Clustering, which is operative in the As-Si system above about 1020 /cm 3 As, coincides with the onset of etch rate acceleration, but the role that a cluster would p lay in etching needs further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Polarized {{electron}} beams {{generated by}} DC guns are routinely available at several accelerators including JLAB, Mainz and SLAC. These guns operate with a <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> {{on the order}} of - 100 kV. To minimize space charge effects, relatively long bunches are generated at the gun and then compressed longitudinally external to the gun just before and during initial acceleration. For linear colliders, this compression is accomplished using a combination of rf bunchers. For the basic design of the International Linear Collider (ILC), a 120 kV DC photocathode gun is used to produce a series of nanosecond bunches that are each compressed by two sub-harmonic bunchers (SHBs) followed by an L-band buncher and capture section. The longitudinal bunching process results in a significantly higher emittance than produced by the gun alone. While high-energy experiments using polarized beams are not generally sensitive to the source emittance, there are several benefits to a lower source emittance including a simpler more efficient injector system and a lower radiation load during transport especially at bends as at the damping ring. For the ILC, the SHBs could be eliminated if the voltage of the gun is raised sufficiently. Simulations using the General Particle Tracer (GPT) package indicate that a <b>cathode</b> <b>bias</b> voltage of {ge} 200 kV should allow both SHBs to be operated at 433 or even 650 MHz, while {ge} 500 kV would be required to eliminate the SHBs altogether. Simulations can be used to determine the minimum emittance possible if the injector is designed for a given increased voltage. A possible alternative to the DC gun is an rf gun. Emittance compensation, routinely used with rf guns, is discussed for higher-voltage DC guns...|$|E

The tether system comprises a deployer from which a conductive tether having a bare segment extends upward from space object. The positively biased anode end of tether collects electrons from the ionosphere as space object moves in direction across the Earth's magnetic field. These electrons flow through the conductive structure of the tether to the power system interface, where it supplies power to an associated load, not shown.

5000|$|Diffusion Capacitance is the {{capacitance}} due to transport of charge carriers between two terminals of a device, for example, {{the diffusion of}} carriers from anode to <b>cathode</b> in forward <b>bias</b> mode of a diode or from emitter to baseforward-biased junction for a transistor. In a semiconductor device with a current flowing through it (for example, an ongoing transport of charge by diffusion) at a particular moment there is necessarily some charge {{in the process of}} transit through the device. If the applied voltage changes to a different value and the current changes to a different value, a different amount of charge will be in transit in the new circumstances. The change in the amount of transiting charge divided by the change in the voltage causing it is the diffusion capacitance. The adjective [...] "diffusion" [...] is used because the original use of this term was for junction diodes, where the charge transport was via the diffusion mechanism. See Fick's laws of diffusion.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed that {{thermionic}} current flow through a plasma {{is limited by}} a "space-charge limited" (SCL) cathode sheath that consumes the hot <b>cathode's</b> negative <b>bias</b> and accelerates upstream ions into the cathode. Here, we formulate a fundamentally different current-limited mode. In the "inverse" mode, the sheath potentials at both electrodes are positive, trapping the ions in the plasma. The bias is consumed by the anode sheath. There is no potential gradient in the neutral plasma region from resistivity or presheath. The inverse cathode sheath potential phi_inv pulls some thermoelectrons back to the cathode, attenuating the current by a factor exp(qe*phi_inv/Temit). Thermoelectrons entering the zero-field region that undergo collisions may also {{be sent back to}} the cathode. In planar geometry, the plasma density linearly decreases across the gap and the current attenuation factor from collisions is emfp/(Lp+emfp) in terms of the mean free path and plasma length. A continuum kinetic planar plasma diode simulation model is set up to compare the properties of current modes with classical, conventional SCL, and inverse cathode sheaths. SCL modes can exist only if charge-exchange collisions are turned off in the virtual cathode region to prevent ion trapping. With the collisions, the current-limited equilibrium is inverse. Inverse operating modes should therefore be present or possible in many plasma devices that rely on hot cathodes. Evidence from past experiments is discussed. The inverse mode may offer opportunities to minimize sputtering and power consumption that were not previously explored due to the common assumption of SCL sheaths.
