5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium.

40|$|Reactions of β-diketiminato {{magnesium}} and <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrides</b> with 1 atm of CO {{result in}} a reductive coupling process to produce the corresponding derivatives of the cis-ethenediolate dianion. Computational (DFT) analysis of this process mediated by Ca, Sr, and Ba highlights a common mechanism and a facility for the reaction that is enhanced by increasing alkaline earth atomic weight. Reaction of CO with PhSiH 3 {{in the presence of}} the magnesium or <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrides</b> results in catalytic reduction to methylsilane and methylene silyl ether products, respectively. These reactions are proposed to ensue via the interception of initially formed group 2 formyl intermediates, an inference which is confirmed by a DFT analysis of the magnesium-centered reaction. The computational results identify the rate-determining process, requiring traversal of a 33. 9 kcal mol- 1 barrier, as a Mg-H/C-O σ-bond metathesis reaction, associated with the ultimate cleavage of the C-O bond. The carbonylation reactivity is extended to a variety of magnesium and calcium amides. With primary amido complexes, which for calcium include a derivative of the parent [NH 2]- anion, CO insertion is facile and ensues with subsequent nitrogen-to-carbon migration of hydrogen to yield a variety of dinuclear and, in one case, trinuclear formamidate species. The generation of initial carbenic carbamoyl intermediates is strongly implicated through the isolation of the CO insertion product of a magnesium N-methylanilide derivative. These observations are reinforced by a DFT analysis of the calcium-centered reaction with aniline, which confirms the exothermicity of the formamidate formation (ΔH = - 67. 7 kcal mol- 1). Stoichiometric reduction of the resultant magnesium and calcium formamidates with pinacolborane results in the synthesis of the corresponding N-borylated methylamines. This takes place via a sequence of reactions initiated through the generation of amidatohydridoborate intermediates and a cascade of reactivity that is analogous to that previously reported for the deoxygenative hydroboration of organic isocyanates catalyzed by the same magnesium hydride precatalyst. Although a sequence of amine formylation and deoxygenation may be readily envisaged for the catalytic utilization of CO as a C 1 source in the production of methylamines, our observations demonstrate that competitive amine-borane dehydrocoupling is too facile under the conditions of 1 atm of CO employed...|$|R

The catalytic performance of the resulting catalyst samples in the hydrodechlorination (HDCl) of 1, 2 -dichloroethane at 220 ºC was investigated, to gain understanding of metal alloying phenomena governing the variation in ethene selectivity with time on stream (TOS). Metal dispersion was also investigated by O 2 chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). PtCuCaH(b) catalyst, synthesised by reduction with CaH 2 at 450 ºC, showed a high selectivity towards ethene in comparison with that of catalysts synthesised by reduction with either NaH or hydrogen. In view of the chemisorption and TEM results, the significant high selectivity of this catalyst towards ethene was attributed {{to the fact that}} reduction by CaH 2 enhanced alloying of Pt and Cu. On the other hand, the ethene selectivity of PtCuCaH(b) catalyst did not show any variation with TOS, but reached a steady state at early TOS.

[...] Triphenylmethane is significantly more acidic than most other hydrocarbons because the trityl anion is stabilized by extensive delocalization over three phenyl rings.

However, its dehydrogenation temperature 623 K is too high for any mobile applications. By addition of 10 mol of NbF 5 into Ca BH 4 2 MgH 2, a decrease of the dehydrogenation onset temperature by 120 K is observed. In {{order to understand the}} reasons behind this desorption temperature decrement two sets of samples [Ca BH 4 2 MgH 2 and Ca BH 4 2 MgH 2 0. 1 NbF 5] in different hydrogenation states, were prepared. The structural investigation of the above mentioned sets of samples by means of volumetric measurements, anomalous small angle X ray scattering ASAXS and X ray absorption spectroscopy XAS is reported here.

Results from Ca ASAXS indicate Ca containing nanostructures in the Ca RHC 0. 1 NbF 5 samples to be 50 finer compared to those without additive.

The three compounds exhibit C(5 v) equilibrium conformations in their ground states. For CpBeH the agreement between the calculated geometry and that determined by MW spectroscopy is excellent. CpMgH and CpCaH can be viewed almost as the result of the interaction between a C₅H₅⁻ anion and a XH(+) (X = Mg, Ca) cation. Conversely, for CpBeH the interaction between the C₅H₅ and the BeH subunits is significantly covalent. These compounds exhibit a significant aromaticity, usually named three-dimension aromaticity, in contrast with the unsubstituted cyclopentadiene compound. The CpBeH derivative behaves as a C acid in the gas phase and is less acidic than cyclopentadiene. More importantly, CpMgH and CpCaH, in spite of the X(+δ) H(-δ) polarity exhibited by the X-H bond in the neutral systems, are predicted to be metal acids in the gas phase. Also surprisingly, both the Mg and the Ca derivatives are stronger acids than the Be analogue, and only slightly weaker acids than cyclopentadiene. This somewhat unexpected result is the consequence of two concomitant facts: the lower dissociation energy of the X-H (X = Mg, Ca) bonds with respect to the C-H bonds, and the significantly high electron affinity of the C₅H₅X* (X = Mg, Ca) radicals...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the synthetic utility of insertion reactions with Group two complexes, specifically towards the activation of the small molecular gas; carbon monoxide. Extension of this Group two mediated reactivity into catalytic regimes exploits both σ–bond metathesis and insertion chemistries with hydride sources such as PhSiH 3 or HBpin to generate value added chemicals. Chapter Two demonstrates organoisocyanates are readily converted to methyl amines through hydrodeoxygenation with HBpin {{in the presence of}} the β–diketiminato magnesium catalyst, Ib. A series of catalytically relevant species have been identified and fully characterized through stoichiometric reactivity studies. These data suggest that overall reduction and C–O activation occur through the intermediacy of well–defined magnesium formamidato and magnesium boryloxide species. This reaction is further explored through a DFT study which complements the experimental findings. Chapter Three explores the reaction between both β–diketiminato magnesium, Ih, and <b>calcium,</b> Ii, <b>hydride</b> complexes with carbon monoxide, resulting in the isolation of dimeric cis–enediolate species by the reductive coupling of two CO molecules.

One can implement this protocol using common lab glass and lab equipment. First, dichloromethane is refluxed with <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> to remove water. Then, dichloromethane is distilled to separate it from the byproducts of the reflux reaction. This procedure can be implemented in 1 day. ### Introduction In many instances in synthetic chemistry {{it may be necessary}} to remove residual water from solvents in order to carry out a synthesis procedure under inert conditions. In this example, water is removed from dichloromethane by refluxing dichloromethane in the presence of <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> at 60 °C. Under these conditions, <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas is allowed to escape from the system through a drying tube while calcium hydroxide is separated from the anhydrous dichloromethane by distillation at 80 °C in a subsequent step. ### Reagents 1. <b>Calcium</b> <b>hydride,</b> ≥ 95 % (Sigma-Aldrich Co., cat. no. 208027 - 100 G) - Dichloromethane, ≥ 99. 5 %, ACS certified (EMD, cat. no.

Add <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> (20 g) and dichloromethane (700 mL) into a one-necked round-bottomed flask (1 L) and fit the round-bottomed flask with a condenser and drying tube filled with drierite (Figure 1). - CAUTION <b>Calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> and dichloromethane are irritating and/or harmful if exposed to the skin or inhaled. <b>Calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> releases flammable gases upon contact with water. Conduct all work in a chemical fume hood. Proper personal protective equipment (lab coat, nitrile gloves, and safety glasses) should be worn throughout the procedure. - Stir the mixture using a magnetic stir bar. - Heat the reaction flask to 60 °C using a heating mantle and reflux at 60 °C for 2 h. Under these conditions, <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas is allowed to escape from the system through a drying tube. - After 2 h, cool the reaction flask to room temperature (20 - 25 °C). - PAUSE POINT Once cooled, the dichloromethane/calcium hydride mixture may be sealed and stored overnight in the fume hood, if necessary. - **Distillation of dichloromethane TIMING ~ 6 h** 5. Attach the flask from Step 4 to the apparatus shown in Figure 2 with a 100 mL receiving flask. - Stir the mixture using a magnetic stir bar and heat the reaction flask to 80 °C using a heating mantle. - Collect the first 30 mL distillate in the 100 mL receiving flask and then replace with a 1000 mL receiving flask. - CRITICAL STEP The first 30 mL distillate may contain residual water and should be discarded. - Continue heating until ~ 600 mL anhydrous dichloromethane has been collected in the receiving flask. - Once the desired amount of anhydrous dichloromethane has been collected, cool the reaction flask to room temperature. - Once cooled, seal the flask with the remaining mixture from step 1 and store in the fume hood awaiting either reuse of unreacted <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> or disposal. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Drying of dichloromethane** ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") **Figure 2 : Distillation of dichloromethane** ![Fig 2]([URL] "Fig 2 ") ### Associated Publications **Synthesis of oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) **.

Anhydrous THF, anhydrous hexane, N-trimethylsilyl (N-TMS) allylamine (1 -TMS), N-TMS morpholine (3 -TMS), redistilled chlorotrimethylsilane, hexamethyldisilazane, 5 -norbornene- 2, 3 -dicarboxylic anhydride, propargylamine, N-TMS tert-butylamine, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) acetamide (BSA), ethylenediamine and triphosgene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich {{and used as}} received. Anhydrous triethylamine (TEA) was prepared by treating regular TEA (Sigma-Aldrich) with <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> at 40 oC under nitrogen overnight followed by distillation under nitrogen. Anhydrous DMSO-d 6 was prepared by treating regular DMSO-d 6 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) with <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> at 70 oC under nitrogen overnight followed by distillation under reduced pressure. 1 Anhydrous CDCl 3 was prepared by treating regular CDCl 3 (Sigma-Aldrich) with P 2 O 5 overnight followed by distillation under nitrogen. Anhydrous allylamine (1) and benzylamine (2) were prepared by treating the corresponding amine (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight with KOH followed by distillation. Anhydrous propargylamine (4) was obtained by treating regular propargylamine with 4 Å molecular sieve...|$|E
40|$|General: Solvents were {{dried over}} sodium {{diphenyl}} ketyl (hydrocarbons), <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> (dichloromethane), and calcium sulfate (acetone) and distilled under nitrogen prior to use. The reactions {{were carried out}} under nitrogen, using Schlenk-vacuum line techniques, and were routinely monitored by solution IR spectroscopy (carbonyl stretching region) and by spot TLC (silica gel). Compound 2 was prepared as described previously. [1] IR: Perkin-Elmer FT 1720 -X. NMR: Bruke...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA one-pot two-step {{reaction}} (Knoevenagel condensation – {{reduction of}} the double bond) has been developed using <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> as a reductant {{in the presence of}} a supported noble metal catalyst. The reaction between carbonyl compounds and active methylene compounds such as methylcyanoacetate, 1, 3 -dimethylbarbituric acid, dimedone and the more challenging dimethylmalonate, affords the corresponding monoalkylated products in moderate to good yields (up to 83 %) with minimal {{reduction of the}} starting carbonyl compounds...|$|E
30|$|The {{reduction}} of 47 TiO 2 was performed at Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research (GSI) in Darmstadt as described elsewhere (Lommel et al. 2014). Briefly, the enriched 47 TiO 2 was combined with 40 % surplus of <b>calcium</b> <b>hydride</b> and the reduction process was performed under constant argon flow at 900  °C for 1  h. Dilute acetic acid {{was used for}} the isolation of the reduced 47 Ti metal from the co-produced calcium oxide.|$|E
