40|$|In {{a crowded}} public space, people often walk in groups, either with people they know or strangers. Associating {{a group of}} people over space and time can assist {{understanding}} individual’s behaviours as it provides vital visual context for matching individuals within the group. Seemingly an ‘easier ’ task compared with person matching given more and richer visual content, this problem is in fact very challenging because {{a group of people}} can be highly non-rigid with <b>changing</b> <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> of people within the group and severe self-occlusions. In this paper, for the first time, the problem of matching/associating groups of people over large space and time captured in multiple non-overlapping camera views is addressed. Specifically, a novel people group representation and a group matching algorithm are proposed. The former addresses changes in the relative positions of people in a group and the latter deals with variations in illumination and viewpoint across camera views. In addition, we demonstrate a notable enhancement on individual person matching by utilising the group description as visual context. Our methods are validated using the 2008 i-LIDS Multiple-Camera Tracking Scenario (MCTS) dataset on multiple camera views from a busy airport arrival hall. ...|$|E
40|$|A large {{literature}} has documented {{an increase in}} income equality in the United States {{over the past several}} decades (see, for example, David H. Autor, Lawrence F. Katz, and Melissa S. Kearney, 2006). At the same time, real aggregate income has risen markedly, and most socioeconomic groups have experienced at least some rise in real purchasing power. Standard models of consumption, which typically assume that an individual’s utility is based only on her own consumption, would predict that these gains have led to higher levels of happiness for all groups, albeit with greater increases for some more than others. However, economists have long recognized that an individual’s utility may depend not only on the level of her own consumption but also on how that level compares with the consumption of others. If preferences are characterized by such “external habits, ” then the observed widening of the income distribution may have implications for the happiness of different groups that go beyond those associated with the changes in their respective incomes. This study combines data from two sources to document the evolution of reported levels of happiness for different socioeconomic groups over the past 25 years and to explore whether those levels have been affected by the <b>changing</b> <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> of these groups within th...|$|E
40|$|In post socialist {{countries}} that now form the eastern member {{states of the}} European Union {{there was a general}} vision of the society from the early nineties to catch up to the developed West. The dream of reaching the level of western European economic development and living standards was the main driver for economic transition and EU integration. In spite of modest convergence, however, the difference between the West and the East has remained dominant until today, ten years after the EU accession, while the core—periphery duality is also an important economic-geographic dimension in the European single market. The <b>changing</b> <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> of these regions in economic terms and the interrelation between the East and West of the EU is in the focus of this paper. It addresses some specifics of regional economic development of this area and particularly of Hungary at both macroregional and regional levels paying attention to the economic crisis which started in 2007.

This paper analyzes the general terrain adaptability of the feet of ruminants using kinematics of the equivalent mechanism model based on screw theory. Cloven hooves could adjust attitude by <b>changing</b> <b>relative</b> <b>positions</b> between two digits in swing phase. This function helps to choose better landing orientation. “Grasping” or “holding” a rock or other object on the ground passively provides extra adhesion force in stance phase. Ruminants could adjust the position of the metacarpophalangeal joint or metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP or MCP) with no relative motion between the tip of feet and the ground, which ensures the adhesion and dexterity in stance phase. These functions are derived from an example from chamois’ feet and several assumptions, which are believed to demonstrate the foundation of adaptation of ruminants and ensure a stable and continuous movement...|$|R

In convincing examples we point out the high sensitivity and complete selectivity of the method for the angular anisotropy of the 7 S state, such as orientation or alignment created in the 6 S- 7 S excitation process.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} the {{posterior}} spiracles of Drosophila as a model to link patterning genes and morphogenesis. A genetic cascade of transcription factors downstream of the Hox gene Abdominal-B subdivides the primordia of the posterior spiracles into two cell populations that develop using two different morphogenetic mechanisms. The inner cells {{that give rise to}} the spiracular chamber invaginate by elongating into “bottle-shaped” cells. The surrounding cells give rise to a protruding stigmatophore by <b>changing</b> their <b>relative</b> <b>positions</b> in a process similar to convergent extension. The genetic cascades regulating spiracular chamber, stigmatophore, and trachea morphogenesis are different but coordinated to form a functional tracheal system. In the posterior spiracle, this coordination involves the control of the initiation of cell invagination that starts in the cells closer to the trachea primordium and spreads posteriorly. As a result, the opening of the tracheal system shifts back from the spiracular branch of the trachea into the posterior spiracle cells. We analyze the contribution of the ems gene to this coordination. In ems mutants, invagination of the spiracle cells adjacent to the trachea does not occur, but more posterior cells of the spiracle invaginate normally. This results in a spiracle without a lumen and with the tracheal opening located outside it...|$|R

This can be enabled either by <b>changing</b> the <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> of the individual panels, or by using articulated mechanisms and deployable, retractable and/or inflatable structures. Such a model introduces the concept of modular spacecraft of variable morphology to large gossamer spacecraft. However, this joint concept is complex in nature and requires equations for coupled orbit/attitude dynamics. Therefore, as a starting point, the system is modelled as a rigid-body dumbbell consisting of two tip masses connected by a rigid, massless panel. The system is subjected to a central gravitational force field under consideration of solar radiation pressure forces. Therefore, we assign reflectivity coefficients to the tip masses and a high area-to-mass ratio. An analytical Hamiltonian approach is {{used to describe the}} planar motion of the system in Sun-centred Keplerian and non-Keplerian circular orbits. The stability and controllability of the system is enabled through changing the reflectivity coefficients, for example through the use of electro-chromic coating on its surface. The creation of artificial unstable equilibria of the system due to the presence of solar radiation pressure and heteroclinic connections between the equilibria are investigated. We further derive a constraint for the solar radiation pressure forces to maintain the system on a circular Sun-centred orbit. It is planned that the structure is eventually capable of reconfiguring between the equilibria by a minimum actuation effort...|$|R
