60|$|Although the beaks {{and feet}} of birds are {{generally}} clean, earth sometimes adheres to them: {{in one case}} I removed sixty-one grains, and in another case twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from {{the foot of a}} partridge, and in the earth there was a pebble as large as the seed of a vetch. Here is a better case: the leg of a woodcock was sent to me by a friend, with a little cake of dry earth attached to the shank, weighing only nine grains; and this contained a seed of the toad-rush (Juncus bufonius) which germinated and flowered. Mr. Swaysland, of Brighton, who during the last forty years has paid close attention to our migratory birds, informs me that he has often shot wagtails (Motacillae), wheatears, and whinchats (Saxicolae), on their first arrival on our shores, before they had alighted; and he has several times noticed little cakes of earth attached to their feet. Many facts could be given showing how generally soil is charged with seeds. For instance, Professor Newton sent me the leg of a red-legged partridge (Caccabis rufa) which had been wounded and could not fly, with a ball of hard earth adhering to it, and weighing six and a half ounces. The earth had been kept for three years, but when broken, watered and placed under a bell glass, no less than eighty-two plants sprung from it: these consisted of twelve monocotyledons, including the <b>common</b> <b>oat,</b> and at least one kind of grass, and of seventy dicotyledons, which consisted, judging from the young leaves, of at least three distinct species. With such facts before us, can we doubt that the many birds which are annually blown by gales across great spaces of ocean, and which annually migrate--for instance, the millions of quails across the Mediterranean--must occasionally transport a few seeds embedded in dirt adhering to their feet or beaks? But I shall have to recur to this subject.|$|E

The majority of the material (70 %) differed in respect to morphological features from the basic features accepted as species-specific in common keys of plants used in Poland (S z a f e r, 1919; S z a f e r et al., 1969). The differences referred mainly {{to the number of}} flowers in the spiklets, hairs of lower lemma and its callus, both as regards length of hairs and their distribution and colour.

F. Gray), 2. var. intermedia (Lestib.) Lej. et Court., 3. var. glabrata Peterm., 4. var. vilis (Wallr.) Hauskn. Statistical studies embraced 20 stations (fields with area of about 1 ha). 100 panicles of A. fatua were randomly collected from each station. All four varieties were found at 14 stations, three varieties only were found at 4 stations, while at two stations only two varieties grew. None of the populations under study was one-variety only.

5000|$|... "Sowing wild oats" [...] is {{a phrase}} used {{since at least}} the 16th century; it appears in a 1542 tract by Thomas Beccon, a Protestant clergyman from Norfolk. Apparently, a similar {{expression}} was used in Roman Republican times, possibly by Plautus. The origin of the expression is the fact that wild oats, notably A. fatua, are a major weed in oat farming. Among European cereal grains, oats are hardest to tell apart from their weedy relatives, which look almost alike but yield little grain. The life cycle of A. fatua is nearly synchronous with that of <b>common</b> <b>oat,</b> and their relationship is an example of Vavilovian mimicry. Historically, growers could control the weed only by checking the crop plants one by one and hand-weeding. Consequently, [...] "sowing wild oats" [...] became a phrase to describe unprofitable activities. Given the reputation of oat grain to have invigorating properties and the obvious connection between plant seeds and human [...] "seed", {{it is not surprising that}} the meaning of the phrase became a reference to the destructive sexual liaisons of an unmarried young male, which result in unwanted children born out of wedlock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Land-use {{change is}} likely to be a major {{component}} of global change at high latitudes, potentially causing significant alterations in soil C and N cycling. We addressed the biogeochemical impacts of land-use change in fully replicated black spruce forests and agricultural fields of different ages (following deforestation) and under different management regimes in interior Alaska. Change from forests to cultivated fields increased summer temperatures in surface soil layers by 4 – 5 °C, and lengthened the season of biological activity by two to three weeks. Decomposition of a <b>common</b> substrate (<b>oat</b> stubble) was enhanced by 25 % in fields compared to forests after litter bags were buried for one year. In-situ net N mineralization rates in site-specific soil were similar in forests and fields during summer, but during winter, forests were the only sites where net N immobilization occurred. Field age and management had a significant impact on C and N mineralization. Rates of annual decomposition, soil respiration and summer net N mineralization tended to be lower in young than in old fields and higher in fallow than in planted young fields. To identify the major environmental factors controlling C and N mineralization, soil temperature, moisture and N availability were studied. Decomposition and net N mineralization seemed to be mainly driven by availability of inorganic N. Soil temperature played a role only when comparing forests and fields, but not in field-to-field differences. Results from soil respiration measurement...|$|R

The second objective was to measure the effects of cultural practices (sowing rate, harvest interval and irrigation level) on yield of dry matter (DM), chemical composition, digestibility of DM and metabolizable energy (ME) concentration of herbage from the best adapted C 3 species previously tested (lop-sided oat). Four experiments were conducted. Oat species proved to be the best adapted species and produced the highest annual yield of herbage (7600 kg DM ha) 1) with a high nutritive value. Yields of DM of lop-sided oat were not affected by sowing rate of seed but increased as the length of harvest intervals increased from 30 to 45 and 60 d (P < 0 Æ 001). Crude protein concentration, digestibility ofDMand ME concentration decreased as the harvest interval increased (P < 0 Æ 01). Irrigation increased the yields of DM of lop-sided oats by 1 Æ 3 (P < 0 Æ 05) but had no effect on the nutritive value of herbage.

In six long-term field experiments in southern Queensland, we are testing a wide variety of management practices to deplete soil seed banks of key annual weed species, such as wild <b>oat,</b> <b>common</b> sowthistle, liverseed grass, barnyard grass and awnless barnyard grass. Irrigation increased the emergence of all species with timing of irrigation being important. Higher stubble levels increased the emergence of larger seeded species including wild oat and awnless barnyard grass, but decreased the emergence of sowthistle. Cultivation reduced emergence of sowthistle and summer grasses, but had little effect on wild oat emergence. The wild oat seed bank was reduced by up to 70 % in the top 5 cm of soil either with or without cultivation. However, cultivation increased the number of wild oat seeds persisting below 5 cm. Data suggest that wetter environments will encourage a more rapid depletion of summer grasses and sowthistle through increased emergence. Similarly, maintaining crop residue may increase seed bank depletion of larger seeded species through increased emergence. Cultivation increases the persistence of all the target species and is not a favoured practice for rapid depletion of the seed bank...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{occurrence of}} Fusarium-mycotoxins in Norwegian cereals {{over the last}} decade, {{is thought to be}} caused by increased inoculum resulting from more cereal residues at the soil surface as a result of reduced tillage practices. In addition, weather conditions have increasingly promoted inoculum development and infection by Fusarium species. The objective of this work was to elucidate the influence of different tillage regimes (autumn plowing; autumn harrowing; spring plowing; spring harrowing) on the inoculum potential (IP) and dispersal of Fusarium spp. in spring oats. Tillage trials were conducted at two different locations in southeast Norway from 2010 to 2012. Oat residues from the previous year’s crop were collected within a week after sowing for evaluation. IP was calculated as the percentage of residues infested with Fusarium spp. multiplied by the proportion of the soil surface covered with residues. F. avenaceum and F. graminearum were the most common Fusarium species recovered from oat residues. The IP of Fusarium spp. was significantly lower in plowed plots compared to those that were harrowed. Plowing in either the autumn or spring resulted in a low IP. Harrowing in autumn was more effective in reducing IP than the spring harrowing, and IP levels for the spring harrowed treatments were generally higher than all other tillage treatments examined. Surprisingly low levels of F. langsethiae were detected in the residues, although this species is a <b>common</b> pathogen of <b>oat</b> in Norway. The percentage of the residues infested with F. avenaceum, F. graminearum, F. culmorum and F. langsethiae generally related to the quantity of DNA of the respective Fusarium species determined using qPCR. Fusarium dispersal, quantified by quantitative PCR analysis of spore trap samples collected at and after heading, generally corresponded to IP. Fusarium dispersal was also observed to increase after rainy periods. Our findings are in line with the general understanding that plowing is a means to reduce the IP of Fusarium spp. in cereal fields. The main inoculum source for F. langsethiae remains unclear. Our results will be useful in the development of forecasting tools to calculate the risk of Fusarium in cereals...|$|R

Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar a interferÃncia dos resÃduos culturais de aveia preta e tambÃm do consÃrcio de aveia preta, ervilhaca comum e nabo forrageiro sobre a incidÃncia de plantas invasoras; emergÃncia de plÃntulas, crescimento de plantas e produtividade da cultura de soja; alÃm da qualidade da semente da soja colhida. O experimento foi conduzido em campo, nos anos 2007 / 2008, demarcando-se parcelas de 5 m x 2 m, com 1 m de bordadura entre elas e distribuÃdas em sete tratamentos, ao acaso, com cinco repetiÃÃes cada. Durante o desenvolvimento da cultura, avaliaram-se os parÃmetros: Ãndice de velocidade de emergÃncia, desenvolvimento de planta e incidÃncia de espÃcies invasoras. ApÃs a colheita, em laboratÃrio, foram avaliadas as sementes colhidas pela determinaÃÃo de teor de Ãgua, massa de 100 sementes, pureza, produtividade, porcentagem de germinaÃÃo e vigor. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em esquema fatorial com dois fatores com testemunha e as mÃdias foram comparadas pelo teste de Tukey ao nÃvel de 5 % de significÃncia. Observa-se que as espÃcies invasoras nÃo diferiram estatisticamente entre os tratamentos. De maneira geral, os tratamentos nÃo influenciaram na altura de plantas e aumentaram a produtividade da soja. Entretanto, apresentaram sementes menos vigorosas quando submetidas ao teste de envelhecimento acelerado. A pureza das sementes foi menor quando submetida ao cultivo com aveia preta. A massa de 100 sementes foi alterada pelos tratamentos, sendo maior em cultivo sob aveia preta. Os demais parÃmetros analisados nÃo mostraram diferenÃas estatÃsticas. Conclui-se, portanto, que tais espÃcies sÃo indicadas como alternativa para cobertura de inverno, na rotaÃÃo de culturas com a soja, pois melhoram os aspectos agronÃmicos da cultura. The {{adjustment of}} a cover crop to the agricultural system, with species whose chemical composition has substances {{able to control}} weeds, is a promising alternative to decrease herbicides application in agriculture. So, this trial aimed at analyzing the interference of black oats residues as well as black <b>oat,</b> <b>common</b> vetch and forage turnip consortium on weeds incidence, seeds emergence, seedling emergence, plants development, soybean productivity and its harvested seeds quality. The trial was carried out on field, from 2007 to 2008, with 5 m x 2 m plots and 1 m of border among them, distributed in seven randomized treatments with five replications each. During the crop development, the following parameters were evaluated: emergence speed index, plants development and weeds incidence. After harvest, in the laboratory, harvested seeds were evaluated according to: water content determination, weight of 100 seeds, purity, productivity, percentages of germination and vigor. It was a factorial experimental design with two factors plus one control and the averages were compared by the Tukey test at 5 % level of significance. The weeds species did not differ statistically among the treatments. By and large, the treatments did not influence on plants heights, but increased the soybean productivity. However, the seeds showed less vigor when under the accelerated aging test. The seeds purity was inferior when they were under black oats crop. The weight of 100 seeds was changed by the treatments and they were heavier when grown on black oats. The other analyzed parameters did not show any statistic difference.

Como tratamentos, avaliou-se a combinação de dois fatores (3 x 3) em um delineamento {{experimental}} de parcelas subdivididas com três repetições, no qual as parcelas foram as condições luminosas (proporcionadas por duas densidades arbóreas: 555 e 333 árvores/ha e luz solar plena) e as subparcelas as espécies forrageiras azevém-anual (Lolium multiflorum Lam.); aveia-preta (Avena strigosa Schreb.); e aveia-branca (A. sativa L.) cv. Fapa 2. A semeadura foi realizada entre 25 / 7 / 2005 e 5 / 8 / 2005 e entre 26 e 27 / 4 / 2006. O rendimento de matéria seca foi estimado em avaliações durante o estádio vegetativo (aos 104 dias após a semeadura em 2006) e em pleno florescimento (aos 132 e 170 dias, em 2005 e 2006, respectivamente). O valor nutritivo da forragem foi avaliado considerando os teores médios de proteína bruta (PB) e a digestibilidade {{in vitro}} da matéria orgânica (DIVMO). O sombreamento moderado reduziu em 57 % o rendimento médio de forragem dos três genótipos avaliados, mas aumentou em 2, 3 % o teor de proteína bruta (PB) e em 5, 5 % a digestibilidade in vitro (DIVMO) quando as plantas estavam em florescimento pleno. Entre as espécies forrageiras avaliadas, a aveia-branca e a aveia-preta apresentam maior potencial para utilização em sistemas silvipastoris na Região Sul. It was evaluated the shading effect induced by two tree densities of a ten-year-old slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) forest, and at full sun, on forage dry matter yield and nutritive value of three cool-season annual grasses. Treatments were {{a combination of}} two main factors: a) three light conditions induced by two tree densities (333 e 555 stems/ha) and at full sun; b) three cool-season annual forage grasses: Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), <b>common</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena sativa L.) cv. Fapa- 2, and black-oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.). A split-plot experimental design, with three replications, was used. The main plots were the light conditions affected by tree density and the subplots were the different forage species. Sowing dates were from July 25 to August 5, 2005 and April 26 and 27, 2006. In order to determine forage DM yield, plants were hand-clipped at the vegetative stage (104 days after sowing, in 2006) and at full bloom (132 and 170 days, in 2005 e 2006, respectively). Forage nutritive value was accessed by determining crude protein (CP) concentration and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). Results showed that when plants were at the full bloom stage and under moderate shading, forage DM yield was reduced by 57 %, forage CP content was increased by 2, 3 %, and IVOMD was raised by 5, 5 %, compared to plants at full sun. In terms of their potential utilization, <b>common</b> <b>oat</b> and black-oat show promise for regional silvopastoral systems in southern Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew in <b>common</b> <b>oat</b> {{is caused}} by Blumeria graminis DC. f. sp. avenae Em. Marchal. Host-pathogen tests are {{commonly}} used to identify and locate resistance genes to powdery mildew in cereals. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the virulence of powdery mildew isolates obtained from powdery mildew populations harvested in Poland and to identify OMR 1, OMR 2 and OMR 3 resistance genes to powdery mildew in F 2 populations of inter-cultivar hybrids of common oat: Bruno × Fuchs, Jumbo × Fuchs and Mostyn × Fuchs. On the basis of the analysis conducted, isolates enabling division of the studied populations into groups of resistant and susceptible plants were selected. M 10 and M 14 isolates were chosen for the population which was obtained from crossbreeding of ‘Bruno’ with ‘Fuchs’; these isolates demonstrated avirulence to Bruno cultivar containing OMR 1 gene. In order to divide population obtained from crossbreeding of ‘Jumbo’ with ‘Fuchs’, M 13 and M 16 isolates were chosen; they demonstrated avirulence to the cultivar Jumbo containing the OMR 2 gene. On the basis of the tests conducted, it was impossible to select isolates characterised by avirulence to the OMR 3 gene. In the F 2 population of Bruno × Fuchs and Jumbo × Fuchs hybrids, a division was made into resistant and susceptible plants. The obtained results were verified by the 2 test; the proportion in the dispersion matching model was found to be 3 resistant plants: 1 sensitive plant both in the Bruno × Fuchs and Jumbo × Fuchs populations. Such dispersion indicated that the resistance to powdery mildew in the studied cultivars Bruno and Jumbo was conditioned by single dominant genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of diversity and}} population structure and construction of a core collection is beneficial for the efficient use and management of germplasm. A unique collection of <b>common</b> <b>oat</b> landraces, cultivated in the temperate climate of central Europe {{until the end of}} the twentieth century, is preserved in the Polish gene bank. It consists of 91 accessions that have never been used in breeding programs. In order to optimise the use of this genetic resource, we aimed to: (1) determine genetic and agro-morphological diversity, (2) identify internal genetic variation of the tested accessions, (3) form a core collection and (4) recognise the accessions useful for breeding programs or re-release for cultivation. The collection was screened using ISSR markers (1520 loci) and eight agro-morphological traits. Uniquely, we performed molecular studies based on 24 individuals of every accession instead of bulk samples. Therefore, {{assessment of}} the degree of diversity within each population and the identification of overlapping gene pools were possible. The observed internal diversity (Nei unbiased coefficient) was in the range of 0. 17 - 0. 31. Based on combined genetic and agro-morphological data, we established the core collection composed of 21 landraces. Due to valuable compositions of important traits, some accessions were also identified as useful for breeding programs. The population structure and principal coordinate analysis revealed two major clusters. Based on the previous results, the accessions classified within the smaller one were identified as obsolete varieties instead of landraces. Our results show that the oat landraces are, in general, resistant to local races of diseases, well adapted to local conditions and, in some cases, yielding at the level of modern varieties. Therefore, in situ conservation of the landraces in the near future may be satisfactory for both farmers and researchers in terms of the genetic resources preservation...|$|E
40|$|Atualmente, os critérios utilizados no Sul do Brasil para definição da dose de nitrogênio (N) a ser aplicada no milho são o teor de matéria orgânica no solo, a expectativa de rendimento da cultura e as características da cultura antecessora. Embora apresente alta relação carbono:nitrogênio (C/N), a aveia preta é a espécie de cobertura de solo de inverno mais utilizada como antecessora às culturas comerciais de verão. Essa característica pode resultar em imobilização do N do solo, deficiência de N na planta de milho e redução no rendimento de grãos. Embora na determinação da dose a ser aplicada sejam consideradas as espécies antecessoras, os avanços quanto à melhor época para aplicar N em cobertura em milho foram pequenos. Com o objetivo de avaliar a época mais adequada para aplicação da primeira dose de N em cobertura no milho cultivado em sucessão a espécies de inverno com distintas relações C/N, um experimento foi realizado em vasos em casa de vegetação em Porto Alegre-RS. Utilizaram-se colunas de solo não deformado, classificado como Argissolo Vermelho distrófico típico. Os tratamentos constaram de quatro sistemas de coberturas de solo de inverno (aveia preta, ervilhaca comum, nabo forrageiro e pousio) e três formas de {{manejo de}} N em cobertura (com aplicação de N nos estádios V 3 ou V 5 e sem aplicação de N em cobertura). O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o completamente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 4 x 3, com três repetições. Procedeu-se à análise de variância pelo teste F e à comparação de médias pelo teste de Tukey (p The criteria currently used in Southern Brazil for {{the definition of}} the nitrogen (N) rate to be applied in maize are based on the soil organic matter content, the expected grain yield and the characteristics of the previous crop. Although the carbon:nitrogen (C/N) ratio is high, black oat is the most commonly used winter species antecedent to commercial summer crops. This characteristic can result in soil N immobilization, N plant deficiency and reduced grain yield in maize. Although the antecedent species are considered in the determination of the adequate N rate, little progress has been made regarding the best time for N side dressed application in maize. With the objective of evaluating the best time of the first rate of N side-dressed application in maize cultivated in succession to winter species with distinct C/N ratios, a greenhouse experiment was conducted in pots in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Undisturbed columns of soil, classified as typical dystrophic Argisol (Rhodic Ultisol) were used. The treatments consisted of four systems of winter cover species (black <b>oat,</b> <b>common</b> vetch, oilseed radish and fallow) and three management forms of side-dressed N application (N applied in the growth stage V 3, V 5 and without N application). The experimental design was a completely randomized block, in a 4 x 3 factorial treatment combination, with three replications. Analysis of variance was performed using the F test and the treatment means were compared by Tukey's test (p < 0. 05). Black oat, which has the highest C/N ratio, presented the lowest rate of mineralization and N release from its residues, while common vetch and oilseed radish have a lower C/N ratio, stimulating the mineralization and N release. Black oat preceding maize reduced the soil mineral N and N content in maize and affected the initial plant development, independent of the timing of N side-dressed application. In maize succeeding common vetch and oilseed radish, the relative leaf chlorophyll content and the dry mass production of maize in the V 7 growth stage was higher in relation to that obtained in maize succeeding oat, independent of when the first rate of N was side-dressed. The obtained data indicate {{that it is possible to}} delay the first side-dressed N application in maize from V 3 to V 5 stage when maize is cultivated in succession to winter species with a low C/N ratio...|$|R
