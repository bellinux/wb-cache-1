25|$|Cross's {{affinity}} with the Neo-Impressionist movement extended beyond the painting style to include their political philosophies. Like Signac, Pissarro, and other Neo-Impressionists, Cross believed in anarchist principles, with {{hope for a}} utopian society. In 1896 Cross created a lithograph, L'Errant (The Wanderer). This {{marked the first time}} he had worked with a publisher, and the piece was featured anonymously in Les Temps Nouveaux, Jean Grave's anarchist <b>journal.</b> <b>Cross's</b> anarchist sentiments influenced his choice of subjects: he painted scenes illustrating a utopian world that could exist through anarchism.|$|R

50|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Jung perceived that his visionary experiences during the prior year had been not only of personal relevance, but entwined with a crucial cultural moment. In late-1914 and 1915 he compiled the visions from the three so-far <b>completed</b> <b>journals,</b> adding a commentary on each imaginative episode, into a draft manuscript.

40|$|Canada is gratefully acknowledged. Abstract. In {{a seminal}} contribution, Hansson has {{demonstrated}} that the family of de-cisive coalitions associated with an Arrovian social welfare function forms an ultrafilter. If the population under consideration is infinite, his result implies the existence of non-dictatorial social welfare functions. He goes on to show that if transitivity is weakened to quasi-transitivity as the coherence property imposed on a social relation, the set of deci-sive coalitions is a filter. We examine the structure of decisive coalitions and analogous concepts with alternative coherence properties, namely, acyclicity and Suzumura consis-tency, and without assuming that the social relation is <b>complete.</b> <b>Journal</b> of Economic Literature Classification No. : D 71...|$|R

50|$|Until {{recently}} the accepted date of Bashkirtseff's birth was 11 November November New Style, 1860. After {{the discovery of}} the original manuscript of Bashkirtseff‘s journal in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, however, it was found that her journal had been abridged and censored by her family in its first editions. Her date of birth (1858 not 1860) was falsified by her mother to make Bashkirtseff appear even more precocious. An unabridged edition of the <b>complete</b> <b>journal,</b> based on the original manuscript, has been published in French in 16 volumes, and excerpts from the years 1873 - 76 have been translated into English under the title I Am the Most Interesting Book of All (see editions listed below).|$|R

In this issue of The <b>Journal,</b> <b>Cross</b> et al. (1) describe the successful treatment of murine EAE using a soluble form of the T cell activation molecule, CTLA- 4. To-gether with two other recent studies (2, 3), this demonstrates a crucial role of the CD 28 /CTLA- 4 :B 7 receptor system in EAE and suggests potential therapies for human MS. Role of CD 28 in T cell activation The interactions ofT lymphocytes with antigen-presenting cells (APC) lead to T cell activation crucial for immunity to foreign pathogens, transplanted organs, or to self tissue during autoim-mune disease. T lymphocyte activation by interaction with APC is consistent with a two signal model (4). The specificity of T cel/APC interactions (signal one) is provided by the recognitio...|$|R
