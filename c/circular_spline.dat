50|$|The {{strain wave}} gearing theory {{is based on}} elastic {{dynamics}} and utilizes the flexibility of metal. The mechanism has three basic components: a wave generator, a flexspline, and a <b>circular</b> <b>spline.</b> More complex versions have a fourth component normally used to shorten the overall length or to increase the gear reduction within a smaller diameter, but still follow the same basic principles.The wave generator {{is made up of}} two separate parts: an elliptical disk called a wave generator plug and an outer ball bearing. The gear plug is inserted into the bearing, giving the bearing an elliptical shape as well.The flexspline is like a shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is thick and rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, but in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around the outside of the open end of the flexspline. The flexspline fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator plug is rotated, the flexspline deforms to the shape of a rotating ellipse but does not rotate with the wave generator.The <b>circular</b> <b>spline</b> is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The flexspline and wave generator are placed inside the <b>circular</b> <b>spline,</b> meshing the teeth of the flexspline and the <b>circular</b> <b>spline.</b> Because the flexspline has an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with the teeth of the <b>circular</b> <b>spline</b> in two regions {{on opposite sides of the}} flexspline, along the major axis of the ellipse.Assume that the wave generator is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the flexspline teeth which are meshed with those of the <b>circular</b> <b>spline</b> change. The major axis of the flexspline actually rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point at the same rate as the wave generator. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (for example two fewer) on the flexspline than there are on the <b>circular</b> <b>spline.</b> This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flexspline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth, for example) backward relative to the <b>circular</b> <b>spline.</b> Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flexspline in the opposite direction.For a strain wave gearing mechanism, the gearing reduction ratio can be calculated from the number of teeth on each gear: For example, if there are 202 teeth on the <b>circular</b> <b>spline</b> and 200 on the flexspline, the reduction ratio is (200 − 202)/200 = −0.01Thus the flexspline spins at 1/100 the speed of the wave generator plug and in the opposite direction. This allows different reduction ratios to be set without changing the mechanism's shape, increasing its weight, or adding stages. The range of possible gear ratios is limited by tooth size limits for a given configuration.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{describing}} sharp features (i. e., edges and vertices) of implicitly defined surfaces.

In order to decrease the force on flexspline, by means of conjugate method, the parameters of flexspline and <b>circular</b> <b>spline’s</b> tooth profiles are optimized. A D- 100 harmonic drive is simulated based on the contact theory and the explicit algorithm of the finite element method. The parameterized finite element grid of the whole harmonic gear drive model is realized by Matlab, and then the assembly process of the wave generator is simulated by ABAQUS. Meanwhile, the distribution of the flexspline stress and the load characteristics of the flexspline tooth during dynamic transmission process of a harmonic gear with parameters, before and after optimization, are analyzed. The meshing characteristics of the tooth pairs with optimized parameters are improved significantly. The fatigue fracture position on the flexspline is forecasted according to the simulation results.

Since the unit quaternions form the unit spheres S 3 in E 4, a simple curve scheme using spherical biarcs is presented to solve this problem. The spherical biarc is a curve on a sphere consisting of two smoothly joining circular arcs. It is shown that for any two given points and two tangents specified at the two points on the unit sphere, S 3, there always exist spherical biarcs interpolating these data and these biarcs are easy to construct.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} method for planning the manufacturing of pipes from straight cylinders. On the one hand, this allows for feasibility studies by simulation {{and analysis of the}} strain on the cylinder during the manufacturing process. This is done before a pipe is created. On the other hand, planning may be used as input for manufacturing machines used by the industry. A possible approach is to start with the result, i. e. the desired pipe, to get the initial situation, i. e. the cylinder. This is done by reverse engineering the manufacturing operations. Here the following problems can be determined: - Integration of pipes, i. e. the approximation of the pipe by a tube. A tube is a deformed and bent cylinder. - Approximation of spatial curves by <b>circular</b> <b>splines</b> i. e. a G 1 continuous curve which is a consecutive combination of arcs and lines. This dissertation starts with a mathematical definition of pipes and the needed theoretical basis, for example the definition of part-pipes. Based on this, the pipe-tube-approximation problem is formulated as a multicriterial optimization problem which is orientated at the elastic contours of the image processing. Two solutions are presented for the optimization problem. The first one uses dynamic programming, the second one is an adaptive segmentation which is a well known approximation method of curves by polygons. The advantage of the adaptive segmentation is the low run-time. The disadvantage is that a success is not guaranteed, in contrast to dynamic programming. Some methods for basic geometrical operations are presented, which are required to achieve an efficient implementation. Both optimization methods are analyzed. On the one hand, theoretical conditions are presented to guarantee the success of adaptive segmentation. On the other hand, analysis is based on experimental evaluation. It will be shown that both methods yield good results for pipes used in the industry. However, neither provide fully automatic solutions for the practical domain of application. Suggestions are made to handle this complex problem. The definition of a "U-spline-curve" is presented to describe the curve approximation. The aim of a U-spline-curve is to contain as few segments as possible. Therefore, two heuristics are presented. The first one uses adaptive segmentation which is based on the curvature of the curve. The second one is based on a well known algorithm which creates an arc-spline-curve with a minimal number of segments. It will be shown that both methods yield equal results when applied to pipes used in the industry...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} industrial applicatzon of harmonic drives, {{the source}} of some elastokinetic phenomena {{and their impact on}} overall system behavior has not been fully addressed thus far. Some of these phenomena severely influence the behavior of robot arms, both in free and constrained motions, when the end effector is in contact with an environment. The primary goal {{of this study is to}} derive an effective, control-oriented model of a harmonic-drive-based robot joint. Systematic observations of an experimental robot with harmonic drives has revealed that the harmonic drive could not entirely transmit the input torque to the output shaft, due to a nonlinear meshing process between the flexible and <b>circular</b> <b>spline</b> teeth. The torque transmitted to the output shaft might saturate at a much lower value than expected (e. g., motor torque multiplied by the gear ratio). This phenomenon may severely influence the system behavior, par-ticularly in force/impedance control tasks when full joint-torque capacity and wide bandwidth are needed. To understand the harmonic-drive behavior, as well as to derive a convenient form of its model, we have shown restrained motion experi-ments to be much more useful than free-motion experiments. In this article, we also introduce mathematical models and describe experiments related to other physical phenomena, such as nonlinear stiffness, hysteresis, and soft windup. The goal of our modeling strategy was not to develop a precise and possi-bly complicated model, but to generate an appropriate model that could be easily used by control engineers to improve joint behavior To visualize the developed model, equivalent mechan-ical and electrical schemes of the joint are introduced.

40|$|High Speed Milling (HSM) {{machines}} are growing in mainstream manufacturing such as machining of dies and molds. The advantages of HSM include reduction in machining time and better surface finish. A typical HSM machine has a heavy tool-carrying spindle assembly with {{one to three}} degrees of freedom. Consequently, high inertial forces are generated as the spindle head moves to perform cutting. Machining path planning for HSM machines is {{the design of the}} motion of the cutter relative to the part such that the shape is cut n minimum time subject to several constraints. For example, finish cuts limit the thickness of the layer to be machined below a given value. Rough cutting constraints are often guided by the ability of the machine tool to achieve a desired feed rate and cutting speed, without increasing the likelihood of tool failure. Feed rate and cutting speed are related to machine power, chatter, and cutting forces. Tool failure can be induced due to sudden changes in the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE). Likewise, tool failure as well as machining accuracy is affected by inertial forces on the table as well as the spindle head assembly. All practical machining planning algorithms design tool paths by using some typical patterns of shapes (e. g. zigzag, contour offsets, spirals or trochoids). In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we perform an in-depth analysis of all existing path planning algorithms, and point out their strengths and weaknesses by applying them to a series of benchmark part shapes. The objective was to analyze different types of strategy of tool path joining in unit machining operations and their affect on the overall cutting time. In the second part of the thesis, the issue of designing optimized unit shape patterns, in particular spirals and generalized trochoids is examined.
