50|$|The {{subfamily}} Notochthamalinae Foster and Newman, 1987, {{was proposed}} {{for members of}} the barnacle family Chthamalidae with elongated scuta and very narrow terga deeply interlocked, sometimes <b>concrescent.</b> Shell plates may become <b>concrescent</b> with age in some species. Soft part characters include card setae on some or all of cirri I to III, and mandible with or without combed lower edge. Poltarukha made further revisions in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Notochthamalines have a {{shell wall}} of 8, 6, or 4 plates, {{reduction}} from the 8-plated condition {{is accomplished by}} suppression of the carinolatus II. In Chamaesipho only, plate number reduces to four during ontogeny by fusion of carinolatus I with the rostrolatus. Shell wall plates rarely become <b>concrescent</b> with age. The basis is membraneous, rarely partially calcareous. The scutum is elongate, tergum narrow, and deeply articulated. In a few species, scutum and tergum of same side may become <b>concrescent</b> with age.|$|E

50|$|Plants are monoecious. The spicate inflorescences {{consist of}} {{inconspicuous}} flowers. Male flowers comprise 4-5 perianth segments and 4-5 stamens. Female flowers have 2 totally <b>concrescent,</b> three-lobed bracteoles which enclose the ovary, a perianth is missing.|$|E
50|$|Fruitbodies of Hydnellum scrobiculatum have {{centrally}} depressed caps measuring 2 - 6 cm in diameter. These caps can fuse {{together to}} form <b>concrescent</b> fruitbodies. The caps have wavy edges, and an initially felty surface that becomes scaly with age. Young fruit bodies are white, then pinkish-brown, then purplish brown, sometimes with white margins. Fruitbodies can become shiny in age.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{shell wall}} is four plated, reduced from six by fusion of rostrolatera and carinolatera during ontogeny. No sutural interfolding is observed. With age, all plate sutures become <b>concrescent.</b> The basis is membraneous. Opercular plates are deeply articulated, {{but do not}} fuse together. The scutum bears a visible lateral {{depressor}} pit, and a scutal adductor ridge which ranges from nearly absent/indistinct to rounded prominent. The Tergum is pitted internally. There is no trace of a tergal spur, and the tergal depressor area is wide, with prominent crests.|$|E
50|$|Chamaesipho brunnea is an {{intertidal}} barnacle {{common in}} New Zealand, on North Island and South Island north of Stewart Island. Juveniles have six shell wall plates, reducing to four in adults, and with age, all plates become <b>concrescent,</b> with {{no trace of}} sutures inside or out. Shell is brown colored. The related, and sometimes associated Chamaesipho columna is much smaller in size, by nearly half, while Elminius, which can associate with both species, also has four shell wall plates, but plates remain distinct at all stages. The shell of C. columna corrodes to a pitted surface, while that of C. brunnea has a lamellar corrosion.|$|E
50|$|The Chthamaloidea are a {{subdivision}} of Balanomorpha proposed by Newman and Ross to include barnacles with shell wall composed of rostrum, carina, {{and one to}} three pairs of latera, rarely supplemented {{with one or more}} whorls of basal imbricating plates. The rostrolatus enters the , but rarely fuses with the rostrum, as in the three higher superfamilies. Shell plates are simple in construction, solid, and incorporate organic chitin between carbonate layers. Opercular plates are deeply interlocked, and in some genera, may become <b>concrescent</b> with age.Soft part morphology includes concave labrum without notch in the central part. Cirrus III more resembles Cirrus IV than II, or may be intermediate in structure. Caudal appendages present in some species.|$|E
50|$|Ornithogalum {{species are}} {{perennial}} bulbous geophytes with basal leaves. Sensu lato, the genus has {{the characteristics of}} the Ornithogaleae tribe as a whole, since the tribe is monotypic in that sense. Sensu stricto, the genus is characterised by long linear to oblong-lanceolate (lance-shaped) leaves, sometimes with a white longitudinal band on the adaxial (upper) side, an inflorescence that is corymbose or pseudocorymbose, tepals that are white with a longitudinal green band only visible on the abaxial (lower) side, a capsule that is obovate or oblong, and truncate with six noticeable ribs in section and seeds that are globose with a prominently reticulate (net-like pattern) testa. The bulbs are ovoid with free or <b>concrescent</b> scales.|$|E
50|$|The spike-like inflorescences stand {{terminal}} on lateral branches, {{they are}} not branched or with short lateral branches. Cymes of three flowers {{are sitting in the}} axils of fleshy, opposite bracts. The flowers are bisexual (sometimes the stamens of the lateral flowers mey be missing) and proterandric. The central flower is four-angled, the two lateral flowers are three-angled. The perianth consists of 3-4 joined tepals usually <b>concrescent</b> to the apex, these are directed upwards and protrude the length of the bracts by up to one-third to one-half. They consist of several layers of parenchymatous, thin-walled cells with some scattered lignified cells, but are never completely indurated. There are 1-2 stamens exserting the flower, 0.8-1.3 mm, and a conical ovary with two stigmas.|$|E
5000|$|The ring-cupped oaks {{of eastern}} and southeastern Asia. Evergreen trees growing 10 - 40 m tall. They are {{distinct}} from subgenus Quercus {{in that they}} have acorns with distinctive cups bearing <b>concrescent</b> rings of scales; they commonly also have densely clustered acorns, though this {{does not apply to}} all of the species. IUCN, ITIS, Encyclopedia of Life and Flora of China treats Cyclobalanopsis as a distinct genus, but some taxonomists consider it a subgenus of Quercus. It contains about 150 species. Species of Cyclobalanopsis are common in the evergreen subtropical laurel forests which extend from southern Japan, southern Korea, and Taiwan across southern China and northern Indochina to the eastern Himalayas, in association with trees of genus Castanopsis and the laurel family (Lauraceae).|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{history of}} {{philosophy}} has manifested diverse considerations {{of the subject}} of experience and the subject as the primary metaphysical entity or substance. Two positions have been prevalent: the Aristotelian aubstance philosophies, and the philosophies of subjective phenomenalism. Whitehhead's philosophy {{does not seem to}} fit either. The concept of subjectivity as employed and formulated by Whitehead is available for analysis only through a preliminary analysis of the Categorial Scheme. Thus, an analysis of the categorial scheme in its relevance to the concept of subjectivity precedes the analysis of the subject in Whitehead's philosophy. The method Whitehead employs is speculative, but it is firmly founded on scientific knowledge. Whitehead justifies speculative philosophy {{on the grounds that it}} is only through the free play of imagination grounded in fact that interpretive knowledge is possible. Interpretive knowledge is the province of philosophy, and thus philosophy is never divorced from the other branches of knowledge. Further, the categ ories which are evolved in philosophy must be applicable to all areas of experience. The primary category of existence is actual entities. They are the res verae. An actual entity is an act of experience arising out of data. This is contrary to the traditional substance philosophies. Every actual entity has a definite referential relation with all other actual entities. This relation is prehension, which may be either positive or negative. The coming of actual entities is a <b>concrescent</b> process whereby many things achieve individual unity. Qualities are the result of prehensions of eternal objects or pure potentials. The ingression of eternal objects into actual entities provides definiteness to the actual entities. Actual entities are both the subjects of experience and the "substance" of the universe.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{patterns of}} structural and functional {{organization of the}} parenchyma of different groups of lymph nodes, structural features of their connective tissue frame and lymphatic sinuses. We studied superficial and deep somatic (Limphonodi mandibulares, L. cervicales superficiales, L. axillares proprii, L. poplitei), somatovisceral (L.  retropharyngei mediales, L. iliaci mediales), visceral (L. mediastinales caudales, L. jejunales) features of mature male dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius Linnaeus, 1758). We used a complex of traditional macroscopic and histological techniques, and also immunohistochemical staining of lymph node sections for identifying the features of localization of T- and B-lymphocyte populations in the parenchyma of the nodes. We found that the parenchyma of camels’ lymph nodes {{is characterized by a}} spongy type structure {{in the form of a}} complex of partly <b>concrescent</b> round-oval fragments of lymphoid tissue, surrounded by large lymphatic spaces (sinuses). The connective tissue frame of the lymph nodes is represented by a two-layer (connective tissue-muscular) capsule and two types of trabeculae: two-layered (connective-muscular, type I), which contain blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as lymphatic cysternas, and single-layered, formed only by a smooth muscular system (type II). Intranodal lymphatic sinuses are subdivided into subcapsular, peritrabecular and medullary sinuses. The subcapsular sinuses and sinuses related to trabeculae of type I and their branching is the most developed. At the tissue level, the lymph node parenchyma has a clearly manifested lobular structure. Lymphoid lobules in the lymph node parenchyma are positioned diffusely (mosaically) and consist of four main cellular zones: transit and cell-cell interaction (analogous to the cortical plateau), clonal proliferation of T- and, respectively, B-lymphocytes (deep cortex units, lymphatic nodules), accumulation of plasmocytes and synthesis of antibodies (brain cords). The lymphoid lobes (compartments) of the lymph nodes parenchyma are bipolar, their tops formed by the zones of transit and cell-cell interaction, and also by the zones of proliferation of B lymphocytes, and the bases by a complex of brain cords (zone of accumulation of plasmocytes and synthesis of antibodies). The zone of T-lymphocytes proliferation is in intermediate position and underlies the subunits of the parenchyma. The tops of the lymphoid lobes are located along the sinuses of the trabeculae of type I and the bases along the sinuses of the trabeculae of type II, which form the efferent lymphatic vessels. The maximum relative capacity of all studied lymph nodes was typical for zones of plasmocyte accumulation and synthesis of antibodies (19 – 27 %), the minimum capacity was typical for transit and cell-cell interaction zones (3 – 8 %). The relative capacity of zones of clonal proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes in most lymph nodes was 1. 5 – 3. 0 times less than that of the zone of plasmocyte accumulation and antibody formation and was, respectively, 8 – 16 % and 9 – 18 %. The study showed that the structure of the lymph nodes parenchyma of dromedaries is not absolutely unique. As in other mammal species, it is subdivided into specialized cell zones which are connected in lymphoid lobules. Specific features of parenchyma structure include: diffuse (mosaic) location of lymphoid lobules; absence of signs of regulated localization of lymphoid lobules relative to the capsule and the sinus bordering the nodes...|$|E
