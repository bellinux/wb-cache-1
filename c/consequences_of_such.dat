5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an event. The timing and prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. Betelgeuse is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is not close enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} probability of Hale-Bopp's striking Earth in future passages through the inner Solar System is remote, about 2.5×10−9 per orbit. However, {{given that the}} comet nucleus is around 60km in diameter, the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an impact would be apocalyptic. Weissman conservatively estimates the diameter at 35km; an estimated density of 0.6 g/cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1.3×1019 g. At a probable impact velocity of 52.5km/s, impact energy can be calculated as 1.9×1032 ergs, or 4.4×109 megatons, about 44 times the estimated energy of the K-T impact event.|$|E
5|$|The small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestus javanicus) {{was introduced}} to Hawaii {{in order to control}} the rat population. However the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.|$|E

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the cheetah is 38, {{the same as}} in most other felids (though for the ocelot and the margay the number is 36). A remarkable feature of the cheetah is its unusually low genetic variability in comparison to other felids. Consequently, individuals show considerable genetic similarity to one another, as illustrated by skin grafts, electrophoretic evidence and reproductive surveys. A prolonged period of inbreeding, following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age, {{is believed to be the}} reason behind this anomaly. The <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> genetic uniformity might include a low sperm count, decreased sperm motility, deformed flagella, difficulty in captive breeding and susceptibility to disease.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, {{a sign of weakness}} among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing up to be a rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E

25|$|There are 18 {{documented}} {{examples of}} convergent coloration patterns between coexisting pairs of pronophiline species from different genera (three examples), between pronophiline species and other satyrines (eight examples), and between pronophiline species and other butterflies or skippers (seven examples). Most examples involve species of Lymanopoda or Eretris. Some of these observations {{have been described}} as mimetic relationships, but the degree of resemblance is not so accurate as in other mimetic butterfly groups, there is no direct evidence of unpalatability of pronophiline butterflies, and no clear understanding of the ecological <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> resemblance.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue in}} this paper that the {{institutional}} premises of the contemporarybanking system are erroneously defined. In consequence, contemporary commercialbanks cannot operate under normal circumstances as any other sector of the economy. The three core elements of the contemporary financial system – namely fiat money,fractional reserve commercial banking and central banking – imply a system which isfundamentally socialized. The most logical coherent <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> aninstitutional setting is the full control and operation of the entire credit industry by thestate. The present crisis is a <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an institutional setting and thenationalization of commercial banking – a logical step according to the premises of theinstitutional setting – will but {{speed up the process}} of a long depression...|$|R

25|$|Given {{that the}} army was {{consistently}} losing, the war effort switched to emphasize three elements: military intelligence, {{the air force and}} the Janjaweed. The latter were armed Baggara herders whom the government had used to suppress a Masalit uprising from 1986 to 1999. The Janjaweed became the center of the new counter-insurgency strategy. Though the government consistently denied supporting them, military resources were poured into Darfur and the Janjaweed were outfitted as a paramilitary force, complete with communication equipment and some artillery. The military planners were aware of the probable <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a strategy: similar methods undertaken in the Nuba Mountains and around the southern oil fields during the 1990s had resulted in massive human rights violations and forced displacements.|$|E
25|$|Samuel {{initially}} appointed his {{two sons}} as his successors; however, just like Eli's sons, Samuel's proved unworthy. The Israelites rejected them. Because of the external threat from other tribes, such as the Philistines, the tribal leaders decided {{that there was a}} need for a more unified, central government, and demanded Samuel appoint a king so that they could be like other nations. Samuel interpreted this as a personal rejection, and at first was reluctant to oblige, until reassured by a divine revelation. He warned the people of the potential negative <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a decision. When Saul and his servant were searching for his father's lost asses, the servant suggested consulting the nearby Samuel. Samuel recognized Saul as the future king.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, some Loyalist clergy were defiant. In Connecticut, John Beach {{conducted}} worship {{throughout the}} war and swore that he would continue praying for the king. In Maryland, Jonathan Boucher took two pistols into the pulpit and even pointed a pistol {{at the head of}} a group of Patriots while he preached on loyalism. Charles Inglis, rector of Trinity Church in New York, persisted in reading the royal prayers even when George Washington was seated in his congregation and a Patriot militia company stood by observing the service. The <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> bravado were very serious. During 1775 and 1776, the Continental Congress had issued decrees ordering churches to fast and pray on behalf of the Patriots. Starting July 4, 1776, Congress and several states passed laws making prayers for the king and British Parliament acts of treason.|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamical}} systems {{scenario for}} developmental cell biology is proposed, based on numerical studies {{of a system}} with interacting units with internal dynamics and reproduction. Diversification, formation of discrete and recursive types, and rules for differentiation are found as a natural <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a system. "Stem cells" that either proliferate or differentiate to different types stochastically are found to appear when intra-cellular dynamics are chaotic. Robustness of the developmental process against microscopic and macroscopic perturbations is {{shown to be a}} natural <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> intra-inter dynamics, while irreversibility in developmental process is discussed in terms of the gain of stability, loss of diversity and chaotic instability.

25|$|Known in Przemyśl as the {{beautiful}} Rosenbach daughter, Helene {{was given the}} title of most 'brilliant {{enough to be a}} son.' It was in early childhood when Helene and her father began to experience tension in their relationship. Spurred by her thirst for education and her disdain for the life her mother planned for her, Helene turned to her father, only to find him unwilling to help her further her education past the age of fourteen. In her work, The Psychology of Women, Deutsch connects one aspect of feminine masochism with her attachment to her father and the possible <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an identification. She writes that a father will sometimes break his relationship with his daughter when she approaches the age of sexual maturity. Helene later attributed her father's resistance to his subservience to his wife and desire for peace at home.|$|E
25|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, so {{it is common to}} experience constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period of}} time than normal). A balanced diet is recommended to help improve digestion. Diet should include high-fiber foods and plenty of water. Levodopa and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, competing between them for access. When taken together, the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> competition is a reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive proteins are discouraged, while in advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa is recommended to be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch and are usually taken at dinner. As the disease advances, dysphagia may appear. In such cases, specific measures include the use of thickening agents for liquid intake, special postures when eating, and gastrostomy in the worst cases.|$|E

500|$|Hualālai (pronounced [...] in Hawaiian) is {{an active}} volcano {{on the island of}} Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands.

Its peak stands [...] above sea level. Hualālai is estimated to have risen above sea level about 300,000years ago. Despite maintaining a very low level of activity since its last eruption in 1801, Hualālai is still considered active, and is expected to erupt again some time within the next century.
