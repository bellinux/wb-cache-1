He {{had been one of the}} co-executive producers attached to Game of Thrones, and died in his sleep from a <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysm</b> on September 25, 2010. Vicinanza was the literary agent who handled George R. R.

He was instrumental in bringing Martin's work to the screen, recommending the books to David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and leading the negotiations with HBO. He died a few days after HBO greenlighted the series.|$|E
5|$|If a <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysm</b> is {{identified}} on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysm</b> induced by overstraining while defecating.

40|$|CT {{angiography}} (CTA) {{has improved}} significantly {{over the past}} few years such that the reconstructed images of the cerebral arteries may now be equivalent to conventional digital angiography. The new technology of 64 slice multi-detector CTA can reconstruct detailed images that can reliably identify small <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysms,</b> even those < 3 mm. In addition, it is estimated that CT followed by lumbar puncture (LP) misses up to 4 % of symptomatic aneurysms. We present a series of cases that illustrates how CT followed by CTA may be replacing CT-LP as the standard of care in working up patients for symptomatic <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysms</b> and the importance of performing three dimensional (3 D) reconstructions. A series of seven cases of symptomatic <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysms</b> were identified that illustrate the sensitivity of CT-CTA versus CT-LP and the importance of 3 D reconstruction in identifying these aneurysms. Surgical treatment was recommended for 6 of the 7 patients with aneurysms and strict hypertension control was recommended for the seventh patient. Some of these patients demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage on presentation while others had negative LPs. A number of these patients with negative LPs were clearly symptomatic from their aneurysms. At least one of these <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysms</b> was not apparent on CTA without 3 D reconstruction. 3 D reconstruction of CTA is crucial to adequately identify <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysms.</b> This case series helps reinforce the importance of 3 D reconstruction.

25|$|Spring Heeled Jack (known {{alternatively}} {{for a time}} as Spring Heeled Jack U.S.A.) is a {{third wave}} ska band based out of New Haven, Connecticut. The band was formed by guitarist/vocalist Ron Ragona and drummer Dave Karcich in 1991. After a short breakup, Ragona and Karcich reformed the band with a new lineup. This lineup went on to record two albums before announcing a hiatus in 2000. While the band members moved on to perform in several new bands, their intention was to play the occasional reunion show. This plan would never come to fruition as a <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysm</b> would be cause for Karcich's death in 2002. In 2015, several band members returned to reform the band full-time. A third studio album, Sound Salvation, followed in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Almost immediately, {{rumors about}} {{possible}} future reunion shows began to surface. The band's original plan {{to play the}} occasional live show and possibly record new material {{came to a halt}} on April 2, 2002, when Karcich suffered a sudden <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysm</b> and died three days later, at the age of 28. Eight months after his death, a tribute show was held at Toad's Place, in honor of Karcich with each band performing having had some prior connection to Karcich's life. The show ended with the reunion of Spring Heeled Jack. Dan Paternostro, Karcich's good friend from grade school, and Dave Sharma from the Skalars took his place during the performance. A raffle was held and bands such as The Pietasters, Less Than Jake and 2 Skinnee J's donated items with all proceeds being added to a scholarship fund in Karcich's name. By the end of the night, a total of $8,000 was collected for the fund.|$|E

40|$|Summary: A {{rare case}} of {{multiple}} <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysms</b> and factor VII deficiency is presented.

The etiology of <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysms</b> has not yet been fully clarified. The reported incidence is 6 â€“ 16 / 100 (1).

25|$|One {{disadvantage}} is {{the patient}} has to hold still {{for long periods of}} time in a noisy, cramped space while the imaging is performed. Claustrophobia severe enough to terminate the MRI exam is reported in up to 5% of patients. Recent improvements in magnet design including stronger magnetic fields (3 teslas), shortening exam times, wider, shorter magnet bores and more open magnet designs, have brought some relief for claustrophobic patients. However, for magnets with equivalent field strengths, there is often a trade-off between image quality and open design. MRI has great benefit in imaging the brain, spine, and musculoskeletal system. The use of MRI is currently contraindicated for patients with pacemakers, cochlear implants, some indwelling medication pumps, certain types of <b>cerebral</b> <b>aneurysm</b> clips, metal fragments in the eyes and some metallic hardware due to the powerful magnetic fields and strong fluctuating radio signals to which the body is exposed. Areas of potential advancement include functional imaging, cardiovascular MRI, and MRI-guided therapy.|$|E
