It produces so many individual strikes that even Kakashi Hatake {{is unable to}} <b>count</b> <b>them</b> all with his Sharingan. The wind-blades sever all nerve channels in the body, leaving the target unable to move after being struck. They also attack the entire chakra circulatory system, which cannot be repaired by any form of medical ninjutsu.|$|E
5|$|Population {{figures for}} elk are {{in excess of}} 30,000—the largest {{population}} of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid‑1990s; this {{has been attributed to}} wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately <b>count</b> <b>them.</b> The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the National Elk Refuge, immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Maya rituals {{differ from}} region to region, but many similar {{patterns}} in ceremonies, whether being performed for {{individual or group}} need, have been noted. First, all rituals are preceded by foresight of a medicine man, who determines {{the day of the}} ceremony through calendrical divination. The medicine men of the Ixil Maya of Guatemala, who kept track of days in their heads, would lay out red seeds from the coral tree onto the pre-Columbian calendar to <b>count</b> <b>them</b> and figure out what day best suited the specific ritual. As a symbol of a spiritual purification, the individual or individuals would observe a fasting and abstinence period before the ritual day.|$|E

Android on tablets is thus second most popular after the iPad.|$|E

25|$|Owing to {{interaction}} with other languages, Urdu has become localized {{wherever it is}} spoken, including in Pakistan. Urdu in Pakistan has undergone changes and has incorporated and borrowed many words from regional languages like Pashto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balti, thus allowing speakers of the language in Pakistan to distinguish themselves more easily and giving the language a decidedly Pakistani flavour. Similarly, the Urdu spoken in India can also be distinguished into many dialects like Dakhni (Deccan) of South India, and Khariboli of the Punjab region. Because of Urdu's similarity to Hindi, speakers of the two languages can easily understand one another if both sides refrain from using specialized vocabulary. The syntax (grammar), morphology, and the core vocabulary are essentially identical. Thus linguists usually <b>count</b> <b>them</b> as one single language and contend that they are considered as two different languages for socio-political reasons.|$|E

In another positive review, Brett Love of TV Squad called the episode [...] "solid," [...] and praised the scenes set in 1984, and the alternate world.

500|$|Having seen Black Mischief {{launched}} to mixed {{but generally}} favourable critical comment (Oldmeadow's intervention was not immediate), Waugh sailed from Tilbury on 2 December 1932. He arrived in British Guiana on 23 December, and after some days of indecision opted {{to accompany the}} district commissioner for Rupununi, on a journey into the interior. He hoped that he might reach Manaus, a large city deep within the Brazilian jungle, but transport proved unreliable, and he got {{no further than the}} border town of Boa Vista. On the way, at one of his overnight stopping points, he encountered Mr Christie, an elderly mixed-race settler who greeted him by saying, [...] "I was expecting you. I was warned in a vision of your approach". The two enjoyed an agreeable dinner together, where Christie talked of the [...] "Fifth Kingdom" [...] (a biblical prophecy from the Book of Daniel). He told Waugh that he had seen the entire gathering of the saints in heaven—surprisingly few, he said—but could not <b>count</b> <b>them</b> because they were incorporeal. Waugh added Christie to his [...] "treasury of eccentrics", set aside for future literary use.|$|E
500|$|In a Malay folk tale, {{the mouse}} deer Sang Kancil wants {{to cross a}} river to reach the fruit trees on the far side, but Sang Buaya, a crocodile, is waiting in the river to eat him. Sang Kancil asks all the {{crocodiles}} to line up across the river so he can <b>count</b> <b>them</b> for the king, and makes them promise not to eat him as he counts. He then steps on their heads one by one, calling out [...] "One! Two! Three!" [...] as he goes. When he reaches the far side, he thanks them for helping him cross the river, and feasts on fruit. Sang Buaya does not fare as well, since the other crocodiles are angry with him for letting Sang Kancil trick them. A legend from East Timor tells how a boy rescues a gigantic crocodile that becomes stranded. In return, the crocodile protects him {{for the rest of}} its life, and when it dies, its scaly ridged back becomes the hills of Timor. One Australian Dreamtime story tells of a crocodile ancestor who had fire all to himself. One day, a [...] "rainbow bird" [...] stole fire-sticks from the crocodile and gave it to man. Hence the crocodile lives in water.|$|E
