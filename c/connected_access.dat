40|$|Societal trends {{have changed}} {{more in the}} last decade than they have in the last century. This is {{particularly}} prevalent in the education environment. Concepts such as Lifelong Learning (the continued learning/educating of an individual throughout his/her lifetime), New Competencies (technology that is now part of almost every skill in the workplace) and Telecommuting (more people working from home rather than traditional offices) have become common-place today (Twigg, 1996, pp. 1 - 2). Education delivery needs to provide for these societal changes in order to ensure competent individuals pass on to the next level of education and ultimately to the work force. With key trends in technology such as Digitization, Maturation and Disintermediation becoming common in the workplace, education delivery must address the ―Digital Divide. (Twigg, 1996, pp. 2 - 3). Historically, schools in South Africa have used traditional teaching methods that have stayed the same for the last century. Educational institutions in South Africa, in particular, the previously disadvantaged schools of the Eastern Cape, face various challenges such as the dwindling ability to collect school fees from parents of scholars and declining financial support from the government. In Chapter Seven of the Draft White Paper on e-Education, which was gazetted on 26 August, 2004, the DoE, as part of its implementation strategies, urged the private sector to respond by implementing ICT initiatives nationwide. Phase 1 of the strategy advocated that ―Institutions are <b>connected,</b> <b>access</b> the internet and communicate electronically. (Department of Education, 2004, pp. 37 - 40). This dissertation shows that it is feasible to create a communications’ network among South African schools. It is believed that such a network can add great value to the education system in South Africa. The potential for this network to address the gap in the Digital Divide is enormous. This dissertation examines various ICT communications’ technologies and isolates wireless communications’ technology as best suited for this purpose, due to the speeds offered by the technology and the cost structure associated with it.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 Heterojen kablosuz ağlar arasında kesintisiz el değiştirme, istenilen servis kalitesinin sağlanması için oldukça önemli bir konudur. Farklı teknolojilere sahip ağların birlikte çalışabilmesi için, birbirleri arasında kesintisiz dikey el değiştirme algoritmaları desteklenmelidir. Tez çalışmasında bir hücresel ağ ve bir kablosuz yerel ağdan (WLAN) oluşan heterojen bir ortam sunulmuştur. 4 G teknolojilerinin kullanılması ile birlikte, heterojen ağlar değerlendirilirken birçok ağ parametrelerinin ele alındığı dikey el değiştirme kararı (VHD) algoritması mevcuttur. Bu VHD algoritmaları çeşitli sınıflandırmalar altında incelenerek, kullanımları durumundaki avantaj ve eksiklikleri tespit edilmiştir. Bu çalışmada, rastgele hareket eden mobil kullanıcıların oldugu bir ortamda el degi¸stirme hatalarını, gereksiz el değiştirmeleri ve bağlantı kopmalarını en aza indirerek maksimum kullanıcı tecrübesinde {{optimize}} edilmiş bir VHD algoritması sunulmuştur. Bu sayede minimum seviyedeki servis kesintisiyle istenilen ağda en uzun süre bağlı kalınabilmektedir. El değiştirmenin gerekli olup olmadığını saptayan bu yöntemde iki VHD algoritması mevcuttur. Birincisi, kullanıcının belli bir ağdaki kapsama alanında ortalama alınan sinyal gücü (RSS) örnekleri ve kullanıcı hızı bilgisi ile hareket süresinin matematiksel bir model ile tahmin edilmesidir. İkinci algoritma ise, çeşitli ağ parametreleri ve el değiştirme hatası veya gereksiz el değiştirme olasılığı bilgilerine göre bir eşik zaman değeri hesaplamaktadır. El değiştirme hatası veya gereksiz el değiştirme olasılığı ifadeleri, bir ağdaki kapsama alanı içerisindeki giriş ve çıkış noktalarının düzgün dağılımda olduğu varsayımıyla geliştirilen matematiksel bir model ile üretir. Tahmin edilen toplam hareket süresi eşik zaman değeri ile karşılaştırılır ve sadece toplam hareket süresi eşik zaman değerinden uzun olduğu zaman el değiştirmenin gerekli olduğu kararı alınır. Kullanılan senaryoda, mobil kullanıcı WLAN içerisinde rastgele hareket ederek birçok yörünge çizmektedir. Rastgele hareket modelinden dolayı WLAN hücresi içerisindeki bu yörüngelerde yön değiştirmeler söz konusudur. Her bir yörünge için tanımlanan hareket vektörleri için sistemin başarım kriterleri olan gereksiz el değiştirme ve el değiştirme hata olasılıklarına ait eşik değerlere ve yolculuk süresine ait matematiksel ifadeler üretilmiştir. Tanımlanan matematiksel ifadeler ışığında, MATLAB ortamında Monte-Carlo yöntemi kullanılarak yinelemeli şekilde benzetimler yapılmıştır. Bu benzetimler, herhangi bir yörünge içerisindeki bir ve birden fazla vektör sayısı için karşılaştırılmalı olarak sunulmuştur. Sonuç olarak, hem gereksiz el değiştirme sayısının hem de el değiştirme hatası sayısının farklı yön değiştirmelerdeki artan kullanıcı hızına karşın değişimleri çıkartılmıştır. En sonunda ise toplam el değiştirme sayısı benzer şekilde verilerek, bu performans metriklerinin toplam el değiştirme sayısına oranları gösterilerek sistem hakkında daha detaylı bir analiz sağlanmıştır. Benzetim sonuçları değerlendirildiğinde, rastgele hareket modelinin etkisinden dolayı artan yön değiştirme sayısı ile WLAN hücresi içerisinde daha uzun süre kalındığı için gereksiz el değiştirme, el değiştirme hatası ve toplam el değiştirme sayılarının azalmakta olduğu gözlemlenmiştir. Bu çalışmada kullanılan gölgeleme etkisine ek olarak, kablosuz ortamdaki sönümleme etkisi de ele alınarak daha gerçekçi benzetimler çıkarılabilir. Ayrıca, birden fazla WLAN ve WiMAX ağlarının da birleşimiyle oluşturulacak heterojen ağlar ile mobil kullanıcılar için daha verimli bir dolaşım sağlanılabilir. Seamless handover is a {{major and}} critical issue to provide requested Quality of Service (QoS) in Next Generation Wireless Networks. The integration of heterogeneous networks technologies has been planned to be support for this issue. In this paper, a decision mechanism is proposed {{in order to provide}} an adaptive time which initiate to handover between cellular networks and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). Probability of handover failures and unnecessary handovers from cellular to WLAN are reduced and the schema is extended by using Random Waypoint Mobility (RWM) model. The handover necessity estimation consist of two phases: traveling time prediction and time threshold calculation. Next generation of wireless system requires providing real-time multimedia services any time anywhere with the required QoS. Mobile users expect to connect these services while they are on the move. In an environment of multiple heterogeneous access technologies, the concept of Always Best Connected (ABC) is defined as being connected in the most advantageous access technology according to available bandwidth, monetary cost, battery level, delay and security. Such ability to handover between heterogeneous networks is defined as vertical handovers. The new standards (e. g., IEEE 802. 21) create a framework to support protocols for establishing seamless vertical handovers. These standards provide only the overall framework, leaving the implementation of the actual algorithms to the system designer. Therefore, it is essential to develop efficient Vertical Handover Decision (VHD) algorithms to support the success of the handover frameworks. Various VHD algorithms have been presented in the literature to initiate handover at the appropriate time to the optimal network based on different criteria such as Received Signal Strength (RSS), bandwidth, cost function and combination of these metrics. A detailed survey and comparison of these proposed algorithms are provided in this thesis. These VHD algorithms have lack an extensive evaluation of various network parameters and/or require more detail for implementation. In general, there are two additional problems with the current VHD algorithms. Firstly, these algorithms lean to initiate handovers to low-cost and high-throughput WLANs whenever their coverage is available. For example, when Mobile Terminal (MT) travels around an area close to the coverage boundary of a WLAN at speeds above a certain limit, the handover process for connecting to the WLAN may start and not be completed before the MT leaves the WLAN coverage area. This situation may cause a connection breakdown and hence a network resource wastage as well as unnecessary battery consumption. Secondly, when the signal level from the <b>connected</b> <b>Access</b> Point (AP) is reduced and a handover is compulsory, the existing VHD algorithms for determining the handover triggering time are usually not adaptive to user mobility and network parameters. The handover to WLAN is preferable due to high data rates and low access cost; however, it intrinsically has limited coverage range for a fast moving MT, and hence it may cause unnecessary handovers. For vertical Handover Necessity Estimation (HNE) problem, the work of Yan et al. can be considered among one of the leading studies. This model provides a very lucid guiding for HNE and considers only Linear Mobility (LM). In this thesis, this model is extended by applying the random waypoint mobility for MT to emulate more realistic mobility scenario. This work proposes an optimized and extended vertical handover decision scheme, which includes minimum number of handover failures and unnecessary handovers whilst maximizing the user experience under the random waypoint mobility model. The handover necessity estimation unit decides the necessity of handover among all candidate networks. HNE processes various network parameters as its inputs and after some calculation produces a decision as its output. The inputs are the AP transmit power, RSS samples under shadowing effect, the distances between mobile terminal and access point, the speed of the MT, the handover latency, and the tolerable handover failure and unnecessary handover probability values. HNE has two elements, travel time estimation and time threshold calculation. The travel time is estimated by using these inputs. Then, HNE compares the estimated travel time against the desired time threshold value: if the travel time is greater than the threshold, "a handover is necessary" decision is given; otherwise "a handover is unnecessary" decision generated as an output. HNE executes this process for all the candidate networks with all trajectories and gives a necessity decision for each of them. As a consequence of this research, the optimum connection point with a preferred access network with the minimum probability of connection breakdowns. Also, this result is presented the HNE algorithm in both mobility models such as RWM and LM. In this thesis, a MT follows multiple trajectories using random waypoint model. Due to RWM effect, each trajectory can be comprised movement vectors in the WLAN cell. Some mathematical expressions are generated for traveling time of MT and thresholds for unnecessary handovers and handover failures that are stated as performance metrics of the system for each movement vector. In the light of this mathematical expressions, these performance metrics are simulated iteratively in the MATLAB using Monte-Carlo method. Results are presented compartively for one or more vectors in a trajectory. Finally, variation of number of unnecessary handovers and handover failures are produced against increasing MT speed in a condition of different number of direction changes. Similary, total number of handover is given and ratios of these metrics to total number of handover are calculated for deeper analysis about the proposed system. According to result of simulations, it is observed that number of unnecessary handover, handover failure and total number of handover are decreasing due to random waypoint model effect since it provides longer traveling time through multiple direction changes. In the conclusion and future work chapter, a fading effect may be considered in a network coverage as well as shadowing in order to examine more realistic network enviroment. Besides, more than one heterogeneous networks such as WLAN and WiMAX may be involved for better user satisfaction. For this, researchers can measure on real test beds in order to observe ultimate evaluation. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
