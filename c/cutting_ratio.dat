40|$|A method, {{based on}} {{experimental}} information, of relating the energy {{required for the}} orthogonal cutting of titanium alloys with the chip geometry and the mechanical properties of the material, is discussed. The solution is obtained from {{the extension of the}} apparent strain analysis of orthogonal cutting of ductile materials to the case of less ductile materials which exhibit segmental chip formation. The apparent equivalent strain is defined as the strain which bounds an area under the equivalent stress-strain diagram equal to the total specific energy of the process, and includes the real strain experienced by the material and a frictional component. The mean equivalent strain undergone by the material during deformation is found from this apparent equivalent strain, and the work done per unit volume of material removed in overcoming the total resistance to the movement of the chip at the tool face, thus itis unnecessary to define a model of chip formation. The mean equivalent strain is shown to be a smaller proportion of the apparent equivalent strain for titanium alloys than for ductile materials when cut under similar conditions. This agrees with observations of chip fcrmation which indicate fracture of the titanium alloy chips after limited plastic deformation. The mean equivalent strain in conditions of segmental chip formation is thus considered to represent the sum of plastic deformation and fracture energies. A practical method of determining the <b>cutting</b> <b>ratio</b> of segmental chips, as a ratio of areas before and after chip deformation, is described.
