5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most <b>common</b> <b>procedure</b> is {{sighting}} the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E
5|$|At {{the appeal}} hearing at the {{regional}} court in Dresden, in the morning 1 July 2009, nine people {{were present in the}} courtroom: three judges, the prosecutor, Wiens as the defendant, his court-appointed defence counsel, El-Sherbini as witness for the prosecution, and her husband and son as observers. No security personnel were present and no security searches of individuals and their possessions were carried out; this was a <b>common</b> <b>procedure</b> for cases without anticipated security concerns or detained persons present.|$|E
5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most <b>common</b> <b>procedure,</b> the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E

25|$|A {{buoyancy}} assisted lift is a <b>common</b> <b>procedure</b> {{for recreational}} divers {{to assist the}} recovery of the shotline or anchor, which would otherwise be pulled up manually. A small lift bag attached to the shot is partially filled by the last diver to leave the bottom, and after surfacing the crew pull up the line and the air in the bag expands as it ascends, providing more assistance to the crew. In this application a runaway lift is not usually a problem, and the bag size is not critical.|$|E
25|$|The {{music for}} Plan 9 from Outer Space was {{compiled}} by Gordon Zahler. Zahler used stock recordings {{of works by}} about a dozen composers, which was a fairly <b>common</b> <b>procedure</b> in the 1950s for scoring low-budget films and television programs. However, Zahler apparently never provided a reliable accounting for the score. In 1996, Paul Mandell produced a CD that recreated the film's score by tracking down the stock recordings and the composers; Mandell subsequently wrote {{an article about the}} film's music for Film Score Monthly. Some websites give proper credit to these composers.|$|E
25|$|Slab {{stabilization}} {{does not}} correct depressions, increase the design structural capacity, stop erosion or eliminate faulting. It does, however, restore the slab support, therefore, decreasing deflections under the load. Stabilization {{should only be}} performed at joints and cracks where loss of support exists. Visual inspection is the simplest manner to find voids. Signs that repair is needed are transverse joint faulting, corner breaks and shoulder drop off and lines at or near joints and cracks. Deflection testing is another <b>common</b> <b>procedure</b> utilized to locate voids. It is recommended to do this testing at night as during cooler temperatures, joints open, aggregate interlock diminishes and load deflections are at their highest.|$|E

25|$|<b>Common</b> <b>procedure</b> {{was that}} the {{secondary}} helicopter escorted a heavily damaged primary helicopter back to base, but Kennedy was asked to return to continue the pickup attempts of the F-4 backseater, Tempest 03B, Kennedy's first actual attempt at combat rescue. On the first try, his aircraft was hit and both enlisted men slightly wounded. The HH-3E was driven off by fire four times, taking more battle damage on each pass. Despite deteriorating weather conditions, a rupture in their forward fuel tank, and smoke in the aircraft, Kennedy's three crewmen joined him in wanting to try again. In the poor weather, Williamson noted that better reference points were {{on the left side}} of the aircraft and urged that Lt. Harris conduct the hover.|$|E
25|$|The French army doctor Ambroise Paré, born in 1510, {{revived the}} ancient Greek method of tying off blood vessels. After {{amputation}} the <b>common</b> <b>procedure</b> was to cauterize the open {{end of the}} amputated appendage to stop the haemorrhaging. This was done by heating oil, water, or metal and touching it to the wound to seal off the blood vessels. Pare also believed in dressing wounds with clean bandages and ointments, including one he made himself composed of eggs, oil of roses, and turpentine. He {{was the first to}} design artificial hands and limbs for amputation patients. On one of the artificial hands, the two pairs of fingers could be moved for simple grabbing and releasing tasks and the hand look perfectly natural underneath a glove.|$|E
25|$|Hubertia had 14 student {{members in}} Summer of 1920, {{a large number}} at that time, {{especially}} considering {{that they were all}} forestry students as all other members had to remain in Karlsruhe for the time being, as their departments had not moved and switching universities was a complicated procedure. The first weeks in Freiburg were filled with establishing regular meetings to celebrate or fence. Official fencing relationships, so-called Paukverhältnisse, were established with the other local Corps in Freiburg's league of corps (SC) and the fraternity Turnerschaft Markomanno-Albertia. Establishing this fencing relationship allowing regular fencing practice and duels to take place was back then the <b>common</b> <b>procedure</b> for a Corps to {{become a member of the}} local League of Corps at a university location, a tradition that has not changed to this day. This step was supported by the ge and Corps Suevia Freiburg who were hoping to increase the number of students from Baden (lower Germany) to counteract the rising number of students from the north of Germany in Freiburg's fraternity landscape.|$|E
