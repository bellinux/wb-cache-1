60|$|You {{may wish}} to know how Butterfield finally beat me. I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{particulars}} now, but will when I see you. In the meantime let it be understood I am not greatly dissatisfied,--I wish the offer had been so bestowed as to encourage our friends in future contests, and I regret exceedingly Mr. Edwards' feelings towards me. These two things away, I should have no regrets,--at least I think I would not.|$|E

I think there is a good reason, and, at any rate, I have decided that you are not to go. If you are a good girl, and do not make any difficulty, you can have your little chair out upon the front door-step, and can see the chaise come to the door, and see your father and me get in and drive away; and you can wave your {{handkerchief}} to us for a good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How these children's minds do run!" [...] exclaimed old aunt Dorothea {{staring at}} little Pierre in amazement--"That indeed {{is more than}} I can tell you, little Pierre. But cousin Ralph had a foolish fancy about it. He used to tell me, that being in your father's room some {{few days after the}} last scene I described, he noticed there a very {{wonderful}} work on Physiognomy, as they call it, in which the strangest and shadowiest rules were laid down for detecting people's innermost secrets by studying their faces. And so, foolish cousin Ralph always flattered himself, that the reason your father did not want his portrait taken was, because he was secretly in love with the French young lady, and did not want his secret published in a portrait; since the wonderful work on Physiognomy had, as it were, indirectly warned him against running that risk. But cousin Ralph being such a retired and solitary sort of a youth, he always had such curious whimsies about things. For my part, I don't believe your father ever had any such ridiculous ideas on the subject. To be sure, I myself <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> why he did not want his picture taken; but when you get to be as old as I am, little Pierre, you will find that every one, even the best of us, at times, is apt to act very queerly and unaccountably; indeed some things we do, we can not entirely explain the reason of, even to ourselves, little Pierre. But you will know all about these strange matters by and by." ...|$|E

Like any process occurring on a large scale, intensive energy use impacts the world. For example, climate change, nuclear waste storage, and deforestation may {{be some of the}} consequences of supplying our growing energy demands from hydrocarbon fuels, nuclear fission, or biomass.|$|R
2500|$|Part of {{the problem}} all along has been the {{automatic}} assumption {{on the part of}} many that Rowling has the right to completely control anything written about the Harry Potter world. That's quite a huge power grab on her part and from everything I <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>not</b> legal. <b>You</b> and I are part of a subculture that lives off the creative work of others. We always try to do that in a legal and respectful way. However, if Rowling manages to extend her reach that far into our subculture, she will choke us off very quickly. And if she doesn't, what's to stop the next person from taking this legal precedent to even more dangerous places? ...|$|R
60|$|The royal {{historians of}} Oz, who are fine writers and know {{any number of}} big words, have often tried to {{describe}} the rare beauty of Ozma and failed because the words were not good enough. So of course I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> hope to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how great was the charm of this little Princess, or how her loveliness put to shame all the sparkling jewels and magnificent luxury that surrounded her in this her royal palace. Whatever else was beautiful or dainty or delightful of itself faded to dullness when contrasted with Ozma's bewitching face, and {{it has often been}} said by those who know that no other ruler in all the world can ever hope to equal the gracious charm of her manner.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, the {{organization}} Zero-to-Three: National Center for Infants, Toddlers, and Families also {{plays an important}} role in research and advocacy for infants and toddlers. Zero-to-Three was responsible for creating the Diagnostic Classification: 0-3 (DC:0-3) and more recently a revised version (DC:0-3R) that allows mental health professionals to give a mental health diagnosis to infants, toddlers, and their relationships with their caregivers when suffering and dysfunction reach a level suggestive of psychopathology that requires intervention. [...] Supported by empirical research, Zero-to-Three and WAIMH have both advocated for the notion that just because babies <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> their symptoms, does not mean that they do not suffer from mental health problems. A number of states have infant mental health organizations affiliated with WAIMH and Zero-to-Three.|$|E

Then Chaitanya das told to him: [...] " [...] My dear Sannyasi, you are a great preacher. Can I do you any favor? Is there anything you need?" [...] The sannyasi said: [...] "No, my dear Chaitanya das, what I want, I will not tell you." [...] Chaitanya das said: [...] "What you mean, you will not tell me? You can not say this! I am a grhasta and I have my vows and I will treat the sannyasis properly. Please do not hesitate, if you need something special, tell me!" [...] "No!", said the sannyasi: [...] "I will not tell you. I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> You will not like that." [...] Hearing this Caitanya das became even more eager to serve the sannyasi, insisting: [...] "You must tell me.

40|$|Network {{administrators are}} always striving {{to get as}} {{complete}} picture as possible of the usage of their network. One technology commonly used for this is flow analysis where information about packets containing the same common attributes are summarised into a flow record. The common attributes are refered to as the flow key and are usually the source and destination IP addresses and ports and the protocol type. The flow records contain information about the flow key {{as well as information}} like number of bytes and packets in the flow, start and stop of the flow and source destination AS numbers. The most common flow analysis technology used today is Netflow version 5 from Cisco, and IETF is currently standardizing Netflow in the IPFIX[1] working group. One problem with these technologies is that while they can provide a lot of information for general use of the network, they provide very little information about the end-to-end quality of service that users get. IPFIX can for example easily give you information about which IP addresses that sends the most traffic, but it can not say anything about the burstiness of this traffic. It can also tell you how much traffic you send to one specific AS number, but it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> who initiated the traffic. Was it someone in your own network that started sending data to this AS, or was it a user in the AS that started to download things from your network...|$|E
