A contact model of the conductor and the clamp was established by using finite element method. The effects of sag angle of the conductor, holding force and tension force in section are analyzed. The {{results showed that the}} contact area {{in the middle of the}} clamp is of belt-like type. The extreme values of tress were observed on the edge of the contact area and near the edge of keeper. In <b>clamp</b> <b>section,</b> suspension angle had the greatest influence on contact stress, and then the clamp force. The tension force in section played a most important role in these affecting factors. In the exit section of clamp, the biggest impact factor was tension force in this section, then the suspension angle, the third was clamp force. The results provide theoretical basis on reducing corona loss, optimization the clamp. Doubtlessly, the conclusion has important theoretical significance and application value...|$|E

Additionally, the rotary motor, as designed, {{can be used as a}} clutch/brake mechanism. Constructed prototype motors of both types along with their characteristics are presented. The torsional motor consists of a torsional section that provides angular displacement and torque, and two alternating <b>clamping</b> <b>sections</b> which provide the holding force. The motor relies on the principal piezoelectric coupling coefficient (d 33) with no torsional elements, increasing its torque capability. The linear motor consists of a longitudinal vibrator that provides displacement and load, and two alternating <b>clamping</b> <b>sections</b> which provide the holding force. This design eliminates bending moment, tension and shear applied to the actuator elements, increase its load capability and life. Innovative flexure designs have been introduced for both motor types.

50|$|Jack posts are {{telescopic}} {{tubular steel}} props {{consisting of two}} primary parts, {{the main part of}} the post, and the jack screw or other adjustable fitting on the end. Both ends are normally fitted with flat metal plates on the end, providing additional support area. Most jack posts are split in two near the middle, with the upper end carrying the jack designed to slide within the lower portion. Gross adjustment for length is first made by pulling a pin and sliding the two sections within each other until they almost fill the gap, inserting the pin to lock them, then using the screw to close any remaining gap. Other designs used two threaded pipes instead of sliding <b>sections,</b> <b>clamping</b> <b>sections,</b> or other similar concepts to lock the system at a specific length.|$|R
40|$|A piezoworm {{step-and-repeat}} type actuator {{is being}} developed which uses complementary configurations for the two <b>clamping</b> <b>sections.</b> The <b>clamps</b> engage on opposite extremes of the common clamp signalâ€”while one clamp engages with high voltage, the other releases at high voltage and vice versa for low voltage. This allows the actuator to be driven with a two-channel controller {{instead of the usual}} three-channel controller. A diode-shunted delay circuit that causes unclamping to occur more slowly than clamping can be added in series with each clamp. This increases the overall force drive capability of the actuator. The performance is also influenced by the timing of the common clamp signal relative to the extender signal as well as the signal waveform shapes. In this paper, the dynamic model of the actuator is presented which includes the electrical, mechanical and friction behaviour of the piezomotor components. This model is then used to assess different voltage waveforms input to the actuator and delay circuit resistances in order to optimize the performance...|$|R

The required function of the bendings is chosen {{in the form of}} a sum of the corresponding beam function and a biharmonic function, which is a series in terms of unorthogonal eigenfunctions of the problem. The eigenfunctions satisfy the homogenous boundary conditions on the longitudinal edges (the clamped and the opposite ones). It is suggested to find series coefficients from the condition of the minimum residuals effect on the corresponding displacements of the transverse edges. It leads to an infinite system of linear algebraic equations for the required coefficients in the complex form. The coefficients of homogenous solutions were found for the cases in which the approximating series contained sequentially 2, 3, [...] ., 7 terms.

40|$|This {{project was}} carried out at Sandvik Coromant in Sandviken. The {{objective}} was to investigate how the machining dynamics was influences by the workpiece and different positions of the fixtures. The project consisted of two parts: investigation of one simple beam model to gain {{knowledge and understanding of}} the problem and secondly: study of alternative clamping positions for a jet engine turbine exhaust case. For both cases natural frequencies, mode shapes, frequency response functions and machining stability was investigated. For the beam model the natural frequency changes resulting from machining were found to have specific patterns which were dependent on the boundary conditions. The changing natural frequencies were reflected on to the stability lobes. In order to maximize the production rate the spindle speed should be altered to natural frequencies changes. The natural frequencies can change considerably when the beam cross section is machined down. The mode shapes of the beam is however fairly unchanged. This makes it possible to choose a good position of an additional support based on knowledge of the original beam. A position of an additional support at a node point for a particular mode maximizes the natural frequency for the mode one number lower. A position of the support near the middle of the beam minimizes the highest flexibility that occurs and also maximizes the first natural frequency for a prismatic beam. For the jet engine casing six lower and six upper <b>clamping</b> <b>sections</b> with a 30 degree phase shift was found to have both the highest first natural frequencies and the highest machining stability limits of the investigates cases. Locking the casing in three symmetrically positioned sections of its lower flange gives the lowest first natural frequencies, of the investigated cases, followed by six sections and twelve sections.

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, {{manually operated}} tool enables precise bending (typically, within 1 / 2 of the specified bend angle) of a metal tube {{located in a}} confined space, {{with a minimum of}} flattening of the tube and without significant gouging of the tube surface. The tool is designed for use in {{a situation in which the}} tube cannot be removed from the confined space for placement in a conventional benchmounted tube bender. The tool is also designed for use in a situation in which previously available hand-held tube benders do not afford the required precision, do not support the tube wall sufficiently to prevent flattening or gouging, and/or do not fit within the confined space. The tool is designed and fabricated for the specific outer diameter and bend radius of the tube to be bent. The tool (see figure) includes a clamping/radius block and a top clamping block that contain mating straight channels of semicircular cross section that fit snugly around the tube. The mating portions of the clamping/radius block and the top clamping block are clamped around a length of the tube that is adjacent to the bend and that is intended to remain straight. The clamping/radius block is so named because beyond the straight <b>clamping</b> <b>section,</b> its semicircular channel extends to a non-clamping section that is curved at the specified bend radius. A pivot hole is located in the clamping/radius block at the center of the bend circle. The tool includes a bending block that, like the other blocks, contains a straight semicircular channel that fits around the outside of the tube. The bending block contains a pivot hole to be aligned with the pivot hole in the clamping/radius block. Once the tube has been clamped between the clamping/ radius and top clamping blocks, the bending block is placed around the tube, the pivot holes are aligned, and a pivot pin is inserted through the pivot holes...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Temporary {{interruption}} of {{cerebral blood flow}} during carotid endarterectomy can be avoided by using a shunt across the <b>clamped</b> <b>section</b> of the carotid artery. This may improve outcome. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 1996 and previously updated in 2001. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of routine versus selective, or never, shunting during carotid endarterectomy, and to assess the best method for selecting patients for shunting. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched September 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2008), EMBASE (1980 to November 2008) and Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (1980 to November 2008). We handsearched journals and conference proceedings, checked reference lists, and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of routine shunting compared with no shunting or selective shunting, and trials that compared different shunting policies in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed the searches and applied the inclusion criteria. We identified one new relevant randomised controlled trial. MAIN RESULTS: We included four trials in the review: three trials involving 686 patients compared routine shunting with no shunting; the other trial involving 131 patients compared shunting {{with a combination of}} electroencephalographic and carotid pressure measurement with shunting by carotid pressure measurement alone. Allocation was adequately concealed in one trial, and one trial was quasi-randomised. Analysis was by intention-to-treat where possible.

There was no significant difference between the risk of ipsilateral stroke in patients selected for shunting with the combination of electroencephalographic and carotid pressure assessment compared to pressure assessment alone, although again the data were limited. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review concluded that the data available were too limited to either support or refute the use of routine or selective shunting in carotid endarterectomy. It was suggested that large scale randomised trials between routine shunting versus selective shunting were required.

Searched reference lists from all relevant trials All the authors of studies included in the initial review, and other authors known to have published relevant work, were contacted requesting information about further published or unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of routine shunting compared with no shunting or selective shunting, and trials that compared different shunting policies in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For the original review two reviewers independently performed the searches and applied the inclusion criteria. The data were extracted by one reviewer and double-checked. Trial quality was assessed. During the update, two reviewers independently performed the searches and applied the inclusion criteria. No new relevant randomised controlled trials were found. MAIN RESULTS: Despite recommendation from the original review that further studies were required, no new trials of adequate quality and fitting the inclusion criteria were found. The initial review included three trials. Two trials involving 590 patients compared routine shunting with no shunting. The other trial involving 131 patients compared shunting with a combination of electroencephalographic and carotid pressure measurement, with shunting by carotid pressure measurement alone.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} macro and {{microscopic}} {{evaluation of the}} damage caused by <b>clamping</b> or <b>section</b> of cervical sympathetic nerve in rabbits, quantifying the collagen in the lesions. METHODS: Twenty rabbits were divided into two groups of ten, doing in group 1 (section) section of the right cervical sympathetic nerve, while in group 2 (clipping) clipping of the nerve. All rabbits were induced to death on the seventh day after surgery. The macroscopic variables were: consequences of nerve lesion, clip appearance, presence of infection and adhesions around the nerve. Microscopy used hematoxylin-eosin staining to evaluate the stages and the degree of inflammation and necrosis, and F 3 BA Picrosirius red staining to quantify collagen. Mann-Whitney test was used for comparisons of collagen types I and III between groups. Fisher exact test analyzed the macroscopic variables, the degree of inflammation and necrosis. RESULTS: There was no discontinuity of nerve injury in the clipping group, as well as the clip was closed in all animals. The presence of severe adhesions was significantly higher in the clipping group (p< 0. 05). There was no significant difference on other variables macroscopically analyzed. There {{was no significant difference between}} groups regarding the type of inflammatory process and its intensity, as well as the presence of necrosis and collagen deposition in the nerves. CONCLUSIONS: In the macroscopic evaluation, the section caused discontinuity, which did not occur in the clamping group; there was no development of local infection; the clipping of the cervical sympathetic nerve was linked to the presence of a greater number of adhesions in comparison to the section group. Microscopically, no difference existed in relation to the type and intensity of inflammation reaction between the groups; occurred predominance of chronic and severe inflammation on the specimens; the necrosis was noticed equally in both groups; there was predominance of type I collagen deposition in relation to type III in both groups...|$|R
