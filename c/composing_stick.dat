2500|$|The {{linotype}} machine ( [...] ) is a [...] "line casting" [...] machine used in printing {{sold by the}} Mergenthaler Linotype Company and related companies. It was a hot metal typesetting system that cast blocks of metal type for individual uses. Linotype {{became one of the}} mainstay methods to set type, especially small-size body text, for newspapers, magazines and posters from the late 19thcentury to the 1970s and 1980s, when it was largely replaced by phototypesetting, offset lithography printing and computer typesetting. The name of the machine {{comes from the fact that}} it produces an entire line of metal type at once, hence a line-o'-type, a significant improvement over the previous industry standard, i.e.,manual, letter-by-letter typesetting using a <b>composing</b> <b>stick</b> and drawers of letters.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, {{it rather}} {{encroaches}} on my respected predecessor's fame for prudence and wisdom--Sed semel insanivimus omnes--everybody has played the fool in their turn. It is said, my ancestor, during his apprenticeship with the descendant of old Faust, whom popular tradition hath {{sent to the}} devil {{under the name of}} Faustus, was attracted by a paltry slip of womankind, his master's daughter, called Bertha--they broke rings, or went through some idiotical ceremony, as is usual on such idle occasions as the plighting of a true-love troth, and Aldobrand set out on his journey through Germany, as became an honest hand-werker; for such was the custom of mechanics at that time, to make a tour through the empire, and work at their trade for a time in each of the most eminent towns, before they finally settled themselves for life. It was a wise custom; for, as such travellers were received like brethren in each town by those of their own handicraft, they were sure, in every case, to have the means either of gaining or communicating knowledge. When my ancestor returned to Nuremburg, he is said to have found his old master newly dead, and two or three gallant young suitors, some of them half-starved sprigs of nobility forsooth, in pursuit of the Yung-fraw Bertha, whose father was understood to have bequeathed her a dowry which might weigh against sixteen armorial quarters. But Bertha, not a bad sample of womankind, had made a vow she would only marry that man who would work her father's press. The skill, at that time, was as rare as wonderful; besides that the expedient rid her at once of most of her gentle suitors, who would have as soon wielded a conjuring wand as a <b>composing</b> <b>stick.</b> Some of the more ordinary typographers made the attempt: but none were sufficiently possessed of the mystery--But I tire you." ...|$|E
50|$|Early <b>composing</b> <b>sticks</b> {{were made}} of wood, but later iron, brass, steel, aluminium, pewter and other metals were used. Wooden <b>composing</b> <b>sticks</b> {{continued}} {{to be made in}} large sizes into the nineteenth century, for setting wood letter and other large sizes of type for display. In the industrial age, <b>composing</b> <b>sticks</b> were manufactured by many companies, but notably in America by the H. B. Rouse company, which made <b>composing</b> <b>sticks</b> that were adjustable to the half pica, as well as a stick containing a micrometer that was infinitely adjustable. Some sticks were marked in agates as well, to aid in newspaper and advertisement composition.|$|R
50|$|In typography, the stick, stickful, or {{stick of}} type was an inexact length {{based on the}} size of the various <b>composing</b> <b>sticks</b> used by {{newspaper}} editors to assemble pieces of moveable type. In English-language papers, it was roughly equal to 2 column inches or 100-150 words. In France, Spain, and Italy, sticks generally contained only between 1 and 4 lines of text each. A column was notionally equal to 10 sticks.|$|R

The Museum contains a large collection of priting types, displacing a fraction of it's large collections of type cases for different font sizes from small lead and types including large carved pear-wood type, as well as composing tools and <b>composing</b> <b>sticks.</b> The Printing Room houses a collection from the Eickhoff factory in Copenhagen which was active from the 1890s until the mid-20th century.|$|R
50|$|Like its diet, {{the black}} hawk-eagle's {{breeding}} behaviour is little known other than some details relating to its nest: <b>composed</b> of <b>sticks</b> and possibly other materials, the nest is around one metre {{and a half}} in total diameter and is usually constructed in tall trees, often around fifteen metres high. The variety of tree chosen probably varies greatly, but they have been observed chiefly in pine trees.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{occurs during}} the months of September to November. Lizard buzzards are monogamous and form pair bonds that are {{protected}} or permanent. Both sexes are involved in nest building which is small and compact, <b>composed</b> of <b>sticks</b> and found in the sub canopy of trees both indigenous and alien, often near the main trunk of the tree. The stick nest is lined with dry grass,green leaves or lichen.|$|R

5000|$|Females {{sometimes}} nest {{close to}} sites used the previous year; occasionally, nest-sites may be re-used. The female alone builds the dome-shaped nest, {{which has a}} side entrance; it is <b>composed</b> of <b>sticks,</b> fern fronds, rootlets, bark, pieces of palm leaf and moss, and is lined with moss, fine plant material and feathers. Construction of the nest may take at least three weeks. [...] The overall appearance is rather like a pile of accumulated rainforest debris, which make the nest quite inconspicuous.|$|R
5000|$|Mexican fox {{squirrels}} typically {{produce a}} single small litter of 1 or 2 young {{in late spring}} or summer. [...] Mexican fox squirrels nest in ball-shaped dreys <b>composed</b> of <b>sticks</b> and leaves in trees; cavities within large trees are occasionally used, especially by nursing females. They are known to communally nest at times. Mexican fox squirrels are notably silent and appear to prefer to seek cover and remain motionless. If startled, they may bark and chuck from safe locations in trees.|$|R
50|$|Except {{during the}} {{breeding}} season, the red-bellied grackle is usually seen in small, noisy {{groups in the}} canopy. Sometimes these are mixed flocks with other grackles, and sometimes they may include Oropendolas. The grackles feed on fruit and insects, scrambling about among the branches and foliage, and sometimes clinging upside down. Breeding takes place between March and August. The nest is a cup-shaped structure in the fork of a tree, loosely <b>composed</b> of <b>sticks</b> and dead leaves. The eggs are greenish-grey, blotched and streaked with dark brown and lilac. The giant cowbird (Molothrus oryzivorus) sometimes lays its eggs in the grackle's nest.|$|R

50|$|The roadrunner's nest {{is often}} <b>composed</b> of <b>sticks,</b> and may {{sometimes}} contain leaves, feathers, snakeskins, or dung. It is commonly placed 1-3 meters {{above ground level}} in a low tree, bush, or cactus. Roadrunner eggs are generally white. The greater roadrunner generally lays 2-6 eggs per clutch, but the lesser roadrunner's clutches are typically smaller. Hatching is asynchronous. Both sexes incubate the nest (with males incubating the nest at night) and feed the hatchlings. For {{the first one to}} two weeks after the young hatch, one parent remains at the nest. The young leave the nest at two to three weeks old, foraging with parents for a few days after.|$|R
50|$|The species constrycts well-lined {{cup-shaped}} nests, <b>composed</b> of moss, <b>sticks,</b> grass, straw fragments, {{and colored}} threads, in forest {{borders on the}} edge of pine branches, 15-20 m from the ground. The nests are concealed with epiphytes and mosses. Information on specific breeding patterns is limited, but it is known that females lay 2-3 eggs and incubate them for 12-14 days, and that nestlings remain in the nest for 18-22 days.|$|R
60|$|On the {{outskirts}} of our old peach orchard, described in a former chapter, there was a solitary tree of a somewhat singular shape, standing about forty yards from the others {{on the edge of}} a piece of waste weedy land. It was a big old tree like the others, and had a smooth round trunk standing about fourteen feet high and throwing out branches all round, so that its upper part had the shape of an open inverted umbrella. And in the convenient hollow formed by the circle of branches the caranchos had built their huge nest, <b>composed</b> of <b>sticks,</b> lumps of turf, dry bones of sheep and other animals, pieces of rope and raw hide, and any other object they could carry. The nest was their home; they roosted in it by night and visited it at odd times during the day, usually bringing a bleached bone or thistle- stalk or some such object to add to the pile.|$|R

50|$|Weld County was {{thrust into}} the media {{spotlight}} {{on the evening of}} November 1, 1955, when United Airlines Flight 629, a Douglas DC-6B airliner flying from Denver to Portland, Oregon, exploded in midair and crashed, killing all 44 persons on board the plane and scattering bodies, wreckage and debris over a six-square-mile area of the county. The subsequent investigation of the accident revealed that Denver resident John Gilbert Graham had secretly placed a time bomb <b>composed</b> of 25 <b>sticks</b> of dynamite in a suitcase belonging to his mother, who was a passenger on the airplane.

50|$|The bulky, untidy nest is a dome-shape {{structure}} <b>composed</b> {{of small}} <b>sticks,</b> grass and dry leaves. The inside {{is lined with}} finer twigs, tendrils and some dry leaves. It is placed 2 to 4 metres above ground in the fork of a sapling, or in the thorny and leafy branches of Acacia, Ziziphus, Ximenia or Dichrostachys. A projecting lip beside the side entrance {{is used as a}} landing platform. Egg-laying takes place from November to December in southeastern Africa, and the birds fall silent once incubation starts. Three to four eggs are laid, that are white or cream in colour, and flecked with grey and blackish-brown near the thicker end. The nestlings are altricial and nidicolous.|$|R
