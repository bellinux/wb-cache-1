5|$|Industry representatives <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> final rule overstated the {{environmental}} effects of corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of ILUC as an unfair penalty to domestic corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} was being tied to U.S. ethanol production. The 2011 limit for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol failed, unless current carbon intensity was reduced. Oil industry representatives <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> standard left oil refiners with few options, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, with its accompanying tariff. CARB officials and environmentalists counter that time and economic incentives will allow produces to adapt.|$|E

5|$|The Secretary {{noted that}} no other firm had <b>complained,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hobbs {{mechanism}} had not been widely sold, and that the changes demanded—a clear space around the rim and the flattening of the Indian's cheekbone—would affect the artistic merit of the piece.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} after opening, the Uno Chicago Grill was sued for not paying the builders, suppliers, and utilities. It soon {{changed its name to}} La Sha's West Virginia Bistro and was headed by Powerball winner Jack Whittaker; however, it closed on February 22, 2007 after another lawsuit was filed after Metropolitan Huntington LLC <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bistro owed {{thousands}} for rent.|$|E
5|$|Despite its name, {{the college}} taught no classes in agriculture, instead concentrating on {{classical}} studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics. After four years, students could attain degrees in scientific agriculture, civil and mining engineering, and language and literature. Local farmers <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> college was abusing its mission, and, in November 1879, {{the president and}} faculty were replaced and given a mandated curriculum in agriculture and engineering.|$|E
5|$|The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees was {{initially}} composed of Bomis' three founders: Jimmy Wales {{and his two}} business partners, Michael Davis and Tim Shell. Shell and Davis were appointed to the board by Wales, but after Wikipedia community members <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> board was composed of appointed individuals, the first elections were held in 2004. Two community members, Florence Devouard and Angela Beesley, were elected to the Board of Trustees.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} critics and {{was described as}} another entry {{in a long line}} of poorly developed movie tie-ins. Reviewers enjoyed the opportunity to play as a Predator, but <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game was too easy and not rewarding, particularly the simple artificial intelligence of enemies. The visuals and audio of the game were also considered of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|The negatives {{were sold}} by Hap Gilliland of the Council for Indian Education to the Buffalo Bill Historical Center museum in Cody, Wyoming. Mader <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> negatives {{had been a}} gift to the Cheyenne people, and that their proper home was in the John Woodenlegs Memorial Library in Lame Deer on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. The Smithsonian Institution and The Little Bighorn National Monument museum hold a few other Marquis negatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} LP {{cover was}} designed as a spoof of a 12x16-inch (305x406mm) 12-page small-town English newspaper, entitled The St. Cleve Chronicle and Linwell Advertiser, with articles, competitions and advertisements lampooning the typical parochial and amateurish journalism of the local English press. The band's record company, Chrysalis Records, <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sleeve would be too expensive to produce, but Anderson countered that if a real newspaper could be produced, a parody of one would also be practical.|$|E

5|$|The report {{made several}} recommendations, {{including}} {{the creation of}} a set of national principles emphasizing the minimum use of force at all times, and making the display of police ID a legal requirement. In February 2010 the Met announced that 8,000 of its officers had been issued with embroidered epaulettes, as several had <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> numbers were falling off, rather than being removed deliberately.|$|E
5|$|The team {{conducted}} intense preparations {{during the}} spring and fall practices before the 1940 season. On one occasion, Stanford athletic director Al Masters angrily <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> maintenance department had left on the practice field lights, only to be told that the team was still practicing. In one scrimmage, the varsity offense managed only a single touchdown against the freshman team, which prompted Shaughnessy to secretly draft a single-wing playbook in the event that the T formation failed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E

5|$|Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, {{was given}} on 3 March 1942. Using a French ship would involve using the Free French forces and {{increase}} the number of people aware of the raid. Consequently, it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own. The RAF <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> raid would draw heavily on their resources; the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command was reduced time and time again before the day of the raid. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were clearly identified.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its celebrity {{endorsements}} and infomercials, Proactiv {{is one of the most}} popular skincare brands of all time, according to the Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology. Sales amounted to $800 million a year as of 2010, with a media budget of nearly $200 million and $12–15 million for celebrity fees. The product is mostly sold online as part of a continuity program. A month after ordering, customers are sent a three-month supply, which continues until the subscription is cancelled. Customers have <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> subscriptions are hard to cancel.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library {{publications}} such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which pointed out the complexity, depth and consistency of the world Rowling had built) {{attracted the attention of}} reviewers in major newspapers. Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> final chapters were the weakest part of the book, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.|$|E

5|$|Benedict Arnold next wrote {{a series}} of letters to Clinton, even before he might have {{expected}} {{a response to the}} July 7 letter. In a July 11 letter, he <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made. On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to £20,000 (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a £1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, Wayne ordered Scott's {{volunteers to}} conduct {{numerous}} raids within a fifty-mile radius of their position. Due {{to a lack}} of pack horses in Wayne's force, the mounted volunteers were also employed transporting supplies between forts throughout September 1794. They eventually grew weary of garrison duty and <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use of their personal horses to transport goods had injured the animals. Many threatened to mutiny if not discharged. On October 13, 1794, Wayne finally ordered them home. In a commendation of Wayne issued on December 4, 1794, the U.S. House of Representatives specifically thanked Scott and his men for their service at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Treaty of Greenville formally ended the war in mid-1795.|$|E
5|$|For the American forces, abuses were {{typically}} either a disproportionate use of firepower or servicemen committing extrajudicial killings (such as in Haditha). Many accusations {{of human rights}} violations against the United States were connected with the First and Second Battles of Fallujah. Following the assault, the United States military admitted it had employed white phosphorus artillery rounds, the use of which is not permitted in civilian areas under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Several Marines, all {{of them from the}} 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, were later charged (but not convicted) with executing Iraqi prisoners. Some British advisers also <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Marines had little regard for civilian casualties and had used munitions containing depleted uranium that caused birth defects for years after the battle.|$|E

50|$|The {{area around}} Calzada de la Ronda {{is filled with}} stored selling mostly used auto parts as well as {{informal}} mechanics. This has caused problems for neighbors who <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> businesses block sidewalks and streets with merchandise and cars under repair. The city has stepped in to enforce codes with success but neighbors <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> problem reappears. Another problem is {{that a number of}} auto parts vendors are selling merchandise from stolen cars. Arrests have been made as recently as March 2010 when a sting operation went down in the colonia.|$|R
