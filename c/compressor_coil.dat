40|$|A new {{configuration}} of a coaxial plasma accelerator with self-energized magnetic <b>compressor</b> <b>coil</b> attached is described. It is {{shown that the}} circuit may be treated theoretically by analyzing an equivalent circuit mesh. The results obtained from the theoretical analysis are shown to compare favorably with the results measured experimentally. Using this accelerator configuration, glass beads of 125 -micron diameter were accelerated to velocities as high as 11 km/sec, while 700 -micron-diam glass beads were accelerated to velocities as high as 5 km/sec. The velocities are within the hypervelocity regime of meteroids...|$|E
40|$|The present {{knowledge}} of the micrometeoroid environment and the simulation requirements for laboratory devices show that the simulated mass-velocity range must be extended to higher values in both mass and velocity. This is accomplished with the new two-stage accelerator, which consists of a light gas gun as the first stage and a coaxial accelerator with a <b>compressor</b> <b>coil</b> as the second stage. The operation of the new device is described together with a theoretical investigation of {{the timing of the}} first and the second stage, which leads to an appropriate adjustment of the two stages. The theoretical and experimental results agree well and show that 600 -micron diameter glass beads have been accelerated to velocities near 20 km/sec...|$|E
50|$|A few {{manufacturers}} offer {{dual compressor}} models. These models have separate freezer and refrigerator compartments that operate independently of each other, sometimes mounted {{within a single}} cabinet. Each has its own separate compressor, condenser and evaporator coils, insulation, thermostat, and door. Typically, the <b>compressors</b> and condenser <b>coils</b> are mounted {{at the top of}} the cabinet, with a single fan to cool them both.|$|R
50|$|While {{the system}} is running, there is enough heat being {{generated}} by the compressor running to prevent refrigerant migration from occurring. Refrigerant vapor always migrates to the coldest {{part of the system}} (the compressor). The refrigerant migrates to the compressor crankcase where it is attracted to the compressor oil. This refrigerant vapor condenses and returns to a liquid in the off cycle. On the next start of the compressor, the oil is in a watery state and washes the bearings out, which leads to locked-up, frozen or totally burnt-out compressors. The temperature is sensed at the <b>compressor,</b> indoor <b>coil,</b> and outdoors. The sensed temperatures are compared and if the compressor temperature is not a specified amount higher than the lower of the other two sensed temperatures, then the crankcase heater is energized. When the compressor temperature rises to or is a specified amount above the lower of the other two temperatures, the crankcase heater is de-energized.|$|R
40|$|Inverse {{models are}} {{generally}} derived from empirical behavior and {{expressed in terms}} of one or more driving forces and a set of empirical parameters that are “identified” using measurements. Once identified, a model can be used for a variety purposes, including performance monitoring, diagnostics, retrofit analysis, measurement and verification of efficiency improvements, and on-line control optimization. In this paper, a semi-empirical inverse model or a “grey-box” model is developed to estimate the power consumption of a direct expansion (DX) air conditioning system that handles the cooling requirement of a residential building. This “grey-box” model approach requires fewer parameters and training data and provides better extrapolation than other popular empirical or “black-box” models. The model is based on physical system performance parameters and not only on a single <b>compressor</b> or <b>coil,</b> so it can provide a clear performance map of the air conditioning system in residential buildings. The training and validation data used for model construction in this paper comes from manufacturer’s detailed DX unit performance models, which closely matches equipment performance in the field...|$|R

50|$|Another use of {{the term}} occurs in {{industrial}} refrigeration, specifically vapor-compression refrigeration. Normally, the economizer concept is applied when a particular design or feature on the refrigeration cycle, allows a reduction either in the amount of energy used from the power grid; {{in the size of the}} components (basically the gas compressor’s nominal capacity) used to produce refrigeration, or both.For example, for a walk-in freezer that is kept at , the main refrigeration components would include: an evaporator coil (a dense arrangement of pipes containing refrigerant and thin metal fins used to remove heat from inside the freezer), fans to blow air over the coil and around the box, an air-cooled condensing unit sited outdoors, and valves and piping. The condensing unit would include a <b>compressor</b> and a <b>coil</b> and fans to exchange heat with the ambient air.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} Finite Element (FEM) analysis of a Linear <b>compressor</b> of voice <b>coil</b> type (LCVCT). This kind of linear compressor {{will be used in}} a refrigerator equipment. It is well-known that the replacing of the rotating compressor from a classical refrigerator by a linear compressor leads to an efficiency improving wit about 5 % by avoiding the piston side friction, which is very important because of the huge number of refrigerators in operation world-wide. The linear compressor refrigerator is already commercially available in South Korea, equipped with an electromagnetic (fix coil and moving permanent magnet) linear compressor. This paper presents a new type of linear compressor - a voice-coil type (fixed permanent magnet and moving coil). The operation principle is the same as for electrodynamic vibrator or electro-dynamic loud-speaker. The designing with rare earth permanent magnet is not a simple problem, because of the nonlinear characteristic of rare earth magnets. A magneto-static FEM analysis has been performed in order to validate the design methodology proposed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Stirling {{cycle and}} Pulse Tube cryocoolers can be {{described}} by ideal thermodynamic cycles with discrete losses, however experiments show a systematic underestimate of power consumed. Existing correlations {{have been unable to}} explain the magnitude of this additional 'compression loss', but it can account for up to 50 % of the power delivered to the gas. It appears that even a modest decrease could significantly improve the efficiency of future machines. One problem inherent in studying this effect is the complex geometry of cryocoolers. Experiments have therefore been performed on an existing 'Oxford type' moving <b>coil</b> <b>compressor</b> with the simplest compression space geometry, a flat cylinder head. Measurements were made of the intrinsic motor losses (including windage), and the power delivered to the gas. The results show that for this machine the motor losses are greater than previously thought, accounting for up to 30 % of the compression loss in the original cryocooler configuration. Measurements of the heat transfer losses are also presented. © 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
500|$|Despite an {{incomplete}} {{understanding of the}} principles behind them, in some ways Evans's thinking {{about the potential for}} steam engines was once again far ahead of its time. In the postscript of the Steam Engineer's Guide, Evans noted that drawing a vacuum on water reduces its boiling point and cools it. He further observed that a vacuum would have the same effect upon ether, and the resulting cooling should be sufficient to produce ice. He went on to describe a piston vacuum pump apparatus to produce this effect, and also showed that a compression cylinder, or the compression stroke of the vacuum pump, should produce heat in a condenser. Thus Evans had produced the first detailed and theoretically coherent design for a vapor-compression refrigerator, identifying all the major components (expander, cooling <b>coil,</b> <b>compressor</b> and condenser) of a refrigeration cycle, leaving some to credit him as the 'grandfather of refrigeration'. [...] Although Evans never developed a working model of his designs, and {{there is no evidence that}} he ever attempted to, Evans in his later life worked and associated extensively with fellow inventor Jacob Perkins on steam engines and the potential for refrigeration. Perkins would later develop and build a refrigeration device for which he received patents in 1834–1835, employing much the same principles originally put forward by Evans.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} a compressed air generation system in a bus manufacturer, being evaluated {{the operation of the}} compressors to identify the electric energy consumption. A maintenance plan is elaborated to correct the air system leaks and also proposes the reuse of thermal energy generated by the compressors. Initially, as {{for the purpose of this}} paper, a revision of fundamentals related to thermodynamics transformation is presented. Afterwards, some important electric energy concepts will lead to the understanding of the energy consumption of the compressors. Then, an overview about compressed air generation systems will be showed with the goal of understanding techniques of energetic efficiency. The tools used in this study for collecting data were the software of a compressor manufacturer with pressure transducers and an energy analyzer. The basic concepts and their uses will be shown along this paper. The proposal of electric energy consumption reduction was achieved with the installation of compressor operation managers and yields a reduction about 60, 600 kWh per month, which provided a monthly saving of R$ 19, 400. 00, validating the collected data. For heat recovery from the cooling air <b>compressors,</b> externally finned <b>coils</b> were sized to heat water up to 55 ◦C and used in a process of heating rubber gaskets. For air leakage reduction, a working methodology to perform the corrective and preventive maintenance has been prepared, and a control system in the form of internal audit. The obtained air leakage reduction was about 50 %...|$|R
40|$|Microchannel heat {{exchangers}} (MHX) have found great successes in {{residential and commercial}} applications, being compact {{heat exchangers}}, to reduce refrigerant charge and material cost. This investigation aims to extend the application of MHXs as evaporators in split, room air conditioners (RAC), per fundamental heat exchanger and system modelling, and field study. Â For this paper, a microchannel evaporator model was developed, using a segment-to-segment modelling approach. The microchannel evaporator model was integrated to a system design model having a <b>compressor,</b> fin-and-tube condenser <b>coil,</b> and lines. The system model is able to predict the performance indices, such as cooling capacity, efficiency, sensible heat ratio, etc. In addition, field investigations were conducted to compare performances of two 2 -ton RACs, using R 22 refrigerant. The two RACs are identical, except {{one of them was}} modified by replacing the original fin-and-tube evaporator with a microchannel heat exchanger. The field testing data was used to calibrate the component and the system models. Based on the field testing and modelling studies, performances of the fin-and-tube evaporator and micro-channel evaporator will be compared. Using the calibrated system and heat exchanger models, we evaluated numerous low GWP (global warming potential) refrigerants to find a replacement for R 22, i. e. propane, R 32, etc. The predicted system performance indices, e. g. cooling efficiency, compressor discharge temperature, and required compressor displacement volume etc., are compared. A suitable replacement of R 22 for the room air conditioner application is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Relative {{humidity}} of air {{produced by}} simple compressors {{used to drive}} ventilators was measured at different working pressures. At normal working pressures, a relative humidity of 100 % was found and condensation occurred, mainly at the high pressure air/oxygen mixer valve. This resulted in blockages and loss of accuracy which could have serious consequences for patients. It was concluded that simple compressors are unsuitable and that medical air must be used. The Siemens Servo- 900 B ventilator is driven by gas derived from a high pressure air/oxygen mixer unit and requires a minimum operating pressure of 200 kPa. When medical air is not available, the ventilators are supplied with compressors which are of the reciprocating piston, oil-free type, without air drying facilities but fitted with cooling coils. Difficulties were encountered because of condensation and water collection in the mixer unit which affected the performance and reliability of the ventilator system. This particular problem has not been reported and prompted our investigation {{of the characteristics of}} air produced by simple compressors. METHODS A test circuit consisting of a <b>compressor,</b> a cooling <b>coil,</b> a water trap, 2 m of flexible tubing and a mixer unit was set up and the temperature of the air measured at various points (fig. 1). The relative humidity before the mixer was measured by dew point estimation and values derived for the other points indicated. Measurements of relative humidity were made for working pressures between 0 and 207 kPa. RESULTS The measured values of temperature and relative humidity for a working pressure of 150 kPa are shown in figure 1. The measured data of relativ...|$|R
