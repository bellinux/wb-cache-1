It follows, if predicted climate changes are correct, we need to adapt existing stock sustainably. In city centres outside Australia there {{is a history of}} office to residential conversions. These types of conversions are few in number in Sydney although evidence suggests a trend is emerging in <b>conversion</b> <b>adaptations.</b> In 2014 102, 000 m 2 of office space was earmarked for residential conversion in Sydney as demand for central residential property grows and low interest rates create good conditions. Linked to this, the CBD population is projected to increase by 4 % to 2031 requiring 45000 new homes and, this increase coincides with a stock of ageing offices. A further factor is the Sydney office market is set to be flooded with the Barangaroo development office supply in 2017; thus conditions for residential conversion are better than ever. However; what is the level of sustainability in these projects? And, are stakeholders cognisant of the sustainability issues in these projects? Through a series of interviews with key stakeholders, this paper investigates {{the nature and extent of}} the phenomena in Sydney, as well as the political, economic, social, environmental and technological drivers and barriers to successful conversion. To date no major study exists on <b>conversion</b> <b>adaptation</b> in Sydney and most residential development is new build. There is substantial potential to change the nature of the CBD and enhance sustainability with the residential <b>conversion</b> <b>adaptation</b> of office space and this paper explores this potential. The findings show that opportunities are being overlooked to appreciate and acknowledge the sustainability of this type of adaptation and that there is a need for a rating tool to encourage greater levels of sustainability; and to acknowledge existing levels of sustainability achieved in these projects.

If predicted climate changes are correct we need to adapt existing stock sustainably. Reuse is an inherently sustainable option, which reduces {{the amount of waste}} going to landfill. Inevitably settlements and areas undergo change, whereby land uses become obsolete and buildings vacant. At this stage, the options are either to demolish or to convert to another use. In central business districts (CBDs) outside of Australia there is a long history of office to residential conversion. Although these types of conversions are few in number in the Sydney and Melbourne CBD, a trend is emerging in conversion. Some 102, 000 m 2 of office space is earmarked for residential conversion in Sydney as demand for central residential property grows and low interest rates create good conditions. Coupled with this, is a stock of ageing offices and a population projected to increase by 4 % to 2031 requiring 45000 new homes.

A review of confinement feeding highlighted the variability of growth rate and feed conversion of sheep and revealed that {{little is known about}} the use of sorghum for feeding sheep. The review indicated that the main factors responsible for variation of growth rate and feed <b>conversion</b> were <b>adaptation</b> to grain and feeding system, including the preparation and presentation of feed. The importance of social and physiological adaptation to grain feeding was confirmed. Factors identified as responsible for safe induction and uniform growth rates included prior exposure to grain as lambs, gradual introduction of grain and, when concentrate was provided ad libitum from the first day, the use of either virginiamycin, a pelleted feed, a total mixed ration or a step-wise increase of high-starch grain components. Separate feeding of hay and grain resulted in performance comparable with that of a pelleted diet and that of a total mixed ration. Sorghum-based concentrate diets resulted in growth rates and carcase weights similar to that for winter cereal grains or pellets. Steam flaking or expanding of sorghum had no significant effect on growth rates or carcase weights. These results can be used to determine the profitability of various feedlotting options...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} viability of pastoralism {{has been a}} constant theme for discussions. The progress of knowledge on the sustainability of pastoralism under global environmental change has been notable in the last years. To better characterize this vulnerability, we have examined the existing scientific knowledge about the three dimensions of vulnerability, being exposure illustrated by the existing climate trends and non-climate transformations, sensitivity by the impacts of these on pastoral resources and pastoral land <b>conversions,</b> and <b>adaptation</b> by the adaptation strategies developed by the pastoral communities. A qualitative meta-analysis was conducted to explore patterns and trends across the literature. From this, six different pathways of vulnerability being followed by pastoral communities were identified: Encroachment, Re-greening, Customary, Polarization, Communal and No-alternative. The results point that the livelihood options of pastoralists are generally becoming narrower. Four major forces are identified as exerting determinant influence on the co-production of the vulnerability of pastoralism: (i) the double exposure to climate and non-climate transformations, (ii) the persistence of unfavorable development policies, (iii) the great vitality of adaptation, and (iv) the multifaceted role of markets. We point that it is crucial to distinguish between the component of vulnerability inherent in any economic activity devoted to the use of natural resources, which is the usual business of pastoralism, and the component of vulnerability linked to external forces that disturb the usual working of the pastoral production strategies...|$|R

40|$|Spoken {{language}} conversion is {{the challenge}} of using synthesis systems to generate utterances {{in the voice of}} a speaker but in a language unknown to the speaker. Previous approaches have been based on voice <b>conversion</b> and voice <b>adaptation</b> technologies applied to the output of a foreign language TTS system. This inevitably reduces the quality and intelligibility of the output, since the source speaker will not be a good source of phonetic material in the new language.

Audio morphing technology is then exploited to correct the foreign accent of the source speaker, {{while at the same time}} trying to maintain his or her identity.

40|$|The {{preponderance}} of Native American {{histories of the}} Old Northwest traditionally have examined macro-regional trends, particularly those related to warfare, trade, and the attrition of indigenous sovereignty {{in the face of}} European/American expansion. A number of recent studies have begun to dig deeper into the details of indigenous life in the region, but usually in the context of Indian Removal. This study attempts to shift the focus to a microhistorical examination of a single indigenous community, the Wyandot people in the Sandusky River region in modern northwest Ohio. I argue that training the analytical lens on the Wyandots reveals a much more complicated history than most existing studies have considered, especially after the War of 1812 (when most studies tend to end with the collapse of effective military resistance to American expansion). This study reveals a community in the midst of tremendous cultural changes, especially in regards to questions of religious adherence/identity, economic change, social structural changes, and perceptions of the importance of race and cultural identity. This dissertation considers these changes, especially the linkages (and non-linkages) between these varieties of social and religious change. Most importantly, this study seeks to recover both the complex lives of the Ohio Wyandots and the human agency they exercised in the roughly fifty years between the signing of the Treaty of Greenville and the removal of the bulk of the Wyandots in 1843. Framed within the legacies of both historical studies of missions and studies of contemporary indigenous communities, this dissertation places the Wyandot story into a broader context of Native American history, with important lessons about the complex nature of religious and societal changes. Through the evidence examined {{in the case of the}} Ohio Wyandots, it also asks historians to further question dominant assumptions about indigenous cultural change, such as the perceived links between religious <b>conversion,</b> economic <b>adaptation,</b> and racial identities...|$|R

Presently, this approach has still not attracted many researchers to apply in general noisy speech enhancement because of some major problems: those are the difficulties of noise adaptation and the lack of noise robust synthesizable features in different noisy environments. In this paper, we adopted the methods of state-of-the-art voice <b>conversions</b> and speaker <b>adaptation</b> in speech recognition to the proposed speech recovery approach applied in different kinds of noisy environment, especially in adverse environments with joint compensation of additive and convolutive noises.

40|$|Image {{registration}} is typically formulated as an optimization problem with multiple tunable, manually set parameters. We present a principled framework for learning thousands of parameters of registration cost functions, {{such as a}} spatially-varying tradeoff between the image dissimilarity and regularization terms. Our approach belongs to the classic machine learning framework of model selection by optimization of cross-validation error. This second layer of optimization of cross-validation error over and above registration selects parameters in the registration cost function that result in good registration {{as measured by the}} performance of the specific application in a training data set. Much research effort has been devoted to developing generic registration algorithms, which are then specialized to particular imaging modalities, particular imaging targets and particular postregistration analyses. Our framework allows for a systematic <b>adaptation</b> of generic <b>registration</b> cost functions to specific applications by learning the "free" parameters in the cost functions. Here, we consider the application of localizing underlying cytoarchitecture and functional regions in the cerebral cortex by alignment of cortical folding. Most previous work assumes that perfectly registering the macro-anatomy also perfectly aligns the underlying cortical function even though macro-anatomy does not completely predict brain function.

In Amsterdam, the oversupply of office space makes across use <b>adaptation,</b> <b>conversion</b> from offices into housing, an interesting development. The concept of adaptation is well developed in Europe, though the scale of some of the post war developments has created different forms of building perhaps less adaptable or suited to change. The need to adapt buildings and to reduce environmental footprints becomes more pressing over time as global concentrations of carbon dioxide increase. Moreover, the ageing workforce and the new way of working lead to a decline in the demand of office space, and so conversion becomes a possibility for dealing with obsolete offices. Applying knowledge of adaptation to examine the adaptation potential of office buildings in Melbourne and Amsterdam, it is possible to learn where similarities and differences exist and where new practices can be shared. This paper addresses the question; what are the possibilities for building conversions in Melbourne and Amsterdam? Using Amsterdam and the Melbourne CBD as case studies, the research analysed the across use adaptation potential of office buildings in Amsterdam and in Melbourne CBD. The outcomes of this research show where similarities and differences exist and are relevant to all urban areas where adaptation of existing office buildings can mitigate the impacts of climate change and enhance the city for another generation of citizens and users.
