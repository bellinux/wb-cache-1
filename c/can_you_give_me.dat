2500|$|Valve's former {{business}} development chief Jason Holtman {{stated that the}} company sees themselves as an [...] "oddity" [...] {{in an industry that}} looks towards punctual delivery of products; instead, Valve [...] " [...] as hard as we can to make the best thing possible in the right time frame and get people content they want to consume. And if that takes longer, that's fine". For that, Valve takes the concept of [...] "Valve Time" [...] as a compliment, and that [...] "having customers consistently looking at our property or something you've done and saying, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> more" [...] is evidence that they are making the right decisions with their game releases, according to Holtman. The company does try to avoid unintentional delays of their projects, and believes that the earlier occurrences of [...] "Valve Time" [...] delays, primarily from Half-Life development, has helped them improve their release schedules.|$|E

6000|$|... "Your news is excellent, Francisco. I {{will not}} ask you more, now. It is three o'clock already, and at five I must {{be up and}} doing; so get off to bed as soon as <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the details in the morning." ...|$|R
