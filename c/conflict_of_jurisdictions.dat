Each agency is authorized by the respective statute and enactment in enforcing the regulation and law on halal goods and products. Although the implementation and enforcement of halal in Malaysia is seen as comprehensive, the issues on weakness and lameness of the agencies are still being debated especially matters related to procedures and <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> This paper focuses on the jurisdiction of the enforcement agencies pertaining to halal matters. The paper also will discuss and elaborate the legal issues and hiccups due to halal. Firstly, the jurisdiction of enforcement agencies will be discussed throughout this paper. Then this paper will analyze the procedures and statutory provisions as to see whether all the processes and current legislation s are protecting the consumers on halal food consumption. Notwithstanding of statutory provisions, the finding of this paper is based on interviews with the enforcement agencies of halal products. A few recommendations have been suggested as to improve the lacuna pursuant to the roles and jurisdictions of the enforcement agencies...|$|E

Framed by {{introductory}} and concluding remarks, the thesis is divided into five chapters. One after the other, these components will expound the generation and elaboration of the reform project, synchronise its jurisdictional aspects with the pre-existing law of international civil procedure and of <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> trace intimately related other harmonisation efforts, and briefly compare conventional and up-to-date substantive and conflict of law rules of selected Common and Civil Law jurisdictions that apply to secured transactions and their underlying contractual relationships.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{analyses}} extraterritorial {{application of}} acquis communautaire on merger control. The {{aim of this}} work is to take down current state of development of law in this area, identify actual questions and problems and introduce methods that could possibly solve those problems. The introductory chapter defines the theme and goals of this work and deals with resources used. The second chapter explains the European legal regulation system of merger control. Council Regulation (EC) No 139 / 2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings holds {{a central role in}} this system. European Commission is a competition authority of European Communities and in order to protect competition on common market it proceeds also against companies that operate outside European territory. The third chapter explores the ways how European Commission derives a legal basis of such extraterritorial jurisdiction. The most appropriate means of jurisdictional derivation regarding merger control appears to be an effects doctrine. Next chapter identifies problems connected with extraterritorial application of European competition law, such as <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> limits of national competition laws, multijurisdictional merger thicket, substantial differences in laws and different market [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} dissertation {{deals with}} the current legislation of judicial review of administrative decisions in civil matters, which is incorporated into the fifth part of the Code of Civil Procedure. The introduction outlines the historical context of this legislation, {{as well as the}} fundamental motives that {{led to the formation of}} the current form of the evaluated legal regulations. Attention is also given to specific issues related to the chosen topic, in particular the question of dualistic concept of judicial protection, adopted within the reform of the administrative judiciary effective from 1 st January 2003, as well as the issues of a <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> which is one of the consequences of exclusion of the review of decisions of public authorities about private individual rights from the jurisdiction of courts deciding in administrative judiciary, and assigning this agenda to civil courts, which occurred within the context of the mentioned reform.

40|$|Employing {{systematic}} {{document analysis}} and other methods, {{this article analyses}} a long-standing and still relevant issue related to the interpretation and application of the law regulating relationships {{in the field of}} European Union criminal justice {{within the framework of the}} national criminal proceedings that are taking place in EU member states. The article places special emphasis on the explanation and application of the principle of mutual recognition within the framework of one of the newest instruments of international cooperation in the European Union criminal proceedings meant to prevent <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and to solve issues arising between two or more member states. The analysis <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> provided in this paper is not limited to a mere explanation of the concept as such, but includes an essential analysis of other related issues, such as the principle of mutual recognition, its influence on the recognition of criminal proceedings as parallel proceedings, and including other aspects related to the matching of the form of national criminal proceedings with the criminal proceedings taking place in another member state. Finally, significant attention is given to one of the objectives in terms of prevention and solution <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> namely, the ne bis in idem principle and its application in case of parallel criminal proceedings taking place in two or more member states. One of the key conclusions offered here is that in order to eliminate <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> positive law in the process <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> must become an effective measure in criminal justice; however, only on the condition that at least a minimum likelihood in the form of criminal proceedings adopted by different EU members states is ensured as a precondition necessary to enable a smooth application of the principle of mutual recognition...|$|R

40|$|With {{emerging}} new Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) and the stagnating of the Doha Round negotiations, the <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> overlapping {{laws and}} jurisdictions between WTO tribunals {{and those of}} RTAs has become an important issue. That conflict should be addressed multilaterally and regionally. The examination of the DSU shows that the WTO treaty negotiators did not perceive potential <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> with RTAs. Since there is no general rule of primacy between WTO norms and those of RTAs, {{it has been suggested}} that the DSU (Dispute Settlement Understanding) should be amended and that under certain conditions choice of forum and/or exclusive forum clauses of RTAs could lead a panel to suspend jurisdiction until the issue has been cleared. This article points out that <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> laws and <b>jurisdictions</b> should constantly be borne in mind while setting up RTAs. Moreover, a forum selection rule might not always be sufficient to prevent <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> If there are norms in an RTA that address matters differently from the WTO-covered agreements, an effective remedy under the RTA is especially crucial for those rights to be enforceable.

Alas, this has otherwise been decided and negated by the civil court. Based on the case's decided, even though the jurisdiction to hear wakaf exclusively is under the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the syariah court, yet the civil court vehemently decided otherwise, viz it is under their domain. This clearly negates the importance of article 121 (1 A) of the FC. This paper intends to study the decided cases involving wakaf since the inclusion of sub clause 1 A to article 121 of the FC, which has bestowed to the syariah courts, exclusive and unfettered jurisdiction and power to adjudicate and determine their own matters as provided the said provisions and to identify the real legal and jurisprudential issues, causes and stumbling blocks which had hitherto barred the syariah courts from having the freedom and ability to decide on wakaf and further to give suggestion and solution in the problem <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> between these courts, civil and syariah, in matters pertaining to the same.

In particular, due attention is paid at both the relevant features, on the one hand the <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> on the other hand the principle of European ne bis in idem. The first chapter focuses on the lis pendens.
