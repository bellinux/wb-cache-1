25|$|But as fame {{of their}} unbeaten status spread, {{so did the}} status of their haka. At the {{beginning}} of their 22nd game in Wales at Llanelli, we read On the appearance of the men in red, 'Sosban Fach' was sung with great enthusiasm. Nepia then led the All Blacks in their famous war dance, which was very impressive. One <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> a pin drop while it was rendered. The crowd again sang 'Sosban Fach' in reply.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Big Show was {{not just}} more grand than most radio shows---it was also more witty, {{smoothly}} produced, smart, and ambitious, with an interesting juxtaposition of guests, but it wasn't significantly different," [...] wrote radio historian Gerald Nachman in Raised on Radio. [...] "It was just a more lavish, inflated revival of radio's earliest form---the variety showcase; you <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the sequins." [...] Yet Nachman admired the show, which he said was [...] "as close to a Broadway show as radio could whip together each week." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Jack Kerouac's 1955 novel, On The Road, the book's narrator Sal Paradise {{and other}} {{prominent}} character Dean Moriarty (an alias of Kerouac's friend Neal Cassady) encounter the Sabine River. [...] It is recorded as an [...] "evil old river," [...] and [...] "the mansion of the snake...we <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the slither {{of a million}} copperheads." [...] A novel in which the theme rests heavily on familiarity with the American continent, {{it is interesting that}} Kerouac labels the region as [...] "a manuscript of the night we couldn't read." ...|$|E
60|$|The dingy den off the Common-room {{was never}} used for {{anything}} except gowns. Its windows were ground glass; {{one could not}} see out of it, but one <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>almost</b> every word on the gravel outside. A light and wary footstep came up from Number Five.|$|R
2500|$|George Sidney {{described}} Thau as [...] "a {{very quiet}} man, a gentle man." [...] He {{would be brought}} in to calm down the performers when they got upset. He said, [...] "Benny spoke very quietly. You <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> never quite <b>hear</b> what he said. But he would talk to this one and that one and {{had the ability to}} calm things down.|$|R

2500|$|Following the Japanese {{military}} {{offensive against}} the Philippines, President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur {{to evacuate the}} islands. MacArthur reluctantly left, promising to send reinforcements that never came. In his autobiography, MacArthur recalled {{one of his last}} memories on leaving the Philippines was of Bunker:"On the dock I could see the men staring at me. I had lost 25 pounds living on the same diet as the soldiers, and I must have looked gaunt and ghastly standing there in my old war-stained clothes - no bemedaled commander of inspiring presence. ... Through the shattered ruins, my eyes sought 'Topside,' where the deep roar of heavy guns still growled defiance, with their red blasts tearing the growing darkness asunder. Up there, in command, was my classmate, Paul Bunker. Forty years had passed since Bunker had twice been selected by Walter Camp for the All American team. I could shut my eyes and see again that blond head racing, tearing, plunging - 210 pounds of irresistible power. I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> Quarterback Charley Daly's shrill voice barking, 'Bunker back.' He and many others up there were old, old friends, bound by ties of deepest friendship." ...|$|E
60|$|Another went up more quickly; {{and then}} another; they <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> it twist and roar.|$|E
60|$|There was a tense silence. Beverley <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> {{the voice}} of the referee uttering the count.|$|E
60|$|As they {{approached}} the village the Arabs raised shouts of triumph, and a crowd gathered {{as they entered the}} street, gesticulating and screaming so furiously that Edgar thought he would be torn to pieces. However, his captors forced their way through the crowd, turned off from the street, and entered a court-yard, in the centre of which stood a house of larger size than the majority of those that composed the town. Edgar's legs were again tied, and he was thrown into an outhouse, where he lay for hours. He <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>almost</b> continuous talking in the house, and the voices occasionally rose into angry altercation.|$|R
60|$|The {{noiseless}} Morgan {{had listened}} to the conversation between Strong and Major Pendennis at the latter's own lodgings, and had carried away from it matter for much private speculation; and a desire of knowledge had led him to follow his master when the Major came to the Wheel of Fortune, and {{to take his place}} quietly in the Confidential room, whilst Pendennis and Clavering had their discourse in the parlour. There was a particular corner in the Confidential room from which you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>almost</b> all that passed in the next apartment; and as the conversation between the two gentlemen there was rather angry, and carried on in a high key, Morgan had the benefit of overhearing almost the whole of it and what he heard, strengthened the conclusions which his mind had previously formed.|$|R
6000|$|... "D'you {{want to wake}} 'em up? Is {{that your}} game?" [...] she asked, and began to fumble at her belt. Overcoming with an effort a disgust amounting to nausea, Janet {{approached}} her sister again, little by little undressing her, and finally getting her into bed, when she immediately fell into a profound slumber. Janet, too, got into bed, but sleep was impossible: the odour lurked like a foul spirit in the darkness, mingling with the stagnant, damp air that came in at the open window, fairly saturating her with horror: it seemed {{the very essence of}} degradation. But as she lay {{on the edge of the}} bed, shrinking from contamination, in the throes of excitement inspired by an unnamed fear, she grew hot, she <b>could</b> feel and <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the pounding of her heart. She rose, felt around in the clammy darkness for her wrapper and slippers, gained the door, crept through the dark hall to the dining-room, where she stealthily lit the lamp; darkness had become a terror. A cockroach scurried across the linoleum. The room was warm and close, it reeked with the smell of stale food, but at least she found relief from that other odour. She sank down on the sofa.|$|R
6000|$|As Louisa read on, she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> Lord Radclyffe's whispered words, whilst {{she herself}} sang Tosti's melancholy song: [...] "Good-bye!" ...|$|E
60|$|Joan shot {{a glance}} from over her cup. The poor puzzled face was {{staring into the}} fire. Joan <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> him saying it.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite {{felt as if}} she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> {{them talking}} it over and vowing that she should not escape, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel should soon be captured.|$|E
5000|$|... "I Can <b>Almost</b> <b>Hear</b> Her Wings" [...] (Travis, Eddie Lee, Buck Moore) - 4:21 ...|$|R
60|$|In {{his third}} letter one can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> Hay's chuckle in the {{certainty}} that his diplomatic, if somewhat wicked, suggestion would bear fruit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I, really, Arthur?" [...] said Smirke, {{looking through}} his spectacles; {{and his heart}} began to beat so that he thought Pen must <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> it throbbing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Abnormal? I don't call it abnormal," [...] I began, and I was {{sensible}} of my wife's thoughts {{leaving her}} own injuries for {{my point of}} view so swiftly that I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> them whir.|$|E
60|$|The {{house was}} so still {{and the air}} was so oppressive. When she paused in her fumbling--since her fingers refused her service--she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> that {{movement}} again behind the acacia tree outside, and that rustling among the leaves.|$|E
60|$|The artful dodger! he {{had drawn}} and {{coloured}} a beautiful little {{sketch of a}} bridge; not an engineer's plan with sections and measurements, vexatious to a woman's eye, but a graceful little bridge {{with a string of}} cars running under it. You <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the bell going.|$|E
60|$|My friend, as I call him, uttered an exclamation, stared, then {{laid his}} two {{hands on the}} other's shoulders. The latter looked round at me keenly, compassing me in a {{momentary}} glance. I read in its own vague light {{that this was a}} transatlantic eyebeam; and with such confidence that I hardly needed to see its owner, as he prepared, with his companion, to seat himself at the table adjoining my own, take from his overcoat-pocket three New York newspapers and lay them beside his plate. As my neighbours proceeded to dine I felt the crumbs of their conversation scattered pretty freely abroad. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>almost</b> all they said, without straining to catch it, {{over the top of the}} partition that divided us. Occasionally their voices dropped to recovery of discretion, but the mystery pieced itself together as if on purpose to entertain me. Their speech was pitched in the key that may in English air be called alien in spite of a few coincidences. The voices were American, however, with a difference; and I had no hesitation in assigning the softer and clearer sound to the pale thin gentleman, whom I decidedly preferred to his comrade. The latter began to question him about his voyage.|$|R
5000|$|Mandy Davis of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch commented in her {{review of}} [...] "A Few Questions", [...] "On [...] "I Can't Sleep," [...] you can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> Walker {{pleading}} for the crossover success of Garth Brooks or Tim McGraw.".|$|R
6000|$|She listens, but she cannot hear [...] The foot of horse, {{the voice}} of man; [...] The streams with softest sound are flowing, [...] The grass you <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> it growing, [...] You hear it now if e'er you can.|$|R
60|$|Oh, {{you don't}} know. Last Tuesday he was dining there, {{and you should}} have seen the state he was in. He was so restless he couldn't sit still. He looked at his watch every minute. His eyes simply glittered with excitement, and I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> his heart beating.|$|E
6000|$|We {{had been}} moving onward for some little time, when the girl's {{companion}} addressed an observation to her. She heard it imperfectly, {{and lifted her}} veil while it was being repeated. How painfully my heart beat! I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> it--as her face was, for the first time, freely and fairly disclosed! ...|$|E
60|$|Still no sound. My {{heart beat}} {{so fast that}} I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> it. The night was very dark. A thin mist-like drizzle was falling; in fact the weather {{conditions}} were absolutely perfect for my purpose. With utmost wariness I allowed myself to drop from the window-ledge on to the soft ground below.|$|E
5000|$|Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe {{gave the}} song a B+ grade, saying that [...] "you can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the guy smirking as he sings this {{swinging}} hit, running down {{a list of}} jilted lovers {{from all over the}} Lone Star state." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is hardly}} {{to be called}} a story," [...] said Kate. [...] "It is a bit of history brought near us with a strong telescope. We can see the soldiers' faces: no, it is more than that--we can <b>hear</b> everything--we can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> their hearts beat." ...|$|R
60|$|Those {{twinkling}} eyes! {{how well}} we know them! that laugh! we can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> it; as for the swagger, the devil-may-care arrogance, do we not condone it, seeing that it has its mainspring behind a fine straight brow whose noble, sweeping lines betray an undercurrent of dignity and of thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, Essie and Ellie were promenading {{a select}} party about the gardens. I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> Mackintyre gnashing his teeth at their inroads on the forced strawberries, {{and the park}} and Elmwood Spinney were dotted so thick with people, {{that we had to}} look sharp not to fall in with any one." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she stood}} aside, having made a cold bow to Mme. de Pompadour; the fair Marquise was {{accompanying}} His Majesty to Versailles; {{she stepped into}} the coach beside him, surrounded by murmurs of flattery and adulation. Even Charles Edward made her a final speech of somewhat forced gallantry; he was the last to kiss her hand, and Lydie <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the softly whispered words of entreaty with which he bade her not to forget.|$|E
60|$|He {{shut his}} eyes; {{he could not}} bear to look at the {{brightness}} of the world outside the window of the car. Under his closed lids there came to him visions, sometimes of Margery and sometimes of the forests of New Mexico. Sometimes the visions were wavering, uncertain, and transitory, and again they were strong and vivid--so plain to him that he <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the leaves rustle as some wild creature turned a startled look upon him.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called the film [...] "a genteel, buttoned-up soap opera" [...] and added it [...] "wants to be a grand, pull-out-the-stops tearjerker like Terms of Endearment or Beaches. But its {{situations}} are so awkwardly contrived {{that you can}} <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the machinery creaking.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} four stars and stated that [...] "cartoon {{violence}} is only funny in cartoons. Most of the live-action attempts to duplicate animation have failed, because when flesh-and-blood figures hit the pavement, we can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the bones crunch, and it isn't funny." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{style of}} the book is said to be [...] "notably sarcastic but {{nonetheless}} charming attitude." [...] The narration is described as [...] "entertaining." [...] It has a very circus feel when you read this book [...] "you can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> the screams from the midway rides and taste that fluffy pink cotton candy." ...|$|R
