40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedTropical cyclone motion influenced by adjacent synoptic features is examined with relative vorticity fields at 700, 400 and 250 mb computed from operationally-analyzed wind fields. When an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method {{is used to}} map the vorticity onto spatial grids, a smoother but more dependable depiction of the vorticity dynamics is provided than by the original fields. The effect of five processes that contribute to motion relative to the steering flow during periods of interaction with adjacent circulations are evaluated for their contribution to binary rotation and to changing the separation distance between interacting circulations. This vorticity dynamics approach indicates tropical cyclones interact with various features at different levels. The Fujiwhara effect is most evident with stronger interaction events. Only the convergence effect of one tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>circulation</b> on another tropical cyclone can explain the cases with decreasing separations. By contrast, the advection by the tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>circulation</b> of the vorticity gradient of the other cyclone could not explain the decreasing separations. The Beta effect depends on the orientation of two interacting systems of different sizes, but the environmental vorticity gradient is not just due to earth vorticity in these interacting cases.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA {{study was conducted}} to understand the physical mechanisms by which a tropical cyclone is able to develop and be maintained under moderate to strong vertical wind shear. The general approach was to describe case studies of three tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific that developed and/or intensified in the lee of another tropical cyclone. The data resources include high temporal and spatial resolution visible and infrared satellite imagery, operational subjective and objective analyses, plus special Tropical Cyclone Motion (TCM- 90) high resolution (50 km) analyses and multi-quadric analyses. The three tropical cyclones developed and/or intensified under moderate to strong vertical wind shear that exceeded threshold values. The vertical wind shear was time dependent due to complex interactions with the leading tropical cyclone outflow, adjacent tropical upper tropospheric trough, and large-scale environment. Diurnal variability in strength of convection and outflow against the impinging flow led to fully exposed, partially exposed, or covered middle to lower tropospheric cyclonic circulation.

40|$|The {{steering}} {{principle of}} tropical cyclone motion {{has been applied}} to tropical cyclone forecasting and research for nearly 100 years. Two fundamental questions remain unanswered. One is why the steering flow plays a dominant role in tropical cyclone motion, and the other is when tropical cyclone motion deviates considerably from the steering. A high-resolution numerical experiment was conducted with the tropical cyclone in a typical large-scale monsoon trough over the western North Pacific. The simulated tropical cyclone experiences two eyewall replacement processes. Based on the potential vorticity tendency (PVT) diagnostics, this study demonstrates that the conventional steering, which is calculated over a certain radius from the tropical cyclone center in the horizontal and a deep pressure layer in the vertical, plays a dominant role in tropical cyclone motion since the contributions from other processes are largely cancelled out due to the coherent structure of tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>circulation.</b> Resulting from the asymmetric dynamics of the tropical cyclone inner core, the trochoidal motion around the mean tropical cyclone track cannot be accounted for by the conventional steering. The instantaneous tropical cyclone motion can considerably deviate from the conventional steering that approximately accounts for the combined effect of the contribution of the advection of the symmetric potential vorticity component by the asymmetric flow and the contribution from the advection of the wave-number-one potential vorticity component by the symmetric flow...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} mechanisms {{associated with}} the transformation stage of the extratropical transition of a tropical cyclone are simulated with a mesoscale model using initial environmental conditions that approximate the mean circulations defined by Klein et al. The tropical cyclone structural changes simulated by the U. S. Navy Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Model Prediction System mesoscale model during the three steps of transformation compare well with available observations. During step 1 of transformation when the tropical cyclone {{is just beginning to}} interact with the midlatitude baroclinic zone, the main environmental factor that affects the tropical cyclone structure appears to be the decreased sea surface temperature. The movement of the tropical cyclone over the lower sea surface temperatures results in reduced surface heat and moisture fluxes, which weakens the core convection and the intensity decreases. During step 2 of transformation, the low-level temperature gradient and vertical wind shear {{associated with the}} baroclinic zone begin to affect the tropical cyclone. Main structural changes include the development of cloud-free regions {{on the west side of}} the tropical cyclone, and an enhanced ‘‘delta’ ’ rain region to the northwest of the tropical cyclone center.

40|$|Updates to the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) for the Atlantic basin are described. SHIPS {{combines}} climatological, persistence, and synoptic predictors {{to forecast}} intensity changes using a multiple regression technique. The original {{version of the}} model was developed for the Atlantic basin and was run in near–real time at the Hurricane Research Division beginning in 1993. In 1996, the model was incorporated into the National Hurricane Center operational forecast cycle, and a version was developed for the eastern North Pacific basin. Analysis of the forecast errors for the period 1993 – 96 shows that SHIPS had little skill relative to forecasts based upon climatology and persistence. However, SHIPS had significant skill in both the Atlantic and east Pacific basins during the 1997 hurricane season. The regression coefficients for SHIPS were rederived after each hurricane season since 1993 so that the previous season’s forecast cases {{were included in the}} sample. Modifications to the model itself were also made after each season. Prior to the 1997 season, the synoptic predictors were determined only from an analysis {{at the beginning of the}} forecast period. Thus, SHIPS could be considered a ‘‘statistical–synoptic’ ’ model. For the 1997 season, methods were developed to remove the tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>circulation</b> from the global model analyses and to include synoptic predictors from forecast fields, so the current version of SHIPS is a ‘‘statistical– dynamical’ ’ model.

40|$|The warm core {{of hurricanes}} as {{measured}} by microwave temperature sounders has been related to various azimuthally averaged measures of hurricane strength by several researchers Unfortunately, {{the use of these}} instruments (e. g. the Microwave Sounding Units, MSU) for the routine monitoring of tropical cyclone genesis and intensity has been hampered by poor resolution. The recent launch of the NOAA- 15 AMSU represents a significant advance in our ability to monitor subtle atmospheric temperature variations (0. 1 - 0. 2 C) at relatively high spatial resolution (50 km) in the presence of clouds. Of particular interest is the possible capability of the AMSU to observe the slight warming associated with depression formation, and the relationship of the spatial characteristics of the warming to the surface pressure and wind field, without azimuthal averaging. In order to present the AMSU data as imagery, we have developed a method for precise limb-correction of all 15 AMSU channels. Through a linear combination of several neighboring channels, we can very closely match the nadir weighting functions of a given AMSU sounding channel with the non-nadir data. It is found that there is discernible, localized upper tropospheric warming associated with depression formation in the Atlantic basin during the 1998 hurricane season. Also, it is found that uncertainty in positioning of tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>circulation</b> centers can be reduced, as in the example of Hurricane Georges as it approached Cuba.

40|$|Tropical cyclone Phet is {{the second}} strongest {{tropical}} cyclone ever recorded in the Arabian Sea. Phet made landfall in the northeast mountainous area of Oman in early morning on 4 June in 2010, causing a breaking record rainfall in this arid region of 488 mm/ 48 h. The cyclone heavy rainfall triggered flash floods causing enormous losses in lives and infrastructure in northeast Oman. The {{state of the art}} Advanced Research WRF model is used to study the atmospheric circulation and to reproduce the heavy rainfall over Oman. Three one-way nested domains with 32 vertical layers with terrain following sigma coordinate are used to setup eight numerical experiments aiming to investigate the effect of initialization time, horizontal grid resolution and terrain elevations on reproducing the cyclone track, intensity and heavy rainfall. Simulation results show negligible effect of model initialization time on cyclone track, intensity and rainfall. In contrast, the orographic effect played a substantial role in rainfall simulation over northeast Oman. The heavy rainfall was a combination of the <b>cyclone</b> <b>circulation</b> effect and the orographic lifting in the mountains. The northeasterly cyclone moist-warm wind was lifted in the Omani mountains releasing its potential energy and enhancing further thermal convection. The numerical experiment with the highest terrain elevation (RUN 3. 3 -C) resulted in overestimation of observed rainfall due to the enhanced topographic lifting of the saturated cyclone wind. Experiment with similar horizontal grid resolution but smoother terrain elevation (RUN 3. 3 -TER) resulted in much less rainfall amount comparable to the observed values. The increased precipitation in RUN 3. 3 -C is due to the increase in the rain- water and cloud water and graupel of the explicit moisture scheme...|$|E

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} {{to generate}} wave heights consistent with tropical cyclone official forecasts from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) has been developed. The process involves generating synthetic observa-tions from the forecast track and the 34 -, 50 -, and 64 -kt wind radii. The JTWC {{estimate of the}} radius of maximum winds {{is used in the}} algorithm to generate observations for the forecast intensity (wind), and the JTWC-estimated radius of the outermost closed isobar is used to assign observations at the outermost extent of the tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>circulation.</b> These observations are then interpolated to a high-resolution latitude– longitude grid covering the entire extent of the circulation. Finally, numerical weather prediction (NWP) model fields are obtained for each forecast time, the NWP model forecast tropical cyclone is removed from these fields, and the new JTWC vortex is inserted without blending zones between the vortex and the background. These modified fields are then used as input into a wave model to generate waves consistent with the JTWC forecasts. The algorithm is applied to Typhoon Yagi (2006), in anticipation of which U. S. Navy ships were moved from Tokyo Bay to an area off the southeastern coast of Kyushu. The decision to move (sortie) the ships was based on NWP model-driven long-range wave forecasts that indicated high seas impacting the coast in the vicinity of Tokyo Bay. The sortie decision was made approximately 84 h in advance of the high seas in order to give ships time to steam the approximately 500 n mi to safety. Results from the new algorithm indicate that the high seas would not affect the coast near Tokyo Bay within 84 h. This specific forecast verifies, but altimeter observations show that it does not outperform, the NWP model-driven wave analysis and forecasts for this particular case. Overall, the performance of the new algorithm is dependent on the JTWC tropical cyclone forecast performance, which has generally outperformed those of the NWP model over the last several years...|$|E

In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path, despite never having made landfall. As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough.

Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|R
40|$|An {{axisymmetric}} {{version of}} the Bryan Cloud Model (CM 1) is used to determine how quickly a coherent and relatively stable tropical <b>cyclone</b> (TC) <b>circulation</b> can form from an initial vortex of nominal intensity. Some {{of the factors that}} may influence the onset time of the rapid intensification are examined, including the height of the tropopause, the microphysical parameterizations, the midlevel dryness and the total surface heat flux from the sea surface. Our analyses of these simulations suggest that there are two conditions that need to be satisfied before RI can occur: the vertical structure of the middle troposphere has to become moist adiabatic in the inner core and peripheral convection has to become suppressed or merged with convection in the inner region...|$|R
50|$|Sose {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to New Caledonia early on April 8, passing about 280 km (175 mi) to the northeast. A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to tighten to surface pressure gradient {{well to the}} south of Sose's center, contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale-force winds. In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path, despite never having made landfall. As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough. At the same time, a mid-level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the <b>cyclone's</b> <b>circulation,</b> causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection. Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening, and by early on April 10, the center had become exposed and ill-defined. Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand, where it continued to deteriorate. The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11, while the system was located about 335 km (210 mi) northeast of Norfolk Island. TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition. Drifting south-southwestward, the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12. The remnant low ultimately moved over the Tasman Sea, where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand's North Island. Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Dry air and {{increased}} wind shear weakened the <b>cyclone,</b> leaving the <b>circulation</b> exposed from the convection. Late on March 27, Oscar crossed 90° E into the South-West Indian Ocean, whereupon it was renamed Itseng. Its peak intensity {{in the basin}} was 100 mph (60 km/h), according to the MFR. On March 28, the storm weakened into a tropical depression, and the JTWC discontinued advisories. A day later, the circulation turned to the west-northwest, steered by the ridge to the south. Late on March 29, Itseng dissipated without having affected land.|$|R
