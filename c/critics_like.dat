5|$|Riley's school {{attendance}} was sporadic, and {{he graduated from}} grade eight at age twenty in 1869. In an 1892 newspaper article, Riley confessed that he knew little of mathematics, geography, or science, and his understanding of proper grammar was poor. Later <b>critics,</b> <b>like</b> Henry Beers, pointed to his poor education {{as the reason for}} his success in writing; his prose was written in the language of common people which spurred his popularity.|$|E
5|$|Between 1950 and 1960, {{research}} and writings by international <b>critics</b> <b>like</b> George R. Collins, Nikolaus Pevsner and Roberto Pane spread a renewed awareness of Gaudí's work, while in his homeland it was admired and promoted by Alexandre Cirici, Juan Eduardo Cirlot and Oriol Bohigas. Gaudí's work has since gained widespread international appreciation, {{such as in}} Japan where notable studies have been published by Kenji Imai and Tokutoshi Torii. International recognition of Gaudí's contributions {{to the field of}} architecture and design culminated in the 1984 listing of Gaudí's key works as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Gaudí's style have subsequently influenced contemporary architects such as Santiago Calatrava and Norman Foster.|$|E
5|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>like</b> Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's {{government}} of doing little {{to stem the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. Mandela later {{admitted that he had}} personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in South Africa, and that he had instead left the issue for Mbeki to deal with. Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade. Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed {{to deal with the problem}} of corruption.|$|E

50|$|A right-wing <b>critic</b> <b>like</b> G. Edward Griffin, {{faced with}} the movement's more radical claims to promote social change, argued that {{sensitivity}} training involves the unethical use of psychological techniques with groups that come close to brainwashing.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reports 15% of surveyed <b>critics</b> <b>liked</b> it, with a 3.9/10 rating {{average out}} of 13 reviews. [...] Metacritic {{gave it a}} score of 35/100, indicating [...] "generally unfavorable reviews".|$|R
5|$|In its {{theatrical}} run, Karnan completed 100 days in four theatres, including Madurai Thangam (noted as {{the second}} largest theatre in Asia during 1964), and also completed 105 days at Ganesan's family-owned Shanthi theatre. In spite of a successful run after completing 80 days, the film was removed from twelve theatres to allow the release of Pachai Vilakku, another Sivaji Ganesan film. At Madurai Thangam, Karnan earned totally 186,805.62 after its 14-week run there. Since most films {{of the time in}} the Tamil film industry did not have box office reports, the film's exact collections are unknown, although <b>critics</b> <b>like</b> Baradwaj Rangan and M. Suganth state that the film was a box office failure during its release.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{policy was}} put forward in 1923 by the Australian Labor Party, {{which was in}} opposition for all but {{two years of the}} 1920s and 1930s. It called for Australia's first line of defence to be a powerful air arm, supported by a well-equipped Australian Army that could be rapidly expanded to meet an invasion threat. This, in turn, required a strong munitions industry. Labor politicians cited <b>critics</b> <b>like</b> Rear Admiral William Freeland Fullam, who drew attention to the vulnerability of warships to aircraft, naval mines and submarines. The Labor Party's Albert Green noted in 1923 that when a battleship of the day cost £7,000,000 while an aircraft cost £2,500, there was a genuine cause for concern as to whether the battleship was a better investment than hundreds of aircraft, if the aircraft could sink battleships. The Labor Party's policy became indistinguishable from the Army's position.|$|E
5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was at Paramount Pictures for {{producer}} Roger Edens. Funny Face contains {{four of the}} original George and Ira Gershwin songs from the otherwise unrelated 1927 Broadway musical {{of the same name}} that had starred Fred Astaire. Loosely based on the life of fashion photographer Richard Avedon, who was also the visual consultant and designed the opening title sequence for the film, it was written by Leonard Gershe and included additional music by Gershe and Edens. Donen and Edens began pre-production at MGM, but had difficulty juggling Astaire and Audrey Hepburn's Paramount contracts, the Warner Brothers – owned rights to the Gershwin music that they wanted and their own MGM contracts. Eventually a deal was reached that both released Donen from his MGM contract and allowed him to make his next two films at Paramount and Warner Brothers respectively. Astaire plays an aging fashion photographer who discovers the intellectual bohemian Hepburn at a used bookstore in Greenwich Village and turns her into his new model while falling in love with her in Paris. Donen, Avedon and cinematographer Ray June collaborated to give the film an abstract, smokey look that resembled the fashion photography of the period despite protests by Paramount, which had recently spent a fortune developing the crisp VistaVision. Funny Face was screened in competition at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and received good reviews from <b>critics</b> <b>like</b> Crowther. Sight and Sound, in contrast, accused it of being anti-intellectual.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} very well {{received}}. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of the <b>critics</b> <b>liked</b> the film, based on 26 reviews. It received a score of 81 on Metacritic, indicating [...] "Universal Acclaim", based on 13 critic reviews.|$|R

5000|$|René Wellek (August 22, 1903 - November 11, 1995) was a Czech-American {{comparative}} literary <b>critic.</b> <b>Like</b> Erich Auerbach, Wellek was an eminent {{product of}} the Central European philological tradition and {{was known as a}} vastly erudite and [...] "fair-minded critic of critics." ...|$|R
5|$|Some {{species have}} become so {{numerous}} that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand use by sea lions. Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks. In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam. The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing Pacific Northwest salmon populations. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted {{to ward off the}} sea lions using bombs, rubber bullets and bean bags. Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective. <b>Critics</b> <b>like</b> the Humane Society object to the killing of the sea lions, claiming that hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon. Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be culled, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually {{have a negative effect on}} the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.|$|E

50|$|The {{reaction}} to Another Hostile Takeover was mixed. <b>Critics</b> <b>liked</b> the album's diversity and braveness {{to try new}} things, {{but some of the}} old fans and hard rock fans thought that the album was weird and that Hanoi Rocks had changed too much since the 80s.|$|R
50|$|The game {{received}} generally positive reviews upon release. <b>Critics</b> <b>liked</b> the game's gameplay, progression system, visuals and map design, while {{criticizing the}} game's balancing issues and occasionally technical issues. The game {{was supported by}} both paid and free downloadable content and sold 300,000 copies within a month.|$|R
25|$|The Game {{was well}} {{received}} by <b>critics</b> <b>like</b> Roger Ebert and major periodicals like The New York Times, but had middling box-office returns {{compared to the}} success of Fincher's previous film, Seven.|$|E

25|$|Schiller is {{considered}} by most Germans to be Germany's most important classical playwright. <b>Critics</b> <b>like</b> F.J. Lamport and Eric Auerbach have noted his innovative use of dramatic structure and his creation of new forms, such as the melodrama and the bourgeois tragedy. What follows is a brief, chronological description of the plays.|$|E
50|$|Lady Gaga wrote {{a column}} for V Magazine in 2011 {{questioning}} the opinions of some critics' superiority over the general people's opinions, {{as well as their}} not actually being interested in the arts but in simply criticizing, where she referred to Horyn as a predictable <b>critic</b> <b>like</b> many others.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the chaos}} behind the scenes, the {{production}} received strong reviews, with Olivier's performance being singled out, and its run was {{extended from the}} initial five weeks that had been booked. Welles noted, [...] "We {{made a lot of}} money out of that production, and the <b>critics</b> <b>liked</b> it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>critics</b> <b>liked</b> Topaz. New York Times critic Vincent Canby in 1969 {{wrote of}} Topaz: [...] "Alfred Hitchcock at his best" [...] {{and put the}} film on his Top Ten list for 1969. In 1969, Hitchcock won the Best Director Award for Topaz from the National Board of Review.|$|R
25|$|Searle {{has argued}} that <b>critics</b> <b>like</b> Daniel Dennett, who (he claims) insist that {{discussing}} subjectivity is unscientific because science presupposes objectivity, are making a category error. Perhaps the goal of science is to establish and validate statements which are epistemically objective, (i.e., whose truth can be discovered and evaluated by any interested party), but are not necessarily ontologically objective.|$|E
25|$|Project Tiger, a {{wildlife}} conservation project, was initiated in 1972 and was launched by Indira Gandhi on 1 April 1973. With 23 tiger reserves, Project Tiger {{claimed to have}} succeeded. But according to <b>critics</b> <b>like</b> conservationist Billy Arjan Singh, temporary increases in tiger population were caused by immigration due to destruction of habitat in Nepal, {{not because of the}} widely acclaimed success of wildlife policy in India.|$|E
25|$|A {{gap between}} the alleged number of victims {{and the number of}} {{confirmed}} cases also characterizes the situation worldwide. The U.S. Department of State recently reported that 0.4 percent of the estimated victims of trafficking internationally had been officially identified. The State Department report provided no source for the number of either estimated or identified victims. Some <b>critics,</b> <b>like</b> Markon in the Washington Post, note that all such estimates are deeply flawed.|$|E
5000|$|Other <b>critics</b> <b>liked</b> the book. Jonathan Yardley of the Washington Post {{called it}} a [...] "nasty book, written in spectacularly execrable prose, but the view of Presley that it {{expressed}} dovetailed in many instances with my own, {{and in spite of}} itself I found things in it to admire." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1971, Vic Morrow {{starred in}} a {{television}} movie, produced by QM Productions for CBS entitled Travis Logan, D.A.. This movie was a pilot for a proposed weekly legal series {{in which he was}} to star.

5000|$|Lydia {{is portrayed}} as a moral and {{intelligent}} woman (although [...] "priggish" [...] according to Shaw) and is constantly contrasted with the [...] "ruffian" [...] Cashel.

25|$|Neoliberalism rose to {{prominence}} after the 1970s and neoliberal shock therapy became increasingly {{used as a}} response to economic crises, for example by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Neoliberal shock therapy became very controversial, with its proponents arguing that it helped to end economic crises, stabilise economies and pave the way for growth, while its <b>critics</b> (<b>like</b> Joseph Stiglitz) believed that it helped deepen them unnecessarily and created unnecessary social suffering.|$|E
25|$|Each year, {{the month}} of October is {{recognized}} as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month by many governments, the media, and cancer survivors. The month-long campaign has been called Pinktober because of the increased production of pink goods for sale, and National Breast Cancer Industry Month by <b>critics</b> <b>like</b> Breast Cancer Action. NBCAM was begun in 1985 by the American Cancer Society and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The organization that runs the official NBCAM aims to promote mammography {{and other forms of}} early detection as the most effective means of fighting breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|The Robbers (Die Räuber): The {{language}} of The Robbers is highly emotional, and {{the depiction of}} physical violence in the play marks it as a quintessential work of Germany's Romantic Sturm und Drang movement. The Robbers is considered by <b>critics</b> <b>like</b> Peter Brooks {{to be the first}} European melodrama. The play pits two brothers against each other in alternating scenes, as one quests for money and power, while the other attempts to create revolutionary anarchy in the Bohemian Forest. The play strongly criticises the hypocrisies of class and religion, and the economic inequities of German society; it also conducts a complicated inquiry into the nature of evil. Schiller was inspired by the play Julius of Tarent by Johann Anton Leisewitz.|$|E
500|$|It was {{released}} as a CD single {{in two different}} formats, with the commercial release featuring two previously unreleased bonus tracks and the promotional release featuring just the album version of [...] "This Is the Day". Music <b>critics</b> <b>liked</b> the track, with most considering it a standout track and noting the possibility of it making Apartment Life more successful.|$|R
5|$|Cryptum {{received}} mixed reviews; some <b>critics</b> <b>liked</b> the Forerunner {{culture and}} suspense that Bear created, but others disliked the characters, found the plot too slow {{and concluded that}} the novel was suited only to existing fans of the Halo series. Cryptum appeared on multiple bestseller lists after promotion on Halo Waypoint, a website that serves as a hub for Halo-related information.|$|R
5000|$|Soviet {{authorities}} {{described the}} comedy as [...] "too mundane and slight for the Soviet screen", so a third rental category {{was assigned to}} the film.

In 1962, the year of the USSR premiere it was seen by almost thirty-five million people.|$|R
