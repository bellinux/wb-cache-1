25|$|Cracking breaks larger {{molecules}} {{into smaller}} ones. This {{can be done}} with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal <b>cracking</b> <b>process</b> follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of free-radicals. The catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>process</b> involves the presence of acid catalysts (usually solid acids such as silica-alumina and zeolites), which promote a heterolytic (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C–C scission in position beta (i.e., cracking) and intra- and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding reactive intermediates (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.|$|E

However, the {{discrete}} particles in the BPM cannot produce a continuous displacement field, which is comparable with those in physical experiments and numerical method such as the finite element method. Displacement trend lines are introduced to analyze the displacement field type of the BPM in the present study. Three displacement field types (DF_I, DF_II and DF_III) are defined and used {{in the analysis of}} the <b>cracking</b> <b>processes.</b> The study shows that the type of displacement field may evolve during the <b>cracking</b> <b>processes.</b> Researchers are advised to examine the displacement field before and right after a particular crack has formed.

25|$|In the United States, western Europe, and Japan, {{butadiene}} {{is produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} the steam <b>cracking</b> <b>process</b> used to produce ethylene and other olefins. When mixed with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (often over 900°C), aliphatic hydrocarbons give up hydrogen to produce a complex mixture of unsaturated hydrocarbons, including butadiene. The quantity of butadiene produced depends on the hydrocarbons used as feed. Light feeds, such as ethane, give primarily ethylene when cracked, but heavier feeds favor the formation of heavier olefins, butadiene, and aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E

50|$|The {{importance}} of catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffin hydrocarbons to olefins {{has been growing}} steadily in recent years. Light olefins, such as butenes, are important raw materials for the synthesis of polymers, gasoline additives and various other petrochemical products. The <b>cracking</b> <b>processes</b> especially fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracker produce high-purity mono-olefins, such as 1-butene or butadiene. Despite such processes, currently more research is focused on developing alternatives such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for two reasons: (1) undesired reactions take place at high temperature leading to coking and catalyst deactivation, making frequent regeneration of the catalyst unavoidable, (2) it consumes {{a large amount of}} heat and requires high reaction temperatures.
