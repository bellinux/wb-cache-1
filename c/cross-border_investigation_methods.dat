40|$|Cooperation between {{judicial}} {{systems is}} a key factor for sustainable development, one of the EU’s major priorities. eGovernment plans and e-Justice initiatives supported by the European Commission and national governments create a very favourable background for the adoption of ICT standards {{in the area of}} cross-border judicial cooperation, both in Member States and in pre-Accession countries. Intensification of illegal immigration, trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings and the advent of terrorism have made necessary a stronger judicial collaboration between European countries. This cooperation includes mutual recognition of judicial decisions, collaboration in investigation phases and approximation of national penal legislations. During investigations, an exchange of information on criminal offences and administrative infringements takes place between judges and investigators belonging to different countries. This exchange is still mainly based on paper support. This essay presents an overview of judicial cooperation in <b>cross-border</b> <b>investigations</b> and describes how computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), coped with security technologies, can improve magistrates’ activities during <b>cross-border</b> <b>investigations</b> on criminal matters...|$|R

New Historicism theory is used to attain the objectives of this research. 	This research is a qualitative research and used content analysis technique to analyze the data. The main source of the data was a novel entitled A Study in Scarlet and the data was the expressions related to criminal <b>investigation</b> <b>methods</b> enclosed in A Study in Scarlet. Non-literary texts such as newspaper articles, journals, and books were also used as the secondary data. The {{analysis of the data}} was conducted in six steps; reading and rereading, noting, identifying, categorizing, analyzing, and interpreting. To obtain trustworthiness, the researcher used triangulation technique. 	The findings of this research show that there are three kinds of criminal <b>investigation</b> <b>methods</b> employed by Sherlock Holmes as seen in the novel. They are the conventional methods, the scientific methods, and Sherlock Holmes’ invented methods. Two of the categories seen through the novel reflect the kinds of criminal <b>investigation</b> <b>methods</b> applied in Victorian era: the conventional methods and the scientific methods. Despite the fact that Sherlock Holmes’ invented methods have the basis of either conventional methods or scientific methods, they are not the reflection of the criminal <b>investigation</b> <b>methods</b> that were commonly used in Victorian era.

40|$|Key Words: reading skill, group <b>Investigation</b> <b>method</b> 	One of {{teaching}} methods {{that can be}} used in teaching reading is group <b>investigation</b> <b>method.</b> Group <b>investigation</b> <b>method</b> is one of cooperative learning <b>methods.</b> In group <b>investigation,</b> students learn to understand reading text in a group. In this method, the students are divided into some groups consisting 2 to 6 students. Each group analyzes and discusses the reading text given by the teacher. After that, they have to present the result of their analysis and discussion. The formulation of the research problems was how can group <b>investigation</b> <b>method</b> improve students reading skill at eleventh grade of MA Arrisalah Ponorogo in academic year 2010 - 2011 ? The purpose of this study was to know how group <b>investigation</b> <b>method</b> can improve students’ reading skill at eleventh grade of MA Arrisalah Ponorogo in academic year 2010 - 2011. The research method of this study is classroom action research. The researcher used Kemmis and Mc Taggart’s classroom action research model, which have four procedures in each cycle, they are: planning, acting, observing and reflecting. He also chose report text as the topic that will be applied in his research. The subjects of this research were 16 students of class eleven D at MA Arrisalah Ponorogo in the academic year 2010 - 2011. The research was conducted in two cycles. In the cycle 1 showed that the students still confused about group <b>investigation</b> <b>method,</b> they did not show a good response to the material given. But, in cycle 2 the students were in good response. They looked so enthusiast, enjoying and interested with the teaching learning process. Besides, on test of first cycle, the students obtained an average score 72. 5. The mean is lower than the target learning mastery. But, after the researcher made improvements in the second cycle, the score is increasing to average value of 77. 5. It states that there is a significant effect in using group <b>investigation</b> <b>method</b> to the students of class eleven D at MA Arrisalah Ponorogo. In other words, the implementation of group <b>investigation</b> <b>method</b> was success, and it can be used as an alternative method to teach reading to the students of MA level...|$|R
