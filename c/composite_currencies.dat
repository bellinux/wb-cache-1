S. dollars or, subject to certain conditions and as provided in ""Description of the Notes Ì Form, Denomination and Title' ' herein, in other currencies or <b>composite</b> <b>currencies</b> as may be designated by the Bank at the time of oÅering as set forth in a supplement hereto which contains the speciÑc terms of an issue of Notes (the ""Pricing Supplement''). The Bank also may issue medium-term notes in the United States of America (""U. S. Notes'') under a U. S. Medium-Term Note Program. The aggregate proceeds of Notes and U. S. Notes outstanding may not at any one time exceed U. S. $ 1, 250, 000, 000 (or the equivalent in other currencies or <b>composite</b> <b>currencies</b> calculated as described herein); provided that the Bank reserves the right to increase such amount. This Information Memorandum supersedes the previous information memorandum dated May 14, 1993 prepared in connection with the Program. Any Notes issued under the Program on or after the date of this Information Memorandum are issued subject to the provisions provided herein. This does not aÅect any Notes already in issue. The Notes, which may be issued at their principal amount or at a premium or discount to their principal amount, may bear interest on a Ñxed or Öoating rate basis...|$|E

They can thus choose to peg their currency to a weighted average of several currencies (also known as a currency basket) [...] For example, a <b>composite</b> <b>currency</b> may be created consisting of 100 Indian rupees, 100 Japanese yen and one Singapore dollar. The country creating this composite would then need to maintain reserves in one or more of these currencies to intervene in the foreign exchange market. [...] A popular and widely used <b>composite</b> <b>currency</b> is the SDR, which is a <b>composite</b> <b>currency</b> created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), consisting of a fixed quantity of U.S. dollars, Chinese yuan, euros, Japanese yen, and British pounds.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{from the}} past three years {{indicates}} that the exchange rate between the private ECU and the official ECU Basket can deviate substantially from par. The value of the private ECU is driven by expectations that a future European Central Bank will enforce par convertibility between the private ECU and the official ECU basket of currencies. Meanwhile, no existing institutional arrangement limits the private ECU’s value in terms of the Basket. This paper addresses the question of what determines the values of the private ECU and of private ECU interest rates. We show that an anticipation of a future fixing of the private ECU’s value, together with the interest rate setting mechanism of the large-value ECU payment and clearing system, are sufficient to determine its value. The determination of the private ECU exchange rate provides the template for how to determine the value of any private <b>composite</b> <b>currency,</b> such as, for example, a private SDR. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{currency}} {{is said to}} be pegged within a band when the central bank specifies a central exchange rate with reference to a single currency, a cooperative arrangement, or a <b>currency</b> <b>composite.</b> It also specifies a percentage allowable deviation {{on both sides of this}} central rate. Depending on the band width, the central bank has discretion in carrying out its monetary policy. The band itself may be a crawling one, which implies that the central rate is adjusted periodically. Bands may be symmetrically maintained around a crawling central parity (with the band moving in the same direction as this parity does). Alternatively, the band may be allowed to widen gradually without any pre-announced central rate.|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} collapse of 2007 - 10 {{is described as}} a debt deflation crisis triggered by a speculative bubble. The basic causes are traced back to the policy choices of the great capitalist powers governing globalization. Market liberalization and the TRIPS agreements work as a sort of global capitalist pact against the working classes. The high tech capital of the advanced countries has a monopolistic advantage over scientific and technological research. The great capital of the emerging countries succeeds in fully exploiting the competitive advantages of their low labour costs. Their trade penetration in advanced capitalist markets has led to a reduction in labour demand and an increase in labour supply. This weakens the Trade Union movements and favours income redistribution from wages to profits. The governments of some advanced countries like Germany and Japan have reinforced redistribution processes by implementing restrictive fiscal and monetary policies. By the same token they have maintained the systematic current account surpluses that help to strengthen their currencies. The United States is unable to implement the same policy because they have to maintain a huge budget deficit to sustain the military expenditure required to ensure the opening of recalcitrant countries to globalization. Moreover they have to maintain a big trade deficit to expand the supply of international currency. Therefore they adopt expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. Finally, to feed domestic demand they favour residential and financial speculation, an expansion of debt-funded consumption and deregulation of financial markets. Emerging countries have reaped great advantages from this policy, as it enables them to maintain the systematic current account surpluses through which they stimulate their GDP growth and by means of which they have accumulated enormous dollar assets. But in the United States the disproportionate increase in private and public debt has nourished a speculative bubble that has dragged financial capital {{from all over the world}} into highly risky positions. The trade and industrial crisis was provoked by the debt deflation process triggered by the bubble burst. Probably it paves the way for rebalancing power relations among major geopolitical areas and redesigning the global governance system. China has reacted to the crisis by implementing expansionary fiscal policies, by which it intends to underpin the continuation of its growth. It is preparing to substitute the United States as a major engine of world economy. At the same time it is manoeuvring its currency reserves to pilot a smooth dollar devaluation followed by stabilization. Its goal is to flank the Dollar with a <b>composite</b> <b>currency</b> created by an IMF in which the influence of China is duly strengthened. JEL classification: E 320, F 43, G 21, O 1...|$|R
