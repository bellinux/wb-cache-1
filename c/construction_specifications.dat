5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous <b>construction</b> <b>specifications</b> in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{research}} projects were conducted starting in 1997 {{to evaluate the}} Iowa Department of Transportation 2 ̆ 7 s <b>construction</b> practices and <b>specifications</b> {{after a series of}} large embankment failures. Iowa State University researchers developed alternative methods for construction and quality control of earthen embankment utilizing strength based soil measurements. A formal <b>construction</b> <b>specification</b> was later developed that incorporated the elements of the previous studies into a usable embankment <b>construction</b> <b>specification.</b> This research focuses on the application of that <b>construction</b> <b>specification</b> to a pilot project in high plasticity clay soils. This work {{is one of the few}} documented cases of applying a strength based earthwork quality control procedure for cohesive fill. The results of this study show that the requirements of this specification are suitable for construction in these types of soils. Furthermore, performance testing on completed embankment fill revealed that adequate levels of shear strength were attained. Observations at the project did reveal that one area of concern is the material property testing. New provisions are recommended to address these concerns...|$|R

The <b>Construction</b> <b>Specifications</b> Institute (CSI) {{was founded in}} 1948 and began to address the organization of specifications into a numbering system.

In November 2004, MasterFormat expanded from 16 Divisions to 50 Divisions, reflecting innovations in the construction industry and expanding the coverage to a larger part of the construction industry.
