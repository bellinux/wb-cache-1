It lies along {{the boundary between the}} Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean and is one of nine populated Spanish territories in Africa <b>and,</b> along with <b>Melilla,</b> one of two populated territories on mainland Africa. It was part of Cádiz province until 14 March 1995 when both <b>Ceuta</b> <b>and</b> <b>Melilla's</b> Statutes of Autonomy were passed, the latter having formerly been part of Almeria province.|$|R

25|$|Llanito, {{the vernacular}} {{language}} {{for the majority}} of Gibraltarians, has significant Jewish influence.

25|$|As of 2015, Morocco still claims <b>Ceuta</b> <b>and</b> <b>Melilla</b> as {{integral}} {{parts of the}} country, and considers them to be under foreign occupation, comparing their status to that of Gibraltar. Spain considers both cities integral parts of the Spanish geography, since {{they were part of}} Spain for centuries before the Spanish colonial occupation of Morocco.|$|E
25|$|On October 30, the Government of Spain {{announced}} {{the visit of}} King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia to <b>Ceuta</b> <b>and</b> <b>Melilla</b> from 5 and 6 November.

50|$|The Spanish {{enclave of}} Ifni {{in the south}} {{became part of the}} new state of Morocco in 1969, but other Spanish {{possessions}} in the north, including <b>Ceuta,</b> <b>Melilla</b> <b>and</b> Plaza de soberanía, remained under Spanish control, with Morocco viewing them as occupied territory.|$|R
25|$|On the west, Spain is {{bordered by}} Portugal; on the south, it is bordered by Gibraltar (a British {{overseas}} territory) and Morocco, through its exclaves in North Africa (<b>Ceuta</b> <b>and</b> <b>Melilla,</b> and the peninsula of Vélez de la Gomera). On the northeast, along the Pyrenees mountain range, it is bordered by France and the Principality of Andorra. Along the Pyrenees in Girona, a small exclave town called Llívia {{is surrounded by}} France.|$|E
25|$|Algeciras is principally a {{transport}} hub and industrial city. Its principal activities are {{connected with the}} port, which serves as the main embarkation point between Spain and Tangier and other ports in Morocco {{as well as the}} Canary Islands and the Spanish enclaves of <b>Ceuta</b> <b>and</b> <b>Melilla.</b> It is ranked as the 16th busiest port in the world. The city also has a substantial fishing industry and exports a range of agricultural products from the surrounding area, including cereals, tobacco and farm animals.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} century, many Spanish Jews fled {{persecution}} under the Visigoths to North Africa, where {{they made their}} homes in the Byzantine-dominated cities along the Mediterranean coast. Others arrived after the expulsion from Iberia. Remnants of longstanding Jewish communities remain in Morocco, Tunisia, and the Spanish cities of <b>Ceuta</b> <b>and</b> <b>Melilla.</b> There is a much-diminished but still vibrant community on the island of Djerba in Tunisia. Since 1948 and the civil war to establish Israel, which aroused hostility in Muslim lands, most other North African Jews emigrated to Israel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ceuta,</b> like <b>Melilla</b> <b>and</b> the Canary Islands, was a {{free port}} before Spain joined the European Union. As of 2011, it has a {{population}} of 82,376. Its population consists of Christians, Muslims, and small minorities of Sephardic Jews and ethnic Sindhi Hindus.|$|R
2500|$|Morocco still claims <b>Ceuta,</b> <b>Melilla,</b> <b>and</b> [...] {{even though}} they are internationally {{recognized}} as administrative divisions of Spain (despite Plazas de Soberania which is a territory of Spain).

50|$|As of 2017, the AU {{spans the}} {{entirety}} of the African continent, with the exception of <b>Ceuta,</b> <b>Melilla,</b> <b>and</b> the plazas de soberanía.

25|$|Some Moroccan Arabic speakers, in the {{territory}} previously known as French Morocco, also practice code-switching. In the northern parts of Morocco, as in Tetouan & Tangier, {{it is common for}} code-switching to occur between Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, and Spanish, as Spain had previously controlled part of the region and continues to possess the territories of <b>Ceuta</b> <b>and</b> <b>Melilla</b> in North Africa bordering only Morocco. On the other hand, some Arab nationalist Moroccans generally attempt to avoid French and Spanish in their speech, consequently, their speech tends to resemble old Andalusian Arabic.|$|E
25|$|For the Congress of Deputies, 348 {{seats were}} elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list {{proportional}} representation, with a threshold of 3 per 100 of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold were not {{taken into consideration}} for seat distribution. Additionally, {{the use of the}} D'Hondt method might result in an effective threshold over three percent, dependant on the district magnitude. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Spain. Each constituency was entitled to an initial minimum of two seats, with the remaining 248 allocated among the constituencies in proportion to their populations. <b>Ceuta</b> <b>and</b> <b>Melilla</b> were allocated the two remaining seats, which were elected using plurality voting.|$|E
25|$|For the Senate, 208 {{seats were}} elected using an open list partial block voting, with electors voting for {{individual}} candidates instead of parties. In constituencies electing four seats, electors could vote {{for up to}} three candidates; in those with two or three seats, for up to two candidates; and for one candidate in single-member districts. Each of the 47 peninsular provinces was allocated four seats, whereas for insular provinces, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, districts were the islands themselves, with the larger—Majorca, Gran Canaria and Tenerife—being allocated three seats each, and the smaller—Menorca, Ibiza–Formentera, Fuerteventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma—one each. <b>Ceuta</b> <b>and</b> <b>Melilla</b> elected two seats each. Additionally, autonomous communities could appoint at least one senator each and were entitled to one additional senator per each million inhabitants.|$|E
50|$|Spanish {{public opinion}} is not {{generally}} aware of the Portuguese claim on Olivenza/Olivença (in contrast to the Spanish claim on Gibraltar or the Moroccan claims on <b>Ceuta,</b> <b>Melilla</b> <b>and</b> the Plazas de soberanía). On the other hand, awareness in Portugal has been increasing under the efforts of pressure groups to have the question raised and debated in public.|$|R
50|$|The only {{parts of}} {{continental}} Africa or outlying islands not {{represented by the}} AU are dependencies and other small territories of France (Mayotte, Réunion, and the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean), Italy (Pantelleria and the Pelagie Islands), Portugal (Madeira Islands), Spain (Canary Islands, <b>Ceuta,</b> <b>Melilla,</b> <b>and</b> the plazas de soberanía), the United Kingdom (Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha), and Yemen (Socotra).|$|R
50|$|The bilingual Muslims speak Arabic in <b>Ceuta</b> <b>and</b> Berber in <b>Melilla,</b> besides Spanish <b>and</b> have familiar, {{commercial}} and cultural relations with neighbour Morocco. Nevertheless, they generally maintain their political allegiance to Spain, despite the Moroccan {{claim on the}} two cities. This Berber language is used sometimes between the Spanish People of the city (Muslims, Christians, Jews, others), specially of Melilla like the Franco-Moroccan language. (lingua franca), many words are adapted by daily trade with Morocco and Algeria during the French colonial period from 1830 to 1962.|$|R
