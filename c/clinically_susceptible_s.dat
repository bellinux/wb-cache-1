40|$|Clinical {{breakpoints}} {{are used}} in clinical microbiology laboratories to categorize microorganisms as <b>clinically</b> <b>susceptible</b> (<b>S),</b> intermediate (I) or resistant (R) dependent on the quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility {{as indicated by the}} MIC value determined in a well-defined standard test system. The laboratory report, with the designations of S, I or R for each antimicrobial agent, provides guidance to clinicians with respect to the potential use of agents in the treatment of patients, and clinical breakpoints should therefore distinguish between patients that are likely or unlikely to respond to antimicrobial treatment. In Europe, clinical breakpoints are set by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), following a defined procedure. This includes evaluation of efficacy in experimental settings and clinical studies to derive pharmacodynamic targets such as the fAUC/MIC ratio or %fT > MIC required for efficacy, the pharmacokinetic properties of the agent, Monte Carlo simulations to estimate exposures of the antimicrobial agent in the target patient population and commonly used dosing regimens. The probability of target attainment is subsequently determined for a range of pharmacodynamic targets and the results from the Monte Carlo simulations. The breakpoints derived are subsequently evaluated with respect to the wild-type population of the target microorganisms, specific resistance mechanisms and other relevant data. In this paper, we provide an overview of the EUCAST process and considerations for setting pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic breakpoints. These are the breakpoints that in the EUCAST breakpoint tables are referred to as 'non-species-related breakpoints'...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} proposes a new SEIRS model that generalizes several {{classical}} deterministic epidemic models (e. g., SIR and SIS and SEIR and SEIRS) involving {{the relationships between}} the <b>susceptible</b> <b>S,</b> exposed E, infected I, and recovered R individuals for understanding the proliferation of infectious diseases. As a way to incorporate the most important features of the previous models under the assumption of homogeneous mixing (mass-action principle) of the individuals in the population N, the SEIRS model utilizes vital dynamics with unequal birth and death rates, vaccinations for newborns and non-newborns, and temporary immunity. In order to determine the equilibrium points, namely the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points, and study their local stability behaviors, the SEIRS model is rescaled with the total time-varying population and analyzed according to its epidemic condition R 0 for two cases of no epidemic (R 0 ≤ 1) and epidemic (R 0 > 1) using the time-series and phase portraits of the <b>susceptible</b> <b>s,</b> exposed e, infected i, and recovered r individuals. Based on the experimental results using a set of arbitrarily-defined parameters for horizontal transmission of the infectious diseases, the proportional population of the SEIRS model consisted primarily of the recovered r (0. 7 – 0. 9) individuals and <b>susceptible</b> <b>s</b> (0. 0 – 0. 1) individuals (epidemic) and recovered r (0. 9) individuals with only a small proportional population for the <b>susceptible</b> <b>s</b> (0. 1) individuals (no epidemic).

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of countering expresses {{the tendency of}} some highly <b>susceptible</b> <b>Ss</b> to favor {{the intent of the}} hypnotist when placed in a conflict situation where social influences of another kind dictate an alternative response.

Rapport was manipulated in 5 different experiments with highly <b>susceptible</b> <b>Ss</b> (Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form A), varying either the warmth or genuineness of the hypnotist. It was predicted from transference theorizing that countering would decrease in the negative context and increase in the positive one.

In the negative setting, Ss were inhibited in their rate of countering, but maintained their previous level of response to the hypnotist when rapport was facilitated.

Six gnotobiotic and two specific-pathogen-free lambs were co-inoculated with either rotavirus and ETEC (four animals), rotavirus and Cryptosporidium (two animals), or ETEC and Cryptosporidium (two animals). Lambs 4 days of age and older became only subclinically infected with either rotavirus, ETEC (08 :K 87 :K 99 ST+), or both enteropathogens given simultaneously. Six-day-old lambs inoculated with Cryptosporidium became extremely depressed, anorectic, and had intermittent diarrhea. There was no difference in the clinical manifestations, level of disaccharidase activity in the small intestine, or extent of histological damage between lambs inoculated with Cryptosporidium alone or together with either of the other two agents.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to (i) determine the prevalence of anti-EBA- 175 RII antibodies in a naturally exposed population, (ii) determine whether naturally acquired antibodies have a functional role by inhibiting binding of EBA- 175 RII to erythrocytes, and (iii) determine whether antibodies against EBA- 175 RII correlate with immunity to clinical malaria. We treated 301 lifelong residents of an area of malaria holoendemicity in western Kenya for malaria, monitored them during a high-transmission season, and identified 33 individuals who were asymptomatic despite parasitemia (clinically immune). We also identified 50 <b>clinically</b> <b>susceptible</b> individuals to serve as controls. These 83 individuals were treated and monitored again during the subsequent low-transmission season. Anti-EBA- 175 RII antibodies were present in 98. 7 % of the individuals studied. The antibody levels were relatively stable between {{the beginning and end of}} the high-transmission season and correlated with the plasma EBA- 175 RII erythrocyte-binding-inhibitory activity. There was no difference in anti-EBA- 175 RII levels or plasma EBA- 175 RII erythrocyte-binding-inhibitory activity between clinically immune and <b>clinically</b> <b>susceptible</b> groups. However, these parameters were higher in nonparasitemic than in parasitemic individuals at enrollment. These results suggest that although antibodies against EBA- 175 RII may be effective in suppressing some of the wild parasite strains, EBA- 175 RII is unlikely to be effective as a monovalent vaccine against malaria, perhaps due to allelic heterogeneity and/or presence of sialic acid-independent strains...|$|R

Atrazine response, carbon fixation rate, and PSII and whole-chain electron transport rates of hybrids were nearly identical to those of their respective maternal parents. Significant differences occurred between the two <b>susceptible</b> (<b>S,</b> S × R) and two resistant (R, R × S) biotypes in atrazine response (I 50), carbon fixation rate, and PSII and whole-chain electron transport rates; PSI rates were identical in all four biotypes. Coupled and uncoupled, whole-chain electron transport rates of thylakoids of the two susceptible biotypes were approximately 50 % greater {{than those of the}} two resistant biotypes at photon flux densities greater than 215 micromoles per square meter per second. Carbon exchange rates of the two susceptible biotypes were 23 % greater than those of the two resistant biotypes. Hybrid biotypes (S × R, R × S) were not identical to their maternal parents in biomass production. The S, S × R, and R × S plants all achieved greater biomass than R plants. These results suggest that while the resistance mutation influences thylakoid performance, reduced productivity of triazine-resistant plants cannot be ascribed solely to decreases in electron transport or carbon assimilation rates brought about by the altered binding protein. Since the F 1 hybrids differed from their maternal parents only in nuclear genes, it appears that the detrimental effects of the triazine resistance mutation on plant growth may be attenuated by interactions of the plastid and nuclear genomes...|$|R
