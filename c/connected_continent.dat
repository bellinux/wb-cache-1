40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the interplay of}} carrier and content regulatory layers in European internet law, how the 'Single Market' agenda informs and influences these layers and whether the proposed EU <b>Connected</b> <b>Continent</b> Regulation may solve some of the difficulties. The article starts with {{a brief overview of}} EU policy making in the area of telecommunications, moves on to explain the 'Single Market' background of EU internet regulation and looks at present telecommunications policy in its potential for the future. The main claim is that the origins of EU telecommunications policy can help understand and explain more general limitations of internet regulation and its more recent transformations. One of the main conclusions is that the 'Single Market' paradigm as understood in the 1990 s or 2000 s may not be best suited for the dynamic digital world of today...|$|E
40|$|The {{case study}} {{presented}} in this paper analyses the mobile market in Romania compared to that corresponding to the other European Union Member States. Mobile phone has appeared in various periods in the European Union countries and had a different development dynamics. Although {{there are a number of}} community regulations in the field of the EU telecommunications to which all the Member States are supposed to comply, there are many differences in the development of this sector at EU level. For this reason, the present study is conducted in several European Union Member States. Although the <b>Connected</b> <b>Continent</b> Package adopted by the European Commission does not involve the regulation issues, it provides a series of incentives for increasing investments as well as consumer protection. The present paper brings into focus the last legislative developments, coupled with the current economic context specific to Romanian mobile market...|$|E

40|$|The new {{smartphone}} era {{is challenging}} the leading position the European Union (EU) has been occupying in the mobile economy, falling behind other economies {{such as the}} United States and some countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The EU acknowledges the fragmented structure of the electronic communications market as {{being one of the}} main obstacles to LTE deployment. The EC argues that a main source of fragmentation is lack of harmonised conditions governing the use of radio spectrum across the EU. The EU member states have developed different and sometimes conflicting radio spectrum management practices through time. A consequent drawback is the impossibility of providing wireless broadband dervices across national borders and of deploying the necessary wireless networks and radio equipment. In consequence, on 11 September 2013, the European Commission put forward a new legislative package for a 'Connected Continent: Building a Telecoms Single Market' which contains several reforms directed to create a single telecommunications market. Some of the proposed reforms would partly modify the existing regulatory system of the radio spectrum, introducing harmonised conditions governing national assignment procedures. Through a document analysis and selected experts interviews the paper attempts to assess whether the EU is moving towards a strategic development of radio spectrum policy by looking at the EU initiatives on radio spectrum since the beginning in 1987. Then the focus is narrowed down to the <b>Connected</b> <b>Continent</b> legislative proposal, to value its contribution to the harmonisation of national assignment procedures. The historical overview of the EU radio spectrum policy shows that the EU has gradually acknowledged the negative implications of national fragmented and inconsistent radio spectrum governing rules. The EU has become aware of the need for a long-term strategy for the planning of the use of radio spectrum for the creation and functioning of the EU internal market. However, the paper also claims that in the arduous process of harmonisation of radio spectrum use much has still to be accomplished. Furthermore the paper draws the conclusions that the radio spectrum reforms contained the <b>Connected</b> <b>Continent</b> legislative proposal are probably not the means by which the harmonisation of radio spectrum use for the completion of the internal market can be enhanced. The EU and the EU member states have remarkably diverging and conflicting views on the content of the EC proposed reforms. The EU member states are unwilling to give up on their prerogatives on the radio spectrum by accepting too intrusive harmonised measures...|$|E
40|$|Australia {{is set to}} be the world’s most <b>connected</b> <b>continent</b> {{following}} {{the completion of the}} NBN rollout in 2020, according to new research released today. Developed by Western Sydney University, this report provides an in-depth analysis into how advancements in technology and nationwide access to fast broadband will transform all aspects of the Australian way of life. It predicts ‘gen nbn™’, Australia’s newest and most connected generation, will benefit from better business opportunities and flexible-working arrangements as well as access to leading education and healthcare services.  The report predicts: 	The internet of everything – Increased connectivity and digital innovation is rapidly penetrating every facet of day-to-day life. By 2020, technologies such as drones, 3 D printers, Virtual and Augmented Reality as well as home automation will become deeply entrenched in homes and workplaces. These technologies will help transform our lives and enable better connectivity with family and friends as well as provide access to a range of new entertainment options. By 2025 - 2030, there are likely to be well over 50 billion devices or apps connecting everything from our fridge door to our home security systems, which will be enabled to run concurrently over the nbn™ network. 	Rapid growth in medical innovations – Digital technology in health care is increasing exponentially with the advent of big data, advanced video conferencing systems and 3 D printing. By 2020, telehealth services, enabled by the nbn™ network will be able to connect regional, rural and remote areas with access to affordable and convenient GP and specialist healthcare appointments, saving up to $ 3 billion in annual health costs. By 2025, {{it may be possible to}} use big data to predict widespread disease outbreaks and by 2030 we are likely to see 3 D printing drastically enhance the ability to produce medical aids and prosthetics. 	E-change movement will continue – Access to fast broadband in regional towns and rapid adoption of teleworking is leading people to migrate away from the major cities to regional hotspots. From now to 2030, the nbn™ network will be a critical enabler to the success of home-grown start-ups across the country and will help to facilitate access to new markets and business opportunities while still enjoying their country or coastside lifestyles. Close to 400, 00 Australians workforce currently work from home; as fast broadband becomes more widespread, these figures could as much as double by 2025. 	Jobs of the future – Connectivity is driving innovation in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM) disciplines spurring a transformation of the Australian job market. Health, education and technical services are expected to employ over 4. 3 million Australians by 2030, up from the current 3. 5 million jobs. From now until 2030, we will see a huge increase in online educational resources and services offering better teaching facilities to upskill our nation in key areas such as health and technical services, to harness careers in data science, coding and bio-chemistry...|$|E
40|$|Dependent as {{they are}} on rare and remote open {{habitats}} for breeding and survival, shorebirds <b>connect</b> <b>continents</b> and hemispheres with their individual movements. Although many of the wetland systems on which shorebirds rely, especially in the rich West, have now some form of protection, two case studies on man-induced declines of Red Knots Calidris canutus in The Netherlands and the USA demonstrate that despite the legislation in these countries, the responsible authorities have tragically failed to provide the necessary safeguards. At the same time, these examples indicate how instructive shorebirds can be in elucidating ecosystem changes at local, and at global, scales. I advocate continued close scientific scrutiny of complementary sets of shorebird species {{so that we can}} be informed about their fate, and about the fate of ecosystems world-wide that are so effectively connected by their movements. ...|$|R

40|$|Fossils of a {{marsupial}} mole (Marsupialia, Notoryctemorphia, Notoryctidae) are described from early Miocene deposits in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland, Australia. These represent the first unequivocal fossil {{record of the}} order Notoryctemorphia, the two living species of which are among the world's most specialized and bizarre mammals, but which are also convergent on certain fossorial placental mammals (most notably chrysochlorid golden moles). The fossil remains are genuinely ‘transitional', documenting an intermediate stage in the acquisition {{of a number of}} specializations and showing that one of these—the dental morphology known as zalambdodonty—was acquired via a different evolutionary pathway than in placentals. They, thus, document a clear case of evolutionary convergence (rather than parallelism) between only distantly related and geographically isolated mammalian lineages—{{marsupial mole}}s on the island continent of Australia and placental moles on most other, at least intermittently <b>connected</b> <b>continents.</b> In contrast to earlier presumptions about a relationship between the highly specialized body form of the blind, earless, burrowing marsupial moles and desert habitats, {{it is now clear that}} archaic burrowing marsupial moles were adapted to and probably originated in wet forest palaeoenvironments, preadapting them to movement through drier soils in the xeric environments of Australia that developed during the Neogene...|$|R

6000|$|The coral insect {{is a small}} {{creature}} of the sea which has been gifted {{with the power of}} [...] "secreting" [...] or depositing a lime-like substance, with which it builds to itself a little cell or habitation.

Like many other creatures the coral insect is sociable; it is fond of company, and is never found working except in connection with millions of its friends. Of all the creatures of earth it shows perhaps the best example of what mighty works can be accomplished by union. One man can do comparatively little, but hundreds of men, united in their work, can achieve wonders, as every one knows. They can erect palaces and cathedrals towering to the skies; they can cover hundred of miles of ground with cities, and <b>connect</b> <b>continents</b> with telegraphs, but, with all their union, all their wisdom, and all their power, men cannot build islands--yet this is done by the coral insect; a thing without hand or brain, a creature with little more than a body and a stomach.

60|$|But {{the very}} same process which, so long as {{conditions}} remain substantially the same, secures the continuance of each species of animal or plant in its full perfection, will usually, under changed conditions, bring about whatever change of structure or habits may be necessitated by them. The changed conditions to which we refer are such as we know have occurred throughout all geological time and {{in every part of}} the world. Land and water have been continually shifting their positions; some regions are undergoing subsidence with diminution of area, others elevation with extension of area; dry land has been converted into marshes, while marshes have been drained or have even been elevated into plateaux. Climate too has changed again and again, either through the elevation of mountains in high latitudes leading to the accumulation of snow and ice, or by a change in the direction of winds and ocean currents produced by the subsidence or elevation of lands which <b>connected</b> <b>continents</b> and divided oceans. Again, along with all these changes have come not less important changes in the distribution of species. Vegetation has been greatly modified by changes of climate and of altitude; while every union of lands before separated has led to extensive migrations of animals into new countries, disturbing the balance that before existed among its forms of life, leading to the extermination of some species and the increase of others.|$|R
