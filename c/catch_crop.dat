5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable.

Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> in winter or as a forage crop. Some radishes are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production.

The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was comparison of the effect of tillage system (ploughing or conservation) and various <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and air dry matter produced by them on the level of weed infestation of spring wheat canopy cultivated after itself. The research was carried out in the years 2006 - 2008 on medium heavy mixed rendzina soil. The static two-factorial experiment included ploughing tillage (A) and conservation tillage with autumn disking of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (B) or with their spring disking (C). At the same time, four methods of stand regeneration were applied in spring wheat monoculture in the form of various <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> With reference to the control plot without <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (a), effect of undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> of red clover (b) was compared with westerwold ryegrass (c), as well as stubble <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> of lacy phacelia (d) and white mustard (e) on the level of weed infestation of spring wheat canopy. Conservation tillage increased species diversity of weeds in the canopy of spring wheat, their total number and air dry mass compared with the ploughing tillage.

50|$|A {{possible}} way {{to lower the}} concentrations of nitrate is to rebuild landscapes. Grass and <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> buffers and forest buffers are successful at preventing a buildup of excess nitrate. Any increase in vegetation leads to {{a decrease in the}} nitrate concentration, due to its uptake into the plant. The wetlands are the natural barrier to this, but they are being rapidly destroyed. The best way to prevent the dead zone is to remediate and rebuild the wetlands off the coast of Louisiana. In order for at least 40% of nitrate concentrations to be removed, 22,000 square kilometers of wetlands have to be rebuilt. This proves to be difficult because that would require 65 times the amount of wetland restorations that has happened over the past 10 years.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAmong {{possible}} mitigation {{options to}} reduce agricultural-borne nitrate fluxes to water bodies, introduction of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> before spring crops is acknowledged as a cost-efficient solution at the plot scale, {{but it was}} rarely assessed at the catchment level.

The objectives are (i) to discuss {{the potential benefits of}} <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> introduction taking into account the limitations due to the physiographic and agricultural context of the area (ii) to propose a multicriteria classification of these scenarios as a basis for discussion with stakeholders. We used the distributed agro-hydrological model TNT 2 to simulate 25 scenarios of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> management, differing in length of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> growing period, place in the crop rotation and residue management. The scenarios were classified considering the variations in main crop yields and either nitrogen fluxes in stream or the global nitrogen mass balance at the catchment level.

Among the scenarios involving additional <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> surface, introducing <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> between two winter cereals appeared as the most promising.

40|$|In {{maritime}} climates {{the production}} of winter wheat often leads to high nitrate leaching losses. In this study mixtures of winter wheat and <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were analyzed as alternative growing system to avoid high leaching losses. In a field experiment pure winter wheat grown as control showed highest N-losses. Leaching losses of 140 kg N ha- 1 after the pre-crop grass-clover and of 50 kg N ha- 1 after oats as pre-crop were measured. Compared to this, growing winter wheat in mixture with forage rape or oats reduced nitrate leaching by 50 %. Common vetch as mixture partner to winter wheat had a lower potential to reduce leaching losses. Comparable results were obtained growing the <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> alone followed by spring wheat. Due to the competition for growth factors between <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and cereal, yields of the tested mixtures were {{lower than those of}} spring wheat grown after <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> {{as well as of the}} winter wheat control.

The field was divided into eight separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 840 m². The amount of drainage water was measured and water samples were collected twice a month. The water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Soil samples were taken periodically from the 0 - 90 cm soil layer for analysis of mineral nitrogen. Plant material was sampled in late summer, late sutumn and early spring to measure plant growth and nutrient in crops, weeds and plat residues. The crop sequence was: oats (1993 and 1994), spring barley (1995), potatoes (1996), oats (1997) and spring barley (1998). The fertilizer regimes were commercial fertilizer according to normal reccommendations (90 kg N/ha) or half the dose of commercial fertilizer (45 kg N/ha) supplemented with pig slurry (on average, 94 kg tot-N/ha) applied before sowing in spring. Treatments with <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> were ploughed either in April-May or in early November, whereas other treatments without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> were stubble cultivated in August-September and plouged in November, or only plouged in April-May. The <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> didn't impact negatively on the yield; instead incorporation if <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> material seemes {{to increase the amount}} of nitrogen available for the next crop, due to increased nitrogen mineralization. Further, the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> reduced nitrogen leaching during the cold seasons to half when the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> was left to grow until spring ploughing. In late autumn, the amount of nitrogen in <b>catch</b> <b>crop,</b> including other green vegetation, was 15 - 17 kg N/ha, which were in the same range as the decrease of nitrogen leaching in treatments with spring ploughing and an undersown ryegrass. When tillage was delayed from early autumn to spring (without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop),</b> nitrogen leaching decreased with 25 %, due to lower mineralization during autumn and winter. Ploughing in spring did not result in increased nitrogen delivery from the soil during growing season, compared with tillage in early autumn. When pig slurry was used, nitrogen leaching increased somewhat, compared with treatments with commercial fertilizer nitrogen, due to increased nitrogen mineralization. The amount of plant available soil nitrogen during the growing season was also larger in treatments with pig slurry applications. Balances of nitrogen were positive in all treatments, especially in treatments with <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and spring ploughing.

It was the aim of this study to investigate the effects of incorporating a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> in a leek crop with minimal competition and to monitor how root growth affected N availability across soil depths at different distances between catch and leek crop rows. To reduce competition between both crops leek was planted at 0. 5 and 0. 75 m row distances and chicory (Cichorium intybus) as a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> at an interrow spacing of 0. 75 m.

40|$|During {{a three-year}} period studies of {{nitrogen}} dynamics, the utilization ratio of nitrogen by crops, and the leaching of nitrogen by tile drainage water in sandy soil in south-western Sweden. The field was divided into ten separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 0. 16 hectare. The amount of drainage water from each plot was measured and water samples were collected twice a month and weekly during flood periods. The water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus an potassium. The fertilizer regimes were: Unfertilized, commercial fertilizer according to general recommendations (90 - 110 kg/ha), liquid manure (pig slurry) in spring or autumn (90 - 110 tot. N kg/ha) supplemented with commercial fertilizer applied in the spring (45 - 55 N kg/ha) and treatments with double amount of liquid manure applied in spring or autumn also supplemented with commersial fertilizer. all treatments were grown with and without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> exept the treatments with autumn application of mature that are {{required by law to}} be followed by a green cover during the winter. During the first two years, Ialian ryegrass, and in the year perennial ryegrass wass grown as <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> The ryegrass was undersown in the main crop. The grop rotation was: Oat (1989), spring wheat (1990) an barley (1991). The treatments with ryegrass were ploughed in the spring whereas the other treatments were ploughed in the autumn after stubble cultivation following harvest. The <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> reduced the spring leaching substially in the single dose treatments with only commersial fertilizer and in th combined system with both manure and commercial fertilizer. The reduction was as high as 74 and 78 %, respectively, but in the treatment with a double dose of pig slurry the reduction stopped at 50 %. When pig slurry was applied in the autumn, the losses were doubled compared to spring application in spite of the <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> The unfertilized treatment (8 years) without a cac crop had 50 % less leaching compared with treatments with springapplied normal doses of fertilizers without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> The yield in the unfertilized treatment was only 34 % of the yield in the treatment with a normal dose of commercial fertilicer. The treatment with a singel dose of manure and half a dose of commercial fertilizer, bothe appliedin the spring, gave 7 % higher yield but a more lodged stand compared with the treatment with a single dose of commercial fertilize. The last two treatments had the best nitrogen utilization ration (82 % of applied N was taken away by the grain yield). A double dose of manure lowered both the yield and the nitrogen utilization ratio indipendent of time of application. The main reason for this was higher lodging tendency and higher leaching values. The cath crop lowered the yield (7 - 24 %) both in 1989 and 1990 in the treatment with spring-applied fertilizers. Also the fertilizer utilization ration was lower in the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> treatments. But in 1991 the diffferences were smaller. The main reason for this seems to be a delivery by mineralization from organic nitrogen from earlier ploughed-in catch crops. Important reasons for the drop in yield in the treatments with a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> seem to be competition with the main crop and large deficiency of mineral nitrogen in the early spring compared with treatments without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> Any net immobilization of nitrogen following the ploughing-in of cath crop could not be verified. At the time of yellow ripeness for the cereals, the intersown ryegrass had taken up 7 - 14 N kg/ha in the standing crop (above ground) {{and in the middle of}} November 11 - 90 N kg/ha, most in treatments were the nitrogen supply was good, such as in treatments with autumn application of manure or in treatments where the frequent use of manure had enlargeed the mineralization capacity of the soil. In the autumn the dry matter content of the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> varied between 800 - 2700 kg d. w. per hectare. From last autumn to early spring the N content of ryegrass changed only very little. The catch crops decreased the amount of mineral nitrogen in the soil (0 - 90 cm) from the time of yellow ripeness to late autumn exept in the treatments with autumn-applied manure. In treatments without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop,</b> the nitrogen mineralization capacity of the soil. In late autumn the dry matter content of the ryegrass changed only very little. The catch crops decreased the amounts of mineral nitrogen in the soil 80 - 90 cm) from the time of wellow ripeness to late autumn exept in the treatments with autumn-applied manure. In treatments without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop,</b> the nitrogen mineralization increased in the storage of mineral nitrogen throughout the autumn, leading to a higher leaching during the following winter compared with treatments with a <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> In the treatments with a <b>catch</b> <b>crop,</b> the mineral nitrogen storage continued to be fairly small until the time of spring ploughing. During the time from spring ploughing with a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> than in corresponding treatments without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> Yearly application of manure enlarged the delivery of mineral nitrogen from the soil compared with to treatments without manure. The delivery was also lowered in the treatment without any fertilizer application. Calculations show that a frequent manure addition gave an enlarged nitrogen leachong magnitude, as well as increased ammoniavolatilization and denitrification. In the autumn-ploughed treatments without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop,</b> the net mineralization of nitrogen from the time of yellow ripeness to early spring was higher than in the treatments with <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and spring ploughing. However, during the growing season, the minratlization was higher in the treatments with a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and spring ploughing. Thus, it seems as if anutumn ploughing stimulates the mineral N-mobilization during winter. In the treatments with a spring ploughed <b>catch</b> <b>crop,</b> the net mineralization during growing season is enlarged. The amounths of nitrogen mineralization also increased during the years, suggesting an additional influence of several years durration given by the ryegrass residues. The combination of a cath crop and spring ploughing therefore seems to both diminish leaching losses though retention of nitrogen in plants and plant residues, and futher offer a possibility to govern nitrogen prosesses in the soil in such a way that nitrogen ta a greater extent will released when it can be utilized by the crop...|$|E
40|$|This model {{analysis}} of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> effects on nitrate retention covered three soil texture classes sand, loamy sand, sandy loam) and three precipitation regimes in a temperate climate representative for northern Europe (annual precipitation 709 - 1026 mm) {{for a period}} of 43 years. Simulations were made with two catch crops (ryegrass and Brassica) with different rooting depths, and soil N effects in the next spring were analysed to 0. 25, 0. 75 and 2. 0 m depth to represent the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> effect on following crops with different rooting depths. Nitrate retained without a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> was generally located in deeper soil layers. In the low precipitation regime the overall fraction of nitrate retained in the 0 - 2. 0 m soil profile was 0. 23 for the sandy soil, 0. 69 for the loamy sand and 0. 81 for the sandy loam. Ryegrass reduced leaching losses much less efficiently than Brassica, which depleted nitrate in the 0 - 0. 75 m soil layer more completely, but also in the deeper soil layer, which the ryegrass could not reach. A positive N effect (Neff, spring mineral N availability after <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> compared with bare soil) was found in the 0 - 0. 25 m layer (i. e. shallow rooting depth of a subsequent main crop) in all three soil texture classes, with on average 10 kg N ha- 1 for ryegrass and 34 kg N ha- 1 for Brassica. Considering the whole soil profile (0 - 2. 0 m deep rooting of next crop), a positive Neff was found in the sandy soil, whereas generally a negative Neff was found in the loamy sand and especially the sandy loam. The simulations showed that for shallow-rooted crops, <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> Neff values were always positive, whereas Neff for deeper-rooted crops depended strongly on soil and annual variations in precipitation conditions.

We hypothesized that under the climate conditions of north-west Germany winter hard <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> are more suitable to reduce nitrogen (N) losses than <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> killed by frost, here especially with cereals or legumes as previous crop. In a field experiment in 2015 / 16 we tested 3 different <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (grown in pure stand and in mixture with legumes) after peas and triticale for their nitrogen loss paths over the winter period. Soil mineral N content (0 - 90 cm) was determined before and after winter. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions were measured weekly. Nitrate (NO 3) concentrations in leachate were analyzed once a week (Oct-Mar). The results show that corn legumes as pre crop have the highest N-loss potential over winter. In comparison, <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> demonstrate a good reduction of nitrogen losses pathways like NO 3 in leachate or gaseous N 2 O emissions. In particular significant lower nitrate losses via leaching were recorded after corn as pre crop. In comparison winter killed white mustard showed significant higher NO 3 and N 2 O losses over winter. Undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> showed the highest potential to mitigate N-losses...|$|R
40|$|Under {{conditions}} with wet mild winters {{due to high}} nitrate leaching risk growing systems with high nitrogen (N) uptake efficiency in autumn are necessary, especially after pre crops with a high N release. In 2003 and 2004 a field trial was conducted in Northern Germany to investigate autumn N uptake and nitrate leaching in autumn sown winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) grown intercropped with <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> <b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> in pure stands were sown as control. In each system three <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> common vetch (Vicia sativa), forage rape (Brassica napus) and oats (Avena sativa) were tested simultaneously. The experiment was run parallel after grass clover (high N status) and oats (low N status). N uptake, soil mineral nitrogen (Nmin) and nitrate leaching of all stands were determined. Especially with winter wheat intercropping with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> increased N-uptake in autumn. In all stands forage rape and oats led to a higher N uptake than common vetch. In comparison to pure sown winter wheat, intercropping reduced Nmin by more than 30 %. Nitrate leaching was highest after grass clover. Averaged over both pre crops intercropping of winter wheat and <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> led to a reduction of nitrate leaching {{in a range of}} 38 to 60 %. Grown as intercrop to winter oilseed rape forage rape and oats decreased nitrate leaching compared to pure sown rape by 50 and 39 %, respectively. If cultivation of winter wheat after N intensive pre cop in winter mild climates is wanted, an intercropped production system with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> is a mean to reduce N leaching risks. Further investigations are necessary to clarify on yield performance of the main crops when growing together with <b>catch</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} adaptive {{strategy for}} reducing climate change risks and increasing agro-system resiliency is broadening cropping system diversity, heightening {{the flexibility of}} cultivation and tillage methods. Climate change impacts on standard cultivation practices such as mineralisation and nitrate leaching due to mild and rainy winters, as well as frequent drought or water saturation, not only limiting fieldwork days, but also restricting ploughing. This calls for alternative methods to counteract these propensities. From 2010 to 2013, a farming system experiment was conducted on a distinctly heterogeneous organic farm in Brandenburg, Germany. With the intention of devising a more varied and flexible winter wheat cultivation method, standard organic farming practices (winter wheat cultivation {{after two years of}} alfalfa-clover-grass and ploughing in mid-October) were compared to four alternative test methods, which were then evaluated for their robustness and suitability as adaptive strategies. Two of the alternative methods, early sowing and <b>catch</b> <b>crop,</b> entailed moving up the date for alfalfa-clover-grass tilling to July. Instead of a plough, a ring-cutter was used to shallowly (8 cm) cut through and mix the topsoil. In the early sowing test method, winter wheat was sown at the end of August, after repeated ring-cutter processing. With the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> method, winter wheat seeding followed a summer <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and October tillage. The two oat methods (oat/plough; oat/ring-cutter) entailed sowing winter wheat in September, following oat cultivation. Overall, the cultivation methods demonstrated the following robustness gradation: standard practice = <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> ≥ early sowing > oat/plough > oat/ring-cutter. When compared to standard procedures, the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and early sowing test methods showed no remarkable difference in grain yields. Measured against early sowing, the <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> test method was significantly more robust when it came to winterkill, quality loss, and weed infestation (40 % lower weed-cover). High N min- values (up to 116 kg N ha - 1) in autumn could have caused the chamomile and thistle infestation in both oat/plough oat/ring-cutter test methods, which led to crop failure in the hollows. Compared to standard practices, the oat ring-cutter test method brought in over 50 % less grain yield. This was attributed to ring-cutter processing, which reduced N mineralisation and caused high weed infestation. However, the ring-cutter effectively regulated alfalfa-clover-grass fields in both exceedingly wet and very dry weather; a temporal flexibility which increases the number of fieldwork days. The <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and early sowing test methods contributed most to boosting future agronomic diversity...|$|E

40|$|Do manures spread {{before the}} sowing of a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> (CIPAN) present an {{excessive}} risk of nitrate leaching?. Description of the subject. The {{implementation of the}} Nitrates Directives in the Walloon region (in the south of Belgium) allows the summer spreading {{of any kind of}} manure on soils in preparation for the sowing of a <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> Objectives. This paper aims to assess whether the spreading of a manure before sowing a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> is more risky for groundwater quality than planting a cereal followed by another crop without any action being implemented between the harvesting of the cereal and the sowing (winter or spring) of the next crop. Method. This study is based on measurements of the nitrate nitrogen content of soils, {{at the beginning of the}} leaching period, performed on reference parcels and on controlled parcels. Results. Three thousand six hundred soil analyses performed in relation to controlled parcels between 2008 and 2013 showed that the presence of a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> (information about the possible application of a manure was not known) led to a nitrate nitrogen content (median) lower (with a very highly significant difference) than in a situation where no action was implemented between the two main crops. For the same period, the analysis of 600 results in reference parcels led to the same conclusion. Moreover, no significant difference was found between the two kinds of manure ("fast action", such as pig slurry or "low action", such as bovine manure). Conclusions. After the harvesting of a cereal, the spreading of a manure before sowing a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> creates no higher risk for water quality than the succession of a cereal by a crop sowed in the autumn...|$|E

The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was comparison of the effect of plough tillage and conservation tillage with the use of various <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on the yield and grain quality of spring wheat sown in monoculture on rendzina soil. The experiment was set up on rendzina soil with split-plot design in four replications and included plough tillage (A) and conservation tillage, conducted with two methods: with autumn disking of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (B) and with their spring disking (C). At the same time, four methods of regenerating plot in monoculture of spring wheat were conducted in a form of undersown red clover and Dutch ryegrass, as well as <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> of lacy phacelia and white mustard. The control were plots without <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> Plough tillage was favorable for obtaining higher ear density and grain number per ear, which consequently affected increase in the yield of spring wheat grain, compared with conservation tillage. Decrease in the yield of spring wheat grain on plots with conservation tillage, to the highest degree resulted from a decreased ear density. Ear number and grain yield obtained from the plots where stubble <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were sown as well as red clover, were significantly higher than on plots after undersown Dutch ryegrass and on the control plots.

40|$|Summary of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> {{experiments}} {{conducted at}} UCL. Since 2001, many <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> trials {{were set up}} by the Department of applied Biology and agricultural Productions of the Catholic University of Louvain. They aim at improving the management of interculture and its environmental impact. <b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> interest is mainly to cover the ground to trap the residual fertilizing elements and those mineralized after the harvest and so to reduce the quantity of potentially leachable nitrogen (PLN) during the period of refill of groundwater. The first trials have for objectives a better knowledge of species likely to meet the desired objectives: nitrogen absorption and agronomic characteristics. Afterward, other parameters were studied such as organic fertilization, crop management and mixtures of species. The results allowed to identify the species and to optimize the taking of nitrogen and provide Walloon farmers (Belgium) with necessary technical references...|$|R
