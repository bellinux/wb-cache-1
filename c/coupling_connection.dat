Even the qualitative dependence of spatiotemporal regularity on $p$ changes drastically as the angular frequency of the oscillators change, ranging from monotonic increase or monotonic decrease, to non-monotonic variation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the spatiotemporal dynamics of a lattice of coupled chaotic maps whose <b>coupling</b> <b>connections</b> are dynamically rewired to random sites with probability p, namely at any instance of time, with probability p a regular link is {{switched to a}} random one. In a range of weak coupling, where spatiotemporal chaos exists for regular lattices (i. e. for p = 0), we find that p > 0 yields synchronized periodic orbits. Further we observe that this regularity occurs over a window of p values, beyond which the basin of attraction of the synchronized cycle shrinks to zero. Thus we have evidence of an optimal range of randomness in <b>coupling</b> <b>connections,</b> where spatiotemporal regularity is efficiently obtained. This {{is in contrast to}} the commonly observed monotonic increase of synchronization with increasing p, as seen for instance, in the strong coupling regime of the very same system.

40|$|Dedicated to André HAEFLIGER, whose {{philosophy}} of differentiable cohomology has inspired {{the present paper}} We prove a cyclic cohomological analogue of Haefliger’s van Esttype theorem for the groupoid of germs of diffeomorphisms of a manifold. The differentiable version of cyclic cohomology is associated to the algebra of transverse differential operators on that groupoid, which is shown to carry an intrinsic Hopf algebraic structure. We establish a canonical isomorphism between the periodic Hopf cyclic cohomology of this extended Hopf algebra and the Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology of the Lie algebra of formal vector fields. We then show that this isomorphism can be explicitly implemented at the cochain level, by a cochain map constructed out of a fixed torsion-free linear connection. This allows the direct treatment of the index formula for the hypoelliptic signature operator – representing the diffeomorphism invariant transverse fundamental K-homology class of an oriented manifold – in the general case, when this operator is constructed {{by means of an}} arbitrary <b>coupling</b> <b>connection...</b>|$|E

Secondly, the polluted air current in CDRS is constrained by the driven cyclone passageway, and the velocity components of air current has axial, radial and tangential, so the air current in CDRS is transformed to a spiral air current. Thirdly, the dust particles are separated from the polluted air current by centrifugal force, and are captured by water sink. Finally, the watering air current from CDRS, is dewatered by water baffles, and is handled into a purified air current, which is closer to non-dust and non-water.|$|E

Unlike traditional call admission control procedures commonly used for performance evaluation of wireless networks, this paper {{deals with the}} problem of <b>coupling</b> <b>connection</b> and packet level QoS characteristics by analysis. At connection level we use the Blocked-Calls-Cleared (BCC) model, whereas at packet level we use the Blocked-Call-Interfered (BCI) model which has no immediate feedback from packet level to connection level about lost data. At connection level we use the convolution algorithm which defines the feasible state space at packet level. At packet level we take into consideration wireless interference (soft blocking). The traffic is modeled as multi-rate Binomial-Poisson-Pascal (BPP-) traffic at connection level and on-off traffic at packet level. We obtain individual performance measures for each service, both at connection level and at packet level. By case studies we investigate the trade-off between the two levels to meet Grade of Service (GoS) requirements for cellular networks with WCDMA radio interface.

Modifications in the physical layout of an optical device through changes in <b>coupling</b> <b>connection</b> design, splitting angles and waveguide dimensions may have significant effects on device performance. The beam propagation method is initially developed for a symmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer for baseline validation of the accuracy and applicability of the propagation scheme. A major validation is achieved through modeling an asymmetric device designed and built by the Naval Research Laboratory. The validated simulation model is {{used to analyze the}} performance and design characteristics of complex parallel configurations of interferometers. The beam propagation method allows quantitative analysis of the performance of these integrated optical devices. The propagation model developed implements a new global propagator scheme that substantially reduces computational requirements and introduces a design methodology that ensures compatibility between the discrete implementation and the physical structure. Also identified are areas in which continued research can provide a complete modeling system that may be implemented as a stand-alone design and analysis. NANAU. S. Marine Corps (U. S. M.

What influence generated by the results acting on the actual use of performance is still not clear. To this end, this article studied the influence generated by the angle of surface S tangent of coupler-knuckle on <b>coupling</b> <b>connection</b> contour and starting bearing line (referred to as surface S angle) to traction reliability, coupling feasibility and acting force in tangent line, systematically. And authors explored the value ranges of surface S angle {{in order to ensure}} the operation performance of coupler-knuckle. Firstly, find the major factors which are associated to surface S angle by studying the movement mechanism of coupling and traction. For example, the maximum level angle of coupler-knuckles, the ability for vehicle to pass the curves, etc. And then, get analytical expression of coupler surface S angle and related factors by means of theoretical derivation. After that, obtain value ranges of surface S angle. Finally, carry on experiments with multi-body dynamics simulation software RecurDyn. On the one hand, eliminate unreasonable value ranges obtained by theoretical derive, on the other hand, analyze the changing rule of the acting force on coupler-knuckle contour. The results prove that, when coupler surface S angle is 30 °, the traction performance of coupler is relatively stable, the coupling performance is relatively reliable, the contact force on coupler-knuckle contour is smaller. The conclusion is consistent with surface S angle parameter required by the standard system of Association of American Railroads. The research results above provided the theoretical basis for improving coupler’s manufacturability...|$|E
40|$|Strings on AdS_ 3 x S^ 3 and the Plane Wave Limit Oswaldo Zapata The AdS_{d+ 1 }/CFT_d {{holographic}} correspondence {{suggests a}} relationship between string theory, the only known consistent formulation of quantum gravity, and a superconformal field theory where gravity is absent. In this correspondence the strings live in a ten-dimensional space-time given by a direct product of an anti de-Sitter space (AdS), a space with negative cosmological constant, and a sphere (S). On the other hand the conformal field theory is only defined on the boundary of such an AdS space. In the last years this conjecture has passed {{a large number of}} tests, especially in the AdS_ 5 /CFT_ 4 case, and it continues to be intensively studied, in part due to the weak/strong <b>coupling</b> <b>connection</b> that links {{the two sides of the}} correspondence. Another realization of the correspondence is given by superstrings living on a AdS_ 3 x S ^ 3 x M_ 4 bulk space and a two-dimensional superconformal boundary field theory that is expected to be a non-linear sigma-model on a symmetric orbifold. The bosonic case is relatively well known (WZW model) and it provides by itself useful insight into some basic aspects of holography, nevertheless it is not completely satisfactory and new issues should come from the study of the superstring. So far we have made some progress in understanding and extending the bosonic results to the full fermionic string (M. Bianchi, and O. Zapata, to appear soon). An interesting limit of AdS x S is the plane wave background (pp-wave), which corresponds to the local background seen by an observer moving at the speed of light in the AdS x S space. This process of zooming-in around a null geodesic is known as Penrose limit. In the line of what we said above we expect string theory in this pp-wave background to be described by a special kind of WZW model. In particular, for the Penrose limit of AdS_ 3 x S ^ 3 the worldsheet current model is a generalization of the Nappi-Witten (NW) model. Using powerful CFT techniques we have been able to give explicit expressions for the string amplitudes (two, three and four insertions) in the relevant pp-wave background. Moreover, we have found {{a relationship between}} string amplitudes in the pp-wave and the correlators coming from the original formulation in the AdS space. Preliminary results suggest that in the boundary theory the correlation functions should mimic what has been done in the bulk side (M. Bianchi, G. D'Appollonio, E. Kiritsis and O. Zapata, [arXiv:~hep-th/ 0402004], published in JHEP 0404 : 074, 2004). We are convinced that following this approach we will be able to show how holography precisely works after the Penrose limit has been taken on both sides of the correspondence, something that has so far remained unclear. Then, by studying a simpler case (AdS_ 3 /CFT_ 2) we hope to shed light on the understanding of pp-holography in the more realistic and complicated AdS_ 5 /CFT_ 4 duality. A general overview of the PP-wave/CFT holographic correspondence and some preliminary results were presented in the `Tenth Marcel Grossmann Meeting', 20 - 26 July 2003, CBPF-ICRA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil [arXiv: hep-th/ 0312316]...|$|E

Further, the coupling ǫbifr at which the onset of spatiotemporal synchronisation occurs, scales with the fraction of rewired sites p as a power law, for 0. 1 < p < 1.
