5000|$|In 2002, Wennberg {{was elected}} {{chair of the}} Total <b>Carbon</b> <b>Column</b> Observing Network (TCCON). In 2004, the first TCCON site was established. [...] The Total <b>Carbon</b> <b>Column</b> Observing Network {{is a group of}} about 20 {{ground-based}} sites worldwide that host Fourier transform spectrometers. The spectrometers examine near-infrared (NIR) solar absorption spectra and measure atmospheric column abundances of CO2, CH4, CO, N2O and other molecules in terrestrial ecosystems. [...] Data enables researchers to identify and study local carbon [...] "sources" [...] and [...] "sinks", and by pooling data across the system, to better understand mechanisms of carbon exchange involving the atmosphere, the land, and the ocean. Data from the sites is used to understand carbon dynamics and to validate data from space-based measurements of atmospheric CO2 and CH4. Both terrestrial and atmospheric data are used to study carbon transfer within the atmosphere. Methane emissions from the Aliso Canyon gas leak were detected by TCCON within a day of the start of the leak.

This coordinated flight formation was intended to enable researchers to correlate OCO data with data acquired by other instruments on other spacecraft. In particular, Earth scientists would like to compare OCO data with nearly simultaneous measurements acquired by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite and ground-based data from the Total <b>Carbon</b> <b>Column</b> Observing Network (TCCON).

5000|$|The Total <b>Carbon</b> <b>Column</b> Observing Network (TCCON) is {{a global}} network of {{instruments}} that measure {{the amount of carbon}} dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and other trace gases in the Earth's atmosphere. The TCCON ( [...] ) began in 2004 with the installation of the first instrument in Park Falls, Wisconsin, USA, and has since grown to 23 operational instruments worldwide, with 7 former sites. [...] The TCCON is designed to investigate several things, including the flow (or flux) of carbon between the atmosphere, land, and ocean (the so-called carbon budget or carbon cycle). This is achieved by measuring the atmospheric mass of carbon (the airborne fraction). The TCCON measurements have improved the scientific community's understanding of the carbon cycle, and urban greenhouse gas emissions. The TCCON supports several satellite instruments by providing an independent measurement to compare (or validate) the satellite measurements of the atmosphere over the TCCON site locations. The TCCON provides the primary measurement validation dataset for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) mission, and has been used to validate other space-based measurements of carbon dioxide.|$|E

The Limulus assay procedure was easily adapted to the testing of water samples for endotoxin. Measured endotoxin concentrations varied from 0. 78 ng/ml to 1, 250 ng/ml. Levels of endotoxin were not predictable based on whether the water was drinking water or AWT water, i. e., some AWT water samples had less endotoxin activity than some samples of drinking water, and some AWT waters had greater endotoxin activity than drinking water. Only three of the water samples tested were free of any detectable endotoxin.
