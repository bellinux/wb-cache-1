Maintenance of product temperature below 5 °C. is impera-tive {{in order to meet}} USDA requirements for safe delivery of fresh poultry. Bacterial growth processes accelerate rapidly as tem-peratures increase. With temperatures in excess of 5 °C. some pathogenic types will increase in numbers. Investigators at Package Research Labo-ratory (1956) compared weight losses of birds packed in <b>corrugated</b> and wirebound <b>containers</b> and found a 2. 61 lb. average weight loss of all birds in each <b>corrugated</b> <b>container,</b> and a 2. 22 lb. average loss of all birds in each wirebound container after 76 hours.

40|$|Cyclic {{changes in}} {{temperature}} and humidity in real-life distribution environments decrease BCT and life-span of standard <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers.</b> As a result, BCT obtained from testing at standard TAPPI environment may be inadequate to protect the products inside from damages during real-life distribution. The <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers</b> users need to understand this concept in order to design a proper <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers</b> at a cost-efficient price that can retain BCT in these extreme {{temperature and humidity}} changes environments. Wax curtain coating {{is one of the}} most commonly used techniques to retain BCT of <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers</b> that are distributed in short-term high humidity environment, and usually found in the fresh produce, poultry and meat industries. In this study, standard and wax curtain coated <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers</b> were top-loaded with two different safety factors and conditioned in three different cyclic environments. Every 24 hours, moisture contents and heights of these loaded test containers were determined to investigate life-span and relationship between moisture content change and reduction in height. In addition, unloaded standard and wax curtain coated <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers</b> were conditioned in three different cyclic and constant environments. The reduction in BCT of these unloaded test containers in each cyclic and constant environment was investigated after the loaded test containers in that cyclic environment reached the critical deflection. The results of the experiment showed that there was a notable difference in reduction in BCT of the standard unloaded test containers after exposure to every cyclic and constant environments, but not of the wax curtain coated unloaded test containers. The life-span of loaded wax curtain coated test containers were also greater than of loaded standard test containers in every cyclic environment. The greater difference of temperature in cyclic environment resulted in greater moisture content change of corrugated material. Thus, both types of test containers experienced the greatest moisture content change in cyclic cold storage environment. However, due to its most severe temperature and relative humidity, cyclic tropical environment showed the greatest effect on reduction in BCT, reduction in height and life-span of both types of test containers...|$|R

40|$|This study evaluates {{compression}} damage to <b>corrugated</b> shipping <b>containers</b> {{used in the}} small parcel delivery system. A client is experiencing an unacceptable level of end-to-end compression resistance during shipment through small parcel companies, while never experiencing any top-to-bottom {{compression damage}}. According to small parcel company workers, {{there is a need}} for more end-to-end compression strength in <b>corrugated</b> shipping <b>containers.</b> This study examines the effect of corrugation direction on <b>corrugated</b> shipping <b>containers</b> and <b>corrugated</b> board. Box compression testing (BCT) is performed on regular-slotted containers with different corrugation directions. Edgewise compression testing (ECT) is also used in comparing the compression strengths of sample corrugated boards with various corrugation directions. ECT and BCT values directly relate to the compression resistant properties of <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers</b> and board. The results of the tests show that compression strength increases less as corrugation becomes more perpendicular to the applied force. By altering the corrugation direction, the end-to-end compression strength can be increased at a higher percentage rate than the top-to-bottom compression strength is reduced...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{compression}} strength of <b>corrugated</b> fiberboard <b>containers</b> used to package agricultural products rapidly decreases owing to various environmental factors encountered during {{the distribution of}} unitized products. The main factors affecting {{compression strength}} are moisture absorption, long-term top load, and fatigue caused by shock and vibration during transport. This study characterized the durability of <b>corrugated</b> fiberboard <b>containers</b> for packaging fruits and vegetables under simulated transportation conditions. Methods: Compression tests were done after <b>corrugated</b> fiberboard <b>containers</b> containing fruit were vibrated by an electro-dynamic vibration test system using the power spectral density of routes typically traveled to transport fruits and vegetables in South Korea. Results: To predict loss of compression strength owing to vibration fatigue, a multiple nonlinear regression equation (r 2 = 0. 9217, RMSE = 0. 6347) was developed using three independent variables of initial container compression strength, namely top stacked weight, loading weight, and vibration time. To test the applicability of our model, we compared our experimental results with those obtained during a road test in which peaches were transported in <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers.</b> Conclusions: The comparison revealed a highl...|$|R

40|$|The {{stacking}} life of <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers</b> {{under load}} decreases as relative humidity (RH) increases and when RH cycles, compared with when RH remains stable. Conventional RH test schedules {{that rely on}} fixed cycle periods do not adequately reflect the significance of moisture diffusion and hygroexpansion rate phenomena on the creep of <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers</b> and general wood fiber products. With cycle periods shorter than a critical period, materials are relatively unaffected by cyclic changes in RH. Longer periods amplify material hygroexpansion and accelerate creep. In this study, we propose a swept sine RH schedule in which the cycle frequency varies logarithmically with time and set forth equations for generating a numerical control signal. Data from creep tests of corrugated fiberboard reveal the frequency dependence of the amplitude and phase relationships between cyclic hygroexpansion and cyclic RH. A swept sine RH schedule yielded the continuous form of the response characteristics varying with cycle period {{that could not be}} acquired with multiple constant period schedules. The critical cycle period and the hygroexpansion response to moisture as a function of cycle period are proposed as criteria for discriminating among hygroexpansion-creep models...|$|R
