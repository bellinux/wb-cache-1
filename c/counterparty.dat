The state is unique in that no Native American tribe in California is the <b>counterparty</b> to a ratified federal treaty. Therefore, all the Indian reservations in the state were created by federal statute or executive order.|$|E
5|$|Proponents {{of the use}} of {{leverage}} argue that using leverage can be risk-reducing rather than risk-increasing provided four conditions are met: (i) enough unencumbered cash is kept to meet any margin calls (ii) leverage is applied to a well-diversified portfolio (iii) assets can be rebalanced frequently and (iv) <b>counterparty</b> risk is minimized.|$|E
50|$|For {{exchange}} traded derivatives, {{if one of}} the <b>counterparties</b> defaults in this periodic exchange, that <b>counterparty's</b> {{account is}} immediately closed by the exchange and the clearing house is substituted for that <b>counterparty's</b> account.Marking-to-market virtually eliminates credit risk, but it requires the use of monitoring systems that usually only large institutions can afford.|$|R
50|$|All parties {{involved}} in trades must submit timely notifications of approaching, exceeding, {{and no longer}} exceeding the clearing threshold as defined by EMIR. This clearing regulation applies to financial <b>counterparties</b> such as banks, insurers, and managers of assets, as well as non-financial <b>counterparties.</b>|$|R
50|$|An NDF is a short-term, cash-settled {{currency}} forward {{between two}} <b>counterparties.</b> On the contracted settlement date, the {{profit or loss}} is adjusted between the two <b>counterparties</b> based on {{the difference between the}} contracted NDF rate and the prevailing spot FX rates on an agreed notional amount.|$|R
25|$|To {{minimize}} <b>counterparty</b> risk to traders, trades executed on regulated futures exchanges {{are guaranteed}} by a clearing house. The clearing house becomes the buyer to each seller, and the seller to each buyer, {{so that in}} the event of a <b>counterparty</b> default the clearer assumes the risk of loss. This enables traders to transact without performing due diligence on their <b>counterparty.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has <b>counterparty</b> risk, {{because the}} <b>counterparty</b> is contractually obligated {{to match the}} return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap <b>counterparty.</b> A potential hazard is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral, and that collateral could be of dubious quality. Furthermore, the investment bank could use its own trading desk as <b>counterparty.</b> These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), so the investor should look for UCITS III-compliant funds.|$|E
25|$|Derivative {{contracts}} are leveraged positions whose value is volatile. They are usually more volatile than their underlying asset. This {{can lead to}} credit risk, in particular <b>counterparty</b> risk: {{a situation in which}} one party to a trade loses such a large sum of money that it is unable to honor its settlement obligation. In a safe trading environment, the parties to a trade need to be assured that the counterparties will honor the trade, no matter how the market has moved. This requirement can lead to complex arrangements like credit assessments and the setting of trading limits for each <b>counterparty,</b> thus removing many of the advantages of a centralised trading facility. To prevent this, a clearing house interposes itself as a <b>counterparty</b> to every trade, in order to extend a guarantee that the trade will be settled as originally intended. This action is called novation. As a result, trading firms take no risk on the actual <b>counterparty</b> to the trade, but instead the risk falls on the clearing corporation performing a service called central <b>counterparty</b> clearing. The clearing corporation is able to take on this risk by adopting an efficient margining process.|$|E
50|$|Then the {{collateral}} teams {{on both sides}} establish {{the collateral}} relationship. Key details are communicated and entered into the two collateral systems. Some initial collateral may be posted to enable the <b>counterparties</b> to trade immediately in small size. Once the account is fully established the <b>counterparties</b> can trade freely.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} labor market {{model in which}} {{financial}} firms compete for a scarce supply of workers who can be employed as either bankers or traders. While hiring bankers helps create a surplus that can be split between a firm and its trading <b>counterparties,</b> hiring traders helps the firm appropriate {{a greater share of}} that surplus away from its <b>counterparties.</b> Firms bid defensively for workers bound to become traders, who then earn more than bankers. As <b>counterparties</b> employ more traders, the benefit of employing bankers decreases. The model sheds light on the historical evolution of compensation in finance...|$|R
25|$|A margin is {{collateral}} {{that the}} holder {{of a financial}} instrument has to deposit to cover {{some or all of}} the credit risk of their <b>counterparty,</b> in this case the central <b>counterparty</b> clearing houses. Clearing houses charge two types of margins: the Initial Margin and the Mark-To-Market margin (also referred to as Variation Margin).|$|E

50|$|In September 2013, new {{obligations}} embedded into EMIR took effect, requiring EU {{banks and}} their <b>counterparties</b> {{to discuss and}} agree on processes and procedures for portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution of derivatives executed in the OTC market.

In November 2013, ESMA published the final draft on EMIR's technical standards in regards to non-EU <b>counterparties.</b> In January 2014, mandatory transaction reporting for OTC derivatives began under EMIR.|$|R

25|$|A {{clearinghouse}} acts as {{the buyer}} to every seller and seller to every buyer, {{reducing the risk of}} <b>counterparty</b> defaulting on a transaction. In the over-the-counter market, where credit- default swaps are currently traded, participants are exposed to each other in case of a default. A clearinghouse also provides one location for regulators to view tradersâ€™ positions and prices.|$|E
25|$|A {{financial}} derivative is {{a financial}} instrument whose value {{is derived from}} a commodity termed an underlier. Derivatives are either exchange-traded or over-the-counter (OTC). An increasing number of derivatives are traded via clearing houses some with Central <b>Counterparty</b> Clearing, which provide clearing and settlement services on a futures exchange, as well as off-exchange in the OTC market.|$|E

25|$|A further, often ignored, risk in {{derivatives}} such as {{options is}} <b>counterparty</b> risk. In an option contract this {{risk is that}} the seller won't sell or buy the underlying asset as agreed.

25|$|An August 2012 {{survey by}} the Financial Services Authority {{concluded}} that risks were limited and had reduced as a result, inter alia, of larger margins being required by <b>counterparty</b> banks, but might change rapidly according to market conditions. In stressed market conditions, investors might suddenly withdraw large sums, resulting in forced asset sales. This might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether risk-based regulation is an efficient approach to the regime of Central <b>Counterparties</b> (CCPs) in the OTC derivatives market. The discussions below will first attempt to throw some light on the way risk-based regulation operates. They highlight the benefits, limits and complexities tied to the adoption of this approach to regulation. The core of the study in this paper is the analysis concerning the parameters that risk-based regulation offers to assess the current regime of Central <b>Counterparties</b> in the OTC derivatives market in the UK. The paper explores the UK risk-based model of regulation and supervision governing OTC derivatives. It is specifically focused on prudential supervision and conduct of business rules governing OTC derivatives transactions and the increasing tendency to use Central <b>Counterparties</b> CCPs. Additionally, this study will identify and assess the risks to the regulatorâ€™s objectives that are posed by the Central <b>Counterparties</b> CCPs, and to address those using various regulatory tools...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{dynamics}} of default cascades in a network of credit interlink-ages in which each agent {{is at the same}} time a borrower and a lender. When some <b>counterparties</b> of an agent default, the loss she experiences amounts to her total exposure to those <b>counterparties.</b> A possible conjecture in this context is that individual risk diversification across more numerous <b>counterparties</b> should make also systemic defaults less likely. We show that this view is not always true. In particular, the diversification of credit risk across many borrowers has ambiguous effects on systemic risk in the presence of mechanisms of loss amplifications such as in the presence of potential runs among the short-term lenders of the agents in the network...|$|R
