50|$|In the United States, {{pre-stressed}} concrete <b>cylinder</b> <b>pipes</b> (PCCP) {{account for a}} vast majority of water transmission mains. Due to their large diameters, failures of PCCP are usually catastrophic and affect large populations. Approximately 19000 mi of PCCP have been installed between 1940 and 2006. Corrosion in the form of hydrogen embrittlement has been blamed for the gradual deterioration of the pre-stressing wires in many PCCP lines. Over the past decade, CFRPs have been utilized to internally line PCCP, resulting in a fully structural strengthening system. Inside a PCCP line, the CFRP liner acts as a barrier that controls the level of strain experienced by the steel cylinder in the host pipe. The composite liner enables the steel cylinder to perform within its elastic range, to ensure the pipeline's long-term performance is maintained. CFRP liner designs are based on strain compatibility between the liner and host pipe.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to dela with the entry flow problem for a micropolar fluid in steady motion in a semi-infinite <b>cylinder</b> <b>pipe.</b> The problem to be studied is "end effect" {{involving}} comparison between two motion: the Poiseuille flow (basic flow) and another flow with the same velocity flux. Our main result is an explicit estimate which establishes the rate of exponential decay, with axial distance z from the entry, of the dissipation energy of the perturbation thus providing a qualitative description of the flow development. We find that, under mild hypothesis on the asymptotic behavior of the fields and a smallness assumption on the velucity flux, the flow tends to the Poiseuille flow in the energy norm as z tends to infinity. We give also an upper bound for the perturbation energy through the data of the problem...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{prestressing}} wires of {{prestressed concrete}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>pipe</b> (PCCP) provide core concrete with compressive stress to resist internal pressure. Broken wires resulting from corrosion and embrittlement may cause cracking in pipe wall {{and increase the}} risk of failure with time. In order to reveal the mechanism of longitudinal cracking in PCCP with broken wires, a simplified model is developed and the maximum number of broken wires to preclude onset of longitudinal cracking can be determined conveniently by the equations derived in this paper. Verification against results of finite element analysis shows that the presented method has decent accuracy for appropriate effective pipe length and wall thickness. By comparing the calculated maximum number of broken wires with the actual number of broken wires detected by inspection and monitoring technologies, longitudinal cracking in prestress loss zone can be predicted, thus aiding condition assessment of PCCP...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{deterioration}} after {{a period}} of service can induce the failure of prestressed concrete <b>cylinder</b> <b>pipes</b> (PCCPs), with microcracks in the coating leading to the corrosion of the prestressed wires. In this paper, we propose the use of Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) strain sensors for detecting the onset of microcracking in PCCP coating: the BOTDA strain sensors are mounted {{on the surface of the}} PCCP, and distributed strain measurements are employed to assess the cracks in the mortar coating and the structural state of the pipe. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, experimental investigations were conducted on a prototype PCCP segment, wherein the inner pressure was gradually increased to 1. 6 [*]MPa. Two types of BOTDA strain sensors—the steel wire packaged fiber optic sensor and the polyelastic packaged fiber optic sensor—were employed in the experiments. The experimental distributed measurements agreed well with the finite element computations, evidencing that the investigated strain sensors are sensitive to localized deterioration behaviors such as PCCP microcracking...|$|R

Further, a detail survey of the pipeline was performed using a combination of non-destructive technologies in order to determine if immediate intervention was required to replace PCC pipes. In addition, a hydraulic model was employed to analyze the behavior of air pockets located at high points of the pipeline...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Recent years, many {{utilities}} {{have experienced}} catastrophic rupture of critical Prestressing Concrete <b>Cylinder</b> <b>Pipe</b> (PCCP) lines throughout the world. Much {{attention has been}} focused on reliably assessing the condition of PCCP mains. However, assessment of embedded prestressing wire is difficult. Continuous acoustic monitoring can provide a means of locating problematic pipe sections. In this paper the application of support vector machine (SVM) in acoustic signal detection is proposed. And the effect of this method is investigated. Some key parameters of SVM and kernel functions are surveyed. SVM methods are more effective, especially for the case of lack of training samples. The experiment shows that the SVM method has good classification ability and robust performances. The techniques can provide the opportunity to identify problematic pipe sections and repair the pipe prior to failure. Therefore it can help to prolong the life of a suspect pipeline while minimizing the potential for catastrophic failure...|$|E

40|$|Broken {{prestressing}} wire wraps are {{the main}} cause of failure in prestressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP). The effect of the number and location of broken wire wraps on the structural performance of PCCP is investigated using advanced numerical modeling that considers full interaction between the spigot and bell ends of adjacent pipes. The stresses and strains in the various components of PCCP are evaluated with increasing internal pressure. A sensitivity analysis is performed to understand how manipulating the severity of the damage through varying the number of broken wire wraps affects the internal fluid pressure that causes failure. A 244 -cm (96 -in.) embedded <b>cylinder</b> <b>pipe</b> (ECP) is modeled with 5, 35, 70, and 100 broken wire wraps. The results obtained show that the internal fluid pressure required to cause failure can be as much as 14 % lower when the damage is at the joint, and that the internal pressure that causes yielding of the wire wraps decreases approximately 65 % as the severity of the damage increases from 5 to 100 broken wires.
