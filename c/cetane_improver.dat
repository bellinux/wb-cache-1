Meanwhile, the centre of the heat release curve moves close to the top dead centre, and the maximum rate (dQb/dQ) max of heat release and the maximum rate (dp/dQ) max of pressure rise increase with increase in the ethanol fraction in the blends.

40|$|Abstract:Green Fuel, {{also known}} as Biofuel {{is a type of}} fuel {{distilled}} from plants and animal materials. It is believed by most of the people to be more environmentally friendly than the widely used fossil fuels. Green fuel has evolved as a possible fuelling option as the world drains out its possible energy resources. It has a big role to play in the future as far as the replacements to the already existing fossil fuels are concerned. We, as a group, aim at evaluating the performance and combustion characteristics of one of the biofuels, bio diesel. The performance of biodiesel can be evaluated by an index called as cetane number. Cetane number is a measurement of combustion quality of diesel fuel during compression ignition. It is a significant expression of diesel fuel quality among a number of other measurements that determine overall diesel fuel quality. Data has been collected from the experiments done and comparison is drawn between the performance of diesel engine filled with biodiesel and diesel.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} presented here was to compare the effects of fuel composition on combustion parameters, emissions and fuel consumption in engine tests and simulations with five fuels: a diesel-water emulsion, a diesel-ethanol blend, a diesel-ethanol blend with EHN (<b>cetane</b> number <b>improver),</b> a Fischer-Tropsch diesel and an ultra-low sulfur content diesel. The engine used in the experiments was a light-duty, single-cylinder, direct injection, common rail diesel engine equipped with a cylinder head and piston from a Volvo NED 5 engine. In tests with each fuel the engine was operated at two load points (3 bar IMEP and 10 bar IMEP), and a pilot-main fuel injection strategy was applied under both load conditions. Data were also obtained from 3 -D CFD simulations, using the KIVA code, to compare to the experimental results and to further analyze the effects of water and ethanol on combustion. The experimental data indicated that the lower aromatic content of Fischer-Tropsch diesel fuel resulted in reduced soot emissions compared to conventional diesel. Use of Fischer-Tropsch diesel also gave lower NO emissions. The diesel-ethanol blend gave a large reduction in soot emissions, but higher NO emissions than the diesel-water emulsion.

40|$|The ternary phase {{behaviour}} of the n-heptane-l-propanol-water {{system was}} studied and {{compared with the}} theoretical prediction based on the UNIQUAC model for non-electrolyte solutions. The results showed that this model adequately approximated experimental studies. The excess enthalpies and excess volumes for several binary mixtures were determined. The excess enthalpies were measured using a LKB flow microcalorimeter and the excess -volumes determined using a PAAR densitometer. The study showed that no significant enthalpy or volume changes occurred when petrol/n-heptane were mixed with alcohols. Ternary phase diagrams, including tie lines have been determined {{for a number of}} petrol-alcohol-water systems (including the Sasol blend of alcohols). The tie line results show that the concentration of water in the water-rich layer is strongly dependent on the type of alcohol used. The Sasol alcohol blended with petrol resulted in a high water concentration in the water-rich layer which forms on phase separation. This is believed to contribute significantly to the corrosion problems experienced by motorists using the Sasol blended fuel on the Witwatersrand. The effect of temperature on several of these blends was included in the study. Diesel-alcohol blends and the co-solvent properties of ethyl acetate investigated. Ethyl acetate ensures miscibility at low concentrations for diesel-ethanol blends.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to collect and evaluate environmentally relevant data on mineral oil additives and their combustion products. In addition, their concentration ranges, chemistry and functions in the mineral oils are described. Lubricant and fuel additives belong to the quantitatively most important chemicals with a total quantity of 84600 tons estimated for Germany 1997 / 98 (57400 tons of lubricant additives, 27200 tons of fuel additives). They determine substantially the characteristic profile of engine oils, gasoline and diesel. Main lubricant additive families are detergents, dispersants, antioxidant/antiwear agents (ZDTP), inhibitors, and viscosity modifiers. Examples for fuel additives are detergents, antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, <b>cetane</b> <b>improvers</b> (diesel), and wax crystal modifiers (diesel). Based on the information available in the literature and provided by the manufacturers the environmental fate of the additives is explored, and inventories (calculations of the input and output) are presented. Data for emission volumes and additional 'reasonable worst case' assumptions were calculated on this basis. But as measurement data in this area is very limited, the calculated emissions are uncertain. Comparison of the emitted additive combustion products (CO_ 2, CO, NO_ 2, NMVOC, particulate matter) with exhaust limit values for tail pipe emissions and total traffic emissions in Germany showed that the contribution of additive combustion products to particles is more significant than to other fractions. The results of the calculations indicate that the portion of mineral oil additives of the traffic-dependent particle emissions in Germany is approximately 7 % (ca. 3 / 5 from lubricant additives and ca. 2 / 5 from fuel additives).

Performance and emissions characteristics of a CI engine fuelled with DTBP blended LPG fuel were examined.

Exhaust emissions measurements showed that hydrocarbon were decreased with the blended fuel at enhancing cetane number. Furthermore, the combustion stability of LPG with a <b>cetane</b> number <b>improver</b> was equivalent to that of commercial Diesel fuel. Increasing the EGR rate leads to deteriorate the IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure) and increase the ignition delay.

40|$|Past {{research}} has shown that during diesel combustion, soot is formed in local premixed fuel-rich regions. This project focuses on the fundamentals soot formation under fuel-rich conditions similar to those in diesel engine operation. Since these conditions cannot be easily reproduced in typical laboratory scale experiments, such as flat-flame burners, and since diesel engine data are difficult to interpret because of uncertainty in the local charge composition and thermal state, a new rapid compression machine (RCM) was built to study the phenomenon. The RCM provides a well-controlled and uniform engine-like thermal environment, where mixing and chemistry are decoupled. Fuel-rich mixtures of n-butane and air were primarily used in this study; aromatics, oxygenates and <b>cetane</b> <b>improvers</b> completed the test matrix. Line-of-sight absorption technique was used to investigate the details of soot evolution. The primary data set consisted of soot volume loading history for selected fuels at various equivalence ratios, temperatures and pressures. Based on existing sub-models, a detailed chemical kinetic calculation leading to soot particles was per- formed to study the relative importance of the underlying chemistry. The results show that the initial soot volume grows exponentially with time, reflecting an "autocatalytic" mechanism. The growth rate depends strongly on temperature and pressure. The lower rates observed for richer mixtures can be attributed to lower temperatures {{after the end of the}} main heat release process, when most of the soot is formed. Soot yield increases steadily with fuel-air equivalence ratio and depends on fuel structure. Toluene addition to n-butane increases the final soot yield at constant fuel-air equivalence ratio (- 1 %/ 1 % toluene by mol) but not at constant C/O ratio. (cont.) Oxygenates totally suppress soot formation at or above 30 % oxygen in fuel by mass. Since soot formation is kinetically limited at lower temperatures and soot precursors are not thermodynamically stable at higher temperatures, soot yield exhibits a bell-shape dependence on temperature with a maximum at approximately 1800 - 2000 K. Thus different surface growth mechanisms prevail across the temperature range; the relative contribution of C 2 H 2 over PAH to soot growth increases with temperature. Even though nucleation is mostly governed by PAH coalescence, it was found that the C 2 H 2 route is not negligible under certain conditions. The kinetics of fuel-rich combustion was found to be sensitive to the fuel+HOO reaction. Suggestions are made for better correlation between model and experiments regarding ignition delay and rate of heat release. While performing this study, insight was gained into RCM operation. Assuming uniform and homogeneous environment at the end of compression, was sufficient to model ignition delays under most conditions (2 - 10 ms), but not rate of heat release and maximum pressure. CFD analysis predicted non-negligible temperature stratification at the end of compression (- 80 % of mass within 50 K). A multizone model, taking into account zones of constant mass and allowing heat transfer and flow into the crevice, was developed and improved the agreement significantly. by Ioannis Kitsopanidis.

40|$|With {{growing concern}} over {{greenhouse}} gases {{there is increasing}} emphasis on reducing CO 2 emissions. Despite engine efficiency improvements plus increased dieselization of the fleet, increasing vehicle numbers results in increasing CO 2 emissions. To reserve this trend the fuel source must be changed to renewable fuels which are CO 2 neutral. As a renewable, sustainable and alternative fuel for compression ignition engines, biodiesel is widely accepted as comparable fuel to diesel in diesel engines. This is due to several factors like decreasing the dependence on imported petroleum, reducing global warming, increasing lubricity, and reducing substantially the exhaust emissions from diesel engine. However, {{there is a major}} disadvantage in the use of biodiesel as it has lower heating value, higher density and higher viscosity, higher fuel consumption and higher NO x emission, which limits its application. Here fuel additives become essential and indispensable tools not only to minimize these drawbacks but also generate specified products to meet the regional and international standards. Fuel additives can contribute towards fuel economy and emission reduction either directly or indirectly. Their use enable vehicle performance to be maintained at, or near, optimum over the lifetime of the vehicle. A variety of additives are used in automotive biodiesel fuel to meet specification limits and to enhance quality. For example, metal based additives, oxygenated additives, antioxidants, <b>cetane</b> number <b>improvers,</b> lubricity improvers and cold flow improvers are used to meet specifications and quality. This article is a literature review of the effect of various additives on biodiesel properties, engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics and the corresponding effect factors were surveyed and analyzed in detail. The review concludes that the use of additive in biodiesel fuel is inalienable both for improving properties and for better engine performance and emission control. Therefore, in order to find the appropriate fuel additives in the combustion applications, more experiments are needed to explore the different related mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Cetane {{number is}} the {{accepted}} indicator for quantifying the autoignition characteristics of diesel fuels in compression ignition engines. Diesel fuel specifications typically require a minimum cetane number to achieve satisfactory combustion behaviour in conventional diesel engines. In contrast, a high cetane number fuel {{may not be}} beneficial for implementing high efficiency, clean combustion strategies such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate cetane number effects on HCCI combustion and emissions. The experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder, variable compression ratio, cooperative fuel research engine operated in HCCI combustion mode. The fuels were finely atomized and partially vaporized in the intake manifold. The base fuel was a low cetane refining stream derived from oil sands sources. Three different methods were employed to increase the base fuel cetane number, namely hydroprocessing, <b>cetane</b> <b>improver</b> addition, and blending with a renewable fuel component. Results show that the three methods of cetane number enhancement produce significantly different HCCI combustion behaviour. The hydroprocessed fuels exhibited more stable and complete combustion than the base fuel, which resulted in a wider operating region, reduced carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon, and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and lower indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC). The main disadvantages of the hydroprocessed fuels were the higher exhaust gas recirculation rates required to retard the combustion phasing, which limits the maximum indicated mean effective pressure for a given intake pressure, and increased knock intensity due to a faster combustion process. In comparison, the other twomethods of fuel cetane enhancement increased ISFC compared to the base fuel. The addition of nitrate <b>cetane</b> <b>improver</b> resulted in higher NOx emissions, while blending with a renewable fuel component increased hydrocarbon emissions. The experimental data provide evidence that the magnitude and phasing of low temperature heat release, as well as fuel volatility,play important roles in HCCI combustion.

40|$|New {{premixed}} diesel combustion strategies, {{with their}} low engine-out PM and NOx emissions, are highly attractive for production implementation given increasingly strict emissions regulations. Accordingly, premixed diesel combustion strategies must operate effectively on commercially available diesel fuel, whose critical properties vary substantially. It is therefore critical {{to understand how}} premixed diesel combustion strategies respond to variations in fuel properties, especially cetane number the primary quantification of ignition behavior. This research study sought to understand the connection between diesel fuel properties, in particular cetane number, and the combustion and emissions behavior of premixed diesel combustion. Four primary test fuels with cetane numbers varying over the range expected in the field (42 - 53) were used, along with a secondary matrix of fuels to characterize {{the behavior of a}} nitrate <b>cetane</b> <b>improver.</b> Fuel effects were quantified across a range of EGR levels, injection pressures, and engine loads to identify secondary parameter interactions. Gaseous emissions, particularly NOx emissions, were found to be dependent solely on combustion phasing and EGR rate for the primary test fuels at the studied condition. Fuel cetane number shifts the combustion phasing (increasing cetane number advances phasing) but {{is only one of many}} different parameters which shift combustion. The effect of varying cetane number can be counteracted by varying injection timing to yield matched combustion phasing. The presence of 2 -ethylhexyl nitrate (2 -EHN) <b>cetane</b> <b>improver</b> within the fuel introduces a new fuel-borne NOx formation mechanism to the combustion process, which significantly increases NOx emissions in a premixed diesel combustion mode. The increase in NOx emissions stems from NOx formed by the decomposition of the 2 -EHN additive. The trends and magnitudes of soot, CO, and HC emissions remain constant for all tested fuels across a range of engine loads. The high load limit of the tested premixed diesel combustion mode is primarily limited by equivalence ratio, with excessive soot, CO, and HC emissions resulting as the overall equivalence ratio approaches stoichiometric. The light load limit is limited by high CO and HC emissions and the ability of a diesel oxidation catalyst to reduce these emissions to acceptable levels...|$|E

My comments are specifically directed to the use of di-tertiarybutyl peroxide (DTBP) for mitigation of the exhaust NOx increase generally observed from biodiesel blended fuels. Numerous studies have shown that both DTBP and 2 -ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN), when added to diesel fuel, will reduce NOx emissions.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) studied a number of potential approaches to mitigate the NOx increase observed when using biodiesel blends. They conclude...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increased}} travel demand, {{the consumption of}} fossil fuels, as {{the main energy source}} for transportation, has risen sharply over the last few decades. Fossil fuels are considered a non-renewable resource. In addition, burning them in internal combustion engines can generate a large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. According to the life-cycle assessment, use of renewable fuels as alternatives in diesel engines can help to dramatically reduce GHG emissions. Furthermore, the oxygen content in alcohols may help to suppress soot formation significantly. Therefore, mixing renewable alcohols in diesel fuel may offer a potential solution for reducing GHG emissions, soot emissions and fossil fuel consumption. Hence, it is important to investigate the possibility of using alcohol/diesel blends in existing diesel engines. To reproduce the characteristics of existing engines as closely as possible, a light duty (LD) single-cylinder engine, a heavy duty (HD) single-cylinder engine and a four-cylinder LD engine were employed with production engine settings. In both types of single-cylinder engine, engine performance and emissions were studied under steady-state conditions. In the four-cylinder LD engine, the cold start behaviour of the fuels was investigated. Four alcohols were selected to mix with diesel, i. e. n-butanol, isobutanol, 2 -ethylhexanol and n-octanol. These alcohols were blended separately with one of two different <b>cetane</b> number (CN) <b>improvers,</b> either hydrotreated vegetable oil or di-tertiary-butyl peroxide, in diesel fuel. The mixtures were prepared to have the same CN as diesel fuel. With the same CN and engine settings, the alcohol/diesel blends and diesel fuel showed very similar heat release profiles. The blends generated slightly faster combustion, leading to slightly higher indicated thermal efficiency, than diesel fuel under most of the tested conditions in both types of single-cylinder engine. Soot emissions decreased sharply when changing diesel fuel to alcohol/diesel blends. Further, the n-butanol and 2 -ethylhexanol diesel blends showed good cold start performance in the multi-cylinder LD engine. In conclusion, the results showed that from a combustion point of view, it is possible to use renewable fuels, such as n-butanol, iso-butanol, n-octanol or 2 -ethylhexanol, mixed with diesel and ignition improver in existing diesel engines without any engine modifications...|$|R
40|$|The {{diesel fuel}} {{stability}} is related with the fuel composition that evolved {{to the modern}} fuels from the historical ones. The stability of modern diesel fuel is mainly due to {{the reduction of the}} oxidation processes, the result of the presence of unsaturated components and components with oxygen as organic components and cetane index improvers. These fuel components may form insoluble particles and gum that can contribute to rapid fuel injection system wear and filter plugging. Therefore, the simple characteristic of serious degradation of diesel fuel is the appearance of resins and sediments. The present paper concentrates on the development of simple measurement procedure that can find application in construction of low cost the capillary sensor which enables the examination of the stability of modern diesel fuel including classification of not degraded fuel, fuel on first stage of degradation and serious degraded fuel. As a basic of development the degradation of most widely used <b>cetane</b> <b>improver</b> (2 -ethyl hexyl nitrate) and presence of resin are examined in one arrangement. Results of a sensor working on the principle of scattered signal and fluorescence excited in a disposable capillary cell with two, UV and VIS, high power light emitted diodes are presented...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel {{produced}} from soybean oil, canola oil, yellow grease, and beef tallow was tested in two heavy-duty engines. The biodiesels were tested neat and as 20 % by volume blends with a 15 ppm sulfur petroleum-derived diesel fuel. The test engines were the following: 2002 Cummins ISB and 2003 DDC Series 60. Both engines met the 2004 U. S. emission standard of 2. 5 g/bhp-h NO{sub x}+HC (3. 35 g/kW-h) and utilized {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (EGR). All emission tests employed the heavy-duty transient procedure as specified in the U. S. Code of Federal Regulations. Reduction in PM emissions and increase in NO{sub x} emissions were observed for all biodiesels in all engines, confirming observations made in older engines. On average PM was reduced by 25 % and NO{sub x} increased by 3 % for the two engines tested {{for a variety of}} B 20 blends. These changes are slightly larger in magnitude, but in the same range as observed in older engines. The <b>cetane</b> <b>improver</b> 2 -ethyl hexyl nitrate was shown to have no measurable effect on NO{sub x} emissions from B 20 in these engines, in contrast to observations reported for older engines. The effect of intake air humidity on NO{sub x} emissions from the Cummins ISB was quantified. The CFR NO{sub x}/humidity correction factor was shown to be valid for an engine equipped with EGR, operating at 1700 m above sea level, and operating on conventional or biodiesel...|$|E
