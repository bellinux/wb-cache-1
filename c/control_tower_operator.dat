5000|$|Tim [...] "Spud" [...] Barrett is the well-meaning but bumbling chief pilot [...] - [...] in fact, {{the only}} pilot [...] - [...] and {{part-owner}} of Triple A Airlines, a charter airline based at Crawford Airfield in Los Angeles, California. His business partner, the inept co-owner {{and president of}} Triple A, is Herb Kenworth, who is cranky, terrified of flying, and prone to airsickness. Triple A [...] - [...] which stands for [...] "Anywhere Anytime Airlines" [...] - [...] owns only one plane, a decrepit Beechcraft Model 18 named Lucky Linda, and {{is always on the}} verge of bankruptcy. Mrs. K. J. Crawford, a tough businesswoman, owns both Crawford Airfield and Crawford Airlines, a larger and more successful charter airline that is in direct competition with Triple A and based at the same airport; she also holds a mortgage on Lucky Linda. Her sycophantic son, Ronnie Crawford, helps her run the airport and her airline and is always trying to put Triple A out of business. Spud has a romantic interest in a Crawford Airlines employee, Becky Parks, who is friendly toward Triple A and helps Spud and Herb whenever she can. Spud and Herb often eat at the airport terminals diner, the Chez Skyway, run by Harry Wetzel. Sherman Bell is the <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> <b>operator.</b>|$|E
25|$|Radar {{contact and}} tracking, {{sometimes}} from multiple sites. These have included {{military personnel and}} <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> <b>operators,</b> simultaneous visual sightings, and aircraft intercepts. One such example were the mass sightings of large, silent, low-flying black triangles in 1989 and 1990 over Belgium, tracked by NATO radar and jet interceptors, and investigated by Belgium's military (included photographic evidence). Another famous case from 1986 was the Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident over Alaska investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).|$|R

50|$|In May 1943, a Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) {{contingent}} {{was established}} at Kirtland Field {{with the arrival}} of 45 women on base. WAAC quarters built at Kirtland Field included barracks, a day room, beauty shop, and supply room. A WAAC open house for the new post was held in August 1943 and several hundred men with their wives and families attended. Initially, most WAACs and WACs worked as file clerks, typists, stenographers, or motor pool drivers. Gradually, their jobs grew more technical as positions were created for weather forecasters, parachute riggers, radio operators and repair specialists, sheet metal workers, bombsight maintenance specialists, <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> <b>operators,</b> and cryptographers.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, the FAA {{modified}} {{their approach}} to air traffic control hiring. They launched more [...] "off the street bids", allowing anyone with either a 4-year degree or 5 years of full-time work experience to apply, rather than the closed college program or VRA bids, something that had last been done in 2008. Thousands have been picked up, including veterans, CTI grads, {{and people who are}} true [...] "off the street" [...] hires. The move was made to open the job up to more people who might make good controllers but did not go to a college that offered a CTI program. Before the change, candidates who had completed coursework at participating colleges and universities could be [...] "fast-tracked" [...] for consideration. However, the CTI program had no guarantee of a job offer, nor was the goal of the program to teach people to work actual traffic. The goal of the program was to prepare people for the FAA academy in Oklahoma City, OK. Having a CTI certificate allowed a prospective controller to skip the Air Traffic Basics part of the academy, about a 30- to 45-day course, and go right into Initial Qualification Training (IQT). All prospective controllers, CTI or not, have had to pass the FAA Academy in order to be hired as a controller. Failure at the academy means FAA employment is terminated. In January 2015 they launched another pipeline, a [...] "prior experience" [...] bid, where anyone with an FAA <b>Control</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>Operator</b> certificate (CTO) and 52 weeks of experience could apply. This was a revolving bid, every month the applicants on this bid were sorted out, and eligible applicants were hired and sent directly to facilities, bypassing the FAA academy entirely.|$|E

I like to receive the Bulletin even better. I should bring you {{up-to-date}} on my address and title. It is now [...] Corporal C. L. Crawley 3 rd Airways Communications Sq. Army Air Base Eagle Pass, Texas. I am a <b>Control</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>Operator</b> and by no {{stretch of the imagination}} can Bryant College take credit for making a so-called radio man out of me. When I was inducted I asked to be placed in “Finance” but four days later I was in the Air Force and the first of June I was in Radio School. So I don’t know what to advise potential draftees to ask for when the time comes. One thing about it, though, it sure is a snap in the Army. Just drill, that’s all. Give my best wishes for a Happy New Year to Mssrs. [sic] Lambert, Lee, Naylor and Gulski and tell those old men {{to stay out of the}} Army. It is bad enough for us young, single men. I have just spent the queerest Christmas. I went to town last night in shirt-sleeves. Never did that in New England this time of year. Was talking to a girl last night who has only seen snow which really covered the ground once in 24 years. They just use natural gas for heat. The gas rationing is tough on the people down here. All these little towns are at least 40 miles apart. So what is a rancher going to do about his mail on 4 gallons of gas per week? And this is where they grow the stuff. Best wishes to all of you.

Mine hasn’t changed though my title has. I am {{classified as a}} <b>Control</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>Operator</b> down here and also it has been rumored that I am a Radio Mechanic. The latter {{is a case of}} slander against all good radio men everywhere so we will have to discount it. Indeed Randolph Field had my civilian occupation as a Mech and as all of my mechanical knowledge was confined to typewriters, bookkeeping machines and driving automobiles I think there must have been some mistake. But in keeping with established Army Policy I was found to be wasting my time doing clerical work and made into a pseudo radio man and promotions have come much faster than if I had been placed into something I knew about. But I’m not mad about it at all. I stay down here on the friendly Mexican border and make forays across the Rio Grande now and then for a decent meal. They grow beef over there. Indeed they grow BEEG, FEROSHUS? BULLS [sic] and once a month they have a public butchering which they call a bull fight. I swear that I had a T-Bone from one of those tough babies the last time I visited Piedras Negras. For the ones who are not familiar with Spanish that means black rocks. I {{want you to know that}} I have picked up some good words too since coming to this country where the sun shines daily and dust gets in your eyes, barracks, blankets and clothes. My brother Wes is now in Sicily. His address is: 				Lt. Wesley C. Crawley Co. A., Prov. Sig. A. W. Bn. Mobile 				c/o 3 rd Air Defense Wing 				A. P. O. 525 				c/o Postmaster 				New York, N. Y. Why anyone should need all that address, I don’t know. He was promoted to first lieutenant recently.

5000|$|Eventually the Air Force {{obtained}} 40% of all WACs in the Army; {{women were}} assigned as weather observers and forecasters, cryptographers, radio operators and repairmen, sheet metal workers, parachute riggers, link trainer instructors, bombsight maintenance specialists, aerial photograph analysts, and <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> <b>operators.</b> Over 1,000 WACs ran the statistical control tabulating machines (the precursors of modern-day computers) {{used to keep}} track of personnel records. By January 1945 only 50% of AAF WACs held traditional assignments such as file clerk, typist, and stenographer. A few Air Force WACs were assigned flying duties; two WAC radio operators assigned to Mitchel Field, New York, flew as crew members on B-17 training flights. WAC mechanics and photographers also made regular flights. Three WACs were awarded Air Medals, including one in India for her work in mapping [...] "the Hump," [...] the mountainous air route overflown by pilots ferrying lend-lease supplies to the Chinese Army. One woman died in the crash of an aerial broadcasting plane.|$|R
50|$|Currently, female {{personnel}} of {{all three}} services play {{an active part in}} ongoing operations. However, there are certain limitations in 'direct combat' duties such as special forces, pilot branch, naval fast attack squadrons. These are only a few restrictions; female personnel have been tasked with many front line duties and attached to combat units such as paratroops, SLAF Regiment, as well as undertaken support services such as <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> <b>operators,</b> electronic warfare technicians, radio material teletypewriters, automotive mechanics, aviation supply personnel, cryptographers, doctors, combat medics, lawyers, engineers and aerial photographers. In the Sri Lanka Navy female personnel were at first limited to the medical branch, however currently both lady officers and female rates are able to join any branch of service including the executive branch. With the escalation of the Sri Lankan civil war, many female personnel have come under enemy fire both directly and indirectly thus taking many casualties including fatalities. As of 2008 there were three female officers of the rank of Major General and one Commodore.|$|R
50|$|In October 1942, Lemond {{qualified}} to be a <b>tower</b> <b>control</b> <b>operator</b> with the United States Army Air Forces.

He ran the Mosquito Network, which broadcast to United States military personnel throughout the South Pacific. After the Japanese surrendered, he was named manager and officer in charge of Radio Tokyo.|$|R
50|$|On May 27, 1941, Kleiss {{earned his}} {{nickname}} {{when he made}} an unauthorized landing at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, located on the south shores of Oahu. After serving as the tow-sleeve aircraft during a gunnery exercise, Kleiss landed his SBD {{in front of the}} tower, hoping to find a safe field to haul in the tow-sleeve. Unexpectedly, his plane’s prop blast churned up a giant cloud of red dust, preventing two squadrons of Marine Corps fighter planes from landing on the runway. The <b>tower</b> <b>control</b> <b>operator</b> called over the radio, “Unknown dust cloud, who the hell are you?” Without responding, Kleiss took off for Naval Air Station Ford Island, hoping that no one had identified his plane. After landing, one of his squadron mates, Ensign Cleo Dobson, told Kleiss that he had seen the whole thing. Dobson joked, “Welcome aboard, Dusty!” For the remainder of his career in the Navy, Kleiss went by that nickname.|$|R

5000|$|In May 2012, the FAA {{published}} a report which concluded {{that as long}} as the brighter flashing lights remained active, extinguishing the steady burning red lights on communication towers at night would still provide enough conspicuity for pilots, and result in significantly less avian fatalities. [...] This change would also save <b>tower</b> <b>operators</b> maintenance and energy costs. Since the report was published, the FAA and FCC have approved the change in lighting systems, and it is now an option for <b>tower</b> <b>operators</b> to change the lights on their existing towers, or to build new towers with the new lighting system.
