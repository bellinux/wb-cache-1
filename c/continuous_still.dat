25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{the basics of}} modern {{techniques}} including pre-heating and reflux were developed. In 1822, Anthony Perrier developed {{one of the first}} continuous stills. In 1826, Robert Stein improved that design to make his patent still. In 1830, Aeneas Coffey got a patent for improving that design. Coffey's <b>continuous</b> <b>still</b> may be regarded as the archetype of modern petrochemical units. The French engineer Armand Savalle developed his steam regulator around 1846. In 1877, Ernest Solvay was granted a U.S. Patent for a tray column for ammonia distillation and the same and subsequent years saw developments of this theme for oil and spirits.|$|E
60|$|Although {{strong enough}} to bear, the ice {{undulated}} terribly as they swept over it, and sent forth rending sounds, which cannot be conceived by those whose experience of young ice has been derived chiefly from lakelets and ponds. Dogs in such circumstances are apt to become terrified and to stop, in which case immersion is almost certain. But Ujarak gave his team no time to think. With lash and voice he urged them on until they were nearly frantic. The undulations became greater as they advanced, and the rending sounds <b>continuous.</b> <b>Still</b> the wizard plied his whip and shouted. Indeed it was his only chance. At {{the other side of}} the bay the old ice still adhered to the shore. If that could be reached, they would be safe. Eagerly the women strained their eyes, and even stretched out their hands as if to grasp the shore, for the fear of instant death had banished all other thoughts. A few minutes more, and Ujarak, standing up in his eagerness, flourishing the great whip, and shouting at the pitch of his voice, drove the yelling dogs off the crackling sheet of ice to a place of safety on the solid floe.|$|E
6000|$|On the 19th, Warren {{pushed forward}} {{a portion of}} his force with a view to driving back the Boers' right and gaining the main road leading through Dewdrop to Ladysmith, while Woodgate's brigade watched Spion Kop. Fighting went on all day, the British forcing the enemy back step by step. On the 20th it began early and {{continued}} the whole day. Every inch of the ground was contested stubbornly by the Boers, but the Irish Brigade, who were in the hottest position, pressed them back fiercely with sudden rushes, and, had the rest of the division kept up with their advance, might have cleared the way through the enemy's centre. But the cannonade to which the advancing troops were exposed was terrible. Maxims and Nordenfeldts, the heavy cannon, and the field-pieces captured from us a month before, hurled shot and shell incessantly among them, while the rattle of the Boer rifles was <b>continuous.</b> <b>Still,</b> fair progress was made, and with less loss than might have been expected in such strife. Two officers only were killed, Captain Hensley of the Dublin Fusiliers, and Major Childe, who was a most popular officer. He had a presentiment that he would fall, and actually asked a friend the evening before to have a tablet placed over his grave with the inscription, [...] "Is it well with the child? It is well." ...|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s, Aeneas Coffey refined {{a design}} {{originally}} created by Robert Stein for <b>continuous</b> <b>stills</b> which produced whisky much {{more efficiently than}} the traditional pot stills. Quickly, merchants began blending the malt whisky with the grain whisky distilled in the <b>continuous</b> <b>stills,</b> making the first blended Scotch whisky. The blended whisky proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt with more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations as the blended whisky was more popular on the international market.|$|R
50|$|In Peru, pisco is {{produced}} only using copper pot stills, like single malt Scotch whiskies, rather than <b>continuous</b> <b>stills</b> like most vodkas. Unlike the Chilean variety, Peruvian pisco is never diluted {{after it is}} distilled and enters the bottle directly at its distillation strength. The production of a regular Peruvian Pisco bottle requires 8 kilograms of grapes, and a Mosto Verde variety needs 12 kg.|$|R
50|$|All vodkas are distilled; the {{manufacturers}} of Cîroc emphasize its being distilled five times. The first four distillations of the Ugni Blanc take place in stainless steel column stills; the Mauzac Blanc grapes are distilled in copper <b>continuous</b> <b>stills.</b> These are distilled to 96.5% and 93.5%, then blended together; 95% is Ugni Blanc and 5% is Mauzac Blanc. The final distillation is performed in a traditional Armagnac style copper pot still.|$|R

50|$|The {{design was}} to be {{improved}} and patented by an Irishman, Aeneas Coffey. Educated at Dublin's Trinity College, Coffey had ample opportunities to observe all manner of still designs because he had worked {{for a quarter of}} a century as an excise tax collector. He knew how much could be produced in a given period of time. He also knew that the new <b>continuous</b> <b>stills</b> had a flaw. To obtain a higher proof spirit, receiving vessels had to be changed so multiple distillations could take place.|$|R
50|$|There were {{a number}} of factors, both {{internal}} and external which lead to this decline. However, one of the main turning points was the patenting in 1832, of the Coffey still by Aeneas Coffey. Ironically, Coffey was both the former Inspector General of Excise in Ireland, and subsequently, after leaving the excise service, an Irish distiller himself. His patent, the Coffey <b>still,</b> was a <b>continuous</b> distillation apparatus which offered an improvement on the traditional pot <b>still.</b> Although similar <b>continuous</b> <b>stills</b> had been proposed in the past, including by other Irish distillers themselves, the Coffey still was the most effective, and soon entered widespread use.|$|R

50|$|Alcohol {{distillation}} at {{the factory}} was approved in 1919, due to shortages of certain grades of concentrated alcohol, and the dilute alcohol produced by the fermentation of molasses was distilled to produce concentrated alcohol in the Alcohol Still House, a two storey eastern extension to the Evaporator House.

5000|$|Distillation is {{generally}} a two-step process involving either pot <b>stills,</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>stills,</b> {{or a combination}} of both.

It {{is generally}} distilled to between 33% and 50% alcohol by volume (ABV) or 66 to 100 proof). The entire distillation process is completed within 24 hours. Various blends of coconut arrack diverge in processing, yet the extracted spirit may also be sold raw, repeatedly distilled or filtered, or transferred back into halmilla vats for maturing up to 15 years, depending on flavor, color and fragrance requirements.|$|R

50|$|Coffey {{opened the}} Dock Distillery on Grand Canal Street in Dublin. The main feature of his {{operation}} was a customised still {{of his own}} design—or rather Stein’s design with a minor modification. Coffey inserted two pipes into Stein’s column still that allowed a greater portion of the vapours to re-circulate into the still instead of flowing into the receiver with the spirit. This eliminated the need for multi-distillation and produced a spirit with a higher proof and lighter character. In 1830, he was granted Patent #5974 for his design, a two-column <b>continuous</b> <b>still.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>continuous</b> <b>still</b> can, as {{its name}} suggests, sustain a {{constant}} process of distillation. This, along {{with the ability to}} produce a higher concentration of alcohol in the final distillate, is its main advantage over a pot still, which can only work in batches. Continuous stills are charged with preheated feed liquor {{at some point in the}} column. Heat (usually in the form of steam) is supplied to the base of the column. Stripped (approximately alcohol-free) liquid is drawn off at the base, while alcoholic spirits are condensed after migrating to the top of the column.|$|E
