In this approach services are categorized in four main groups: supporting, regulating, provisioning and <b>cultural</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract There is {{increasing}} {{concern that the}} ecosystem services approach puts emphasis on optimizing {{a small number of}} services, which may jeopardize environmental sustainability. One potential solution is to bring <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> more strongly into the foreground. We synthesize recent empirical evidence and assess what consideration of <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> adds to landscape management and planning. In general, <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> incentivize the multifunctionality of landscapes. However, depending on context, <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> can either encourage the maintenance of valuable landscapes or act as barriers to necessary innovation and transformation. Hence, <b>cultural</b> ecosystems <b>services</b> are not uncontested, as seen through the three analytical lenses of landowner behavior, cultural practices of communities, and landscape planning...|$|R
25|$|Following the {{proposal}} of Mayor Yiannis Karousos, then President of the Ayia Napa Tourism Committee, on September 16, 2007, the world's longest chain of syrtaki dancers (a famous Greek dance) danced to Zorba the Greek in a successful attempt {{to enter the}} Guinness Book of World Records. The chain had a total of 268 members of eight groups dancing in step to Zorbas. Then Ayia Napa Mayor Antonis Tsokkos said {{the aim of the}} event was to send the message that the village was interested in Greek culture and to promote the tourist resort abroad. Head of the <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> of the Municipality Maria Tofini said that according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the dancers had to perform in synchronised step for the attempt to qualify. The event drew the attention of tourists and locals, many of whom danced to Zorbas on the beach and in the sea.|$|E
500|$|On 9 May, {{after an}} hour-long heated debate, the {{government}} was forced to withdraw its motion {{due to the lack}} of support. Choy So-yuk, from the usually pro-Government DAB, called for the vote to be postponed, and the Liberal Party equally did not back the Government. However, Government ministers declared that it had [...] "no plans to list the pier as a declared monument", and insisted that there was [...] "no direct relationship between the grading and whether we will demolish and relocate the pier". During the debate, the Director of Leisure and <b>Cultural</b> <b>Services</b> also said that even if the site was pronounced a first-class monument, there remained no legally binding prohibition against its demolition. Liberal Party Chairman James Tien said that, in failing to muster support to implement its policies, [...] "the Government is like a crab with weak legs".|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 2009 a [...] {{alligator}} gar {{was found}} in Tak Wah Park in Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong. Over the next two days, at least 16 other alligator gar, [...] the largest measuring , were found in ponds in public parks in Hong Kong. Nearby residents reported the alligator gar had been released into the ponds by aquarium hobbyists, and had lived there for several years. [...] However, after a complaint made by a citizen who falsely identified alligator gar as crocodiles, the use of terms like [...] "horrible man-eating fish" [...] had begun appearing in the headlines of some major local newspapers. [...] Officials with Leisure and <b>Cultural</b> <b>Services</b> in Tak Wah Park removed all the alligator gar from the ponds because they were concerned the large, carnivorous fish might harm children. [...] It {{is not unusual for}} the large sharp teeth and outward appearance of alligator gar to precipitate unreasonable fear in those unfamiliar with the species. Sensationalized reports have contributed to the misconception of predatory attacks by alligator gar on humans even though none of the reports have been confirmed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cultural</b> {{ecosystem}} <b>services</b> {{constitute a}} growing {{field of research}} that is characterized by {{an increasing number of}} publications from various academic disciplines. We conducted a semiquantitative review of publications explicitly dealing with <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services.</b> Our aims were: (1) to provide an overview of the current state of research, (2) to classify the diversity of research approaches by identifying clusters of publications that address <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> in similar ways, and (3) to highlight some important challenges for the future of <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> research. We reviewed 107 publications and extracted 20 attributes describing their type and content, including methods, scales, drivers of change, and trade-offs between services. Using a cluster analysis on a subset of attributes we identified five groups of publications: Group 1, conceptual focus, deals with theoretical issues; Group 2, descriptive reviews, consists mostly of desktop studies; Group 3, localized outcomes, deals with case studies coming from different disciplines; Group 4, social and participatory, deals mainly with assessing preferences and perceptions; and Group 5, economic assessments, provides economic valuations. Emerging themes in <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> research relate to improving methods for <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> valuation, studying <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> in the context of ecosystem service bundles, and more clearly articulating policy implications. Based on our findings, we conclude that: (1) <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> are well placed as a tool to bridge gaps between different academic disciplines and research communities, (2) capitalizing on the societal relevance of <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> could help address real-world problems, and (3) <b>cultural</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> have the potential to foster new conceptual links between alternative logics relating to a variety of social and ecological issues...|$|R
