40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents a}} review {{on the application}} of a remote sensing technique (terrestrial laser scanning, TLS) to a well-known topic (rock slope characterization and monitoring). Although the number of publications on the use of TLS in rock slope studies has rapidly increased in the last 5 – 10 years, little effort has been made to review the key developments, establish a code of best practice and unify future research approaches. The acquisition of dense 3 D terrain information with high accuracy, high data acquisition speed and increasingly efficient post-processing workflows is helping to better quantify key parameters of rock slope instabilities across spatial and temporal scales ranging from <b>cubic</b> <b>decimetres</b> to millions of cubic metres and from hours to years, respectively. Key insights into the use of TLS in rock slope investigations include: (a) the capability of remotely obtaining the orientation of slope discontinuities, which constitutes a great step forward in rock mechanics; (b) the possibility to monitor rock slopes which allows not only the accurate quantification of rockfall rates across wide areas but also the spatio-temporal modelling of rock slope deformation with an unprecedented level of detail. Studying rock slopes using TLS presents a series of key challenges, from accounting for the fractal character of rock surface to detecting the precursory deformation that may help in the future prediction of rock failures. Further investigation on the development of new algorithms for point cloud filtering, segmentation, feature extraction, deformation tracking and change detection will significantly improve our understanding on how rock slopes behave and evolve. Perspectives include the use of new 3 D sensing devices and the adaptation of techniques and methods recently developed in other disciplines as robotics and 3 D computer-vision to rock slope instabilities research...|$|R

50|$|In 1793 the {{commission}} defined {{the unit of}} mass as a <b>cubic</b> <b>decimetre</b> of distilled water at 0°C, and gave it the name grave.

The mass of a unit volume of water at 0°C was accurately determined by Lavoisier and Haüy (18841 grains per cubic provisional decimetre). A prototype of the grave was made in brass.|$|E

5000|$|Capacity {{is defined}} by the Oxford English Dictionary as [...] "the measure applied to the content of a vessel, and to liquids, grain, or the like, which take the shape of that which holds them". (The word {{capacity}} has other unrelated meanings, as in e.g. capacity management.) Capacity is not identical in meaning to volume, though closely related; the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior. Units of capacity are the SI litre and its derived units, and Imperial units such as gill, pint, gallon, and others. Units of volume are the cubes of units of length. In SI the units of volume and capacity are closely related: one litre is exactly 1 <b>cubic</b> <b>decimetre,</b> the capacity of a cube with a 10 cm side. In other systems the conversion is not trivial; the capacity of a vehicle's fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet, for example, but in gallons (a gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft).|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the shape}} and {{material}} of the high-voltage electrode of an atmospheric pressure plasma generation system were optimised. The research was performed {{with the goal of}} achieving maximum uniformity of plasma treatment of the surface of the low-voltage electrode with a diameter of 100 mm. In order to generate low-temperature plasma with the volume of roughly 1 <b>cubic</b> <b>decimetre,</b> a pulsed volume discharge was used initiated with a corona discharge. The uniformity of the plasma in the region of the low-voltage electrode was assessed using a system for measuring the distribution of discharge current density. The system's low-voltage electrode - collector - was a disc of 100 mm in diameter, the conducting surface of which was divided into 64 radially located segments of equal surface area. The current at each segment was registered by a high-speed measuring system controlled by an ARM™-based 32 -bit microcontroller. To facilitate the interpretation of results obtained, a computer program was developed to visualise the results. The program provides a 3 D image of the current density distribution {{on the surface of the}} low-voltage electrode. Based on the results obtained an optimum shape for a high-voltage electrode was determined. Uniformity of the distribution of discharge current density in relation to distance between electrodes was studied. It was proven that the level of non-uniformity of current density distribution depends on the size of the gap between electrodes. Experiments indicated that it is advantageous to use graphite felt VGN- 6 (Russian abbreviation) as the material of the high-voltage electrode's emitting surface...|$|E
