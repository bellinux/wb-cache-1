40|$|Pre-earthquake ionospheric {{anomalies}} {{are still}} challenging and unclear to obtain and understand, particularly for different earthquake magnitudes and focal depths {{as well as}} types of fault. In this paper, the seismo-ionospheric disturbances (SID) related to global earthquakes with 1492 Mw >= 5. 0 from 1998 to 2014 are investigated using the total electron content (TEC) of GPS global ionosphere maps (GIM). Statistical analysis of 10 -day TEC data before global Mw >= 5. 0 earthquakes shows significant enhancement 5 days before an earthquake of Mw >= 6. 0 at a 95 % confidence level. Earthquakes with a focal depth of less than 60 km and Mw >= 6. 0 are presumably the root of deviation in the ionospheric TEC because earthquake breeding zones have gigantic quantities of energy at shallower focal depths. Increased anomalous TEC is recorded in <b>cumulative</b> <b>percentages</b> beyond Mw- 5. 5. Sharpness in <b>cumulative</b> <b>percentages</b> is evident in seismo-ionospheric disturbance prior to Mw >= 6. 0 earthquakes. Seismo-ionospheric disturbances related to strike slip and thrust earthquakes are noticeable for magnitude Mw 6. 0 - 7. 0 earthquakes. The relative values reveal high ratios (up to 2) and low ratios (up to - 0. 5) within 5 days prior to global earthquakes for positive and negative anomalies. The anomalous patterns in TEC related to earthquakes are possibly due to the coupling of high amounts of energy from earthquake breeding zones of higher magnitude and shallower focal depth.

If there is a tie for first place in any one division, then all four spots go to the four first-place winners. Otherwise, the judges calculate which division's second-place winner answered the highest percentage of correct answers on his/her written test. After tallying the scores of the written exam and video rounds, the 2nd-place winner of that division wins the final spot in Israel. [...] The 2012 and 2013 finals were held at Yeshiva University.

40|$|Abstract—Purpose. This study {{examined}} the relationship between depressive symptoms and time courses in achieving independence in basic activities of daily living (BADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Methods. At baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months after stroke, 459 stroke patients were prospectively assessed. We used the Geriatric Depression Scale to determine depressive status. Outcomes were times to achieve independence in BADL (Barthel> 95) and independ-ence in at least three IADL. We used the Kaplan-Meier method and time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression {{to examine the relationship between}} depression and stroke recov-ery. Results. Depressed patients were 0. 3 times less likely than nondepressed patients to achieve BADL of> 95 and 0. 4 times less likely to be independent in three or more IADL. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>percentages</b> for the nondepressed patients to achieve a BADL of> 95 at 1, 3, and 6 months after stroke were 47 %, 63 %, and 72 %, and for the depressed patients, they were 19 %, 34 %, and 52 %, respectively. Similarly, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>percentages</b> for nondepressed patients to achieve complete independence in three or more IADL at 1, 3, and 6 months after stroke were 56 %, 72 %, and 85 %, and for the depressed patients, they were 32 %, 47 %, and 72 %, respectively. Depressed patients had poorer recovery patterns and took longer to achieve the outcomes. Conclusion. Stroke patients with depressive symptoms progressed slower in achieving independence of BADL and IADL compared to patients with-out depressive symptoms.

To provide a comprehensive analysis of inter-arch tooth width discrepancy, this study has developed a combination of <b>cumulative</b> <b>percentage</b> tooth width ratios and a method to visually determine the harmony between maxillary and mandibular tooth widths. Mesiodistal tooth widths from the first permanent molar to the corresponding first permanent molar were measured from 60 sets of pretreatment study models which were selected consecutively. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>percentage</b> ratios relating mandibular teeth to maxillary teeth were calculated utilising the mesiodistal tooth width measurements. The 13 mean <b>cumulative</b> <b>percentage</b> ratios developed {{in this study were}} plotted on graph paper showing plus and minus two standard deviations from the mean. These ratios provide a standard from which <b>cumulative</b> <b>percentage</b> ratios obtained from any new case may be compared graphically.

No simple graphical method of assessment on the final interdigitation of anterior and posterior teeth has previously been devised.
