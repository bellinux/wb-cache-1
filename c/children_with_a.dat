5|$|Peers help expose {{children}} to multi-party conversations. This allows {{children to}} hear {{a greater variety of}} speech, and to observe different conversational roles. Peers may be uncooperative conversation partners, which pressures the children to communicate more effectively. Speaking to peers is different from speaking to adults, but children may still correct their peers. Peer interaction provides <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different experience filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown raising <b>a</b> young <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability, such as an ASD, gives parents {{a unique set of}} challenges that impact their family including relationships among family members. Parents of young <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD may experience many stressors. Some causes of stress when raising <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD are medical decisions, behavioral challenges, and financial impact. Parents develop individual coping strategies that are unique to their family and themselves. The purpose of this literature review is to examine the stress levels and coping strategies of parents of young <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD. Results indicated parents of young <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD had a higher level of stress then parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> other disabilities. <b>Child’s</b> symptom severity was a key factor in stress level. One type of coping strategy many studies found was social support groups, where parents were able to vent, receive advice, and discuss their children. Social support used by parents of young <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD could be formal or informal. Social supports were determined to be a main coping strategy used by parents. Parents sought counseling, support groups, and family members to address stress associated <b>with</b> raising <b>a</b> young <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} the occurrence {{and timing of}} divorce in 391 parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a matched representative sample of parents of children without disabilities using a survival analysis. Parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD had {{a higher rate of}} divorce than the comparison group (23. 5 % vs. 13. 8 %). The rate of divorce remained high throughout the son’s or daughter’s childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood for parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD, whereas it decreased following the son’s or daughter’s childhood (after about age 8 years) in the comparison group. Younger maternal age when the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ASD was born and having the child born later in the birth order were positively predictive of divorce for parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD.

5|$|Quintilian {{provides}} the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ingenium, a talent for learning or linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate. The child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cane (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} {{children}} to extract information from their environment rests on understandings of attentional behaviors such as pointing. Episodes of joint attention provide <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal of information}} about objects by establishing reference and intention. Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in that environment provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance. Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} if having an older sibling {{was significantly related}} to stronger selfregulation and achievement, in a sample of 74 preschool children participating in a selfregulation intervention. It was hypothesized that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> older sibling in the fall would have higher self-regulation and achievement scores than <b>children</b> <b>with</b> no older siblings, and that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> older sibling in the intervention would improve more across the year in selfregulation and achievement than <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> older sibling in the control group. Results showed that having an older sibling significantly predicted higher vocabulary and math scores in the fall of preschool. In addition, <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> older sibling in the intervention group had significantly higher vocabulary scores than <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> older sibling in the control group in the spring.

Wang's son, Wang Gui (王贵), tricks their maid's son, Yue Fei, into completing their assignment while they go outside to play. After easily finishing the task at hand, Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name. The children then burst into the classroom upon learning of Zhou's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape {{in order to avoid}} apprehension. The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and, after marveling at Yue's impromptu ballad, asks Yue to fetch his mother, Lady Yao (姚夫人), for an important meeting. With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall, Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student. She consents and Yue takes his seat amongst Zhou's students the following morning. Because Zhou knows Yue is poor, he commands the four students to become sworn brothers. Zhou also begins to teach Yue all of the eighteen weapons of war.|$|E

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment {{in children with}} drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{considerable}} variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies {{have little or no}} evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise obedience and parental control. These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. An estimated six children have died {{as a consequence of the}} more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.|$|E
