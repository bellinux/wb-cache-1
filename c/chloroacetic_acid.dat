40|$|Goal, Scope and Background. The {{anthropogenic}} environmental {{emissions of}} <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and volatile organochlorines {{have been under}} scrutiny in recent years because the two compound groups are suspected to contribute to forest dieback and stratospheric ozone destruction, respectively. The two organochlorine groups are linked because the atmospheric photochemical oxidation of some volatile organochlorine compounds is one source of phytotoxic <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> in the environment. Moreover, both groups are produced in higher amounts by natural chlorination of organic matter, e. g. by soil microorganisms, marine macroalgae and salt lake bacteria, and show similar metabolism pathways. Elucidating the origin and fate of these organohalogens is necessary to implement actions to counteract environmental problems caused by these compounds. Main Features. While the anthropogenic sources of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and volatile organochlorines are relatively well-known and within human control, knowledge of relevant natural processes is scarce and fragmented. This article reviews current knowledge on natural formation and degradation processes of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and volatile organochlorines in forest soils, with particular emphasis on processes in the rhizosphere, and discusses future studies necessary to understand the role of forest soils in the formation and degradation of these compounds. Results and Discussion. Reviewing the present knowledge of the natural formation and degradation processes of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and volatile organochlorines in forest soil has revealed gaps in knowledge regarding the actual mechanisms behind these processes. In particular, there remains insufficient quantification of reliable budgets and rates of formation and degradation of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and volatile organochlorines in forest soil (both biotic and abiotic processes) to evaluate the strength of forest ecosystems regarding the emission and uptake of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and volatile organochlorines, both on a regional scale and on a global scale. Conclusion. It is concluded that the overall role of forest soil as a source and/or sink for <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and volatile organochlorines is still unclear; the available laboratory and field data reveal only bits of the puzzle. Detailed knowledge of the natural degradation and formation processes in forest soil is important to evaluate the strength of forest ecosystems for the emission and uptake of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and volatile organochlorines, both on a regional scale and on a global scale. Recommendation and Perspective. As the natural formation and degradation processes of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and volatile organochlorines in forest soil can be influenced by human activities, evaluation {{of the extent of}} this influence will help to identify what future actions are needed to reduce human influences and thus prevent further damage to the environment and to human health caused by these compounds...|$|R

The electrodeposited Pd/Fe-C electrode exhibited higher activity in dechlorination of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> than impregnated and calcined electrode. Under optimal experiment conditions of Pd:Fe molar ratio of 2 : 1 at - 1. 5 V (vs SCE), 95 % of trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) with the initial concentration of 500 mu g/L was removed within 20 min at pH 3. The dechlorination of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> followed the order of TCAA > dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) > monochloroacetic acid (MCAA). MCAA cannot be dechlorinated at C and Fe-C electrodes via direct reduction. However, a part of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> was directly dechlorinated to acetic acid at Pd-C and Pd/Fe-C electrodes via indirect reduction. The Pd(O) and Pd(II) species were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Compared with the individual Pd-C electrode, in situ formation of Fe(0) decreased the interface impedance as observed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. In conclusion, the presence of Pd(0) nanoparticles {{played a significant role}} in forming atomic H+ to realize indirect reduction process which could achieve the complete dechlorination of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier B.

This study assessed {{the formation of a}} range of disinfection by-products (DBPs) from the chloramination of seven non-nitrogenous LMWOA precursors, with an emphasis on the contribution of N-chloramine incorporation to haloacetamide (HAcAm) formation. The other DBPs comprised chlorinated halomethanes, haloacetonitriles and haloacetic acids. Citric acid generated higher yields of trichloromethane and two <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> than the other LMWOAs. Further, the unsaturated acids (fumaric acid and itaconic <b>acid)</b> formed more <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> than saturated acids (oxalic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid). Importantly, non-nitrogenous LMWOAs formed three nitrogenous DBPs (dichloroacetamide, trichloroacetamide, and small amounts of dichloroacetonitrile) during chloramination, firstly indicating the monochloramine can supply the nitrogen in nitrogenous DBPs, and the formation of haloacetamides at least in part is independent of the hydrolysis of haloacetonitriles. To the authorsâ knowledge, {{this is the first time}} formation of halogenated nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs) has been reported from chloramination of non-nitrogenous LMWOA precursors. This indicates that concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen compounds in drinking water are not a reliable surrogate for formation of N-DBPs during chloramination.

These agents are: chlorine, chlorine dioxide, chloramine, and ozone. Significant findings include the production of similar nonchlorinated organic oxidation products from chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and ozone. In addition, all three chlorinous oxidants/disinfectants can produce chlorinated by-products under certain conditions. The presence of chloronitrile compounds in drinking waters is indicated to arise from reactions of chlorine or chloramine to amine/amide functions in amino acids or proteinaceous materials, followed by dehydrohalogenation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{coagulation}} coupled with chlorination (i. e., pre-, inter-, and post-chlorination) on {{the formation of}} disinfection by-products (DBPs) and the removal efficiency of DBPs precursors were investigated. Compared with coagulation coupling with pre-chlorination, coagulation coupled with inter-chlorination could lead a higher removal efficiency of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) and <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> formation potential (CAAsFP). The CAAsFP/DOC value of residual DOC showed that coagulation with inter-chlorination has a beneficial effect on CAAs precursors removal. More DBPs were produced during inter-chlorination than that of pre-chlorination at pH 7. 5, while less DBPs were produced during inter-chlorination than that of pre-chlorination at pH 5. 5. In addition, the precipitate of humic acid (HA) after coagulation was chlorinated to study the kinetics of chlorine decay. The results showed that coagulated-HA had a higher reactivity with chlorine than aqueous-HA at pH 7. 5. Furthermore, the trends of zeta potential during coagulation process suggested that the distribution of chlorine species had significant influence on the removing of DBPs precursors by coagulation coupled with chlorination.

The estimated detection limits of the five regulated haloacetic acids in drinking water, without a sample preconcentration step, are in the range of 24 â 86 ng/mL, which is within about a factor of 10 of the levels required for routine monitoring of the acids.

In this study the natural formation of <b>chloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> from soil, {{as well as from}} humic material which is present in soil and from phenolic model substances has been investigated. It is shown that chloroacetates are formed from humic material with a linear relationship between the amount of humic acid used and chloroacetates found.

We further examined the relationship between the structure and reactivity of phenolic substances, which can be considered as monomeric units of humic acids. Ethoxyphenol with built-in ethyl groups forms large amounts of DCA and TCA. The experiments with phenoxyacetic acid yielded large amounts of monochloroacetate (MCA).
