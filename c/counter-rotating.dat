5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding <b>counter-rotating</b> wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself. They designed a two-mass-skate bicycle that the equations of motion predict is self-stable even with negative trail, the front wheel contacts {{the ground in front}} of the steering axis, and with <b>counter-rotating</b> wheels to cancel any gyroscopic effects. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated. Bicycle dynamics was named 26 of Discovers 100 top stories of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} 2 billion years, star {{formation}} throughout Andromeda's disk {{is thought to}} have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a <b>counter-rotating</b> disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.|$|E
5000|$|Walley jump, a full-rotation edge jump with a <b>counter-rotated</b> entry from a {{back inside}} {{edge to the}} back outside edge of the same foot.|$|R
5000|$|Toeless Lutz, a <b>counter-rotated</b> edge jump with a takeoff {{from the}} back outside edge of the left foot and landing on the back outside edge of the other foot.|$|R
50|$|As a {{supplement}} to traditional elevators, canards vastly increase control surface area, and often increase the critical angle of attack of the wings as the canard directs air more directly toward {{the leading edge of}} the wing. They can also be designed to operate independently (i.e. <b>counter-rotate),</b> thus also acting as ailerons.|$|R
5|$|Coandă was {{interested}} in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905, conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the Romanian Army arsenal in Bucharest. In secret, at Spandau in Germany, Coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller, and two <b>counter-rotating</b> propellers providing lift, powered by a 50-horsepower (37kW) Antoinette engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17degrees. According to later claims, Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel, witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow. It was around this time that Coandă's interest in jet propulsion began, claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the Sporthalle indoor sports arena in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Stretched {{version of}} the Navajo with more {{powerful}} 350-hp (261-kW) <b>counter-rotating</b> engines (a Lycoming TIO-540 and a Lycoming LTIO-540) to eliminate critical engine issues.|$|E
25|$|The Gurney flap {{increases}} lift {{by altering}} the Kutta condition at the trailing edge. The wake behind the flap {{is a pair}} of <b>counter-rotating</b> vortices that are alternately shed in a von Kármán vortex street.|$|E
50|$|Most jumps have {{a natural}} rotation; that is, the {{approach}} and landing curves both have the same rotational sense as the jump in the air. A few jumps, notably including the Lutz and Walley, are <b>counter-rotated,</b> with the approach edge having an opposite rotational sense to the rotation {{in the air and}} landing curve.|$|R
50|$|In theory, jumps with a <b>counter-rotated</b> entry, {{such as the}} Lutz and Walley, {{can be used as}} {{the second}} jump of {{combination}} when preceded by a jump with the opposite rotational sense, such as a combination of a clockwise Walley and counter-clockwise Lutz. In practice, this is rarely attempted because most skaters only train jumps in one direction.|$|R
50|$|If {{a change}} in the {{magnetic}} field of current i1 induces another electric current, i2, the direction of i2 is opposite that of the change in i1. If these currents are in two coaxial circular conductors ℓ1 and ℓ2 respectively, and both are initially 0, then the currents i1 and i2 must <b>counter-rotate.</b> The opposing currents will repel each other as a result.|$|R
25|$|The four-cylinder Miller {{fan engine}} drove two wooden two-blade <b>counter-rotating</b> {{propellers}} {{by means of}} two roller chains. A safety device would block both propellers in case {{of the failure of}} one of the chains. The blade pitch could be adjusted while the aircraft was on the ground.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the point}} in the centre of the {{detector}} at which proton-proton collisions occur between the two <b>counter-rotating</b> beams of the LHC. At each end of the detector magnets focus the beams into the interaction point. At collision each beam has a radius of 17μm and the crossing angle between the beams is 285μrad.|$|E
25|$|The second Schumacher era Batmobile {{featured}} {{neither a}} passenger seat nor a canopy. Like the Batman Forever car, this Batmobile (which {{was designed by}} Harald Belker) featured light-up wheels and engine panels. The displays were much more involved with this car, however, with red, orange, yellow, and blue lights, as well as special pulsating lights in the <b>counter-rotating</b> turbine intake.|$|E
5000|$|In the [...] "old days" [...] of skating, some skaters {{carried the}} idea of the Lutz's <b>counter-rotated</b> entry to an extreme by doing this jump in the {{opposite}} direction than their other jumps. For example, Sonja Henie did clockwise Lutz jumps and the remainder of her jumps and spins in a counterclockwise direction. This practice disappeared with the development of multi-rotation jumps.|$|R

25|$|A second {{experiment}} {{conducted during}} a trip to Paris involved a propeller-driven bicycle designed by Bossi; the test rider achieved a speed of , but one drawback was noted: the gyroscopic effect of the propeller generated so much torque that the bicycle became unstable. Bossi concluded, erroneously, that a successful human-powered aircraft would therefore require two <b>counter-rotating</b> propellers to cancel out the effects of torque.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{intended}} to be a simplified helicopter. Constructed by two brothers with no prior aeronautical experience or skills it employed a unique coaxial, <b>counter-rotating,</b> fixed pitch rotor system with no collective control, but employed a rudder. To account {{for the fact that the}} aircraft could not autorotate after a power failure, it was equipped with two engines and could hover on either one. A ballistic parachute was optional.|$|E
25|$|A {{design feature}} of the Peregrine {{was that it was}} {{produced}} in both right- and left-hand tractor variants. This was done to improve aircraft handling by providing a <b>counter-rotating</b> propeller facility. This was a common feature of German designs, but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of an idler gear arrangement for the Merlin propeller reduction gear.|$|E
50|$|Stator clutch breakage: A very abrupt {{application}} of power can cause shock loading of the stator clutch, resulting in breakage. If this occurs, the stator will freely <b>counter-rotate</b> in the direction opposite {{to that of the}} pump and almost no power transmission will take place. In an automobile, the effect is similar to a severe case of transmission slippage and the vehicle is all but incapable of moving under its own power.|$|R
5000|$|Messier 59's core {{contains}} a supermassive black hole, {{with a mass}} that has been estimated to be 270 million times {{the mass of the}} Sun, and <b>counter-rotates</b> with respect {{of the rest of the}} galaxy, being bluer. This galaxy also has an inner disk of stars and is very rich in globular clusters, with a population of them that has been estimated in around 2200. [...] It has a satellite, the Ultra Compact Dwarf galaxy M59-UCD3.|$|R
5000|$|On some engine designs, the [...] "back" [...] (smooth side) of {{the belt}} may drive some accessories. This is {{typically}} limited to components requiring less torque or where a large angle of wrap is present. Such accessories will <b>counter-rotate</b> vs. the [...] "normal" [...] pulleys. Some vehicles use two serpentine belts for their system, such as the manual transaxle equipped Ford Taurus SHO, 1995 - 1999 DOHC Nissan Maxima, vehicles using the supercharged GM 3800 engine, and many BMWs.|$|R
25|$|Escort fighter version. The F-82E {{followed}} the F-82B, which it so closely resembled. They were equipped with two <b>counter-rotating</b> Allison liquid-cooled engines, V-1710-143 and V-1710-145. The first four F-82Es were redesignated as F-82As and were allocated for engine testing. After production delays by engine problems and additional testing, F-82Es entered operational service in May 1948. The Air Force accepted 72 F-82Es {{in fiscal year}} 1948 (between January and June 1948), and 24 in fiscal year 1949 (22 in July 1948, one in October, and one in December).|$|E
25|$|A second {{experiment}} {{conducted during}} a trip to Paris involved a propeller-driven bicycle designed by Bossi. The test rider achieved a speed of 23 miles (37km) per hour, but one drawback was noted: the gyroscopic effect of the propeller generated so much torque that the bicycle became unstable. Bossi concluded, erroneously, that a successful human-powered aircraft would therefore require two <b>counter-rotating</b> propellers to cancel out the effects of torque – similar to the design of a helicopter. In light of these findings, Bossi decided to design an aircraft incorporating this difficult requirement.|$|E
25|$|The {{propellers}} {{envisioned for}} the completed fighter — unlike the torque-reducing <b>counter-rotating</b> propellers of the V-173 design — {{were to have}} a built-in cyclic movement like a helicopter's main rotor, with a very limited ability to shift their center of lift up and down to aid the aircraft in maneuvering. An ejection seat was fitted to allow the pilot to clear the massive propellers {{in the event of}} an in-flight emergency. Although the prototype was unarmed, a combination of machine guns and cannons would have been installed under the nose.|$|E
50|$|Listing's {{law is not}} obeyed {{when the}} eyes <b>counter-rotate</b> during head {{rotation}} to maintain gaze stability, either due to the Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) or the optokinetic reflex. Here the eye simply rotates about approximately the same axis as the head (which could even be a pure torsional rotation). This generally results in slow movements that drive the eye torsionally out of Listing's plane. However, when the head translates without rotating, gaze direction remains stable but Listing's law is still maintained.|$|R
5000|$|The Lutz jump, {{named after}} its {{originator}} Alois Lutz, is a toe jump that takes {{off from a}} back outside edge and lands on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. The Lutz is a <b>counter-rotated</b> jump, meaning that the takeoff edge travels in a rotational direction opposite to which the skater rotates {{in the air and}} lands. Lutzes can often be identified by the long, backward diagonal glide preparation, though this is not necessary to do a Lutz.|$|R
25|$|Whitehead's Number 21 {{monoplane}} had a wingspan of 36ft (11m). The fabric-covered wings were ribbed with bamboo, {{supported by}} steel wires and {{were very similar}} to the shape of the Lilienthal glider's wings. The arrangement for folding the wings also closely followed the Lilienthal design. The craft was powered by two engines: a ground engine of 10hp (7.5kW), intended to propel the front wheels to reach takeoff speed, and a 20hp (15kW) acetylene engine powering two propellers, which were designed to <b>counter-rotate</b> for stability.|$|R
25|$|Horizontal rolls are <b>counter-rotating</b> vortex rolls {{that are}} nearly {{aligned with the}} mean wind of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). They {{can be caused by}} {{convection}} {{in the presence of a}} moderate wind and/or dynamic inflection point instabilities in the mean wind profile. Early theory on the features predict that the vortices may be aligned up to 30° to the left for stably stratified environments, 18° to the left for neutral environments, and nearly parallel to the mean wind for unstably stratified (convective) environments. This theory has been supported by aircraft observations from several field experiments.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 Anton Flettner, a German aero-engineer, {{was brought}} to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. He was the {{developer}} of the two earlier synchropter designs from Germany during World War II: the Flettner Fl 265 which pioneered the synchropter layout, and the slightly later Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri ("Hummingbird"), intended for eventual production. Both designs used the principle of <b>counter-rotating</b> side-by-side intermeshing rotors, as the means {{to solve the problem of}} torque compensation, normally countered in single–rotor helicopters by a tail rotor, fenestron, NOTAR, or vented blower exhaust. Flettner remained in the United States and became the chief designer of the Kaman company.|$|E
25|$|The Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight is a medium-lift tandem-rotor {{transport}} helicopter, {{furnished with}} a set of <b>counter-rotating</b> main rotors in a tandem-rotor configuration. It was typically powered by a pair of General Electric T58 turboshaft engines, which were mounted {{on each side of the}} rear rotor pedestal; power to the forward rotor was transferred from the rear-mounted engines via a drive shaft. For redundancy, both engines are coupled so that either one would be capable of powering both of the main rotors in the event of a single engine failure or a similar emergency situation. Each of the rotors feature three blades, which can be folded to better facilitate storage and naval operations. The CH-46 features a fixed tricycle landing gear, complete with twin wheels on all three legs of the landing gear; this configuration results in a nose-up stance, helping to facilitate cargo loading and unloading. Two of the main landing gear were installed within protruding rear sponsons; the free interior space of the sponsons are also used to house fuel tanks, possessing a total capacity of 350 US gallons (1,438 L).|$|E
50|$|Another type of ND filter {{configuration}} is the ND-filter wheel. It {{consists of}} two perforated glass disks that have progressively denser coating applied around the perforation {{on the face of}} each disk. When the two disks are <b>counter-rotated</b> in front of each other, they gradually and evenly go from 100% transmission to 0% transmission. These are used on catadioptric telescopes mentioned above and in any system that is required to work at 100% of its aperture (usually because the system is required to work at its maximal angular resolution).|$|R
5000|$|Besides the {{mechanical}} inability to easily follow celestial motion the altazimuth mount does have other limitations. The telescope's field-of-view rotates at varying speed as the telescope tracks, whilst the telescope body does not, requiring {{a system to}} <b>counter-rotate</b> {{the field of view}} when used for astrophotography or other types of astronomical imaging. The mount also has blind spot or [...] "zenith hole", a spot near the zenith where the tracking rate in the azimuth coordinate becomes too high to accurately follow equatorial motion. [...] These mounts also require a third axis to de-rotate the field as the telescope tracks.|$|R
5000|$|The Valveless was an English {{automobile}} manufactured, after lengthy development, from 1908 until 1915 in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. The {{successor to}} the Ralph Lucas Valveless, the car marked the entry of the David Brown & Sons group into the manufacture of motors. Its engine was a 20 or 25 hp duplex two-stroke model which was advertised as having [...] "only six working parts"; these included two pistons, two connecting rods, and two crankshafts, which were geared together and <b>counter-rotated.</b> This {{is a type of}} engine configuration known as a split single since it is effectively a single cylinder split into two.|$|R
