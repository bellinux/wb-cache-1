40|$|International audienceStrain {{growth is}} a {{phenomenon}} observed in the elastic response of <b>containment</b> <b>vessels</b> subjected to internal blast loading, which is featured by the increased vibration amplitude of the vessel in a later stage. Previous studies attributed the strain growth in spherical <b>containment</b> <b>vessels</b> to the beating between two close vibration modes, the interactions between the vessel vibration and the reflected shock waves and the structural perturbation. In this paper, it is shown that nonlinear modal coupling is another important cause of strain growth in spherical <b>containment</b> <b>vessels.</b> Based on {{the understanding of the}} vibration modes in a complete spherical shell, the nonlinear modal coupling in the nonaxisymmetric response of complete spherical shells are studied using finite element method. Methods for preventing the strain growth due to nonlinear modal coupling are discussed, which provide guidelines for the engineering design of spherical <b>containment</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A {{report from}} the Japanese Government to the IAEA says the [...] "nuclear fuel in three {{reactors}} probably melted through the inner <b>containment</b> <b>vessels,</b> not just the core". The report says the [...] "inadequate" [...] basic reactor design— the Mark-1 model developed by General Electric— included [...] "the venting system for the <b>containment</b> <b>vessels</b> {{and the location of}} spent fuel cooling pools high in the buildings, which resulted in leaks of radioactive water that hampered repair work".|$|R

2500|$|In a joint {{statement}} by TEPCO and the Japan government it is announced that the reactors have achieved a state of cold shutdown. [...] Temperatures in the <b>containment</b> <b>vessels</b> were 38.9 degrees Celsius for reactor one, 67.5 degrees for reactor two, and 57.4 degrees for reactor 3. [...] This announcement failed to lay to rest substantial concerns arising from TEPCO's inability to directly measure temperatures at the bottoms of the <b>containment</b> <b>vessels,</b> {{and the fact that}} the site is too radioactive for visual confirmation of the fuel rods' status.|$|R
25|$|TEPCO {{said the}} {{radiation}} {{level in the}} <b>containment</b> <b>vessel</b> of reactor 2 at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 power plant was 530 sieverts per hour, the highest recorded level since the triple core meltdown in March 2011. This is however the first measurement of the radiation level within the reactor area and as such is likely lower than in the initial period after the meltdown. TEPCO also announced {{that there is a}} 2-meter hole under the pressure vessel in the reactor’s primary <b>containment</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E

The 9975 package provides double payload containment via nested stainless steel primary (PCV) and secondary (SCV) <b>containment</b> <b>vessels.</b> The <b>containment</b> <b>vessels</b> are closed by a conical plug sealed with dual O-rings (Figure 1) made of Parker Seals compound V 0835 - 75, based on Viton{reg_sign} GLT fluoroelastomer. The outer O-ring is credited as being leaktight per ANSI N 14. 5 with a leak rate of < 1 E- 07 ref cc/sec. The 9975 package is being used for interim storage in the K-Area Material Storage (KAMS) facility at the Savannah River Site. The aging performance of the O-rings is being studied to provide the storage facility a technical basis for service life prediction and safety analysis...|$|R
25|$|Injection of {{seawater}} {{into the}} primary <b>containment</b> <b>vessel</b> (PCV) was discontinued at 01:10 on 14 March {{because all the}} water in the reserve pool had been used up. Supplies were restored by 03:20 and injection of water resumed.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt is}} made to view {{the state of the}} melted fuel in reactor 2 using a fibre-optic endoscope, however clear images of the water level and fuel {{location}} could not be obtained, probably due to the harsh environment inside the <b>containment</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E
25|$|TEPCO {{measures}} {{atmospheric radiation}} at several points inside the <b>containment</b> <b>vessel</b> of reactor 2 {{for the first}} time, and reports values of 31.1 and 72.9 Sv/h.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{fabrication}} criteria {{recommended by the}} US Department of Energy (DOE) for high-level radioactive materials <b>containment</b> <b>vessels</b> used in packaging is found in Section III, Division 1, Subsection NB of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. This Code provides material, design, fabrication, examination, and testing specifications for nuclear power plant components. However, many of the requirements listed in the Code are not applicable to <b>containment</b> <b>vessels</b> made from austenitic stainless steel with austenitic or ferritic steel bolting. Most packaging designers, engineers, and fabricators are intimidated by {{the sheer volume of}} requirements contained in the Code; consequently, the Code is not always followed and many requirements that do apply are often overlooked during preparation of the Safety Analysis Report for Packaging (SARP) that constitutes the basis to evaluate the packaging for certification...|$|R

50|$|In the Soviet Union, {{reactors}} {{were considered}} too expensive, until Brezhnev came to power. Under his leadership, Anatoly Petrovich Alexandrov designed cheap reactors that were produced at high speed, {{with very few}} safety features, sometimes not even <b>containment</b> <b>vessels.</b> This was publicly criticized by experts, but the experts were sidelined.|$|R
25|$|The {{temperature}} of corium {{can be as}} high as 2400°C (4,352 °F) in the first hours after the meltdown, potentially reaching over 2800°C (5,072 °F). A large amount of heat can be released by reaction of metals (particularly zirconium) in corium with water. Flooding of the corium mass with water, or the drop of molten corium mass into a water pool, may result in a temperature spike and production of large amounts of hydrogen, which can result in a pressure spike in the <b>containment</b> <b>vessel.</b> The steam explosion resulting from such sudden corium-water contact can disperse the materials and form projectiles that may damage the <b>containment</b> <b>vessel</b> by impact. Subsequent pressure spikes can be caused by combustion of the released hydrogen. Detonation risks can be reduced by the use of catalytic hydrogen recombiners.|$|E
25|$|Unit 2 was {{considered}} the most likely unit to have a damaged reactor <b>containment</b> <b>vessel,</b> as of 24 March. But images from a robotic inspection reveal superficial surface damage to pipework but show the outer surface of the torus to be in normal condition and the potential break points of the manhole covers intact.|$|E
25|$|On 19 January 2012 the {{interior}} of the primary <b>containment</b> <b>vessel</b> of reactor 2 was inspected with an industrial endoscope. This device, 8.5 millimeters in diameter, is equipped with a 360 degrees-view camera and a thermometer to measure the temperature at this spot and the cooling-water inside, in an attempt to calibrate the existing temperature-measurements that could have an error-margin of 20 degrees. The device was brought in by a hole at 2.5 meter above the floor where the vessel is located. The whole procedure lasted 70 minutes. The photos showed parts of the walls and pipes inside the <b>containment</b> <b>vessel.</b> But they were unclear and blurred, most likely due to water vapors and the radiation inside. According to TEPCO the photos showed no serious damage. The temperature measured inside was 44.7 degrees Celsius, and did not differ much from the 42.6 degrees measured outside the vessel.|$|E
