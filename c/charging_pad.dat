40|$|Abstract—Dynamic {{contactless}} charging is {{an emerging}} tech-nology for charging electric vehicles (EV) on the move. For effi-cient charging and for proper billing, dynamic charging requires secure {{communication between the}} charging infrastructure and the EVs that supports very frequent real-time message exchange for EV authentication. In this paper we propose Portunes, an authentication protocol for <b>charging</b> <b>pads</b> to authenticate an EV’s identity. Portunes uses pseudonyms to provide location privacy, allows EVs to roam between different charging sections and receive a single bill, and achieves fast authentication by relying on symmetric keys and on the spatio-temporal location of the EV. We have implemented Portunes on RaspberryPi Model B with 700 MHz CPU and 512 MB RAM. Portunes allows the EV to generate authentication information within 0. 3 ms, and allows <b>charging</b> <b>pads</b> to verify the information within 0. 5 ms.

This is done by use of modern finite element method anal-ysis software to propose the primary and secondary mag-netic structures of such an ICPT system. Firstly, two pri-mary magnetic structures are proposed based on contrasting modes of operation and different field directions. This in-cludes a single-phase and multi-phase current model.

In the period 1891 to 1900 he used it to perform some of the first experiments in wireless power, transmitting radio frequency power across short distances by inductive coupling between coils of wire. In his early 1890s demonstrations such as those before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago he lit light bulbs from across a room. He found he could increase the distance by using a receiving LC circuit tuned to resonance with the Tesla coil's LC circuit, transferring energy by resonant inductive coupling. At his Colorado Springs laboratory during 1899-1900, by using voltages of the order of 10 million volts generated by his enormous magnifying transmitter coil (described below), he was able to light three incandescent lamps at a distance of about [...] Today the resonant inductive coupling discovered by Tesla is a familiar concept in electronics, widely used in IF transformers and short range wireless power transmission systems such as cellphone <b>charging</b> <b>pads.</b>|$|R

40|$|With {{the current}} {{surge in the}} {{development}} and use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) due to increased environmental consciousness, methods to increase the driving range and improve the battery charging conditions of these vehicles have become important research areas. Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) is one of the solutions to the challenges currently faced by EV manufacturers and customers. IPT is a method that is used to transfer power over large air gaps and has proven to be efficient, reliable and convenient in the charging of electric vehicles and also for factory automation systems and charging of consumer devices such as mobile phones. In some cases, it necessary to have transmitter and receiver topologies having multiple coils especially in a three phase IPT highway system or a table top IPT system for charging many consumer devices or mobile phones at the same time. Multi coil topologies are also used in lumped <b>charge</b> <b>pad</b> topologies to enable better misalignment tolerances. In such cases it is necessary to mutually decouple these multiple coils to avoid interactions that could affect the efficiency of power transfer. The current state of the art systems offer solutions that lead to the decoupling of multiple coils by their relative spatial position, and are hence limited. Multi coil systems operating at the same frequency also generate magnetic fields that add or cancel out each other, thereby changing the air gap magnetic field orientation depending on which coil is powered. A multi frequency IPT system developed in this thesis aims to provide a solution to the above challenges. A multi coil primary system with two coils carrying currents of different frequencies can be designed to transfer power independently without interactions between the two different frequency systems. This thesis develops this concept by first investigating the need for decoupling multi coil transmitter and receiver designs. Multi frequency IPT is then introduced and the design considerations are developed in order to achieve a frequency decoupled IPT system. Experimental results of the proposed multi frequency method using two transmitter coils are also presented. Finally, a comparison is provided between this proposed multi frequency method using two transmitter coils and another recently published method that amplifies the third harmonic along with the fundamental from the input inverter, thereby achieving multi frequency IPT using one transmitter coil.
