This paper presents a method of constructing <b>common</b> <b>operational</b> <b>pictures</b> to achieve situation awareness during disaster response among the emergency response agencies. The method of <b>common</b> <b>operational</b> <b>pictures</b> is featured with the visualization and collaborative work of current undergoing response measures and future state prediction provided by computational disaster models. It was visualized by integrating base map, disaster influence, future state prediction and resource allocation supported by GIS technologies.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>common</b> <b>operational</b> <b>pictures</b> (COPs) is {{explored}} {{through the application}} of social network analysis (SNA) and agent-based modelling to a generic search and rescue (SAR) scenario. Comparing the command structure that might arise from standard operating procedures with the sort of structure that might arise from examining information-in-common, using SNA, shows how one structure could be more amenable to ‘command’ with the other being more amenable to ‘control’ – which is potentially more suited to complex multi-agency operations. An agent-based model is developed to examine the impact of information sharing with different forms of COPs. It is shown that networks using <b>common</b> relevant <b>operational</b> <b>pictures</b> (which provide subsets of relevant information to groups of agents based on shared function) could result in better sharing of information and a more resilient structure than networks that use a COP. Practitioner Summary: SNA and agent-based modelling are used to compare different forms of COPs for maritime SAR operations. Different forms of COP change the communications structures in the socio-technical systems in which they operate, which has implications for future design and development of a COP...|$|R

This chapter shows that the expectations on the functioning of the tool were not fully met: first it was hard for the response room professionals {{to make sense of the}} data and second, the management did not develop a proper project planning. The recommendations are twofold. On the one hand, the professionals who work with Twitcident must invest in developing new information management routines. On the other hand, the response room management needs to create a much more inclusive project learning strategy...|$|R

40|$|The Global Information Grid (GIG) is a {{collection}} of systems, programs and initiatives aimed at building a secure network and set of information capabilities modeled after the Internet. The GIG is expected to facilitate DoD’s transformation by allowing warfighters, policy makers and support personnel to engage in rapid decision making. The roadmap is designed to take advantage of converged services of voice, data, video, and imagery over common data links. The vision is to have commanders identify threats more effectively, make informed decisions, and respond with greater precision and lethality. The information advantage gained through the GIG and network-centric warfare (NCW) allows a warfighting force to achieve dramatically improved information positions, in the form of <b>common</b> <b>operational</b> <b>pictures</b> that provide the basis for shared situational awareness and knowledge, and a resulting increase in combat power. The GIG Precedence and Preemption (P&P) requirements stem from the need to utilize scarce resources at critical times in the most effective way in support of national security, the intelligence community and the war-fighter. Information Assurance (IA) enables all information and data to be available end-to-end to support any mission without delay in accordance to the sensitivity of the task. Together, P&P and IA ensure data availability integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. This study addresses and analyzes the QoS and P & P requirements and architecture for the GIG. Threat scenarios are presented and used to evaluate the reference architectures. The goal of the study is to assess the Information Assurance concerns associated with implementing Precedence and Preemption within the GIG and to guarantee an acceptable minimum level of security and protection for DoD networks...|$|R

The United States Navy has established programs of record leveraging space, terrestrial, and maritime communications capabilities extending to fiscal year 2015. An ordered systems engineering process {{was performed to}} derive requirements and identify Joint ASW C 4 I Architecture strengths and weaknesses.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe conceptual template {{laid out in}} Joint Vision 2010 called for leveraging technological opportunities to achieve new {{and higher levels of}} effectiveness in a joint operating environment. Born out of this concept the U. S. Joint Forces Command developed a concept - the <b>Common</b> Relevant <b>Operational</b> <b>Picture,</b> or CROP. It is a presentation of timely, fused, accurate, assured and relevant information. The CROP concept addresses battlespace awareness, information transport and processing, combat identification and joint command and control - four of the six high priority challenges identified by the Joint Staff for the 21 st century. This thesis investigates CROP, comparing and contrasting it to uncoordinated separate service systems in a time-critical targeting setting. The Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) used are the time to kill a target and the number of weapons expended. Previous work on this problem used an analytical model with some simplifying assumptions concerning processing time latency following target detection. In this thesis, a simulation is used to investigate the validity of some of the analytical model assumptions. The simulation also extends the model for more general command and control time distributions and models Battle Damage Assessment. The results provide distributional information about the MOEs, showing how improvements in information sharing and optimal weapons assignment due to CROP can improve systems performance. However, this improvement is lost if processing time latency under CROP is too long. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Network-centric {{operations}} {{demand an}} increasingly sophisticated level of interoperation and information fusion for an escalating number and throughput of sensors and human processes. The resulting {{complexity of the}} systems being developed to face this environment render lower level fusion techniques alone simply insufficient to ensure interoperability, as they fail to consider subtle, but critical, aspects inherent in knowledge interchange. A fundamental mathematical theory of high-level information fusion is needed to address (1) the representation of semantics and pragmatics, (2) the mathematical framework supporting its algorithmic and computing processes, and (3) scalability of products such as <b>common</b> and user-defined <b>operational</b> <b>pictures.</b> We {{argue that there is}} no silver bullet for addressing these elements, and therefore any successful approach to the problem of high-level fusion must be systemic. In this paper, we propose the development of mathematical foundations that systemically address this problem from a decision theoretic perspective, and might seed the development of such fundamental theory. As a case study illustrating these techniques we present our current development of PROGNOS, a HLF system focused on the maritime domain...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedLarge-scale disasters severely damage local {{information and communication}} technology (ICT) infrastructure. This negatively impacts responders’ ability to communicate and collaborate with one another. As a result, humanitarian assistance (HA) response organizations cannot maintain situational awareness and efforts remain disjointed and inefficient. Out of {{the rubble of the}} Haiti earthquake, a cross-organizational collection of first responders created the Rapid ICT Assessment Team (RTAT) to conduct and share a holistic assessment of the ICT environment. However, RTAT has yet {{to solve the problem of}} efficiently and effectively collecting the ICT data and creating a shareable, <b>common,</b> ICT <b>operational</b> <b>picture.</b> Employing a campaign of experimentation (COE), this thesis analyzes RTAT with an Enterprise Architecture framework and Savvion process modeler and employs the Android based, mobile, spatial data collection applications Lighthouse and Open Data Kit (ODK) Collect to exploit the open source form builder ODK. RTAT founders, along with Bicol University and local volunteers, field tested the ODK forms with crowd sourcing techniques and when Typhoon Haiyan struck; they validated the organizational RTAT model and integrated assessments into the Pacific Disaster Center’s (PDC) DisasterAWARE collaborative website. This thesis highlights the disjointed rapid response ICT assessment community which lacks standard forms and unifying data standards. The COE validates using open source, spatial data collection tools and crowdsourcing techniques for even highly technical needs. However, the COE revealed programming logic limits of the ODK forms, and the imperfect back-end integration between RTAT and the PDC. Debates remain over the validity of qualitative, crowdsourced ICT assessments. Going forward, RTAT must refine its forms and lead the movement to harmonize HA community assessment data sets. Furthermore, future data collection tools must become operating system independent. Outstanding ThesisMajor, United StatesMarine Corp...|$|R
