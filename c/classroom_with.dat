25|$|Dialogue {{journals}} are a teacher-developed practice, first researched in the 1980s in an ethnographic {{study of}} a sixth grade American <b>classroom</b> <b>with</b> native English speakers, {{supported by a grant}} to the Center for Applied Linguistics from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Teaching & Learning Division. Applications to other educational settings developed quickly as a way to enhance writing development and the teacher-student relationship across linguistic and cultural barriers, with increasing use in second language instruction, deaf education, and adult literacy education. Since the 1980s, dialogue journal practice has expanded to many countries around the world.|$|E
25|$|Steiner's {{division}} {{of child development}} into three major stages {{is reflected in the}} schools' approach to early childhood education, which focuses on practical, hands-on activities and creative play; to elementary education, which focuses on developing artistic expression and social capacities; and to secondary education, which focuses on developing critical reasoning and empathic understanding. The overarching goal is to develop free, morally responsible, and integrated individuals equipped {{with a high degree of}} social competence. Qualitative assessments of student work are integrated into the daily life of the <b>classroom,</b> <b>with</b> quantitative testing playing a minimal role in primary education and standardized testing usually limited to that required for college entry. Individual teachers and schools have a great deal of autonomy in determining curriculum content, teaching methodology, and governance.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, Columbia Law School {{was one of}} the few {{law schools}} {{established}} in the United States before the Civil War. During the 18th and 19th centuries, most legal education took place in law offices, where young men, serving as apprentices or clerks,were set to copying documents and filling out legal forms under the supervision of an established attorney. For example, in New York John Jay, revolutionary founding father and first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, read law with Benjamin Kissam, whose busy practice kept his clerks occupied in transcribing records, pleadings, and opinions. Jay was fortunate to have attentive supervision because the quality and time of learning the law varied greatly within the profession. Theodore Dwight, who had been head of the law department of Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, believed formal legal education, conducted in the <b>classroom</b> <b>with</b> regular lectures, was far superior to casual law office instruction.|$|E

500|$|The 1990s {{brought a}} focus on greater {{independence}} for people with disabilities, and more inclusion in mainstream society [...] In schools, {{students with special needs}} were placed in regular classrooms rather than segregated settings, which led to an increased use of AAC as a means of improving student participation in class. Interventions became more collaborative and naturalistic, taking place in the <b>classroom</b> <b>with</b> the teacher, rather than in a therapy room. Facilitated communication – a method by which a facilitator physically and emotionally supports a person with severe communication needs as they type on a keyboard or letter board – received wide attention in the media and in the field. [...] The question of the authorship made the approach controversial; most of the subsequent research indicated that the facilitators were unknowingly influencing the messages typed. As a result, professional organizations and AAC researchers and clinicians have not typically accepted facilitated communication.|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} damage, however, {{took place}} across eastern Osaka Bay. A maximum tide of [...] was observed there, the highest ever for the region. Areas up to [...] inland were inundated by the typhoon's storm surge, total of 49.31km2 (19.04mi2) {{of the city}} was flooded. The city of Osaka was crippled by the typhoon, electricity was completely lost, the water supply network sustained significant damage, and communications were disrupted. Powerful winds devastated the city's poorly built schools, destroying 128buildings. Within them, at least 421children and teachers were killed, while 1,100 others sustained injury. One teacher, Masuji Ashida, was hailed as a hero for sacrificing himself to save his students by propping up the exit of his collapsing <b>classroom</b> <b>with</b> his own body; his students escaped before he was crushed {{under the weight of the}} building. An insane asylum along the city's outskirts was swept away with 60patients missing. A five-story pagoda (built in 1812) at the Shitennō-ji temple collapsed, killing 3people and trapping 20others. The Sotojima hospital for leprosy was destroyed; 260patients are believed to have drowned after the building collapsed amid rising water and gale-force winds. Near Ōtsu, a passenger train derailed, killing 10people and injuring 165.|$|E

After an encounter where Noah insults her, she expels him. During the fall fling, Claire goes to investigate a leak in the boys' bathroom, where she instead sees the words [...] "I fucked Claire Peterson" [...] written on the wall before Noah emerges. He attempts to force himself on her, but she fends him off and demands that he stay away from her and Kevin. The following day, Noah leaves a printer running in Claire's <b>classroom,</b> <b>with</b> images of them sleeping together scattered everywhere. When Garrett's car brakes fail to work, he and Kevin are nearly involved in an accident. Noah blackmails Claire; telling her that he has a tape of them having sex, which he will relinquish to her if she continues sleeping with him. She refuses, and has Vicky lure Noah away from his house so she can break in and delete their sex tape. While there, she finds hundreds of images of herself all over the walls. On his laptop she also finds instructions on how to tamper with the brakes of Garrett's car and Noah's parents' car.|$|E

They provided test results showing that Amy understood only about 60 percent of discussion in the classroom, while an interpreter would put her closer to 100%. They further provided results from two academic achievement tests Amy took in first grade, one administered in English and the other in American Sign Language. She had average performance on the test administered in English, but performed [...] "well above average" [...] on the test administered in American Sign Language.

2500|$|The District Administration {{reported}} that 87 or 4.45% of [...] its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels.

Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to dual enrollment courses offered by local colleges.

To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.|$|E
