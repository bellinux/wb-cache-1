40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{designed}} to derive the theoretical formulae to predict the pullout strength of pedicle screws with an inconstant outer and/or inner diameter distribution (<b>conical</b> <b>screws).</b> For the transpedicular fixation, one of the failure modes is the screw loosening from the vertebral bone. Hence, various kinds of pedicle screws have been evaluated to measure the pullout strength using synthetic and cadaveric bone as specimens. In the literature, the Chapman's formula has been widely proposed to predict the pullout strength of screws with constant outer and inner diameters (cylindrical screws). Methods This study formulated the pullout strength of the <b>conical</b> and cylindrical <b>screws</b> as the functions of material, screw, and surgery factors. The predicted pullout strength of each screw was compared to the experimentally measured data. Synthetic bones were used to standardize the material properties of the specimen and provide observation of the loosening mechanism of the bone/screw construct. Results The predicted data from the new formulae were better correlated with the mean pullout strength of both the cylindrical and <b>conical</b> <b>screws</b> within an average error of 5. 0 % and R 2 = 0. 93. On the other hand, the average error and R 2 value of the literature formula were as high as - 32. 3 % and - 0. 26, respectively. Conclusion The pullout strength of the pedicle screws was the functions of bone strength, screw design, and pilot hole. The close correlation between the measured and predicted pullout strength validated the value of the new formulae, so as avoid repeating experimental tests. </p...|$|R

O estudo foi dividido em duas fases: na primeira, foi avaliado o efeito do carregamento mecânico na perda de torque dos parafusos. 40 implantes foram utilizados. Os implantes e {{abutments}} foram divididos em 4 grupos: Grupo 1 : hexágono externo/parafuso convencional (HE); Grupo 2 : triângulo interno/parafuso convencional (TI); Grupo 3 : hexágono externo/parafuso cone morse (HECM); Grupo 4 : triângulo interno/parafuso cone morse (TICM). Os abutments foram instalados em seus respectivos implantes com torque de aperto de 32 Ncm; após intervalo de 10 minutos, foram medidos os valores dos torques de desaperto. Os abutments foram instalados novamente com torque de 32 Ncm, e após 10 minutos foram carregados mecanicamente, simulando 1 ano de função oral normal; após o carregamento, os torques de desaperto dos parafusos foram medidos novamente. Os dados foram analisados com o teste one-way ANOVA, com nível de significância de p≤ 0, 05 %. Análises por microscopia óptica foram realizadas antes e após os ensaios. Na segunda fase, foi avaliada a resistência à flexão dos conjuntos implante/abutment. Os mesmos 40 conjuntos foram utilizados. Os testes foram realizados em máquina universal de ensaios, com célula de carga de 500 kgf, deslocamento de 1 mm/min, e inclinação de 45 °. A força máxima de flexão (FMF) e a força de ruptura (FR) foram determinadas. As informações coletadas foram analisadas com o teste one-way ANOVA, para p≤ 0, 05. Análises por microscopia óptica foram realizadas para estudo dos componentes após os ensaios de resistência flexural. Os resultados sugeriram que houve diferença significante (p= 0, 000) na pré-carga residual antes e após carregamento mecânico entre os dois tipos de parafuso: os parafusos cone morse apresentaram torques de desaperto significativamente superiores aos apresentados pelos parafusos planos convencionais. Houve diferença significante nos resultados da FMF obtidos pelos parafusos planos convencionais e pelos parafusos cone morse (p= 0, 011), sendo que os conjuntos implante/abutment com parafusos cone morse apresentaram maior resistência à flexão. Para os resultados da FR houve influência significante do tipo de conexão (p= 0, 019), com melhores resultados para a conexão triângulo interno. Considerando as limitações deste estudo, concluiu-se que os parafusos cone morse apresentaram maiores torques de desaperto em comparação aos parafusos planos convencionais; que o design da conexão protética não teve influência significante sobre o torque de desaperto dos parafusos; que os parafusos cone morse obtiveram maiores valores de resistência à flexão, e que a conexão em triângulo interno obteve maiores valores para a força de ruptura. The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the mechanical behavior of two implant/abutment connection designs; external hex and internal tri-channel, using conventional <b>screws</b> and experimental <b>conical</b> <b>screws.</b> The study was divided in two parts; the first evaluated the effect of mechanical loading in the torque loss of the screws. 40 implants were used. The implants and abutments were divided in 4 groups: Group 1 : external hex/conventional screw (HE); Group 2 : tri-channel/conventional screw (TI); Group 3 : external hex/conical screw (HECM); Group 4 : tri-channel/conical screw (TICM). The abutments were installed in their respective implants with a tightening torque of 32 Ncm, after a 10 minute interval, loosening torque were measured. The abutments were installed again with a 32 Ncm torque, and after 10 minutes, they were mechanically loaded, simulating 1 year of normal oral function; after loading, loosening torques of the screws were measured again. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA test, with significance level of p≤ 0, 05. Optical microscopy analysis were performed before and after the tests. The second part evaluated the flexural resistance of the implant/abutment assemblies. The same 40 assemblies were used. The tests were performed in an universal testing machine, with a 500 kgf load cell, 1 mm/min displacement, and 45 ° angulation. Maximum bending moment (FMF) and rupture force (FR) were determined. Collected information were analyzed with one-way ANOVA test, for p≤ 0, 05. Optical microscopy analysis were performed for study of the components after the flexural resistance tests. The results suggested that there were significant differences (p= 0, 000) in the residual preload before and after mechanical loading between the two types of screws: <b>conical</b> <b>screws</b> showed significantly higher loosening torques than conventional flat screws. There were significant differences in the FMF obtained by the conventional flat screws and by the <b>conical</b> <b>screws</b> (p= 0, 000); the implant/abutment assemblies with <b>conical</b> <b>screws</b> presented higher flexural resistance. For the FR results, there was significant influence of the type of connection (p= 0, 019); the tri-channel connection presented better results. Considering the limitations of this study, it was concluded that the <b>conical</b> <b>screws</b> presented higher loosening torques compared to conventional flat screws; the design of the implant/abutment connection presented no significant influence on the loosening torques of the screws; <b>conical</b> <b>screws</b> showed higher bending moment values; and the tri-channel connection obtained higher rupture force values...|$|R

The operative approach, the position of the osteotomy, the direction of the shift, and the mode of fixation are all subject to considerable variation. Historically, fixation of a calcaneal osteotomy with a headed screw has been associated with high rates of compli-cations due to posterior heel pain from prominent screw heads, requiring secondary surgery for screw removal. In our unit, the method of fixation has changed over time and according to surgeon preference while the operative approach and the technique utilized have remained rela-tively unchanged, which provided a good opportunity to compare the outcome of calcaneal osteotomy with respect to fixation methods utilized.

40|$|Abstract Background Pedicle screws with PMMA cement {{augmentation}} {{have been}} shown to significantly improve the fixation strength in a severely osteoporotic spine. However, the efficacy of screw fixation for different cement augmentation techniques, namely solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling versus cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation, remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the difference in pullout strength between <b>conical</b> and cylindrical <b>screws</b> based on the aforementioned cement augmentation techniques. The potential loss of fixation upon partial screw removal after screw insertion was also examined. Method The Taguchi method with an L 8 array was employed to determine the significance of design factors. Conical and cylindrical pedicle screws with solid or cannulated designs were installed using two different screw augmentation techniques: solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling and cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation. Uniform synthetic bones (test block) simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a platform for each screw design and cement augmentation technique. Pedicle screws at full insertion and after a 360 -degree back-out from full insertion were then tested for axial pullout failure using a mechanical testing machine. Results The results revealed the following 1) Regardless of the <b>screw</b> outer geometry (<b>conical</b> or cylindrical), solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling exhibited significantly higher pullout strength than did cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation (p = 0. 0129 for conical screws; p = 0. 005 for cylindrical screws). 2) For a given cement augmentation technique (screws without cement augmentation, cannulated screws with cement injection or solid screws with cement pre-filling), no significant difference in pullout strength was found between <b>conical</b> and cylindrical <b>screws</b> (p > 0. 05). 3) Cement infiltration into the open cell of the test block {{led to the formation of}} a cement/bone composite structure. Observations of the failed specimens indicated that failure occurred at the composite/bone interface, whereas the composite remained well bonded to the screws. This result implies that the screw/composite interfacial strength was much higher than the composite/bone interfacial strength. 4) The back-out of the screw by 360 degrees from full insertion did not decrease the pullout strength in any of the studied cases. 5) Generally, larger standard deviations were found for the screw back-out cases, implying that the results of full insertion cases are more repeatable than those of the back-out cases. Conclusions Solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling offer improved initial fixation strength when compared to that of cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation for both the conically and cylindrically shaped screw. Our results also suggest that the fixation screws can be backed out by 360 degrees for intra-operative adjustment without the loss of fixation strength. </p...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To biomechanically characterize the specific effects of surgeon-specific pedicle screw design parameters on anchorage performance using a finite element model (FEM). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pedicle screw fixation is commonly used {{in the treatment of}} spinal pathologies. However, there is little consensus on the selection of an optimal screw type, size, and insertion trajectory depending on vertebra dimension and shape. METHODS: Different screw diameters and lengths, threads and insertion trajectories were computationally tested using a design of experiment (DOE) approach. A detailed FEM of an L 3 vertebra was created including elastoplastic bone properties and contact interactions with the screws. Loads and boundary conditions were applied to the screws to simulate axial pullout tests. Force-displacement responses and internal stresses were analyzed to determine the specific effects of each parameter. RESULTS: The DOE analysis revealed significant effects (P< 0. 01) for all tested principal parameters along with the interactions between diameter and trajectory. Screw diameter had the greatest impact on anchorage performance. The best insertion trajectory to resist pullout involved placing the screw threads closer to the pedicle walls using the straight-forward insertion technique, which showed the importance of the cortical layer grip. The simulated cylindrical single-lead thread screws presented better biomechanical anchorage than the <b>conical</b> dual-lead thread <b>screws</b> in axial loading conditions.

Após este período todas as amostras apresentaram viabilidade da suspensão inoculada. Dentro das limitações deste estudo, pode-se concluir que o torque influenciou na microinfiltração bacteriológica de implantes HE e que a padronização da metodologia apresentou minimização de falhas relacionadas ao operador. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the microleakage of abutment/implant interface (A/I) in external hexagon implants (HE) with different torques values. Nine HE implants extern torque with <b>conical</b> abutments and <b>screws</b> were randomly selected and divided into three groups: V 0. 5, V 1. 0 and V 1. 5 and used in two experimental steps. A Escherichia coli bacterial suspension (BS) was prepared to the density of 0, 5 McFarland standard and inoculated in the inner parts of the implants. The clarity of the broth was observed each 24 hours during 14 days, and after this period, the bacterial viability was checked by a microbiological test. In the first step, implants were inoculated as follows: V 0. 5 - with 0. 5 &# 956;L of BS; V 1. 0 - with 1. 0 &# 956;L of BS; and V 1. 5 - with 1. 5 &# 956;L of BS. Then the abutments were wrench following the manufacturer s recommended torque values. In the second step, the experiment design was repeated three times for checking the reproducibility and the assemblies were divided into three groups with different torques values: T 10 - abutments wrench with 10 Ncm; T 20 - wrench with 20 Ncm and T 32 - wrench with 32 Ncm. The results showed that in the first step all the samples of V 1. 0 and V 1. 5 groups presented cloudy broth on the control tubes in the first 24 hours. In the second step, three samples presented positive results for bacterial leakage during the period of 14 days, which two were from the T 10 group and one from the T 20 group. After this period all the samples presented viability for the bacterial test. Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that the torque value influenced the HE implants bacterial microleakage and that the standardization of the test methodology offered lower operator variables...|$|R
