For the new structure, the Khintchine inequalities and Burkholder's martingale inequalities have a very natural form: the span of the Rademacher functions is completely isomorphic to the operator Hilbert space OH, and the square function of a martingale difference sequence d_n is Σ d_n⊗d̅_n. Various inequalities from harmonic analysis are also considered in the same operator valued framework. Moreover, the new operator space structure also makes sense for non commutative L_p-spaces with analogous results. Comment: Minor <b>corrections.</b> <b>Paper</b> will appear in Documenta Mat...|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{invention}} of Tipp-Ex, it became possible to erase a typographical error typed with a typewriter. The typewriter would be backspaced to the letter that was to be changed, the <b>correction</b> <b>paper</b> would be placed in front of the ribbon, and the mistyped letter would be re-typed. The system only worked if the typewriter repositioned the re-typed letter in exactly the same place as originally typed, which could be problematic if returning to a previous line.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This work {{demonstrated}} {{the ability to}} transfer a nanoscale 3 -D polynomial structure of arbitrary shape into Si with a single step electron-beam lithography process. The technique involved employing a proximity correction algo-rithm, PYRAMID, to derive the dose distribution for a given 3 -D structure by accounting for the electron scattering ef-fects of the surrounding pixels. The pattern was written into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resist and then succes-sively transferred into Si via reactive ion etching, where a 1 : 1 etching ratio between PMMA and Si was achieved. The pattern transferred into Si possessed nanoscale features and matched the desired pattern with high fidelity. C© 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Introduction The noisy channel model (Shannon 1948) has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including spelling correction. These models consist of two components: a source model and a channel model. For many applications, people have devoted considerable energy to improving both components, with resulting improvements in overall system accuracy. However, relatively little research has gone into improving the channel model for spelling <b>correction.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes an improvement to noisy [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{information}} content is invariant {{up to an}} additive constant, the range of possible additive constants applicable to programming languages is so large that in practice it {{plays a major role}} in the actual evaluation of K(s), the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity of a string s. Some attempts have been made to arrive at a framework stable enough for a concrete definition of K, independent of any constant under a programming language, by appealing to the "naturalness" of the language in question. The aim of this paper is to present an approach to overcome the problem by looking at a set of models of computation converging in output probability distribution such that that "naturalness" can be inferred, thereby providing a framework for a stable definition of K under the set of convergent models of computation.

60|$|It is not common, I think, in this country, {{to publish}} on the half- profits system, {{but it is}} very common in England, where, owing {{probably}} to the moisture in the air, which lends a fairy outline to every prospect, it seems to be peculiarly alluring. One of my own early books was published there on these terms, which I accepted with the insensate joy of the young author in getting any terms from a publisher. The book sold, sold every copy of the small first edition, and in due time the publisher's statement came. I did not think my half of the profits was very great, but it seemed a fair division after every imaginable cost had been charged up against my poor book, and that frail venture had been made to pay the expenses of composition, <b>corrections,</b> <b>paper,</b> printing, binding, advertising, and editorial copies. The wonder ought to have been that there was anything at all coming to me, but I was young and greedy then, and I really thought there ought to have been more. I was disappointed, but I made the best of it, of course, and took the account to the junior partner of the house which employed me, and said that I should like to draw on him for the sum due me from the London publishers. He said, Certainly; but after a glance at the account he smiled and said he supposed I knew how much the sum was? I answered, Yes; it was eleven pounds nine shillings, was not it? But I owned {{at the same time that}} I never was good at figures, and that I found English money peculiarly baffling. He laughed now, and said, It was eleven shillings and ninepence. In fact, after all those charges for composition, <b>corrections,</b> <b>paper,</b> printing, binding, advertising, and editorial copies, there was a most ingenious and wholly surprising charge of ten per cent. commission on sales, which reduced my half from pounds to shillings, and handsomely increased the publisher's half in proportion. I do not now dispute the justice of the charge. It was not the fault of the half- profits system; it was the fault of the glad young author who did not distinctly inform himself of its mysterious nature in agreeing to it, and had only to reproach himself if he was finally disappointed.|$|R

40|$|Interval {{exchange}} {{maps are}} related to geodesic flows on translation surfaces; they correspond to the first return maps of the vertical flow on a transverse segment. The Rauzy-Veech induction on the space of interval exchange maps provides a powerful tool to analyze the Teichmueller geodesic flow on the moduli space of Abelian differentials. Several major results have been proved using this renormalization. Danthony and Nogueira introduced in 1988 a natural generalization of interval exchange transformations, namely the linear involutions. These maps {{are related to}} general measured foliations on surfaces (orientable or not). In this paper we are interested by such maps related to geodesic flow on (orientable) flat surfaces with Z/ 2 Z linear holonomy. We relate geometry and dynamics of such maps to the combinatorics of generalized permutations. We study an analogue of the Rauzy-Veech induction and give an efficient combinatorial characterization of its attractors. We establish a natural bijection between the extended Rauzy classes of generalized permutations and connected components of the strata of meromorphic quadratic differentials with at most simple poles, which allows, in particular, to classify the connected components of all exceptional strata.
