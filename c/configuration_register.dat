50|$|The SAM has no {{connection}} to the MPU data bus. As such, it is programmed in a curious manner; its 16-bit <b>configuration</b> <b>register</b> is spread across 32 memory addresses (FFC0-FFDF). Writing even bytes sets that register bit to 0, Writing to odd bytes sets it to 1.|$|E
5000|$|The ISA PNP {{specification}} {{divides the}} registers of a device in two categories: control <b>registers</b> and <b>configuration</b> <b>registers.</b> One of the device control registers defined by ISA PNP is (for example) the Activate register, which turns the card on or off.|$|R

Test and debug hardware has been included as well.|$|R
50|$|One way {{to prevent}} this bug is to enable bit 0x10 in the <b>configuration</b> <b>register</b> CCR1. This {{disables}} implicit bus locking normally done by xchg instruction.

This bit was reset at system reset (e.g. power-on) so that the card would not conflict with a CGA or other color card at address B8000h.|$|E
50|$|The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) as {{specified}} by the TCG provides many security functions including special <b>registers</b> (called Platform <b>Configuration</b> <b>Registers</b> - PCRs) which hold various measurements in a shielded location {{in a manner that}} prevents spoofing. Measurements consist of a cryptographic hash using a Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA); the TPM v1.0 specification uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. More recent TPM versions (v2.0+) call for SHA-2.|$|R
50|$|The LM32 {{microprocessor}} is {{assisted by}} a texture mapping unit and a programmable floating point VLIW coprocessor {{which are used}} by the Flickernoise video synthesis software. It is also surrounded by various peripheral cores to support every I/O device of the Milkymist One.

5000|$|Together with UEFI, TPM forms a [...] "root of trust": TPM {{contains}} several PCRs (Platform <b>Configuration</b> <b>Registers)</b> {{that allow}} a secure storage and reporting of security relevant metrics.

Good examples can be found in Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS), and in Microsoft's BitLocker Drive Encryption and PrivateCore vCage memory encryption (see below).|$|R
50|$|At this point, the BIOS or {{operating}} system will program the memory-mapped and I/O port addresses into the device's BAR <b>configuration</b> <b>register.</b> These addresses stay valid {{as long as}} the system remains turned on. Upon power-off, all these settings are lost and the procedure is repeated next time the system is powered back on. Since this entire process is fully automated, the user is spared the task of configuring any newly added hardware manually by changing DIP switches on the cards themselves. This automatic device discovery and address space assignment is how plug and play is implemented.|$|E
50|$|On-die {{termination}} {{is implemented}} with several combinations of resistors on the DRAM silicon {{along with other}} circuit trees. DRAM circuit designers can {{use a combination of}} transistors which have different values of turn-on resistance. In the case of DDR2, there are three kinds of internal resistors 150ohm, 75ohm and 50ohm. The resistors can be combined to create a proper equivalent impedance value to the outside of the chip, whereby the signal line (transmission line) of the motherboard is being controlled by the on-die termination operation signal. Where an on-die termination value control circuit exists the DRAM controller manages the on-die termination resistance through a programmable <b>configuration</b> <b>register</b> which resides in the DRAM. The internal on-die termination values in DDR3 are 120ohm, 60ohm, 40ohm and so forth.|$|E

40|$|The CAN core {{requires}} an external 3. 3 V compatible PHY chip. <b>Configuration</b> <b>Registers</b> Table 4 defines the <b>configuration</b> <b>registers.</b> This module allows for {{read and write}} access to the registers through the external micro-controller interface. Transmit and Receive Messages Separate storage buffers exist for transmit (TX FIFO) and receive (RX FIFO) messages through a FIFO structure. The depth of each buffer is individually configurable up {{to a maximum of}} 64 messages. TX High Priority Buffer The Transfer High Priority Buffer (TX HPB) provides storage for one transmit message. Messages written on this buffer have maximum transmit priority. They are queued for transmission immediately after the current transmission is complete, preempting any message in the TX FIFO. Acceptance Filters Acceptance Filters sort incoming messages with the user-defined acceptance mask and ID registers to determine whether to store messages in the RX FIFO, or to acknowledge and discard them. The number of acceptance filters can be configured from 0 to 4. Messages passed through acceptance filters are stored in the RX FIFO...|$|R
50|$|Additional {{commands}} (with CMD5 set) {{opened and}} closed rows without a data transfer, performed refresh operations, read or wrote <b>configuration</b> <b>registers,</b> and performed other maintenance operations.

5000|$|An {{example that}} is still of {{contemporary}} relevance {{can be found in}} the 16550 UART, whose derivatives are still in widespread use.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a privacy enhancing cloud service architecture {{based on the}} Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) scheme. In order to protect user data, the architecture provides cloud users with the abilities of controlling the extent of data sharing among their service accounts. A user is then enabled to link Cloud Service applications in such a way, that his/her personal data are shared only among designated applications. The anonymity of the platform identity is preserved while {{the integrity of the}} hardware platform (represented by Trusted Computing <b>configuration</b> <b>register</b> values) is proven to the remote servers. Moreover, the cloud service provider can assess user account activities, which leads to efficient security enforcement measures...|$|E
40|$|A novel convolver is {{presented}} in which both samples and results are in serial form, while coefficients are stored in internal registers. The convolver is composed of an array of multiplier-accumulator subunits which operate in a carry-save, serial/parallel mode. The sample bits are broadcast to all subunits, each one executing the multiplication with the stored coefficient and accumulating the product with the result received from the preceding unit. The structure can {{be shown to be}} decomposable in bit-slices; a stack of slices can be programmed as a convolver for prescribed sample and coefficient bit-length under the control of a <b>configuration</b> <b>register.</b> Faulty slices can be neutralized by variables stored in a second register...|$|E

2500|$|Finally, PCI {{configuration}} space provides {{access to}} 256 bytes of special <b>configuration</b> <b>registers</b> per PCI device. [...] Each PCI slot gets its own configuration space address range. The registers are used to configure devices memory and I/O address ranges they should respond to from transaction initiators.

The computer's BIOS scans for devices and assigns Memory and I/O address ranges to them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Static energy {{dissipation}} in cache memories will constitute an increasingly larger portion of total microprocessor {{energy dissipation}} due to nanoscale technology characteristics {{and the large}} size of on-chip caches. We propose to reduce the static energy dissipation of an on-chip data cache {{by taking advantage of}} the frequent values (FV) that widely exist in a data cache memory. The original FV-based low-power cache design aimed at only reducing dynamic power, at the cost of a 5 % slowdown. We propose a better design that reduces both static and dynamic cache power, and that uses a circuit design that eliminates performance overhead. A designer can utilize our architecture by simulating an application and then synthesizing the FVs into an application-specific FV cache design when values will not change, or by simulating and then writing to an FV-cache with <b>configuration</b> <b>registers</b> when values could change. Furthermore, we describe hardware that can dynamically determine FVs and write to the <b>configuration</b> <b>registers</b> completely transparently. Experiments on 11 Spec 2000 benchmarks show that, in addition to the dynamic power savings, 33 % static energy savings for data caches can be achieved. 1...|$|R
