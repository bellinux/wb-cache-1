40|$|Inadequate {{newspaper}} {{reporting of}} medication usage in Omaha school children, scare head-lines, adroitly misleading editorials, and over-emphasis on hyperactivity prompted this reporting of two careful {{studies of the}} effects of <b>cerebral</b> <b>stimulants</b> on M. B. D. children. Forty children were rated twice weekly by their classroom teacher on the Fels Rating Scale for six weeks. A double blind placebo method proved that dextroamphetamine significantly (P <. 001) improved their classroom behavior. Using a questionnaire, parents of 197 children taking <b>cerebral</b> <b>stimulants</b> reported details of symptom and trait changes brought about by <b>cerebral</b> <b>stimulants.</b> This work plus subsequen...|$|E
40|$|University of British Columbia gardens. Sign: Artemisia {{absinthium}} (common wormwood), Asteraceae. Oil {{obtained from}} this plant {{is used as}} a vermifuge tonic. It is also a <b>cerebral</b> <b>stimulant,</b> dangerous in large doses, for which reason its use in drinks is now prohibited. Originally used as a base for the French drink 'Pernod,' wormwood was held in high repute in medieval times, against all forms of infection...|$|R
40|$|Although {{caffeine}} {{has long}} been {{considered to be a}} <b>cerebral</b> cortical <b>stimulant,</b> relatively little is known of its sites and mechanism of action in the cerebral cortex. Therefore, the effects of the methylated xanthines, caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine have been studied on the evoked electrical afterdischarge of the neuronally isolated cerebral cortex preparation of dogs. Electrical stimulation of the neuronally isolated island of suprasylvian gyrus with an intact pial circulation in postanesthetized and immobilized dog preparations elicited a characteristic reproducible spikelike discharge limited within the island. The duration of such afterdischarge was measured before and after the administration of various drugs. Among the methylated xanthines, caffeine in doses as low as 0. 25 mg/kg was the most potent in prolonging cortical afterdischarge. Theophylline and theobromine appeared much less potent. The dose-effect relationship with different doses of the methylated xanthines was determined. It was found that large doses of theophylline and theobromine clearly reduced the duration of cortical afterdischarge. Repeated administration of caffeine appeared to cause no further or even less prolongation of afterdischarge than that produced by the first dose suggesting that tachyphylaxis occurred...|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebral}} {{effects of}} 60 per cent (end-tidal concentration) nitrous oxide (N_ 2 O) {{were examined in}} 29 dogs. With the inhalation of N_ 2 O, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) increased, reaching a peak of 203 per cent of the control value at 7 minutes, and thereafter decreased gradually to 125 per cent of the control over a 60 minute-period. The mean cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMR_O 2) increased to about 120 per cent of the control value within 15 minutes and remained elevated during the inhalation of N_ 2 O. There was no {{significant change in the}} mean arterial pressure (MAP), but a significant reduction in cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) was observed. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed low voltage, slow wave activity with the inhalation of N 20. After the intravenous injection of thiamyla 1 (8 mg/kg), N_ 2 O increased neither the CBF nor CMR_O 2 for the first 30 minute-period, but produced predominant slow wave activity during the period. Pretreatment with reserpine (total 1. 0 mg/kg) did not modify significantly the cerebral circulatory, metabolic and electrographic effects of N_ 2 O. The cerebral responses to the alteration in Paco_ 2 did not differ significantly during increased metabolism with N_ 2 O from the control without N_ 2 O. In conclusion, N_ 2 O is a <b>cerebral</b> metabolic <b>stimulant</b> which accompanies the increase in the CBF, and EEG slowing. The cerebral circulatory and metabolic stimulation was blocked by prior administration of thiamylal but not by pretreatment with reserpine...|$|R
