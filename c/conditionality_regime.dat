40|$|Nigel Keohane {{examines}} the government’s Universal Credit scheme {{and points out}} five areas of concern. He argues that it will make budgeting on low incomes very difficult, that monthly payments in arrears will risk indebtedness, and that the reform of Council Tax Benefit will play havoc with the scheme. Also, bringing those in part-time work into the <b>conditionality</b> <b>regime</b> will be difficult in practice {{and the question of}} how so-called ‘passported benefits’ such as free school means and free prescriptions will be treated is unresolved...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} {{analysing}} the Europeanisation of employment policy in Central and Eastern Europe {{in the process}} of preparing for accession to the European Union, focussing in particular on the example of the Czech Republic. It thereby uses an extended policy analysis based on the theoretical background provided by the Europeanisation approach. After explaining the structure and characteristics of the European employment policy area, the thesis is specifying the employment policy problems of transformation countries and is then concentrating on the Czech situation. The mechanisms and effects of Europeanisation of the Czech employment policy between 1998 and 2004 are studied in detail, comparing three Europeanisation processes concerning the transposition of labour directives, the preparation for participation in the European Employment Strategy (EES) and the preparation for participation in the European Social Fund (ESF). The main theoretical contribution of the thesis concerns the development and test of a conceptual framework for comparing different types of Europeanisation processes connected to different types of EU policy instruments (namely directives, the Open Method of Coordination, and ESF regulations). It is assumed, that the different instruments comprise different modes of implementing these policies in the Member (and accession) states. Certain types of Europeanisation mechanisms identified in the literature, namely institutional, structural and cognitive Europeanisation, are more likely to dominate the adaptation processes in one case or another, and therefore also the the relevance of influencing factors like institutional misfit, national actor constellations and individual actors’ positions is varying according to the type of policy to be implemented. Specifically, institutional misfit should be most relevant in cases where national decision making processes do not {{play a major role in}} the implementation process (i. e. in the case of directly binding EU law such as regulations). In all other cases, the structure of the national policy arena is more relevant for the Europeanisation processes and outputs, such as in particular with the transposition of EU directives. Cognitive Europeanisation processes and therefore the (change of) positions of (dominant) political actors are expected to play a particular strong role in the case of implementing non-binding EU soft law. For the accession countries modifications of these adaptation mechanisms due to the specific pre-accession strategy (“conditionality regime”) of the EU have to be considered, too. Empirically, the study is based on a literature review, analyses of documents and 19 expert interviews. The empirical part starts with an analysis of the situation of the Czech employment policy before the beginning of the pre-accession strategy of the EU in 1998. It then explains the adaptation processes in the framework of the pre-accession strategy and traces them in detail for the three areas to be compared. The results show, that in the case of the transposition of EU labour directives, which were in the core of the EU’s <b>conditionality</b> <b>regime,</b> institutional Europeanisation mechanisms played a major role. Also in the case of adaptation to the ESF institutional mechanisms were dominating, whereas in the case of preparation for the EES, cognitive Europeanisation was of greatest importance. Nevertheless, some structural effects can be observed, too, in particular the empowerment of certain national actors such as the social partners and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs...|$|E
