40|$|Handling and {{assembling}} individual nanostructures {{to bigger}} scale {{systems such as}} MEMS have been the biggest challenge. A deterministic assembly of individual carbon nanotubes by transplanting them to MEMS structures is demonstrated with a new assembly method, "transplanting assembly. " This thesis describes development of a novel assembly technique by transforming individual CNTs assemblable, which enables manual, parallel or automated assembly of individual CNTs in a deterministic way. The key idea of transplanting assembly is to grow individual CNT strands on a substrate at optimal growth conditions, to encapsulate individual CNTs into micro-scale <b>carrier</b> <b>blocks</b> and to transplant them to the target locations. This new assembly method enables products such as CNT-tipped AFM probes in a predictable and repeatable manner. The major research topics discussed in this thesis are: (1) the methods to grow vertically aligned single strand CNTs at predefined locations, (2) the encapsulation method to preserve/control the orientation/exposed length of an individual CNT during transplanting, and (3) the assembly scheme to locate/release an individual CNT at the target location. An array of CNTs was grown from the nickel nano-dots, which were defined on Si substrates using electron-beam lithography followed by metal deposition and lift-off processes. Each CNT strand was embedded into a MEMS scale polymer block {{which serves as a}} CNT carrier. A double polymeric layer encapsulation was designed and implemented: the top SU- 8 forms the body of the carrier while the bottom PMGI layer holds the body until the release of the carrier from the substrate and then is going to be removed to expose the CNT tip with a predefined length. A model was developed to predict mechanical behavior of individual CNTs under the flow of liquid polymers. Manual assembly of a polymer block {{to the end of a}} tipless AFM cantilever forms a CNT-tipped AFM probe, which can be accomplished in minutes without laborious weeding, trimming and welding process. The AFM scanning results confirmed the CNTtipped AFM probe's much improved imaging performance and potential for scanning soft biological samples at nanometer resolutions. by Soohyimg Kim.

40|$|SUMMARY This paper proposes per-tone {{equalization}} {{methods for}} single <b>carrier</b> <b>block</b> transmission with cyclic prefix (SC-CP) systems. Minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) based optimum weights of the per-tone equalizers are derived for SISO (single-input single-output), SIMO (single-input multipleoutput), and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) SC-CP systems. Unlike conventional frequency domain equalization methods, where discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is employed, the per-tone equalizers utilize sliding DFT, {{which makes it}} possible to achieve good performance even when the length of the guard interval is shorter than the channel order. Computer simulation results show that the proposed equalizers can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of the SISO, SIMO, and MIMO SC-CP systems with the insufficient guard interval. key words: per-tone equalization, single <b>carrier</b> <b>block</b> transmission, cyclic prefix 1...|$|R

40|$|To design {{superior}} thermoelectric materials {{the minority}} <b>carrier</b> <b>blocking</b> effect {{in which the}} unwanted bipolar transport is prevented by the interfacial energy barriers in the heterogeneous nanostructures has been theoretically proposed recently. The theory predicts an enhanced power factor and a reduced bipolar thermal conductivity for materials with a relatively low doping level, {{which could lead to}} an improvement in the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT). Here we show the first experimental demonstration of the minority <b>carrier</b> <b>blocking</b> in lead telluride–silver telluride (PbTe–Ag_ 2 Te) nanowire heterostructure-based nanocomposites. The nanocomposites are made by sintering PbTe–Ag_ 2 Te nanowire heterostructures produced in a highly scalable solution-phase synthesis. Compared with Ag_ 2 Te nanowire-based nanocomposite produced in similar method, the PbTe–Ag_ 2 Te nanocomposite containing ∼ 5 atomic % PbTe exhibits enhanced Seebeck coefficient, reduced thermal conductivity, and ∼ 40 % improved ZT, which can be well explained by the theoretical modeling based on the Boltzmann transport equations when energy barriers for both electrons and holes at the heterostructure interfaces are considered in the calculations. For this p-type PbTe–Ag_ 2 Te nanocomposite, the barriers for electrons, that is, minority carriers, are primarily responsible for the ZT enhancement. By extending this approach to other nanostructured systems, it represents a key step toward low-cost solution-processable nanomaterials without heavy doping level for high-performance thermoelectric energy harvesting...|$|R
