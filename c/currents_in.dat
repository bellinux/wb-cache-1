5|$|Ørsted did {{not fully}} {{understand}} his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms {{the basis for the}} international definition of the ampere.|$|E

5|$|July 11, 1996- Hurricane Bertha {{parallels}} {{the east coast}} of Florida about 175miles (280km) offshore, producing a storm tide of 2feet (0.6m) at Jacksonville Beach, as well as rip currents along the coast. Two people drown in rip <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> Miami Beach, and one pilot dies indirectly due to the storm when an evacuating military jet crashes into a house.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter {{can be thought of as}} a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{geomagnetic}} field changes on time scales from milliseconds {{to millions of}} years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> the ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some changes {{can be traced to}} geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.|$|E

5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E

His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' {{as it was then}} called. He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology.

5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E
5|$|By late on July3, Ana {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression. The storm also lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on July4, over the western Atlantic Ocean. The extratropical remnants persisted until dissipating about twenty-four hours later. Minimal impact was reported {{as a result}} of Ana, other than rip <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> coastal North Carolina. Due to the rough seas, 14rescues and one serious injury occurred at Carolina Beach. In addition, five rescues were made at Kure Beach and at least one person was hospitalized. However, there were no fatalities at either location.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Florence {{produced}} strong swells {{and dangerous}} surf conditions {{along the northern}} Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Bermuda. Later in its duration, the tight pressure gradient between Florence and a high-pressure system over southeastern Canada produced strong winds and rough waves along the East Coast of the United States. The hurricane also caused strong swells and rough ocean conditions, including rip <b>currents,</b> <b>in</b> the Bahamas and Atlantic Canada. In South Carolina, high waves produced severe beach erosion on several beaches.|$|E
5|$|Jet streams {{are fast}} flowing, narrow, {{meandering}} air <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth.

5|$|Pyroclastic density {{currents}} can also produce ash particles. These are typically produced by lava dome collapse or {{collapse of the}} eruption column. Within pyroclastic {{density currents}} particle abrasion occurs as particles {{interact with each other}} resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within the flow. These processes produce large quantities of very fine grained ash which is removed from pyroclastic density <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> co-ignimbrite ash plumes.|$|E
