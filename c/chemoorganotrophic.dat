[...] The {{biochemistry}} of methanogenesis {{is unique}} in nature in its use {{of a number of}} unusual cofactors to sequentially reduce methanogenic substrates to methane, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. [...] These cofactors are responsible (among other things) {{for the establishment of a}} proton gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis. [...] Several types of methanogenesis occur, differing in the starting compounds oxidized. [...] Some methanogens reduce carbon dioxide (...) to methane (...) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas (...) [...] chemolithoautotrophically. [...] These methanogens can often be found in environments containing fermentative organisms. [...] The tight association of methanogens and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see below) because the methanogens, which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen, relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth. [...] This type of syntrophic relationship is specifically known as interspecies hydrogen transfer. [...] A second group of methanogens use methanol (...) as a substrate for methanogenesis. These are <b>chemoorganotrophic,</b> but still autotrophic in using [...] as only carbon source. [...] The biochemistry of this process is quite different from that of the carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens. [...] Lastly, a third group of methanogens produce both methane and carbon dioxide from acetate (...) with the acetate being split between the two carbons. These acetate-cleaving organisms are the only chemoorganoheterotrophic methanogens. [...] All autotrophic methanogens use a variation of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway to fix [...] and obtain cellular carbon.|$|E
