25|$|The Sun wobbles as it rotates {{around the}} galactic center, {{dragging}} the Solar System and Earth along with it. What mathematician Kepler did in arriving at his three famous equations was curve-fit the apparent {{motions of the}} planets using Tycho Brahe's data, and not <b>curve-fitting</b> their true circular motions about the Sun (see Figure). Both Robert Hooke and Newton were well aware that Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation did not hold for the forces associated with elliptical orbits. In fact, Newton's Universal Law {{does not account for}} the orbit of Mercury, the asteroid belt's gravitational behavior, or Saturn's rings. Newton stated (in section 11 of the Principia) that the main reason, however, for failing to predict the forces for elliptical orbits was that his math model was for a body confined to a situation that hardly existed in the real world, namely, the motions of bodies attracted toward an unmoving center. Some present physics and astronomy textbooks do not emphasize the negative significance of Newton's assumption and end up teaching that his math model is in effect reality. It is to be understood that the classical two-body problem solution above is a mathematical idealization. See also Kepler's first law of planetary motion.|$|E

50|$|The {{relationships}} between shear stress and shear rate for blood must be determined experimentally and expressed by constitutive equations. Given the complex macro-rheological behavior of blood, {{it is not}} surprising that a single equation fails to completely describe the effects of various rheological variables (e.g., hematocrit, shear rate).

50|$|The LMA {{is used in}} many {{software}} applications for solving generic <b>curve-fitting</b> problems. However, as for many fitting algorithms, the LMA finds only a local minimum, which {{is not necessarily the}} global minimum. The LMA interpolates between the Gauss-Newton algorithm (GNA) and the method of gradient descent. The LMA is more robust than the GNA, which means that in many cases it finds a solution even if it starts very far off the final minimum. For well-behaved functions and reasonable starting parameters, the LMA tends to be a bit slower than the GNA. LMA can also be viewed as Gauss-Newton using a trust region approach.|$|E
50|$|This {{work was}} the first to satisfactorily address the then open problem on robust {{stability}} and performance problems for constant real parameter uncertainty in the literature via parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. The work provided a fundamental generalization of mixed-μ analysis and synthesis in terms of Lyapunov functions and Riccati equations. This unification between mixed-μ and parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions resulted in new machinery for mixed-μ controller synthesis by providing the basis for a reliable, fully automated μ-synthesis procedure while, for the first time, simultaneously capturing H2 performance while avoiding suboptimal multiplier-controller iteration and <b>curve-fitting</b> procedures. This research has produced advanced theoretical breakthroughs directly supporting engineering practice.|$|E
50|$|To avoid {{overfitting}} (or <b>curve-fitting)</b> {{to historical}} data -and {{unlike many other}} techniques used in trading software such as optimizing of trading rules by repeated backtesting, genetic algorithms and neural networks- Adaptive Modeler does not optimize trading rules on historical data. Instead, its models evolve incrementally over the available price data so that agents experience every price change only once (as in the real world). Also, {{there is no difference}} in the processing of historical and new price data. Therefore, there is no specific reason to expect that a model's back-tested historical performance is better than its future performance (unlike when trading rules have been optimized on historical data). The historical results can therefore be considered more meaningful than results demonstrated by techniques based on optimization.|$|E
50|$|To {{increase}} {{the precision of}} edge detection, several subpixel techniques had been proposed, including <b>curve-fitting,</b> moment-based, reconstructive, and partial area effect methods. These methods have different characteristics. Curve fitting methods are computationally simple but are easily affected by noise. Moment-based methods use an integral-based approach to reduce the effect of noise, but may require more computations in some cases. Reconstructive methods use horizontal gradients or vertical gradients to build a curve and find {{the peak of the}} curve as the sub-pixel edge. Partial area effect methods are based on the hypothesis that each pixel value depends on the area at both sides of the edge inside that pixel, producing accurate individual estimation for every edge pixel. Certain variants of the moment-based technique {{have been shown to be}} the most accurate for isolated edges.|$|E
5000|$|It was Peirce's idea to {{statistically}} {{identify what}} constituted an error as [...] "too large" [...] and therefore being {{identified as an}} [...] "outlier" [...] which could {{be removed from the}} observations to improve the fit between the observations and a curve. K. Thomsen identified that three parameters were needed to perform the calculation: the number of observation pairs (N), the number of outliers to be removed (n), and the number of regression parameters (e.g., coefficients) used in the <b>curve-fitting</b> to get the residuals (m). The end result of this process is to calculate a threshold value (of squared error) whereby observations with a squared error smaller than this threshold should be kept and observations with a squared error larger than this value should be removed (i.e., as an outlier).|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} to Eridanus II {{has been estimated}} {{using a variety of}} methods. All rely on fitting the observed stars to a curve (an isochrone) on a color-magnitude diagram (CMD), then comparing the luminosity of stars from the target galaxy with the luminosity of stars from equivalent positions on the CMD in galaxies of known distance, after various corrections for the estimated age and metallicity (derived in part from the <b>curve-fitting</b> process). See, e.g., Sand et al. (2012). The results have been fairly consistent: 330 kpc (1076 kly) (Bechtol et al., 2015), 380 kpc (1238 kly) (Koposov et al., 2015), and 366 ± 17 kpc (1193 ± 55 kly) (Crnojević et al., 2016). Whatever the exact distance value, Eridanus II is the most distant of currently known bodies which are likely satellites of the Milky Way (Id.).|$|E
50|$|Brittleness in {{software}} {{can be caused}} by algorithms that do not work well for the full range of input data. A good example is an algorithm that allows a divide by zero to occur, or a <b>curve-fitting</b> equation that is used to extrapolate beyond the data that it was fitted to. Another cause of brittleness is the use of data structures that restrict values. This was commonly seen in the late 1990s as people realized that their software only had room for a 2 digit year entry; this led to the sudden updating of tremendous quantities of brittle software before the year 2000. Another more commonly encountered form of brittleness is in graphical user interfaces that make invalid assumptions. For example, a user may be running on a low resolution display, and the software will open a window too large to fit the display. Another common problem is expressed when a user uses a color scheme other than the default, causing text to be rendered in the same color as the background, or a user uses a font other than the default, which won't fit in the allowed space and cuts off instructions and labels.|$|E

In the interim he {{published}} journal articles and book chapters on factor analysis, factor indeterminacy in factor analysis, factor rotation, confirmatory factor analysis, psychometric theory, structural equation modeling, and {{goodness of fit}} indices. The work on the book on Causal Analysis with James and Brett {{led him to a}} deep interest in the philosophy of causality, objectivity and philosophy in general. He struggled through Wittgenstein and Kant to a passable understanding of each, being strongly influenced by Kant's concepts of analysis and synthesis in thought, and saw their role in metaphors of objectivity, causality, and the self. He published several articles in the journal Philosophy of Science on the history of exploratory statistics in empiricism; metaphoric origins of objectivity, subjectivity and consciousness; a synthesis of deterministic and probabilistic causality with the functional relation concept; and the <b>curve-fitting</b> problem and degrees of freedom. He was strongly influenced by the works of George Lakoff on metaphor and abstract thought and their origin in embodied perception and action. As a result, Mulaik has argued that science is based on the metaphor that [...] "science is knowledge of objects". In 1997 he was co-editor with L. Harlow and J. H. Steiger of the book What If There Were No Significance Tests? in which he was the principal author of a chapter with N Raju and R. Harshman defending significance tests in appropriate contexts. In 2009 he published the text Linear Causal Modeling with Structural Equations and in 2010 a revision of the earlier Foundations of Factor Analysis.|$|E
40|$|The {{coefficient}} of consolidation (c v) is often determined by comparing {{the characteristics of the}} experimental and theoretical consolidation using empirical <b>curve-fitting</b> procedures which are based on the theoretical U−T curve generated by a layer subjected to a uniform initial excess pore water pressure distribution. However, in cases where settlement–time data are a result of a non-uniform initial pore pressure distribution, these <b>curve-fitting</b> procedures are no longer valid. In this technical note, a generalised procedure for Taylor and Casagrande's popular <b>curve-fitting</b> procedures is proposed, where the user is directed to select appropriate adjustment factors, {{depending on the type of}} non-uniform initial excess pore pressure distribution encountered. These factors were determined by approximating separate regions of the U−T curves using simple power and exponential functions. In non-uniform cases where the power approximation only captures a small portion of the U−T curve it may be difficult to use the corresponding modified <b>curve-fitting</b> procedure objectively...|$|E

For the interpolation of Bezier curves, it is better for the two reference points to be closer.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{introduces}} a novel <b>curve-fitting</b> algorithm for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) curves using a self-constructed, wedge-shaped beam type angular interrogation SPR spectroscopy technique. Previous fitting approaches such as asymmetric and polynomial equations are still unsatisfactory for analyzing full SPR curves {{and their use}} is limited to determining the resonance angle. In the present study, we developed a sigmoid-asymmetric equation that provides excellent <b>curve-fitting</b> for the whole SPR curve over a range of incident angles, including regions of the critical angle and resonance angle. Regardless of the bulk fluid type (i. e., water and air), the present sigmoid-asymmetric fitting exhibited nearly perfect matching with a full SPR curve, whereas the asymmetric and polynomial curve fitting methods did not. Because the present <b>curve-fitting</b> sigmoid-asymmetric equation can determine the critical angle {{as well as the}} resonance angle, the undesired effect caused by the bulk fluid refractive index was excluded by subtracting the critical angle from the resonance angle in real time. In conclusion, the proposed sigmoid-asymmetric <b>curve-fitting</b> algorithm for SPR curves is widely applicable to various SPR measurements, while excluding the effect of bulk fluids on the sensing layer...|$|E
