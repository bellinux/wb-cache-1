50|$|The {{psychological}} <b>coping</b> {{mechanisms are}} commonly termed <b>coping</b> strategies or <b>coping</b> skills. The term <b>coping</b> generally refers to adaptive (constructive) <b>coping</b> strategies. That is strategies which reduce stress. In contrast, other <b>coping</b> strategies may be coined as maladaptive, if they increase stress. Maladaptive <b>coping</b> is therefore also described, {{when looking at}} the outcome, as non-coping. Furthermore, the term <b>coping</b> generally refers to reactive <b>coping,</b> i.e. the <b>coping</b> response which follows the stressor. This differs from proactive <b>coping,</b> in which a <b>coping</b> response aims to neutralize a future stressor. Subconscious or non-conscious strategies (e.g. defense mechanisms) are generally excluded from the area of <b>coping.</b>|$|R

We hypothesized {{that there would be}} a positive association between <b>coping</b> self-efficacy and <b>coping</b> effectiveness, which would be mediated by <b>coping.</b> It was also predicted that <b>coping</b> strategies within the task-oriented <b>coping</b> dimension would be positively associated with <b>coping</b> effectiveness, whereas strategies from the disengagement- and distraction-oriented <b>coping</b> dimensions would be negatively associated with <b>coping</b> effectiveness. Participants were 353 athletes between the ages of 18 and 29 years, who completed a measure of <b>coping</b> self-efficacy the night before they competed, in addition to a measure of the athletes' use of <b>coping</b> strategies and their perceived <b>coping</b> effectiveness, which was completed immediately after the competitive event.

5000|$|Coping, {{as a form}} of {{response}} to stressors, describes how individuals handle stressful events. It is very close to one dimension of adaptive performance by definition (i.e., the Handling Work Stress dimension), and <b>coping</b> has been suggested to be another form of adaptation. [...] However, they are still different constructions. Stress <b>coping</b> could be divided into several styles and strategies based on several theories. One general idea is to divide <b>coping</b> as active <b>coping</b> and avoidant <b>coping.</b> [...] Active <b>coping</b> means to proactively address and resolve stressful events, like quitting a stressful job and changing into a less overwhelming one. Avoidant <b>coping</b> means to reduce stress by ignoring it, like involving in problematic drinking. Another set of <b>coping</b> strategy types includes problem-focused <b>coping</b> and emotion-focused <b>coping.</b> [...] Problem-focused <b>coping</b> involves using skills and knowledge to deal with the cause of their problems. Emotion-focused <b>coping</b> involves releasing negative emotions by ways like distracting or disclaiming.Adaptive performance involves a mixture of different <b>coping</b> strategies. Because adaptive performance concerns positive aspects of behaviors, it is more closely related to <b>coping</b> strategies that have positive effects, such as active <b>coping</b> and problem-focused <b>coping.</b> [...] Therefore, adaptive performance is more likely to contain such behaviors in stressful situations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a {{substantial}} re-conceptualization of <b>coping.</b> The strong focus on emotional distress as the marker of <b>coping</b> efforts has masked {{the importance of social}} functions, processes and outcomes in <b>coping</b> with life stress, particularly the role of communal <b>coping.</b> Communal <b>coping</b> is a cooperative problem-solving process salient in <b>coping</b> with both individual and collective stressors.
