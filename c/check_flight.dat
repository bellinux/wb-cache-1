2500|$|On 28 December 1965, {{the third}} A-12 was lost when [...] "Article 126" [...] crashed 30 seconds after takeoff when {{a series of}} violent yawing and {{pitching}} actions was followed very rapidly with the aircraft becoming uncontrollable. Mele Vojvodich was scheduled to take aircraft number 126 on a performance <b>check</b> <b>flight</b> which included a rendezvous beacon test with a KC-135 tanker and managed to eject safely [...] above the ground. A post-crash investigation revealed that {{the primary cause of}} the accident was a maintenance error in that the flight line technician was negligent in performing his duty when he connected the wiring harnesses for the yaw and pitch rate gyroscopes of the stability augmentation system in reverse. It was also found that a contributing cause was a design deficiency which made it possible to physically connect the wiring harnesses in reverse.|$|E
