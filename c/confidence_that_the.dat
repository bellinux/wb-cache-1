5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

25|$|A mock-up {{with the}} {{expected}} {{layout of the}} MX-1179, {{now known as the}} MA-1, was inspected and approved in December 1955. With growing <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aircraft was now improving, an extended production contract for 17 F-102Bs was sent out on 18 April 1956. On 17 June, the aircraft was officially re-designated as the F-106A.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters {{published}} an article in a special issue of The Lancet.

25|$|England {{has also}} had a chastening {{experience}} {{in the run-up to}} the 1959 Test series.

25|$|The purges of the 1930s {{affected}} all {{branches of}} the military including the Soviet Red Air Force. The poor performance of VVS (Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily) during the Winter War with Finland had increased the Luftwaffe's <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviet forces could be easily defeated. The standard of flight training had been accelerated {{in preparation for a}} German attack that was expected to come in 1942 or later. As a result, Soviet pilot training was extremely poor.|$|E
25|$|Vice Admiral Nilakanta Krishnan of Eastern Naval Command had {{maintained}} {{that it was}} pretty clear that Pakistan would have deployed Ghazi in the Bay of Bengal {{and a part of}} its plan was an attempt to sink the Indian aircraft carrier Vikrant.

25|$|The Marshall and Dodge plans' successes {{have brought}} new {{challenges}} to the U.S. dollar. In 1959, dollars in circulation around the world exceeded U.S. gold reserves, and the dollar became vulnerable to the currency equivalent of a bank run. In 1960, Yale economist Robert Triffin described the problem to Congress: either the dollar was not freely available and other countries {{could not afford to}} import American goods, or the dollar was freely available but <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dollar could be converted to gold would wane.|$|E

25|$|In March 2015, Konami {{announced}} plans for a corporate restructuring that saw them part ways with Hideo Kojima and his development studio Kojima Productions. As part of the separation, Kojima's name {{was removed from the}} game cover, all of its associated paraphernalia and future releases of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection. A Konami spokesperson stated that Kojima would still be involved with Konami and the Metal Gear franchise, and despite the dispute, the company expressed <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game would be declared Game of the Year.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with these large traps, {{there are also}} small arched stone walls which {{are believed to have}} been used as hiding places for archers waiting for prey. Various dating methods have suggested that the earliest traps may be as old as 3500 years. Most of the findings, including remains of houses, date back to the years between 500 and 700 AD. It is thus known with <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> large traps and accompanying walls were used from the 6th century until the onset of the Black Death in the 14th century.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} discussion, the Holy See {{permitted}} radiocarbon dating on portions of a swatch {{taken from a}} corner of the shroud. Independent tests in 1988 at the University of Oxford, the University of Arizona, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology concluded with 95% <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shroud material dated to 1260–1390 AD. This 13th to 14th century dating is much too recent for the shroud to have been associated with Jesus of Nazareth. The dating does on the other hand match the first appearance of the shroud in church history.|$|E

25|$|Losing <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{international}} community would support his reinstatement, Lumumba fled in late November {{to join his}} supporters in Stanleyville {{to establish a new}} government. In early December he was captured by Mobutu's troops and incarcerated at his headquarters in Thysville. However, Mobutu still considered him a threat and on 17 January 1961 transferred him to the rebelling State of Katanga. Lumumba then disappeared from the public view. It was later discovered that he was murdered the same day by the secessionist forces of Moise Tshombe after Mobutu's government turned him over.|$|E
25|$|Although the Commission of Fine Arts did {{not approve}} the FBI building's final design until November 1967, the first {{contract}} for land clearance and excavation was awarded in March 1965. GSA also moved ahead with funding requests for construction in 1965. But securing that funding proved elusive. A Johnson administration request for $45.8 million in initial funding was denied by the House Appropriations Committee in May. Although both administration and FBI officials expressed <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> money would be restored, a House-Senate budget conference committee in August declined to include the funds in the fiscal 1966 budget.|$|E
