5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important {{to our understanding of the}} early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of <b>Ctenophora</b> as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the <b>Ctenophora</b> appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins totalizing ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of <b>Ctenophora</b> as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{combined}} ctenophores with cnidarians into {{a single}} phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells {{on the outside and}} another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. However, genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of <b>Ctenophora,</b> which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals, and increasing awareness {{of the differences between the}} groups has persuaded more recent authors to classify the two as separate phyla. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Ctenophora</b> and the sponges {{are unique}} among {{the animals in}} lacking true hox genes. The {{presence}} of a Hox/Parahox gene in the Placozoa suggests that either the Porifera or the <b>Ctenophora</b> are the most basal animal clades. Another DNA based study suggests that the <b>Ctenophora</b> are the earliest branching animals. Another study also suggests that this group are a sister group to other animals.|$|E
25|$|Several animal phyla are {{recognized}} for {{their lack of}} bilateral symmetry, and {{are thought to have}} diverged from other animals early in evolution. Among these, the sponges (Porifera) were long thought to have diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum. They lack the complex organization found in most other phyla. Their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into distinct tissues. Sponges typically feed by drawing in water through pores. However, a series of phylogenomic studies from 2008–2015 have found support for <b>Ctenophora,</b> or comb jellies, as the basal lineage of animals. This result has been controversial, since it would imply that sponges may not be so primitive, but may instead be secondarily simplified. Other researchers have argued that the placement of <b>Ctenophora</b> as the earliest-diverging animal phylum is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the other}} phyla, the <b>Ctenophora</b> and the Cnidaria, which {{includes}} sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers {{with a single}} opening, which serves as both the mouth and the anus. Both have distinct tissues, {{but they are not}} organized into organs. There are only two main germ layers, the ectoderm and endoderm, with only scattered cells between them. As such, these animals are sometimes called diploblastic. The tiny placozoans are similar, but {{they do not have a}} permanent digestive chamber.|$|E
25|$|Noise from {{ships and}} human {{activity}} can damage Cnidarians and <b>Ctenophora,</b> {{which are very}} important organisms in the marine ecosystem. They promote high diversity and they are used as models for ecology and biology because of their simple structures. When there is underwater noise, the vibrations in the water damage the cilia hairs in the Coelenterates. In a study, the organisms were exposed to sound waves for different numbers of times and {{the results showed that}} damaged hair cells were extruded or missing or presented bent, flaccid or missed kinocilia and stereocilia.|$|E
25|$|The marine {{invertebrate}} collection {{is composed of}} specimens from taxa other than crustaceans and molluscs. It includes Annelida, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Cestoda, Cephalochordata, Hemichordata, Cnidaria, <b>Ctenophora,</b> Echinodermata, Echiura, Entoprocta, Nematoda, Foraminifera, Phoronida, Rotifera, Turbellaria, Trematoda, Urochordata, Porifera, Priapulida and Sipuncula. Specimens are mostly marine (Western Atlantic and Antarctic Ocean), but some are neotropical freshwater and terrestrial. Containing nearly 200,000 lots and 200 type specimens, the collection was built with the efforts of late-19th-century researchers including Ernst and Eveline Marcus, Gilberto Righi, Luis Roberto Tommasi, Antonio Sérgio Ferreira Ditadi, Jeanete Maron Ramos, Gertrude Rita Kloss and Sérgio de Almeida Rodrigues.|$|E
500|$|It is now {{generally}} {{thought that}} the Calcarea (sponges with calcium carbonate spicules) are {{more closely related to}} Cnidaria, <b>Ctenophora</b> (comb jellies) and Bilateria (all the more complex animals) than they are to the other groups of sponges. In 1866 it was proposed that Cnidaria and <b>Ctenophora</b> were more closely related to each other than to Bilateria and formed a group called Coelenterata ("hollow guts"), because Cnidaria and <b>Ctenophora</b> both rely on the flow of water {{in and out of a}} single cavity for feeding, excretion and respiration. In 1881, it was proposed that <b>Ctenophora</b> and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, for example muscles in the middle layer (mesoglea in <b>Ctenophora,</b> mesoderm in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to <b>Ctenophora.</b> This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled [...] "Planulozoa" [...] because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the planula larvae of Cnidaria.|$|E

500|$|Sponges, {{the members}} of the phylum Porifera ( [...] ; meaning [...] "pore bearer"), are the sister of the ParaHoxozoa or Epitheliozoa with which they form a basal animal clade, the Parazoa. The other basal animal clade are the <b>Ctenophora.</b> They are {{multicellular}} parazoan organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells.|$|E
500|$|It is {{difficult}} to reconstruct the early stages in the evolutionary [...] "family tree" [...] of animals using only morphology (their shapes and structures), because the large differences between Porifera (sponges), Cnidaria plus <b>Ctenophora</b> (comb jellies), Placozoa and Bilateria (all the more complex animals) make comparisons difficult. Hence reconstructions now rely largely or entirely on molecular phylogenetics, which groups organisms according to similarities and differences in their biochemistry, usually in their DNA or RNA.|$|E
500|$|<b>Ctenophora</b> ( [...] ; {{singular}} ctenophore, [...] or {{from the}} Greek κτείς kteis 'comb' and φέρω pherō 'carry'; commonly known as comb jellies) is a phylum of invertebrate animals that live in marine waters worldwide. They are notable for the groups of cilia they use for swimming (commonly referred to as [...] "combs"), {{and they are the}} largest animals that swim by means of cilia. Depending on the species, adult ctenophores range from a few millimeters to [...] in size. Only 100–150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named. The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles") that are covered with colloblasts, sticky cells that capture prey.|$|E
500|$|English-language {{writings}} have conventionally treated nemertean as [...] "primitive" [...] acoelomate bilaterians {{that are}} most closely related to flatworms (Platyhelminthes). These pre-cladistics analyses emphasised as shared features: multiciliated (with multiple cilia per cell), glandular epidermis; rod-shaped secretory bodies or rhabdites; frontal glands or organs; protonephridia; and acoelomate body organization. However, multiciliated epidermal cells and epidermal gland cells are also found in <b>Ctenophora,</b> Echiura, Sipuncula, Annelida, Mollusca and other taxa. The rhabdites of nemertea have a different structure from those of flatworms at the microscopic scale. The frontal glands or organs of flatworms vary a lot in structure, and similar structures appear in small marine annelids and entoproct larvae. The protonephridia of nemertea and flatworms are different in structure, and in position – the flame cells of nemertea are usually in {{the walls of the}} fluid vessels and are served by [...] "drains" [...] from which the wastes exit by a small number of tubes through the skin, while the flame cells of flatworms are scattered throughout the body. Rigorous comparisons show no synapomorphies of nemertean and platyhelminth nephridia.|$|E
500|$|The {{analyses}} {{described above}} concluded that sponges are {{closest to the}} ancestors of all Metazoa, of all multi-celled animals including both sponges and more complex groups. However, another comparison in 2008 of 150 genes in each of 21 genera, ranging from fungi to humans but including only two species of sponge, suggested that comb jellies (<b>ctenophora)</b> are the most basal lineage of the Metazoa included in the sample. If this is correct, either modern comb jellies developed their complex structures independently of other Metazoa, or sponges' ancestors were more complex and all known sponges are drastically simplified forms. The study recommended further analyses using {{a wider range of}} sponges and other simple Metazoa such as Placozoa. The results of such an analysis, published in 2009, suggest that a return to the previous view may be warranted. [...] 'Family trees' constructed using a combination of all available data – morphological, developmental and molecular – concluded that the sponges are in fact a monophyletic group, and with the cnidarians form the sister group to the bilaterians.|$|E
2500|$|Cladistics {{embraces the}} concept of the [...] "most recent common ancestor", and {{assigning}} similar animals to groups called clades. Animals are thought to be a basal Apoikozoan clade as sister of the Choanoflagellata. The [...] "bilaterian" [...] animals (Bilateria), whose body display bilateral symmetry, are thought to form a monophyletic group. The Bilaterians are further classified based on a major division between Deuterostomes and Protostomes. More basal animals lack a bilaterally symmetric body plan (<b>Ctenophora,</b> Porifera, Cnidaria and Placozoa), with their relationships still disputed. In 2017, the <b>Ctenophora</b> are found as basalmost animals with [...] "full" [...] support. However, ever since the first finding in 2008, such proposals are strongly contested, with Porifera as the alternative. Some of the issues are the rapid evolutionary rate within <b>Ctenophora,</b> insufficient sampling, and the recent internal divergence date of <b>Ctenophora.</b> It is indicated approximately how many million years ago (Mya) the clades diverged into newer clades.|$|E

It has traditionally also been applied to other animals sharing a superficial resemblance, for example ctenophores (members from another phylum of common, gelatinous and generally transparent or translucent, free-swimming planktonic carnivores now known as comb jellies) were included as [...] "jellyfishes". Even some scientists include the phylum <b>ctenophora</b> when they are referring to jellyfish. Other scientists prefer to use the more all-encompassing term gelatinous zooplankton, when referring to these, together with other soft-bodied animals in the water column.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Georges Cuvier united ctenophores and cnidarians in the Radiata. Thomas Cavalier-Smith, in 1983, redefined Radiata as a {{subkingdom}} consisting of Myxozoa, Placozoa, Cnidaria and <b>Ctenophora.</b> Lynn Margulis and K. V. Schwartz later redefined Radiata in their Five Kingdom classification, this time including only Cnidaria and <b>Ctenophora.</b> This definition {{is similar to}} the historical descriptor coelenterata which has also been proposed as a group encompassing Cnidaria and <b>Ctenophora.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{validity of}} the term coelenterate is currently disputed, as the Cnidaria and <b>Ctenophora</b> have less in common than previously assumed. Coelentera may only be monophyletic if both Placozoa and Bilateria are included. In particular, the phylogenetic position of <b>Ctenophora</b> is controversial; it was first considered a sub-group of coelenterata but Hyman regarded it as a separate phylum. Some researchers suggest that Coelenterata is not monophyletic, and therefore any group containing Cnidaria and <b>Ctenophora</b> but excluding other phyla would be paraphyletic. However, some genomic studies have found support for monophyletic coelenterates. [...] Despite this uncertainty, the term coelenterate is still used in informal settings {{to refer to the}} Cnidaria and <b>Ctenophora.</b>|$|E
