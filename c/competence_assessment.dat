The research has been conducted on a lot of 216 teachers specialized in different pre-university education fields and has aimed at the following objectives: to assess the cumulative development level for teacher's professional competences; to identify differences in the participant's professional development, dependent on gender and specialty; to point at limitations of the current model of assessment of teacher's professional competences. The research methods used have been document analysis (grade rolls), interview and statistical techniques.

Using ANES data from 1972 to 2012, we identify a pattern of partisan polarization in <b>competence</b> <b>assessments</b> in parallel with elite polarization in the US and some evidence of increasing competence ratings for US parties as they polarize. Partisan polarization of <b>competence</b> <b>assessments</b> is robust to the inclusion of spatial proximity controls. As an additional test of our expectations and using British Election Study data from 1963 to 2014, we reveal partisan polarization followed by depolarization, consistent with elite-level dynamics in Britain.

40|$|Women remain noticeably {{underrepresented}} in science despite remarkable gains in other fields, {{and in this}} dissertation, I posit that biased <b>assessments</b> of <b>competence</b> are a mechanism for fewer women pursuing - and succeeding in - science. Drawing from status characteristic theory, I expect that women will be assessed - and assess themselves - as less competent in science than men, which will in turn affect important career decisions and outcomes. In Chapter 2, I test whether similar women and men differ in their self-assessments of their scientific competence using an experimental design. As expected, women evaluated themselves as less competent than similar men when receiving the same feedback about their scientific aptitude. Because self-assessments of competence affect career-relevant decisions, women also reported significantly lower likelihoods of pursuing science-related education and careers, although the effect of gender is no longer significant once self-assessments are controlled for. The results suggest that biased self-assessments of competence are a mechanism for fewer women entering science to begin with. In Chapter 3, I conduct an experiment embedded within a survey to test whether a scientist's gender affects <b>competence</b> <b>assessments</b> made by peers, and whether <b>competence</b> <b>assessments</b> in turn affect important career outcomes, such as hiring support and remuneration. The results suggest that women in science face barriers in getting hired and in the rewards they garner for their careers, {{even when they are}} seen as equally competent as men. Because women face these disadvantages even when controlling for <b>competence</b> <b>assessments,</b> alternative mechanisms should be investigated. In Chapter 4, I shift theoretical and empirical focus to investigate how the gender of a scientist directing a scientific job affects evaluations of the job itself. Drawing from devaluation theory, I predict that a scientific job directed by a woman would be given less favorable evaluations. Indeed, the results indicate that when a job is directed by a woman rather than a man, it is seen as less prestigious, exciting, interesting, and valuable.

Accordingly, North American Culex pipiens and Culex quinquefasciatus were orally exposed and intrathoracically inoculated with the African prototype ZIKV strain and currently circulating Asian lineage ZIKV strains to assess infection, dissemination, and transmission potential. Results indicated that these two North American Culex mosquito species were highly refractory to oral infection with no dissemination or transmission observed with any ZIKV strains assessed. Furthermore, both Culex mosquito species intrathoracically inoculated with either Asian or African lineage ZIKVs failed to expectorate virus in saliva. These in vivo results were further supported by the observation that multiple mosquito cell lines of Culex species origin demonstrated significant growth restriction of ZIKV strains compared with Aedes-derived cell lines. In summation, no evidence for the potential of Cx. pipiens or Cx. quinquefasciatus to serve as a competent vector for ZIKV transmission in North America was observed. 2017 - 05 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 28500817 PMC 541722...|$|R
