40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the synthesis of}} all the response functions computed on <b>Cedrus</b> <b>atlantica</b> (<b>Endl.)</b> Carrière in Morocco. More than a thousand tree-ring width series collected in 40 sites have been used. At every site, a distinction has been made between young adult trees and old adult trees. Response functions have been calculated on the mean raw ring widths by using the multiple linear regression model of Guiot (Guiot et al. 1982). Among the variables selected to determine the response of Cedrus to climate, the precipitation of autumn and winter and the temperature of January, April, August and September play the leading part in explaining the ring-width variations...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a method for identifying years of anomalous radial growth, which are called atypical years and are characterized by particularly narrow rings for certain trees or sites, and wide for the others. With this aim, we use principal components analysis (PCA) of tree -ring series, where years are the variables and trees or sites are the individuals, even though in classical dendrochronological applications of PCA, the trees or sites are considered as variables and the years as cases. The relevant method is explained and results are given for five cedar forests (<b>Cedrus</b> <b>atlantica</b> (<b>Endl.)</b> Carrière) in Morocco...|$|E

D. {{to modern}} times is reconstructed for Morocco, using <b>Cedrus</b> <b>atlantica</b> (<b>Endl.)</b> Carriere tree-ring chronologies. Both multiple regression on principal components and the bootstrap method {{are used to}} calibrate tree-ring width with precipitation; precipitation variation is reconstructed for three climatically distinct areas: the humid, subhumid, and arid regions of Morocco. A series of successive wet and dry periods is identified for the past 1000 years; the maximum length of the 13 dry periods (during which precipitation was at least 1 sigma below normal) is six years. Twenty-one years are identified during which precipitation fell more than 2 sigma below normal. There is no significant correspondence in climatic variation in Morocco, Europe, and the Sahel during this time period. Anglai...|$|E

40|$|Mean {{standardized}} 120 -year ring-width chronologies of <b>Cedrus</b> <b>atlantica</b> (<b>Endl.)</b> Carriere (Atlas cedar) {{computed for}} four geographical regions of Morocco (Rif, Central Middle Atlas, Eastern Middle Atlas, High Atlas) and mean annual 49 -year precipitation series computed for four bioclimatic strata that overlay die geographical regions were analyzed {{in the frequency}} domain. Their predominant frequency components were estimated {{at the end of}} a stepwise procedure that involved the analysis of a modified periodogram. A 7 -year periodicity has been detected in all the precipitation series and in some of the tree-ring series. These ring-width indices also show periodicities of about 11 and 18. 6 years, which have been assigned a posteriori to the planetary system dynamics, i. e., to sunspot activity and lunar nodal tide, respectively. Among-region differences in the year to year fluctuations of C. atlantica radial growth were statistically assessed using analysis of variance of the finite Fourier transform of die mean standardized ring-width chronologies for 39 sites located in the four geographical regions. In particular, they were assessed at frequencies corresponding to the detected periodicities related to climate and planetary behaviors. Low to high concordance levels have been observed among tree-ring series from different geographical regions, and these concordance levels were related to the sensitivity of C. atlantica to limiting factors...|$|E
40|$|The family Siricidae {{has more}} than 100 species in about 11 genera. Nearly all species are native to the Northern Hemisphere {{although}} there is an endemic genus (Afrotremex) in southern Africa. Collectively they are known as woodwasps or horntails. All siricids are wood borers and several species are forestry pests to varying degrees. New Zealand has a single species of siricid woodwasp, Sirex noctilio F., {{thought to have been}} accidentally introduced around 1900. Two recent and noteworthy siricid incursions are presented as case studies, with an emphasis on the science used in decision support. The first case study describes the advantages of using morphological and molecular diagnostic approaches in combination. This case resulted in the first published host record association between S. noctilio and Amylostereum areolatum (Chaillet ex Fr.) Boidin in <b>Cedrus</b> <b>atlantica</b> (<b>Endl.)</b> Manetti. The second case study reports the application of published life cycle developmental data to assess establishment risk, and profiles the entry of Sirex juvencus (L.) into New Zealand within timber stamped with the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 15 mark, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Biosecurity New Zealand’s actions to mitigate this high-risk pathway.

A total of 24 key forest tree species have been selected by the project partners for their importance for the biodiversity of the Mediterranean basin and for delivering ecosystem services to the Mediterranean forestry community.

Vilnius, Lithuania, 16 - 20 September 2012 Diverse targets and {{oviposition}} timings in seed specialized wasps: insights from Cupressaceae and Pinaceae parasitism strategies Parasitism of discrete {{resources such as}} seeds is tightly linked to the synchrony between the timing of oviposition and host development. In seed-specialized wasps of the Megastigmus genus (Hymenoptera: Torymidae), the only nutritive tissues available to larval instars are the female gametophyte and the seed embryo. Because significant storage accumulation begins in the gametophyte if ovule fertilization has taken place, fertilized ovules obviously provide the more desirable oviposition targets. But among conifers, initiation of th e female gametophyte either occurs before pollination, coincides with pollination or is delayed {{for as much as}} a year. This study aimed at addressing the following question: do such diverse host ovule development processes involve diverse oviposition patterns in their specialized parasites ? We analysed and compared the timing and the target of oviposition in different Megastigmus species specialized on two different conifers, for which pollination is essential (Cupressaceae: Cupressus sempervirens L.) or not (Pinaceae: <b>Cedrus</b> <b>atlantica</b> Manetti ex <b>Endl.)</b> for gametophytes to develop. Carrying out extensive histological studies on successive stages of seed development before, during and after the oviposition periods of each Megastigmus species, we demonstrated that oviposition of M. schimitscheki Novitzky and M. pinsapinis Hoffmeyer on C. atlantica occurred about one month before ovule fertilization, at one of the earliest stage of gametophyte development (cœnocytic stage). Conversely, M. watchli Seitner always oviposited after fertilization, during embryogenesis, on C. sempervirens. These results suggest that wasps specialized on Pinaceae seeds can select any of the potential seed within a cone as an oviposition site, and that their fitness does not depend on fertilization success. This may reflect a more simple and efficient oviposition strategy on Pinaceae than on Cupressaceae, where females have to locate a fertilized gametophyte. Ecological and practical implications of these findings are dis...|$|R

On {{the basis of a}} comparative aerial photograph analysis (1962 and 1987 missions) completed by photogrammetry and field observations, the vegetation structure and its succession stages have been recognized. Although the total forest area remains unchanged, the physiognomic stages of identified communities (<b>Cedrus</b> <b>atlantica</b> forest;Quercus rotundifolia forest;mixed forest with <b>Cedrus</b> <b>atlantica</b> and Quercus rotundifolia) show heterogenous evolution. Depending on species and forest components we note paradoxal evolutionary tendencies. Systematic degradation due to harvesting and resource overuse is locally observed beside regenerated and densified parts. Therefore, the system dynamics reflects the locally variable factors such as soil hydrology and human impact. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
