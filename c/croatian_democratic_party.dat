50|$|The <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (Hrvatska demokratska stranka, HDS) was {{a right-wing}} party that {{was among the}} first to be founded after the arrival of multi-party {{democracy}} in Croatia. Led by veteran Communist-era dissident Marko Veselica, HDS was supposed to be the focal point for the most radical Croatian nationalists. This spot was, however, taken by Franjo Tuđman and his Croatian Democratic Union. HDS instead joined moderate Coalition of People's Accord and, consequently, fared badly in the Croatian parliamentary election, 1990.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} intellectuals {{restored}} Croatian Party of Rights on 25 February 1990. Dobroslav Paraga, {{the first president}} of the party acknowledged the historical bounds with the older Party of Rights. Soon, the party faced splits. Krešimir Pavelić, a former secretary of the party, became president of the new <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of Rights. Some other rights parties that claimed origin from old Party of Rights appeared. Croatian Party of Rights did not participate in the Croatian parliamentary election in 1990, which helped Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) to win more votes.|$|E

50|$|HSLS first won the {{elections}} in 2000 and formed a coalition government with four other parties, including the largest party of the <b>Croatian</b> centre-left Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of Croatia. After losing the 2003 general election, party's decline in political influence started. In the most recent 2015 general election HSLS won 2 out of 151 seats in the Croatian Parliament {{as a member of}} the centre-right Patriotic Coalition that is led by the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Union <b>party.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In the Croatian {{parliamentary}} election, 1990 it joined bloc {{of moderate}} nationalists called Coalition of People's Accord.

50|$|It {{initially}} {{seemed that}} this plan by Dabčević-Kučar and Tripalo was working. Coalition was indeed joined by {{large number of}} parties - centrist Croatian Social Liberal Party, right-wing <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> and Croatian Christian Democratic Party, {{as well as the}} nominally left-wing Social Democrats of Croatia and number of local, youth and environmentalist groups and individual candidates. Another boost {{came in the form of}} open letter by some 200 top Croatian artists, scientists and intellectuals expressing support for Coalition. However, it soon became apparent that Coalition would have to compete not only with the Communist government, but also with the more extremist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). The emerging nationalism in other parts of Yugoslavia (Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia) garnered popularity for more radical parties.|$|E
50|$|As it {{strongly}} advocated Croatian independence, the HDZ {{was quite}} unpopular with the Serb minority, {{and others who}} preferred to see Croatia remain inside the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This {{was one of the}} factors contributing {{to the creation of the}} Republic of Serbian Krajina and the subsequent armed conflict in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. The role of the HDZ in those events is matter of controversy, even in Croatia, where some tend to view HDZ policy in the early stages of the conflict as extremist and a contributing factor in the escalation of violence, while others (such as Marko Veselica's <b>Croatian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party)</b> see the HDZ as having appeased Serbia and the Yugoslav People's Army, and therefore, being responsible for Croatia being unprepared for defense. However, the policies of Tuđman and the HDZ shifted according to the circumstances.|$|E
