5|$|In 1999, the chairman, Lord Alexander of Weedon, {{announced}} a merger with Legal & General {{in a friendly}} £10.7billion deal, the first between a bank and an insurance company in UK history. The move was poorly received in the London financial markets and NatWest's share price fell substantially. Seen as a driver of the ill-advised investment banking expansion, Derek Wanless {{was forced to resign}} as chief executive following the appointment of Sir David Rowland (who became executive chairman). Also in 1999, in response to the much reduced NatWest market <b>capitalisation,</b> the much smaller Bank of Scotland made a hostile takeover bid for NatWest. The Bank of Scotland's aim was to break up the NatWest Group and dispose of its non-retail assets. NatWest was forced to abandon its merger, but refused to agree to a takeover by a rival bank. The Royal Bank of Scotland tabled another hostile offer and trumped the Bank of Scotland with a £21billion bid. The takeover of NatWest in early 2000 was the biggest in UK history. National Westminster Bank, once Britain's most profitable bank, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and became, with its subsidiaries, component parts of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The outcome of this bitter struggle set the tone for a round of consolidation in the financial sector as it prepared for a new age of fierce global competition. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group became the second largest bank in the UK and Europe (after HSBC) and the fifth largest in the world by market <b>capitalisation.</b> According to Forbes Global 2000, it was then the 13th largest company in the world. NatWest was retained as a distinct brand with its own banking licence, but many back office functions were merged with those of the Royal Bank, leading to over 18,000 job losses.|$|E

Almost 60 per cent of the initial share offering was bought in the United States, with a third sold in Britain and the rest mainly in the Netherlands. Further capital was soon needed for the construction works and additional share and bond issues followed. The UERL eventually raised a total of £18million (£ today).|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, {{operates}} as a non-quoted public limited company, whose ownership is considerably {{different from that of}} other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £18,000, which sets the club's market <b>capitalisation</b> value at approximately £1,119.9m. Most football clubs aren't listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club's brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand. Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at $2.0 billion (£1.4 billion) in 2016, ranked second in English football. Research by the Henley Business School also ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the club's value at £1.118 billion in 2015.|$|E

However, in its 2005 Annual Report, the company disclosed that it was subsidising the returns to its 1994 forestry scheme by approximately A$3 million, and that it expected to have to similarly subsidise the 1995 and 1996 schemes by up to A$12 million in future years. Board Chairman Peter Patrikeos and non-executive director Jeffry Mews both {{expressed concern about the}} way in which Great Southern was funding shortfalls on the sales of timber products, with the issue leading directly to Mews' resignation. Although the company continued to sell over A$800 million of MIS products in the two financial years after incurring losses on its early offerings, it was not meeting sales targets, and its share price was falling.|$|E

40|$|This paper uncovers several {{empirical}} regularities in {{the returns}} of small stocks. First, within {{the sample of}} firms that have low market <b>capitalisations,</b> stocks with low past profitability ('laggers') bring returns that are significantly {{higher than those of}} stocks with high past profitability ('leaders'). Second, the size premium is generated largely by small laggers. Moreover, both patterns are particularly pronounced at earnings-announcement dates, suggesting that unexpected earnings growth can explain a portion of the abnormal returns to small stocks. Since these findings point to market inefficiency, they are especially important for the revenue management of money managers who invest in small stocks. small-firm effect; forecasting; revenue management; return anomalies; small firms; overreaction; low market capitalisation; size premium; earnings growth; unexpected growth; small stocks. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{had a serious}} negative impact on the Icelandic economy. The national currency fell sharply in value, foreign currency transactions were virtually suspended for weeks, and the market <b>capitalisation</b> of the Icelandic stock exchange fell by more than 90%. As a result of the crisis, Iceland underwent a severe economic depression; the country's gross domestic product dropped by 10% in real terms between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2010. A new era with positive GDP growth started in 2011, and has helped foster a gradually declining trend for the unemployment rate. The government budget deficit has declined from 9.7% of GDP in 2009 and 2010 to 0.2% of GDP in 2014; the central government gross debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline to less than 60% in 2018 from a maximum of 85% in 2011.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} world's leading {{international}} financial centres, Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade. From {{the second half of}} the 19th century and continuing into the first half of the 20th century, Hong Kong operated as a key command centre for the allocation of Asian capital in its broadest form. Hong Kong stature as an International Financial centre (IFC), gradually developed from the 1950s to become a key component of the island's economy. It is an important centre for international finance and trade, with one of the greatest concentrations of corporate headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is the seventh largest in the world and has a market <b>capitalisation</b> of US$3.2 trillion as of December 2016. In 2009, Hong Kong raised 22 percent of worldwide initial public offering (IPO) capital, making it the largest centre of IPOs in the world and the easiest place to raise capital. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Hong Kong was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as London, New York City, Tokyo, San Francisco, Chicago, Sydney, Boston, and Toronto in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia after Singapore.|$|E

This study {{investigates the}} current private equity market in African {{frontier}} markets {{as well as}} inherent investment opportunities in these African frontier markets. The research includes an analysis of, inter-alia, the following: the development of capital markets in Africa, the classification of African frontier markets, the measurement of liquidity, the relationship between liquidity and asset prices {{and the history of}} private equity. This study will highlight to policymakers both in African and in donor capitals the need to implement strategies that will support investment (especially private equity investment) into the continent. The research carried out in this study should contribute {{to a better understanding of}} illiquidity risks of African frontier markets and show how these can be mitigated. This study will also provide key information on African frontier markets to investors and fund managers in order for them to understand that a typical investment strategy for investing in developed markets cannot be applied to frontier markets. The study analyses data of listed stocks on selected African stock exchanges and compares this to data for similar stocks listed on developed world stock markets to examine the relationship between liquidity, earnings multiples and market <b>capitalisations</b> for these stocks. Interestingly, results show that, while there is no relationship between the liquidity of stocks and the Price Earnings (PE) multiples of stocks, there is strong evidence to suggest that a relationship exists between the liquidity of stocks and the Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) multiples of stocks. Furthermore, we find strong evidence that African frontier market stocks are significantly less liquid and have lower earnings multiples than stocks with similar market <b>capitalisations</b> listed on stock exchanges in the developed world...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{performance}} of UK reverse leveraged buy-outs {{to that of the}} AIM and FTSE 250 indexes during the period, 1990 - 2000.

Significant differences in performance were not found to exist but the mean performance of indexes exceeded that of the reverse LBO sample with large effect sizes. Given the available literature the two main determinants of firm performance, level of managerial ownership and the level of debt leverage, are investigated and found to have insignificant effects. The proportion of variance that {{can be explained by the}} regression model is extremely small. We return to our literature and find the basis for our predictions to have been founded on US samples.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{transmission}} of extreme stock market returns among three groups of countries: the Euro-periphery countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain), the Euro-core countries (Germany, France, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium), and the major European Union -but not euro- countries (Sweden, UK, Poland, Czech Republic, Denmark). Using extreme returns on daily stock market data from January 2004 till March 2013, we nd that transmission e ects are present for the tails of the returns distributions for the Pre-crisis, the US-crisis and the Euro-crisis periods from the Euro-periphery group to the Non-Euro and the Euro-core groups. Within group e ects are stronger in the crisis periods. We nd that the transmission channel {{does not seem to}} have intensi ed during the crisis periods, but it transmitted larger shocks (in some cases, extreme bottom returns doubled during the crisis periods). Thus, as extreme returns have become much more "extreme" during the nancial crisis periods, the expected losses on extreme return days have increased signi cantly. Given the fact that stock market <b>capitalisations</b> in these country groups are trillions of Euros, a 1 % or 2 % increase in extreme bottom returns (in crisis periods) can lead to aggregate losses of tens of billions Euros in one single trading day.

5|$|With Yerkes as chairman, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was {{established}} in 1902 with a <b>capitalisation</b> of £5million, the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which, by 1903, raised a total of £18million (£ today) to be used across all of the UERL's projects. Yerkes died in December 1905, and Speyer took his place {{as chairman of the}} UERL. By 1907, the three new railways had opened and the electrification works had been completed. Despite the UERL's engineering success in carrying out the works in such a short time, the company was in a difficult financial position. The preliminary estimates of passenger numbers proved to be over optimistic and revenues were not covering operating costs. After bailing out the company, Speyer, with Managing Director Albert Stanley, struggled {{for a number of years}} to restore its finances. This was finally achieved with the purchase of the London General Omnibus Company in 1912, as its profits could be used to offset losses elsewhere in the group. In November 1912, Speyer further consolidated the UERL's control of London's underground railways when he negotiated the purchase of London's two other main tube railways, the City and South London Railway and the Central London Railway.|$|E
5|$|In September 1966, a {{friendly}} {{takeover of the}} Bradford brewers J. Hey & Company Ltd added 73 public houses to their estate. Webster's had a market value of £3.3million, and J. Hey had a value of £1million. The combined group had assets of over £4.5million (£65million in 2010 prices). Webster's continued to bottle Guinness under their Hey & Humphries subsidiary label into the late 1980s. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, consolidation, a good product and successful marketing made the company successful, according to The Times, with the social club trade accounted for around half of turnover. By 1967 Watney Mann owned 18.4 per cent of the company, and Webster's had a market <b>capitalisation</b> of £6million (£85million in 2010 prices) and owned 320 public houses and 12 off licences. Watney Mann had gradually increased their share to 27.1 per cent by 1972 when it initiated a takeover {{of the rest of}} the company. Samuel Webster & Sons was offered £18million for the 73 per cent of the company that Watney did not already own. The Watney Mann offer valued the entire company at almost £250million in 2010 prices. The takeover was {{a friendly}} one, and dependent upon the agreement of the Webster family, who owned 20 per cent of the company. Watney Mann was motivated by an increase to their tied estate. Following the takeover, Webster's continued as a regional subsidiary of the Watney Mann brewing empire, responsible for Yorkshire, Humberside, north Derbyshire and north Nottinghamshire. The takeover saw heavy investment in the brewery and the Webster's brands enjoyed increased distribution nationally. That same year, Watney Mann itself was taken over by Grand Metropolitan.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{legislative}} changes placed considerable {{emphasis on the}} provision of assistance to companies experiencing financial difficulties, as illustrated by, for instance, section 19 and paragraph 12 A of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act. Where debt is reduced, these sections, {{as well as other}} sections in the Income Tax Act and the VAT Act, may become applicable. Misinterpretation of the legislation or failure to view it holistically can potentially increase a taxpayer s tax burdens (including potential penalties and interest) and may also affect the revenue due to government. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to critically analyse the debt reduction provisions contained in the Income Tax Act and to consider how those provisions interact with other sections of the Income Tax Act as well as with the VAT Act. Practical difficulties and uncertainty with regard to the current legislation were considered and highlighted. The study contemplated the meaning of debt, how hybrid instruments are treated and potential reclassification between debt and equity by SARS. The study further considered what would constitute a debt reduction, how debt is reduced and how share <b>capitalisations</b> as repayment of debt are treated. The sections of the abovementioned Acts that impact on debt reductions were considered. The findings of the study suggest that hybrid instruments create a form of mismatch when a debt reduction occurs that is not in line with the recommendations of the Davis Tax Committee. In certain instances a hybrid instrument reclassifies the interest or dividend component, but the classification for purposes of the debt reduction provisions may be different. When share <b>capitalisations</b> occur as settlement for outstanding debt, care should be taken to ensure that the debt is discharged in order to guarantee that the shares are taken as consideration for purposes of the debt reduction provisions. This will avoid a potential tax liability on a larger amount. Taxpayers should align their processes and procedures to comply with the tracing burden placed on them by the debt reduction provisions. Clarification of the legislation is recommended on how the debt reduction provisions should be applied in a situation where a debt was used for a dual purpose and a partial debt reduction occurs. In the case of debt reductions, an additional tax burden can exist for a financially distressed taxpayer in terms of section 19 of the Income Tax Act and the relevant VAT legislation. It is recommended that the interaction between paragraph 20 (3) (b) of the Eighth Schedule and the debt reduction provisions be clarified in the legislation. The study also considered an intragroup loan in terms of section 45 and the potential that exists for a creditor company to claim a capital loss in the case of a debt reduction.

40|$|The {{past ten}} years have {{witnessed}} many changes in the Asian economies and stock markets, particularly in the Four Tigers, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. They enjoyed economic growth well above the world average during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. There were sharp increases in their stock market <b>capitalisations</b> {{against the background of}} low growth and low interest rates in the US and European countries in the early 1990 s. This coincided with the time when measures to liberalise these markets were implemented to allow or attract foreign direct investments in their stock markets. Then by mid 1997, both their economies and stock markets began to slump. This ten year time period thus provides a good opportunity to examine how such economic and institutional changes affected the price and volatility behaviour of the Four Tigers and their relationships with other markets. Overall, the findings of the thesis suggest that with the increase in foreign participation in the four individual markets, the influence of noise trading activities has been reduced through more and better informed trading. However, their relationships with three world major markets, the US, the UK and Japan, are not getting much stronger. There is no evidence to suggest that their prices are being increasingly led by the world markets, nor is their volatility becoming more sensitive to foreign news. Their price and volatility relationships with three regional markets, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, were not particularly strong either, until recently, when the Asian financial crisis has made them more responsive to shocks from one another. The message to the governments of the Four Tigers is clear. Foreign direct equity investments have not destabilised their stock markets. Instead, the mismanagement of their own and/or their trading partners' economies should be held more responsible...|$|R
