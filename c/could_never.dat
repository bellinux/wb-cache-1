5|$|Mahan {{went on to}} say victory {{could only}} be {{achieved}} by engagements between battleships, which {{came to be known as}} the decisive battle doctrine in some navies, while targeting merchant ships (commerce raiding or guerre de course, as posited by the Jeune École) <b>could</b> <b>never</b> succeed.|$|E

5|$|An Auschwitz {{survivor}} {{with the}} mutant {{ability to generate}} powerful magnetic fields and manipulate metal, who was once friends with Xavier (with whom he helped to build Cerebro) until his belief that humans and mutants <b>could</b> <b>never</b> co-exist led to their separation, leaving him to develop a sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation, which he uses {{in an attempt to}} mutate the world leaders in order to allow mutant prosperity.|$|E

6000|$|... “Not me,” was the disconcerting answer; “I can’t make head or tail {{of these}} bothering old politics. <b>Never</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>never</b> want to. I’ve quite {{enough to do}} to manage my own affairs, and that’s a fact.” ...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{designated}} values relative to the WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (p OR NOT p) always succeeds. Furthermore, assuming Nulls are to be interpreted as existing but unknown values, some pathological CHECKs like the one above allow insertion of Nulls that <b>could</b> <b>never</b> be replaced by any non-null value.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's wife, Alice, was {{the second}} {{daughter}} of Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Morphia of Melitene. Their only child, Constance, was two when Bohemond died in 1130. Alice tried to secure the regency for Constance for herself, but the Antiochene noblemen preferred her father, Baldwin II of Jerusalem. After Bohemond's death, Roger II of Sicily laid claim to Antioch, but he <b>could</b> <b>never</b> assert it against Constance.|$|E
5|$|Clark's {{ultimate}} goal during the Revolutionary War was {{to seize the}} British-held fort at Detroit, but he <b>could</b> <b>never</b> recruit enough men and acquire sufficient munitions to make the attempt. Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their homes by staying closer to Kentucky, instead of making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit. Clark returned to the Falls of the Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued to defend the Ohio River valley {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. I <b>never</b> <b>could</b> tell. It wasn't that I didn't dote upon you, {{and think}} about you, and feel quite sure that there <b>never</b> <b>could</b> be any other one than you." ...|$|R

5|$|Conquest in Africa and the East {{provided}} both {{wonder and}} terror to European intellectuals, as {{it led to}} the conclusion that Eden <b>could</b> <b>never</b> have been an actual geographical location. The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.|$|E
5|$|I think I was {{the first}} woman to play a marshal in a movie western. Roger would often cast against type in those days. I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> resist a plum role like a lady marshal in a genre that would never have {{considered}} such a gender reversal like that before. However, working with Roger was always an adventure and this film was no exception.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{remained}} in England until 1148. The disorders {{were at their}} peak between 1142 and 1148, but her cause <b>could</b> <b>never</b> secure enough support to enable her to be crowned. Nor could Stephen decisively defeat Matilda's forces, which meant that England remained divided in allegiance between the two rivals. But while Matilda was in England, her husband Geoffrey was conquering Normandy, which he finally overran in 1144.|$|E

5|$|Maupertuis' {{ideas were}} in {{opposition}} to the influence of early taxonomists like John Ray. In the late 17th century, Ray had given the first formal definition of a biological species, which he described as being characterized by essential unchanging features, and stated the seed of one species <b>could</b> <b>never</b> give rise to another. The ideas of Ray and other 17th-century taxonomists were influenced by natural theology and the argument from design.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{argue that}} no matter how much Greece and Portugal drive down their wages, they <b>could</b> <b>never</b> compete with {{low-cost}} developing countries such as China or India. Instead weak European countries must shift their economies to higher quality products and services, though this is a long-term process and may not bring immediate relief.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we <b>could</b> <b>never</b> have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E

5|$|The Stamford Bridge freehold, the pitch, the {{turnstiles}} and Chelsea's {{naming rights}} are {{now owned by}} Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium <b>could</b> <b>never</b> again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, {{they may have to}} change their name.|$|E
5|$|While hiking at {{a family}} reunion in 1980, Brodie became unusually tired. She was shortly {{diagnosed}} with metastatic lung cancer, although she had never smoked. Between chemotherapy treatments, she pushed ahead to complete the Nixon study, her three children and a daughter-in-law providing moral and editorial support in her time of need. Knowing that she <b>could</b> <b>never</b> complete a full biography, she ended the manuscript with Nixon's pre-presidential years, lending it an unfinished quality.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore <b>could</b> <b>never</b> legitimately wear the crown.|$|E

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he <b>could</b> <b>never</b> spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{collections}} {{have been}} useful for retrospective studies. Bird collections offer {{the potential for}} current and future researchers to make in-depth morphological and molecular study of past avian diversity. One of the earliest and most famous examples of this {{was the use of}} egg collections from the 19th and early 20th centuries in determining that the pesticide DDT was producing eggshell-thinning in raptors. The ornithologists who collected the eggs <b>could</b> <b>never</b> have known that their work would one day help establish causes for declines and help in making conservation strategies to save bird such as peregrine falcons from possible extinction.|$|E
5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that <b>could</b> <b>never</b> get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
