500|$|Boron nitride aerogel is an aerogel made {{of highly}} porous BN. It {{typically}} {{consists of a}} mixture of deformed BN nanotubes and nanosheets. It can have a density as low as 0.6 mg/cm3 and a specific surface area as high as 1050 m2/g, and therefore has potential applications as an absorbent, <b>catalyst</b> <b>support</b> and gas storage medium. BN aerogels are highly hydrophobic and can absorb up to 160 times their weight in oil. They are resistant to oxidation in air at temperatures up to 1200 °C, and hence can be reused after the absorbed oil is burned out by flame. BN aerogels can be prepared by template-assisted chemical vapor deposition using borazine as the feed gas.|$|E

Different activity orders were obtained over γ-Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 <b>supported</b> <b>catalysts</b> reflecting the critical role of the <b>support.</b> NiMo <b>catalyst</b> <b>supported</b> on γ-alumina {{proved to be the}} most active followed by the CoMo <b>catalyst</b> <b>supported</b> on titania. CoMo and NiMo lab made catalysts were proved to be more active compared to a reduced industrial CoMo <b>catalyst</b> <b>supported</b> on γ-alumina. An increase of phenol conversion in the range 52 - 230 % was obtained at 350 °C. A series of CoMo, NiMo and NiW <b>catalysts</b> <b>supported</b> on TiO 2 was also prepared using the “Equilibrium- Deposition-Filtration ” (EDF) method. The application of this technique, instead of the classical impregnation, increased considerably the activity of the CoMo <b>catalyst</b> <b>supported</b> on titania (48 % increase of phenol conversion at 350 °C). The most active lab catalysts (wet impregnated NiMo <b>catalyst</b> <b>supported</b> on alumina, EDF CoMo <b>catalyst</b> <b>supported</b> on titania) and the industrial CoMo catalyst were evaluated after sulfidation for simultaneous HDO of phenol and HDS of dibenzothiophene.

Results from Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis showed that Co–Mo <b>catalysts</b> <b>supported</b> on SiO 2 and MgO possessed good selectivity toward SWCNTs, while photoluminescence and ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared spectroscopy results indicated that these two cat-alyst supports induced the same (n,m) selectivity to near-armchair tubes, such as (6, 5) and (7, 5) tubes. <b>Catalysts</b> <b>supported</b> on TiO 2 produced a mixture of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and SWCNTs, whereas <b>catalysts</b> <b>supported</b> on Al 2 O 3 mainly grew MWCNTs. Characterization of catalysts by ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy suggested that the surface mor-phology of metal clusters over different supports was not directly responsible for the (n,m) selectivity.
