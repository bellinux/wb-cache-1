George Henry Farnum, the owner of Okemah's only photography studio, took photographs, which were distributed as postcards, a common practice at the time. The district judge convened a grand jury, but the killers were never identified. Four of Farnum's photographs {{are known to have}} survived—two spectator scenes and one <b>close-up</b> <b>view</b> each of Laura and L.D. Three of the images were re-published in 2000 and exhibited at the Roth Horowitz Gallery in New York by James Allen, an antique collector. The images of Laura Nelson are the only known surviving photographs of a female lynching victim.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a <b>close-up</b> <b>view</b> of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, Atari {{produced}} an arcade game {{version of the}} concept called Lunar Lander. This version featured monochrome vector graphics and allowed the player to rotate the ship right or left and fire thrusters controlled with a proportional throttle control system using a joystick with a spring. Like Moonlander, both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface {{as well as a}} text readout of the ship's speed, altitude, and remaining fuel are displayed. Once a game begins, it only ends when a player runs out of fuel, rather than due to a time limit; players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game. Bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts of the map. The game features four levels of difficulty in controlling the ship. Lunar Lander was Atari's first vector graphics game and the first multiple-perspective video game; when the lander got close to the surface, the view changed to a <b>close-up</b> <b>view</b> of the lander. The vector engine was inspired by Space Wars (1978) and created by Rick Moncrief and Howard Delman, who developed Lunar Lander alongside Rich Moore. The idea for the game came from Delman, who had seen a graphical version of the game, likely Moonlander, a few years prior. At least one other arcade game based on the Lunar Lander concept was developed around the same time, Lunar Rescue by Taito.|$|E

500|$|As an art critic, Shen {{criticized the}} {{paintings}} of Li Cheng (919–967) for failing to observe the principle of [...] "seeing the small {{from the viewpoint of}} the large" [...] in portraying buildings and the like. He praised the works of Dong Yuan (c. 934–c. 962); he noted that although a <b>close-up</b> <b>view</b> of Dong's work would create the impression that his brush techniques were cursory, seen from afar his landscape paintings would give the impression of grand, resplendent, and realistic scenery. In addition, Shen's writing on Dong's artworks represents the earliest known reference to the Jiangnan style of painting. In his [...] "Song on Painting" [...] and in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen praised the creative artworks of the Tang painter Wang Wei (701–761); Shen noted that Wang was unique in that he [...] "penetrated into the mysterious reason and depth of creative activity," [...] but was criticized by others for not conforming his paintings to reality, such as his painting with a banana tree growing in a snowy, wintry landscape.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} before the first bridge was built over the Niagara River, the river was crossed entirely by boats. [...] Powered by steam engines, vessels ferried people and {{carriages}} across the raging river at calmer points of the water. [...] One of these vessels was the Maid of the Mist, the first tourist boat to ply {{the waters of the}} Niagara River. [...] Named after a local legend, the steamer began service in 1846. [...] Launching from a point [...] below the Horseshoe Falls, it chugged up {{to the base of the}} falls, offering a <b>close-up</b> <b>view</b> of the natural wonder to its passengers, before moving to the opposite shore. [...] The site for the Suspension Bridge was half a mile (0.8km) from the Maid of the Mists landings. [...] The selection of the bridge site was based more on aesthetics than technical ease; it was the narrowest point of the gorge— across and [...] deep—that allowed a full view of the falls from the American side.|$|E
