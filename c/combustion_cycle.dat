25|$|Since 1989 {{there have}} also been ethanol engines based on the diesel {{principle}} operating in Sweden. They are used primarily in city buses, but also in distribution trucks and waste collectors. The engines, made by Scania, have a modified compression ratio, and the fuel (known as ED95) used is a mix of 93.6% ethanol and 3.6% ignition improver, and 2.8% denaturants. The ignition improver makes it possible for the fuel to ignite in the diesel <b>combustion</b> <b>cycle.</b> It is then also possible to use the energy efficiency of the diesel principle with ethanol. These engines have been used in the United Kingdom by Reading Buses but the use of bioethanol fuel is now being phased out.|$|E
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant. Gas-generator cycles tend to {{have lower}} specific impulse than staged <b>combustion</b> <b>cycles.</b>|$|R
3000|$|All {{the tests}} {{presented}} in this paper were carried out at an engine speed of 2, 000 [*]rpm and wide-open throttle. Absolute intake air pressure and temperature were fixed at 1.4 [*]bar and 338 [*]K, respectively. The relative injection pressure was settled at 3.5 [*]bar. The spark timing was changed in the range 12 to 20 crank angle degree before top dead centre (CAD BTDC) in order to identify the maximum brake torque and the knocking limit. To distinguish normal <b>combustion</b> <b>cycles</b> from knocking cycles, the knocking signal was evaluated through 5 - to 30 -kHz band-pass filtering of the pressure signals [16, 17, 18]. For all cycles, the evolution of the knock pressure was calculated using the absolute value of the knock signal. The <b>combustion</b> <b>cycles</b> were classified in the following way according to their knock intensity [19, 20, 21]: [...]...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{turbomachine}} {{technology and}} novel methods of coal combustion {{may have made}} possible {{the development of a}} competitive coal fired gas turbine locomotive engine. Of the combustor, thermodynamic cycle, and turbine combinations presently assessed, an external <b>combustion</b> closed <b>cycle</b> regenerative gas turbine with a fluidized bed coal combustor is judged to be the best suited for locomotive requirements. Some merit is also discerned in external <b>combustion</b> open <b>cycle</b> regenerative systems and internal <b>combustion</b> open <b>cycle</b> regenerative gas turbine systems employing a coal gasifier. The choice of an open or closed cycle depends on the selection of a working fluid and the relative advantages of loop pressurization, with air being the most attractive closed cycle working fluid on the basis of cost...|$|R

2500|$|More {{recently}} the American private space company SpaceX announced in 2012 an initiative to develop liquid methane rocket engines, including initially, {{the very large}} Raptor rocket engine. Raptor is being designed to produce [...] of thrust with a vacuum specific impulse (Isp) of 363 seconds and a sea-level Isp of 321 seconds, and began component-level testing in 2014. [...] In February 2014, the Raptor engine design was shown {{to be of the}} highly efficient and theoretically more reliable full-flow staged <b>combustion</b> <b>cycle</b> type, where both propellant streams—oxidizer and fuel—are completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber. Prior to 2014, only two full-flow rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands, but neither engine completed development or flew on a flight vehicle. In 2016, a development Raptor engine was tested.|$|E
2500|$|SpaceX has {{signaled}} {{on multiple}} occasions {{that it is}} interested in developing much larger engines than it has done to date. A conceptual plan for the Raptor project was first unveiled in a June 2009 AIAA presentation. In November 2012, Musk announced a new direction for propulsion side of the company: developing LOX/methane rocket engines for launch vehicle main and upper stages. The Raptor LOX/methane engine will use the more efficient staged <b>combustion</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{a departure from the}} open cycle gas generator cycle system and LOX/RP-1 propellants that the current Merlin 1 engine series uses." [...] The rocket would be more powerful than previously released publicly, with over [...] of thrust. The Raptor engine will likely be the first in a family of methane-based engines SpaceX intends to build. In August 2016, a Raptor engine was shipped to the McGregor testing facility in Texas, where it is undergoing development testing.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of two mid-sized oxy-fuel <b>combustion</b> combined <b>cycles</b> is performed. The two cycles are the Semi Closed Oxy-fuel <b>Combustion</b> Combined <b>Cycle</b> (SCOC-CC) and the Graz cycle. In addition, a reference cycle was established {{as the basis}} for the analysis of the oxy-fuel <b>combustion</b> <b>cycles.</b> The fuel for all three cycles is natural gas. A parametric study was conducted where the pressure ratio and the turbine entry temperature (also called combustor outlet temperature) were varied. The optimum net efficiency for the reference cycle is 56 % at a pressure ratio of 26. 2 and turbine entry temperature of 1400 C. The optimum net efficiency for the SCOC-CC was 46 % at a pressure ratio of 57. 3 and a turbine entry temperature of 1450 C. The optimum net efficiency for the Graz cycle was also 46 % at a lower pressure ratio than the SCOC-CC, at 36. 5 at the same turbine entry temperature of 1450 C. The main reduction in effifciency for the oxy-fuel <b>combustion</b> <b>cycles</b> comes from the O 2 production and compression. The layout and the design of the SCOC-CC is considerably simpler than the Graz cycle while it achieves the same net efficiency. The fact that the efficiencies for the two cycles are close to identical differs from previously reported work. Earlier studies have reported around a 3 % points advantage in efficiency for the Graz cycle, which is attributed to the use of a second bottoming cycle. This additional feature, possible to include in both cycles, is omitted to make the two cycles more comparable in terms of complexity. Even in its simplified form the Graz cycle requires the use of intercooling and steam cooling, in contrast to the SCOC-CC. The Graz cycle, however, has substantially lower pressure ratio at the optimum efficiency and has much higher power density for the gas turbine than both the reference cycle and the SCOC-CC...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} time-resolved ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) light absorbance {{to identify}} the formation behaviour of formaldehyde (HCHO) and hydroxyl (OH) within the wavelength range of 280 – 400 nm in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine fuelled with dimethyl ether (DME). The time-resolved HCHO and OH profiles at different initial pressures showed that HCHO absorbance increased in the low-temperature reaction (LTR) and thermal-ignition preparation (TIP) regions and decreased gradually as the combustion approached the high-temperature reaction (HTR) region. At higher intake pressures, HCHO absorbance decreased and OH absorbance increased. The time-resolved absorbance spectra of HCHO, with peaks at 316, 328, 340, and 354 nm for all <b>combustion</b> <b>cycles,</b> were evaluated and {{it was found that}} average absorption at 328 nm was slightly higher than at 316, 340, and 354 nm. For knocking <b>combustion</b> <b>cycles,</b> the absorbance of HCHO in the LTR region was high for cycles with low knock intensity and low for cycles with high knock intensity, showing a high level of OH absorbance. Chemical kinetics analyses showed that for different fuel/oxidiser ratios, initial O 2 concentration and intake temperature had no effect on in-cylinder temperatures in the LTR or TIP regions. However, they did have significant effects on HTR combustion. In-cylinder temperature in the LTR region had less effect on HCHO and H 2 O 2 formation than pressure...|$|R
50|$|The staged <b>combustion</b> <b>cycle</b> is a {{power cycle}} of a {{bipropellant}} rocket engine. In the staged <b>combustion</b> <b>cycle,</b> propellant flows through multiple combustion chambers, and is thus combusted in stages. Also called topping cycle and preburner cycle, its main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high fuel efficiency, measured through specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is engineering complexity.|$|E

50|$|Under ideal {{engineering}} conditions, {{force is}} applied directly {{in the line of}} travel of the assembly. The sinusoidal motion, cosinusoidal velocity, and sinusoidal acceleration (assuming constant angular velocity) result in smoother operation. The higher percentage of time spent at top dead centre (dwell) improves theoretical engine efficiency of constant volume <b>combustion</b> <b>cycles.</b> It allows the elimination of joints typically served by a wrist pin, and near elimination of piston skirts and cylinder scuffing, as side loading of piston due to sine of connecting rod angle is mitigated. The longer the distance between the piston and the yoke, the less wear that occurs, but greater the inertia, making such increases in the piston rod length realistically only suitable for lower RPM (but higher torque) applications.|$|R
