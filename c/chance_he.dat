5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good <b>chance</b> <b>he</b> would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent <b>chance</b> <b>he</b> would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5|$|By 1889 Verdi {{had been}} an opera {{composer}} for more than fifty years. He had written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, Un giorno di regno, staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but thought him incapable of writing a comedy. Verdi disagreed {{and said that he}} longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody would give him the <b>chance.</b> <b>He</b> had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino.|$|E
5|$|By <b>chance</b> <b>he</b> then {{runs into}} another man his age, {{the far more}} {{spontaneous}} Trygve Sissener, who has fallen asleep in the snow-covered street. The two spend the evening in conversation over a few drinks at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas a ski jumper, but Odd himself never {{had the courage to}} try the sport. He now feels as if he has let her down, by never having the courage to seize the day and try new things.|$|E

5|$|That {{following}} offseason, Kelly, Sam Bohne {{and other}} Major League Baseball (MLB) players agreed to play professional basketball with O'Connell. National League (NL) president John Heydler insisted {{that anyone who}} played with O'Connell could be suspended. The Giants were also displeased with Kelly's arrangement, as {{they were concerned about}} the <b>chance</b> <b>he</b> could injure himself in non-baseball activity. However, Kelly had not played in any games at that point. He was removed from the roster and thus avoided suspension by MLB.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving in}} World War II, Loxton was demobilised and {{rose through the}} cricketing ranks to make his {{first-class}} debut in 1946–47. He was an all rounder—a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. During the 1947–48 Australian season, India toured Australia for five Tests, and the home team dominated, taking an unassailable 3–0 series lead after the first four matches. The Australian selectors then {{decided to use the}} Fifth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to give opportunities to players on the fringes of the national team to show their capabilities ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Loxton was one of several debutants, and he seized his <b>chance.</b> <b>He</b> scored 80 and took three wickets as an all rounder in the Australian victory, and was rewarded with inclusion in the 17-man touring party.|$|E
5|$|Julien (Radziwilowicz) is {{a middle-aged}} clockmaker who lives {{alone with his}} cat in a large house in the Paris suburbs. Julien is blackmailing 'Madame X' (Brochet) who is {{importing}} fake antique Chinese silks, and may have murdered her sister. By <b>chance,</b> <b>he</b> meets Marie (Béart), {{a beautiful young woman}} he last saw a year ago, and they begin a passionate relationship. Though elusive, Marie agrees to move in with him; she acts strangely at times and appears absent. A mystery connects Marie to Madame X's dead sister and in uncovering Marie's secret Julien risks losing her. The film is separated into four parts, named to reflect the narrative perspective.|$|E

5|$|Pattle worked {{toward this}} goal for some time until, in late 1935, by <b>chance,</b> <b>he</b> picked {{up a copy of}} the Johannesburg Star newspaper. The paper {{contained}} an advertisement by the Royal Air Force (RAF) which was offering five-year short service commissions for cadets throughout the British Empire. The RAF expansion schemes required a great influx of capable personnel into the organisation as rearmament and the need for fighting men heightened. Pattle decided that a career in the RAF offered better prospects than as an instructor in South Africa and applied. Early in 1936, he was invited to Britain as an applicant. He flew to London at his own expense to attend the selection processes and was offered a commission by the selection board. He immediately returned to South Africa to arrange his migration to Britain and left aboard SS Llandovery Castle on 30 April 1936.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} rounds were played Thursday and the final two rounds on Friday. Strong's fine results in the {{first two rounds}} put him on 149, tied for second place with Ray, two strokes behind the second round leader, Vardon, who stood at 147. Strong's play was {{remarkable}} for its steadiness, rather than any particular brilliancy, as he methodically hit fairways and greens and seldom found himself in trouble. Strong beat or tied eventual winner Francis Ouimet in rounds 1, 2 and 4. A disappointing third round 82, however, ruined any <b>chance</b> <b>he</b> had to win the tournament and he would eventually finish on 310, +18 to par, for a ninth-place finish. He won $40 as his share of the purse.|$|E
5|$|When World War II broke out, Shaw took a {{break from}} acting and joined the Royal Air Force. He was {{commissioned}} as an Acting-Pilot Officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 25 April 1941 {{and over the next}} three months was promoted to Pilot Officer on probation, then Flying Officer and then Flight Lieutenant. According to his obituary in the Guardian, he saw little action in the service and was told the only <b>chance</b> <b>he</b> would have to fly would be as a rear gunner. Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs while others mocked his posh accent, to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech. He continued to hold a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve commission after the war until he resigned the commission on 10 February 1954; he was permitted to retain his rank.|$|E
50|$|Almagro played Julien Benneteau in {{the first}} round of the US Open, making many {{unforced}} errors and only managing to break once out of 13 <b>chances.</b> <b>He</b> lost 2-6, 4-6, 2-6.|$|R

5|$|His goals helped Symes land December's League Two Player of the Month and {{an offer}} of a {{contract}} extension by Accrington to fend off reported interest from other clubs during the January 2010 transfer window. However, Symes announced he would not sign a new contract during the transfer window increasing the <b>chance</b> <b>he</b> could leave on a free transfer during the summer on a Bosman ruling transfer. Two weeks later, Accrington announced they had rejected two bids from fellow League Two side Grimsby Town for their striker. One bid included striker Barry Conlon moving in the opposite direction. The second bid {{was reported to be}} a six-figure sum. Symes continued his rich vein of form as his 14thgoal of the season—making it his most productive season to date—levelled the scoring against Premier League Fulham in the FA Cup fourth round. A victory would have given Stanley a fifth round place {{for the first time in}} their history, but they eventually lost 3–1. In the crowd at the club's following game was Preston North End's new manager Darren Ferguson to become Symes' latest suitor. Despite the interest in Symes, no further bids were reported by Accrington for him or for midfielder Bobby Grant as the January transfer window closed. Symes finished the season with 19goals—his best return of his career to that point—with 13 of those coming in the league.|$|E
5|$|When Nicola feels {{down about}} Simon moving on, {{she decides to}} seduce Ivan. He rebuffs her {{advances}} but she tells Lesley, Rodney and Laurel that she slept with Ivan. When Ivan tries to get the truth, she convinces everyone else that he lying. Paul refuses to speak to Ivan and makes his father throw Nicola out of her home. She then tells Laurel that she lied about the whole thing. Laurel then tells everyone inside the pub that Nicola has lied and Ivan refuses to accept everyone's apologies. Rodney thinks that Ivan and Paul should get back together and lets the whole pub know. Ivan is annoyed but then realises he is right. When Ivan asks Paul for another <b>chance,</b> <b>he</b> turns him down and Ivan leaves the village. When he returns, Simon is annoyed with him for leaving him {{to pay the rent}} on Mulberry Cottage. He forgives him when Ivan reveals that he is just back for his job. He is made haulage manager for Matthew and Sadie's new business after they poach him. However, the job soon ends and along with Simon they leave Emmerdale for a new life in Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Fender's form {{dipped in}} 1924 {{after a good}} start with bat and ball; thereafter, despite {{occasional}} successes, he lacked consistency. Surrey {{finished third in the}} Championship, and Fender contributed 1,004 runs and 84 wickets in all first-class matches. Once again, Fender was a candidate for the England captaincy—South Africa played a Test series that season, and the MCC were to tour Australia in 1924–25. The eventual appointment of Arthur Gilligan was criticised in the press, which again speculated why Fender was not chosen. Fender's prospects of leading England receded further when he clashed once more with Lord Harris. The MCC had rebuked two county committees for covering their pitches prior to matches against the South Africans during a spell of wet weather. Fender pointed out in a letter published by the press that Lord Harris and the MCC were aware that this was common practice at the Scarborough Festival, despite their claims to the contrary. When Fender next played at Lord's, the furious Lord Harris summoned Fender to admonish him. Fender always regretted his indiscretion and believed it finished any <b>chance</b> <b>he</b> had of the England captaincy. Fender played in the first two Tests, without much success, and was dropped; he played only one more Test in his career. Gilligan was injured during the series, but the selectors recalled Douglas as captain rather than select Fender. When the team to tour Australia that winter was chosen, Fender was not selected, a decision which upset him deeply. Fender was married {{at the end of the}} 1924 cricket season, and in the off-season wrote about the MCC tour of Australia for the Daily Express.|$|E
50|$|Cabrera {{spent the}} entire 2004 season playing in the outfield and had 13 outfield assists. In 284 total fielding <b>chances,</b> <b>he</b> {{committed}} nine errors (tied for the most among NL outfielders) and made 262 putouts.|$|R

25|$|In the Lady tasting tea example (below), Fisher {{required}} the Lady to properly categorize {{all of the}} cups of tea to justify {{the conclusion that the}} result was unlikely to result from <b>chance.</b> <b>He</b> defined the critical region as that case alone. The region was defined by a probability (that the null hypothesis was correct) of less than 5%.|$|E
60|$|With that {{swiftness}} which thought {{alone can}} compass did he weigh the odds, and judge his <b>chances.</b> <b>He</b> realized how desperate they were did he remain, {{and even as}} he thought he glanced sharply round.|$|R

25|$|In December 1995, Suazo {{tried out}} for Universidad Católica. In March of the {{following}} year {{he was part of}} the club's youth system. However, Suazo's time spent there was troubled. He did not like to practice and at any given <b>chance</b> <b>he</b> would leave the facilities and return to San Antonio. Suazo later admitted he wasted the opportunity the club gave him.|$|E
25|$|March's {{novels are}} {{psychological}} character studies that intertwine {{his own personal}} torment—deriving presumably from childhood trauma {{as well as from}} his war experiences—with the conflicts spawned by class, family, sexual, and racial matters. March's characters, through no fault of their own, tend to be victims of <b>chance.</b> <b>He</b> writes that freedom can only be obtained by being true to one's nature and humanity.|$|E
