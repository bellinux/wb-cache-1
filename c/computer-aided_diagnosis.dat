25|$|Because fundoscopic {{images are}} the main sources for {{diagnosis}} of diabetic retinopathy, manually analyzing those images can be time-consuming and unreliable, as the ability of detecting abnormalities varies by years of experience. Therefore, scientists have explored developing <b>computer-aided</b> <b>diagnosis</b> approaches to automate the process, which involves extracting information about the blood vessels and any abnormal patterns {{from the rest of}} the fundoscopic image and analyzing them.|$|E
25|$|Computer-aided {{detection}} (CADe), {{also called}} <b>computer-aided</b> <b>diagnosis</b> (CADx), are systems that assist {{doctors in the}} interpretation of medical images. Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, and ultrasound diagnostics yield {{a great deal of information}} that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.|$|E
25|$|Computer-aided {{detection}} (CADe) {{systems are}} usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. <b>Computer-aided</b> <b>diagnosis</b> (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense {{structures in the}} soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions {{about the condition of}} the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.|$|E
40|$|Goal: Most {{state-of-the-art}} <b>computer-aided</b> endoscopic <b>diagnosis</b> methods require pixelwise labeled data {{to train}} various {{supervised machine learning}} models. However, it is a tedious and time-consuming work to collect sufficient precisely labeled image data. Fortunately, we can easily obtain huge endoscopic medical reports including the diagnostic text and images, which {{can be considered as}} weakly labeled data. Methods: In this paper, ourmotivation is to design a new <b>computer-aided</b> endoscopic <b>diagnosis</b> system without human specific labeling; in comparison with most state of the arts, ours only depends on the endoscopic images with weak labels mined from the diagnostic text. To achieve this, we first cast the endoscopic image folder and included images as bag and instances and represent each instance based on the global bag-of-words model. We then adopt a feature mapping scheme to represent each bag by mining the most suspicious lesion instance from each positive bag automatically. In order to achieve self-online updating from sequential new coming data, an online metric learning method is used to optimize the bag-level classification. Results: Our <b>computer-aided</b> endoscopic <b>diagnosis</b> system achieves an AUC of 0. 93 on a new endoscopic image dataset captured from 424 volunteers with more than 12 k images. Conclusion: The system performance outperforms other state of the arts when we mine the most positive instances from positive bags and adopt the online phase to mine more information from the unseen bags. Significance: We present the first weakly labeled endoscopic image dataset for <b>computer-aided</b> endoscopic <b>diagnosis</b> and a novel system that is suitable for use in clinical settings...|$|R
