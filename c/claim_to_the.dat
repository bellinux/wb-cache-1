5|$|By 1139, an {{invasion}} of England by Robert and Matilda appeared imminent. Geoffrey and Matilda had secured much of Normandy and, together with Robert, spent {{the beginning of the}} year mobilising forces for a cross-Channel expedition. Matilda also appealed to the papacy at the start of the year; her representative, Bishop Ulger, put forward her legal <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English throne on the grounds of her hereditary right and the oaths sworn by the barons. Arnulf of Lisieux led Stephen's case, arguing that because Matilda's mother had really been a nun, her <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne was illegitimate. The Pope declined to reverse his earlier support for Stephen, but from Matilda's perspective the case usefully established that Stephen's claim was disputed.|$|E

5|$|After Alfred's {{death in}} 899, Æthelwold disputed the throne with Alfred's son, Edward the Elder. As senior ætheling (prince {{of the royal}} dynasty {{eligible}} for kingship), Æthelwold had a strong <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne. He attempted to raise an army to support his claim, {{but was unable to}} get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Viking-controlled Northumbria, where he was accepted as king. In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex, where he was also accepted as king.|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Belaur, a brother of Michael Asen III, rebelled in Vidin, {{probably}} {{in support of his}} deposed nephew Ivan Stefan's <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne. The advance of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos against Bulgaria in the summer of 1332 protracted military operations against the rebels. The Byzantines overran Bulgarian-controlled northeastern Thrace, but Ivan Alexander rushed southward with a small army and swiftly caught up with Andronikos III at Rusokastro.|$|E

5|$|By 1200, the Swiss plateau {{comprised}} the dominions {{of the houses}} of Savoy, Zähringer, Habsburg, and Kyburg. Some regions (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, later known as Waldstätten) were accorded the Imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes. With the extinction of its male line in 1263 the Kyburg dynasty fell in AD 1264; then the Habsburgs under King Rudolph I (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) laid <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern Swiss plateau.|$|E

After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, Clarice Strozzi. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected Pope Clement VII in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence, where she lived in state.

British administration was restored {{two months later}} {{at the end of}} the Falklands War. Most Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory, but its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom.|$|E
