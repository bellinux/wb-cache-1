500|$|In 1865–66, Gilbert {{collaborated with}} Charles Millward on several pantomimes, {{including}} one called Hush-a-Bye, Baby, On the Tree Top, or, Harlequin Fortunia, King Frog of Frog Island, and the Magic Toys of Lowther Arcade (1866). Gilbert's first solo success came {{a few days}} after Hush-a-Bye Baby premiered. His friend and mentor, Tom Robertson, was asked to write a pantomime but did not think he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the two weeks available, and so he recommended Gilbert instead. Written and rushed to the stage in 10 days, Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack, a burlesque of Gaetano Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, proved extremely popular. This led to a long series of further Gilbert opera burlesques, pantomimes and farces, full of awful puns (traditional in burlesques of the period), though showing, at times, signs of the satire that would later be a defining part of Gilbert's work. For instance: ...|$|E
500|$|Markus and McFeely {{wanted to}} adapt Ed Brubaker's Winter Soldier storyline from the comics, which they {{described}} as [...] "the tone of Cap’s modern franchise", {{but it took}} the duo six months to convince themselves that they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of The First Avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values {{in the new world}} he was living in, with Markus saying, [...] "If you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics everything is going to seem like a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth." [...] Three Days of the Condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.|$|E
500|$|Connie Talbot {{entered the}} public eye appearing, aged six, on the first series of the reality {{programme}} Britain's Got Talent, reaching the final. After briefly recording with Sony BMG, Talbot was signed to Rainbow Recording Company, {{an offshoot of the}} label Rhythm Riders made specifically for her. To produce Over the Rainbow, Talbot worked with John Arnison, then-manager to Gabrielle and Billy Ocean, and Marc Marot, a former managing director of Island Records. It was produced and mixed by Simon Hill and Rob May. A recording schedule was worked out so that Talbot could continue with her normal school activities while recording the album in her aunt Vicky's spare bedroom, which her mother described as [...] "a better solution" [...] than the one offered by Sony BMG, [...] "which has not robbed her of her childhood". Talbot said that [...] "it was just amazing that we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> my auntie's house". Arnison and Marot asked the Talbot family to [...] "write down a list of the songs that Connie would sing at her birthday party" [...] to help choose the track listing, and then [...] "thought long and hard" [...] about including more adult songs on the album. Talbot herself insisted that they should.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a way that also {{sent a message to}} the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ... This is a man with amazing instincts." ...|$|E
2500|$|The concept {{behind the}} IDL (though not the IDL itself, {{which did not}} yet exist) appears as a plot device in Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days (1873). The main protagonist, Phileas Fogg, travels eastward around the world. He had bet with his friends that he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 80 days. To win the wager, Fogg must return by 8:45pm on Saturday, 21 December 1872. However, the journey suffers a series of delays and when Fogg reaches London, it's 8:50pm on Friday, 20 December, {{although}} he believes it's Saturday, 21 December {{and that he has}} lost the wager by a margin of only five minutes. The next day, however, it is revealed that the day is Saturday, not Sunday, and Fogg arrives at his club just in time to win the bet. Verne explains: ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It is {{very fair}} indeed,' said the sister, {{scarcely}} moving her lips in her great attention. 'Now again, and again, and again. How <b>could</b> you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the time!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a chance, boys," [...] {{suddenly}} exclaimed Flinders, [...] "to pay off old {{scores with}} a tree-mendous wallopin'! We <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> aisy <b>in</b> {{five or six}} minutes, an' then lave 'im to think over {{it for the rest}} of his life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t {{think we}} <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> that time, sir. We {{should have had}} to keep within an oar’s-length of the rocks, and so must have progressed very slowly. Besides, we might have staved in the boat at any moment.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the light}} is good enough," [...] she answered, taking no notice of the compliment. [...] "Besides, this is such easy work I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I should say, sir, {{that if you}} {{had five}} vessels you <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> two trips. Meanwhile I wish you would give me another thirty men to {{strengthen}} the garrison.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] {{urged the}} Scarecrow, in a comforting voice, [...] "such a {{transformation}} doesn't last always, {{and as a}} general thing there's some way to break the enchantment. I'm sure Glinda <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> a jiffy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had no opportunity," [...] says she, [...] "to {{speak to}} her alone, and I <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> company; if I could have spoken but two words to her alone, I would have thrown myself at her foot, and asked her blessing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it {{is a sort}} of marble, I think. We had the underpart of {{the slab}} on our side, and I did not think of looking when we took it down.

5000|$|The song {{appears as}} a reminiscence by [...] "Gus the Theatre Cat", who [...] "once played Growltiger - <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again". <b>In</b> most productions, the actor who plays Gus then becomes Growltiger, while Gus's {{companion}} Jellylorum becomes Growltiger's love interest, Griddlebone. Growltiger's crew of cats is played by male members of the troupe with pirate accoutrements over their cat costumes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas! Peregrine, supposing I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> good faith, {{would you}} become a mere tricksy sprite, {{a thing of the}} elements, and yield up your hopes as a Christian soul, a child of God and heir of Heaven?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Billy answered, {{feeling that}} I was {{entering}} {{into the spirit}} of the thing, [...] "if we start each morning just before daylight and paddle hard till moonlight, we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> five days and a half." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] cried Patty breathlessly, [...] "please, Mr. Harmer, I {{have the}} {{interview}} here. I thought perhaps I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Clifford's place, and I {{went out to}} Mr. Reid's and saw Mr. Reefer. He was very kind and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take <b>it</b> up <b>in</b> {{the tree}} with me? Why, how you talk. Of course I didn't. No man <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that. <b>It</b> fell <b>in</b> the tree {{when it came}} down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll drive, as usual," [...] said Kate calmly. [...] "I'd {{feel more}} at home in that way of locomotion. We'll borrow Jim Nash's father's democrat, and take the ponies. We'll put on old clothes, raincoats, rubber caps and boots, and we'll start tomorrow. In an {{ordinary}} time we <b>could</b> easily <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> six days or less, but this fall we'll probably need ten or twelve." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{is nothing}} I have more {{intended}} to know--some day or other. But the moss 'would always be there'; {{and then it}} was so beautiful, and so difficult to examine, that one <b>could</b> only <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> some quite separated time of happy leisure--which came not. I never was like to have less leisure than now, but I will know what moss is, if possible, forthwith.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! do look at Miss Oriel's bonnet {{the next}} time you see her.

6000|$|... 'If we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> something, sir, that wasn't quite boiling,' {{suggested}} Brass humbly, 'perhaps {{it would}} be better.

6000|$|... "'Well thought of!' I said. 'It is {{a hundred}} and seventy miles. A courier with relays of horses <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> three days, without difficulty; and might be back here again, with Drummond's servant, in another four days.

6000|$|Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. [...] "Lecoq was {{a miserable}} bungler," [...] he said, in an angry voice; [...] "he {{had only one}} thing to {{recommend}} him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid." ...|$|R

60|$|Then {{there were}} Teeka's great teeth, not so {{large as the}} males, of course, but still mighty, {{handsome}} things by comparison with Tarzan's feeble white ones. And her beetling brows, and broad, flat nose, and her mouth! Tarzan had often practiced making his mouth into a little round circle and then puffing out his cheeks while he winked his eyes rapidly; but {{he felt that he}} <b>could</b> never <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the same cute and irresistible way <b>in</b> which Teeka <b>did</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R

The actual Outcasts have not taken part in any of these murders and wonder who <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> their name.
