25|$|In a {{convection}} heater, {{the heating}} element heats {{the air in}} contact with it by thermal conduction. Hot air is less dense than cool air, so it rises due to buoyancy, allowing more cool air to flow in to take its place. This sets up a <b>convection</b> <b>current</b> of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil. They are ideally suited for heating a closed space. They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters.|$|E
2500|$|As the sun sets, the <b>convection</b> <b>current</b> reverses and an {{offshore}} flow ensues causing a land breeze.

2500|$|Because of Milwaukee's {{proximity}} to Lake Michigan, a <b>convection</b> <b>current</b> forms around mid-afternoon in light wind, {{resulting in the}} so-called [...] "lake breeze" [...] – a smaller scale version of the more common sea breeze. The lake breeze is most common between the months of March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually , with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Residents refer to this phenomenon with the phrase [...] "cooler by the lake". Because Milwaukee's official climate site, General Mitchell International Airport, is only [...] from the lake, seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.|$|E
2500|$|PLUME – this is magma {{associated}} with the plume itself and is similar to magmas from other ocean islands within the Pacific. It has the characteristics of intermediate Strontium (Sr), Neodymium (Nd) and Lead (Pb) ratios. The PLUME lavas are found predominately in {{the west of the}} islands, around Ferdinandina and Isabela Islands, which is near to the current position of the hotspot. The PLUME lavas erupted on Fernandina and Isabela are relatively cool. Analysis shows that they are as much as 100 degrees Celsius cooler than those in Hawaii. The cause of this is not fully understood but may be due to cooling in the lithosphere or being relatively cool at formation in the mantle. They are then found in lower quantities in a horseshoe pattern north and south of the central islands mixing with the other reservoirs as it progresses east. PLUME lavas are also found in the lavas from the Galapagos Spreading Centre due to convection and mixing of all of these lavas. In the upper mantle convection currents bring in mantle material at shallow angles from the south of the Galapagos Spreading Centre. [...] These <b>convection</b> <b>current</b> will draw in some PLUME type magma to the spreading centre where it is then erupted.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{demonstrate}} optical trapping and manipulation of microparticles suspended in water due to laser-induced <b>convection</b> <b>currents.</b> <b>Convection</b> <b>currents</b> are generated due to laser light absorption in an {{hydrogenated amorphous silicon}} (a:Si-H) thin film.

However, for powers &# 62; 3 mW trapped particles form a ring around the beam due to two competing forces: Stokes drag and thermo-photophoretic forces.

It is now thought likely that there are three possible driving mechanisms for plate tectonics. In addition to movement of mantle <b>convection</b> <b>currents</b> as shown in this demonstration, scientists also consider the mass of the subducted plate (the sinking slab) at the subduction zone dragging the surface part of the plate across the surface and the new plate material sliding off the higher oceanic ridges at constructive margins.

In this case, the cool air brought in from the bottom by the <b>convection</b> <b>current</b> reaches the gauze {{towards the end of the}} outward {{vibration}} movement.

40|$|This {{demonstration}} {{illustrates the}} state of apparent weightlessness in free fall in the earth's gravitational field. When a candle burns, it is dependent on rising <b>convection</b> <b>currents</b> in the air around it to carry the hot combustion products up away from the candle and deliver new air with oxygen from below to the burning wick, as illustrated in Figure 1. <b>Convection</b> <b>currents</b> are dependent on gravity because the hotter combustion products are also lighter than the surrounding air and therefore will rise due to their buoyancy in the more dense air. A candle is placed inside a sealed jar containing enough air to keep the candle burning for a relatively long time. However, when the jar is dropped, and falls freely with the acceleration of gravity, the candle immediately goes out. In the frame of reference of the falling jar a state of apparent weightlessness exists, causing <b>convection</b> <b>currents</b> to cease and removing the supply of oxygen to the flame. This is true weightlessness according to General Relativity...|$|R
