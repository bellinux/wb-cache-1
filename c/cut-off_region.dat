However, higher frequency waves in many plasmas {{of the solar}} atmosphere cannot be correctly described by ideal MHD and a more accurate model is required. Here, we study the properties of small-amplitude incompressible perturbations in both the low and the high frequency ranges in plasmas composed of several ionized species. We use a multi-fluid approach and {{take into account the}} effects of collisions between ions and the inclusion of Hall's term in the induction equation. Through the analysis of the corresponding dispersion relations and numerical simulations we check that at high frequencies ions of different species are not as strongly coupled as in the low frequency limit. Hence, they cannot be treated as a single fluid. In addition, elastic collisions between the distinct ionized species are not negligible for high frequency waves since an appreciable damping is obtained. Furthermore, Coulomb collisions between ions remove the cyclotron resonances and the strict <b>cut-off</b> <b>regions</b> that are present when collisions are not taken into account.

40|$|A novel {{modeling}} {{based on}} deep learning framework which can exactly manifest {{the characteristics of}} nonlinear system is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a Deep Reconstruction Model (DRM) is defined integrating with {{the advantages of the}} deep learning and Elman neural network (ENN). The parameters of the model are initialized by performing unsupervised pretraining in a layer-wise fashion using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to provide a faster convergence rate for modeling. ENN can be used to manifest the memory effect of system. To validate the proposed approach, two different nonlinear systems are used for experiments. The first one corresponds to the Class-D power amplifier (CDPA) which operates in the ohmic and <b>cut-off</b> <b>regions.</b> According to error of time domain and spectrum, Back Propagation Neural Network model improved by RBMs (BP-RBMs) and ENN are compared of different input signals which are the simulated two-tone signal and actual square wave signal. The second system is a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) servo control system based on fuzzy PID control strategy. In terms of simulated and actual speed curves, BP-RBMs, DRM and ENN model are adopted on comparison respectively.

40|$|For {{structural}} utilisation of high-strength concrete, a {{good understanding}} of the bond and anchorage behaviours of ribbed bars in this specific material is essential. The research project aims to increase the knowledge of bond and anchorage behaviours of ribbed bars in high-strength concrete. Furthermore, the validity of the design method in Model Code 1990 aimed for normal strength concrete is investigated. An extensive experimental study was carried out to examine the bond and anchorage behaviour in high-strength concrete compared with that in normal strength concrete. Tests on four types of specimens were conducted. Detail tests and all major anchorage <b>regions</b> (support <b>regions,</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>regions</b> and splice regions) are treated. For each high-strength concrete specimen tested, a reference specimen of normal strength concrete with the same detailing was also tested. Both simple numerical modelling based on schematic bond stress-slip relationships and more complex non-linear finite element modelling were used to complement the experiments. The study showed that the bond and anchorage behaviours were similar in both concrete types, and governed by the same phenomena. The bond strength in well-confined concrete increased linearly with the concrete compressive strength. Furthermore, high-strength concrete gave a much stiffer local bond stress-slip relationship than normal strength concrete. If the yield capacity of the reinforcing steel was reached, the local bond resistance decreased substantially, especially in high-strength concrete. Schematic local relationships between bond stress and slip are proposed for anchorage in confined normal strength and high-strength concrete; these take into account the bond deterioration when the yield capacity of the reinforcement steel is reached or exceeded. Although the anchorage capacity of a high-strength concrete specimen was higher than that of a comparable normal strength one, the increase was not in proportion to the rise in compressive strength, unlike the local bond strength under well-confined conditions. However, the high-strength concrete showed less capacity for stress redistribution, both along anchorage or lap lengths and between bars anchored in the same region. This can result in premature and brittle failures, unless compensated by a sufficient amount of stirrups. The design method examined usually gave results on the safe side when compared with test results. However, the scatter was large and there was a tendency for the safety to decrease with greater concrete strength...|$|R

There exist various approaches to approximating the correct genomewide p -values under various assumptions, either by way of asymptotics or simulations.

The test statistics are assumed to arise from a mixture of distributions under the null and non-null hypotheses. We fit the mixture distribution using both a nonparametric approach and commingling analysis, and then apply the local false discovery rate to select <b>cut-off</b> points for <b>regions</b> to be declared interesting.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new gallium nitride (GaN) based transistor technology for electronic switching applications. Conventional GaN based transistors {{are of the}} high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) type and are depletion mode devices. These are not suitable for switching applications since an extra DC supply is required to bias the device in the <b>cut-off</b> (off-state) <b>region</b> and the devices are not fail-safe, i. e. incase of malfunction a short-circuit can exist between the main DC supply and ground. Enhancement mode (E-Mode) or normally-off devices can overcome these limitations and if realized in the GaN material system would benefit from the good material properties that support large breakdown voltages and low On-resistances. Fabrication of high performace E-mode GaN devices with low On-resistance and high breakdown voltage still remains a big challenge to date. In this thesis a new method for realizing enhancement mode aluminium gallium nitride - gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN) devices using a localized gate-foot oxidation has been described. Thermal oxidation of the AlGaN barrier layer converts the top surface/part of this layer into aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) and gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3), which serve as a good gate dielectric and improve the gate leakage current by several orders of magnitude compared to a Schottky gate. The oxidation process leaves a thinner AlGaN barrier which can result in normally o§ operation. Without special precaution, however, the oxidation of the AlGaN barrier is not uniform from the top but occurs at higher rates at the defect/dislocation sites. This {{makes it impossible to}} control the barrier thickness and so rendering the barrier useless. To avoid the problem of non-uniform oxidation, a thin layer of aluminum is first deposited on the barrier layer and oxidized to form aluminium oxide on top. This additional oxide layer seems to ensure uniform oxidation of the AlGaN barrier layer underneath on subsequent further oxidation. Results of the fabricated 2 um x 100 um AlGaN/GaN MOS-HEMTs with a partially oxidized barrier layer showed a threshold voltage of - 0. 5 V (compared to - 3 V for a Schottky devive fabricated on the same epilayer structure) and a maximum drain current of 800 mA/mm at high gate bias of 5 V with very little current compression. The peak extrinsic transconductance of the device is 160 mS/mm at a drain-source voltage of 10 V with a very low specific On-resistance of 9 : 8 ohm. mm 2 and an off-state breakdown voltage higher than 42 V.

The two thresholds of relative permittivity were determined from μ− 1.5 σ and μ +  1.5 σ, where μ and σ are the average {{and standard deviations of}} relative permittivity of the old concrete bridge decks in this study. Overall, the condition map based on the dual cut-off criteria (see Fig.  14 b) appears to be more closely correlated with the visual inspection map than the condition map based on a single cut-off relative permittivity criteria (see Fig.  14 a). The most severely damaged areas of lane 2 of span 3 of JB- 3 N, and the other damaged areas on JB- 3 N, which were hardly detected in Fig.  14 a, were successfully classified as damaged areas in Fig.  14 b. It is noteworthy that the damaged areas estimated by the dual cut-off relative permittivity criteria are larger than those judged by visual inspection (especially on spans 4 and 5 on JB- 3 N). This phenomenon is related to the improved capability of GPR that is able to detect even minor damages, such as micro-cracks filled with air and/or water, which are generally missed by visual inspection. For example, the relative permittivity of the concrete was found to be larger over the concrete girders (at the vertical axes of −  9.0, −  6.6, −  4.2, −  1.8, 3.0, 5.4, and 7.8  m) and near piers (at the horizontal axes of 30 and 90  m). Those regions are subjected to tensile cracking by the negative moment produced by traffic loads. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the relative permittivity data of GPR signals based on the surface reflection method could be a good indicator of the concrete damage, especially on the surface or sub-surface regions. Deteriorated concrete regions with greater porosity and/or surface-breaking cracks (or concrete with high permeability) can be detected as the regions with higher or lower relative permittivity value than that of solid concrete in wet or dry, respectively, condition.|$|R
40|$|The gap {{waveguide}} {{technology for}} millimeter waves applications has been recently presented. The new structure {{is made by}} generating a parallel plate <b>cut-off</b> <b>region</b> between an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) and a metallic plate. Propagating waves will be only allowed to follow a metal ridge or groove surrounded by the AMC. The gap waveguide can be made of only metal and does not need any contact between the metal joints compared to standard waveguides. In this study, a study of Q-factors of resonators made in ridge and groove gap waveguides are presented. The resonators are made of copper and the AMC used is a textured surface of metallic pins. Simulated and measured unloaded Qs are presented and compared with Q of a standard rectangular waveguide. High Q-factors are measured for the prototypes presented, approaching 90 - 96 % of the simulated values. Furthermore, it is shown how the lid of pins can easily stop the leakage loss at the joints of the circuit, which is the typical cause of reduced Q-factor of standard waveguides at high frequency...|$|E
