Therefore, banks are essential when trade is intense and monitoring is limited.

Style was launched at the beginning of 1982 and followed the lines of other credit cards with no interest incurred for prompt monthly payment. Otherwise, minimum monthly payments could be made {{over a period of time}} thereby incurring interest charges.|$|E
50|$|In 1717, Boston {{learned that}} {{disaster}} had {{struck in the}} West Indies. The Spanish attacked and destroyed the British settlement at Trist in the Bay of Campeche, where Boston merchants had long extracted log wood for sale in England and Europe. Boston's economy was sent into a tailspin. Ship orders decreased and confidence in long-term <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> plummeted triggering an unprecedented amount of lawsuits. Boston's economic catastrophe in 1717 {{led to the creation}} of new currency and credit laws that directly affected how merchants and tradesmen in the shipbuilding industry conducted business. This meant more stringent lending practices to trustworthy tradesmen and a stronger, more transparent industry that continued to dominate the Atlantic economy.|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{retention}} of title ("ROT") clauses {{is to ensure that}} where goods are supplied on credit, if the buyer subsequently goes into bankruptcy, the seller can repossess the goods. They are often seen as a natural extension of the credit economy; where suppliers are expected to sell goods on credit, there is a reasonable expectation that if they are not paid {{they should be able to}} repossess the goods. Nonetheless, in a number of jurisdictions, insolvency regimes or <b>credit</b> <b>arrangement</b> regimes prevent title retention clauses from being enforced where doing so would upset administration of the regime.|$|R

50|$|Alongside fiat money, credit money also develops. Credit money, {{although}} {{expressed in}} currency units, does not consist of money tokens. It consists rather of financial claims, including {{of all kinds}} of debt certificates (promissory notes) which entitle the holder to future income under contractually specified conditions. These claims can themselves be traded for profit. <b>Credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> existed already in the ancient world, but there was no very large-scale trade in debt obligations. In the modern world, the majority of money no longer consists of money tokens, but of credit money. Marx was quite aware of the role of credit money, but did not analyze it in depth. His concern was only with how the credit system directly impacted on the capitalist production process.|$|E
50|$|This {{initiative}} to extend credit to all customers {{was made in}} 1969, during a prosperous period in US history, when Grant was expanding into new areas of the US. W.T. Grant hoped to attract customers from rival Kresge and other department stores. The low number of defaults on small loans at this time meant that the <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> seemed a good idea, but {{the absence of any}} credit check, and the low minimum repayment terms were extreme, even for the times. When the economic expansion slowed in 1970/1971 the balance shifted and the credit arrangement became more of a liability than an asset. No decision was made to change or halt this before 1974, by which time the company's collapse was a certainty.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Ramos succeeded Corazon Aquino in 1992, the Philippine economy was already {{burdened}} {{with a heavy}} budget deficit. This was largely the result of austerity measures imposed by a standard <b>credit</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the International Monetary Fund and the destruction caused by natural disasters such as the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Hence, according to Canlas, pump priming through government spending was immediately ruled out due to the deficit. Ramos therefore resorted to institutional changes through structural policy reforms, of which included privatization and deregulation. He sanctioned {{the formation of the}} Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), which served as a forum for consensus building, {{on the part of the}} Executive and the Legislative branches, on important bills on economic policy reform measures (4).|$|R
50|$|During 1966-1969, then {{president}} Marcos borrowed {{a great amount}} of money to finance his domestic expansion and reforms. This expansion in the government budget led to increases in the current account deficit and crisis in the balance of payments (BOP). According to the Political Economy of Growth and Impoverishment in the Marcos Era, the Philippines' foreign debt rose from $360 million in 1962 to $26.2 billion by the end of 1985. Hence, just over a third of today's $77 billion external debt was contributed by the 20-year rule of the Marcos government. During the early 1970s, the government aimed at reviving growth and establishing an economic stabilization plan as well as a standby <b>credit</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of British credit and complicated account balancing during King William's War, in the 1690s, changed how Boston merchants financed the shipbuilding industry. As British credit flowed into the community, Boston merchants began creating long-term <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> with waterfront tradesmen and other skilled laborers. Local labor and exchanges of goods could be sustained across {{scores of people}} linked with myriad small amounts of credit and debit without cash. But the shipbuilding industry generated the labor and capital necessary for merchants to create far larger and more intricate financial networks that solidified their position of power within both the local and the Atlantic economy. The extension of credit to {{a large portion of}} society helped spur the shipbuilding boom period from 1700-1717.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} also actively encouraged {{the establishment of}} collectively owned and operated industrial and service enterprises {{as a means of}} soaking up some of the unemployment among young people {{and at the same time}} helping to increase supplies of light industrial products. Individual enterprise also was allowed, after having virtually disappeared during the Cultural Revolution, and independent cobblers, tailors, tinkers, and vendors once again became common sights in the cities. Foreign-trade procedures were greatly eased, allowing individual enterprises and administrative departments outside the Ministry of Foreign Trade (which became the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade in 1984) to engage in direct negotiations with foreign firms. A wide range of cooperation, trading and <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> with foreign firms were legalized so that China could enter the mainstream of international trade.|$|E
5000|$|Sole trader {{insolvency}} {{occurs when}} the business cannot meet financial obligations. It may be that bills cannot be paid on time, leading to debts which eventually attract legal action by creditors. Insolvency does not automatically equate to bankruptcy; definitions of insolvency are provided within the Insolvency Act 1986. [...] Cash flow insolvency occurs when a business cannot meet its credit obligations as they fall due. Balance sheet insolvency {{occurs when the}} businesses’ liabilities exceed its assets. According to Business Link {{there are a number}} of factors that can lead to sole trader insolvency. These can include late invoicing for goods or services, accepting orders that exceed its financial capacity to deliver, failure to recover debts, excess inventory and unsuitable <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> and often personal drawings taken in excess of profit.|$|E
