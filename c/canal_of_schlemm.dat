40|$|The bulk of aqueous humour outflow {{resistance}} is generated {{in or near}} the inner wall endothelium <b>of</b> <b>Schlemm's</b> <b>canal</b> in normal eyes, and probably also in glaucomatous eyes. Fluid flow through this region is controlled by the location of the giant vacuoles and pores found in cells of the endothelium <b>of</b> <b>Schlemm's</b> <b>canal,</b> but the flow resistance itself is more likely generated either in the extracellular matrix of the juxtacanalicular connective tissue or the basement membrane <b>of</b> <b>Schlemm's</b> <b>canal.</b> Future studies utilizing in vitro perfusion studies of inner wall endothelial cells may give insights into the process by which vacuoles and pores form in this unique endothelium and why inner wall pore density is greatly reduced in glaucoma. Keywords glaucoma; Schlemm's canal; hydraulic conductivity It has been recognized for more that 130 years that the elevated pressure characteristic of primary open-angle glaucoma arises due to an increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous humour from the eye. (Leber, 1873) However, a conclusive determination of where in the outflow pathways this elevated outflow {{resistance is}} generated has been elusive. Surprisingly, the locus of aqueous humour outflow resistance in the normal eye has also been not been unequivocally determined. Seidel (1921) using light microscopy, stated ‘that the inner wall <b>of</b> <b>Schlemm's</b> <b>canal</b> stand in open communication with the anterior chamber, and that the aqueous humour directly washes around the inner wall endothelium <b>of</b> <b>Schlemm's</b> <b>canal</b> and is only separated from the lumen <b>of</b> <b>Schlemm's</b> <b>canal</b> by a thin, outer membrane’. Our view is little different today. The locus of outflow resistance, both in the normal eye and the glaucomatous eye, is thought to arise either in the endothelial lining <b>of</b> <b>Schlemm's</b> <b>canal,</b> or very near to this location.

Analysis of sectioned human and canine eyes showed Ngb and Cygb IR in the corneal epithelium and endothelium.

In the iridocorneal angle, Ngb and Cygb were detected in endothelial cells of the trabecular meshwork and <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Schlemm</b> in human. In the ciliary body, Ngb and Cygb IR was localized to the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium of the pars plana and pars plicata and in ciliary body musculature.
