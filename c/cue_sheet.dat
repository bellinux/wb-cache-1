"Til It Happens to You" [...] won {{the award}} for Best Song in a Documentary, at the 2015 Hollywood Music in Media Awards, {{which took place in}} November 11, 2015, for Best Original Song at the 20th Satellite Awards, and for Best Song from a Movie at the 3rd iHeartRadio Music Awards. Other {{nominations}} for the song came from 21st Critics' Choice Awards and the St. Louis Film Critics Association (StLFCA), where it was listed for Best Song category, from Georgia Film Critics Association and Denver Film Critics Society in the category for Best Original Song, and from the 58th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Song Written for Visual Media. [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] also received a nomination for an Academy Award in the category of Best Original Song for the 2016 ceremony. It is the fifth song from a documentary to be listed for an award in that category. Gaga dedicated the nomination to survivors of sexual assault, through a message on her Twitter account. In February 2016, Gaga and Warren were honored at the 11th Annual Los Angeles Italia Film, Fashion and Art Fest, with the festival's Song of the Year Award. The song also won an award at the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, however, just Warren was credited because of their <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> accreditation requirement. With its nomination, [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] became the first song ever to be nominated at the Grammys, Oscars and Emmys in the same year.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} sought-after {{unreleased}} music cues from the film is the one where Williams provides low-key lounge music during a party prior to the announcement of a fire. O’Halloran orders Duncan to evacuate the party; the music becomes louder as Lisolette and Harlee are seen dancing and Duncan lectures son-in-law Roger. [...] Titled [...] "The Promenade Room" [...] on the conductor's <b>cue</b> <b>sheet,</b> the track features a ragged ending as Duncan asks the house band to stop playing. Because of this, Film Score Monthly could not add this cue to the expanded soundtrack album.|$|E

2500|$|Zimmer is {{also noted}} {{for his work}} on the scores of Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008), on which he collaborated with James Newton Howard. For the soundtrack of The Dark Knight, Zimmer decided to {{represent}} the character of The Joker by a single note played on the cello by his long-time colleague Martin Tillman. Zimmer commented [...] "I wanted to write something people would truly hate." [...] The scores for these films were disqualified from receiving Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score due to too many composers being listed on the <b>cue</b> <b>sheet.</b> Zimmer succeeded in reversing the decision not to nominate The Dark Knight in December 2008, arguing that the process of creating a modern film score was collaborative and {{that it was important to}} credit a range of people who had played a part in its production. Zimmer explained his approach to scoring with other musicians in an interview with Soundtrack.net in 2006: ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> {{can also}} be a list of songs {{appearing}} in a film or TV show. The <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> shows all the music titles with metadata like composers, publishers, length of use, and shares of ownership. The <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> helps determine who should be paid when the film or TV show airs.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} {{is for the}} audio player to support the <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> directly. This may involve providing a new playlist (for example, an extra window) for {{the contents of the}} <b>cue</b> <b>sheet,</b> or adding an entry for each track directly into the main playlist.|$|E

50|$|A common {{workaround}} is {{to encode}} consecutive tracks as one single file, relying on <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> (or something similar) for navigation. While this method results in gapless playback within consecutive tracks, {{it can be}} unwieldy because of the possibly large size of the resulting compressed file. Furthermore, unless the playback software or hardware can recognize the <b>cue</b> <b>sheets,</b> navigating between tracks may be difficult.|$|R

They are especially useful when dividing audio stored in a single file into multiple songs or tracks.

500|$|Official musical accompaniment for {{works of}} this period were very rare and only one studio, Vitagraph, {{regularly}} made suggestions available to exhibitors. Thanhouser's musical scores were an exception in 1914, but the scores would only be created for the [...] "Thanhouser Big Productions" [...] such as Joseph in the Land of Egypt. In 1913 and 1914, <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> or musical suggestions could be obtained inexpensively through various industry sources and retained their dominance. Given that these <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> were prepared without any specific film in mind, the music would be chosen to match the themes of the film.

5000|$|In {{trying to}} {{establish}} who was the composer of any given film, Clifford McCarty consulted a variety of sources. The two primary sources were the music scores themselves and the music <b>cue</b> <b>sheets.</b> <b>Cue</b> <b>sheets</b> were the legal documents reporting the musical contents of a sound film. They tend to vary on level of detail, but most include the title of cue or name of a musical composition, its composer, and its publisher. They also include information on instrumental and vocal music, background and visual, and their duration measured in minutes and seconds. Their limitations are that they tend not to distinguish between original and preexisting music, and that they credit the original composer and not the one responsible for the adaptation. [...] McCarty also used secondary sources, particularly when the primary sources were long lost or unavailable to him.|$|R
5000|$|Although the <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> that {{listed the}} [...] "Shuckatoom" [...] theme {{indicated}} {{it was published}} by Markwater Music and licensed through BMI, the tune was never made available separate from the show itself.

25|$|Although The Birth of a Nation is {{commonly}} {{regarded as a}} landmark for its dramatic and visual innovations, its use of music was arguably no less revolutionary.

5000|$|Soon thereafter, [...] "Hearts and Flowers" [...] (along with Gustav Lange's [...] "Flower Song") {{became more}} {{commonly}} associated with underscoring an over-the-top parody of melodrama in film.

50|$|Patterned {{after the}} National Geographic Society, and the Institute of the American Musical (Miles Kreuger, Founder and President) in Hollywood, The Film Music Society has sought broad {{public support for}} a mission of {{national}} scope: to preserve for posterity the mostly unpublished materials created in the composition, orchestration, and recording of American motion picture music or film music — Sheet Music (composers' manuscripts, orchestrations, orchestra parts), recordings (disc, tape, soundtracks), and documents (<b>cue</b> <b>sheets,</b> contracts, correspondence).|$|R

Other major films for which he contributed scores include The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Three Musketeers, Little Lord Fauntleroy (all 1921), and Romola (1924).

50|$|DJs often {{distribute}} their recorded mixes on CD-Rs or as {{digital audio}} files via websites or podcasts for promotional purposes. Many popular DJs release their mixes commercially on a compact disc.

50|$|The {{practice}} is also common in television, as composers listed on <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> {{are entitled to}} music royalties every time an episode or theme score appears on television. An 1998 investigation by The Hollywood Reporter revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as Saban Entertainment, DiC, Ruby-Spears Productions and Hanna-Barbera, which often listed company executives as musicians {{for the purpose of}} royalties. Several composers later filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Saban Entertainment president Haim Saban, for allegedly taking ownership and credit for their musical compositions.|$|R
