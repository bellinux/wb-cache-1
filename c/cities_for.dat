5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} {{made peace with}} China when it opened border <b>cities</b> <b>for</b> trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid.

However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E

5|$|As {{the fifth}} book begins, the setting shifts briefly to North America. Following the Ural War, the Japanese had led an Asian {{occupation}} of western North America. The local populations, inspired by Native American beliefs and mythologies, react by leaving the <b>cities</b> <b>for</b> the wilderness and destroying the food factories and cities, eventually driving out the Asian occupation. In America and then globally people begin leaving cities {{in favor of}} the wild. Shamanism and the belief in ghosts reemerge amongst the populace, as does an oral tradition of story-telling. The draining of the cities grows into a settler movement: egalitarian communities that live in nature, characterized by gender equality and sexual liberation. In response to the threat this movement poses to the ruling Senates, political leaders in London hatch a plan to colonize Greenland, thereby channeling both the drive for technological innovation and the drive to settle new land.|$|E

The stadium would be built in modules, so the upper tiers could be dismounted after the championship and installed on other venues. The proposal was selected as one of four for the bid, but the bid was never sent.|$|E
