This {{led to the}} creation of large numbers of digital image libraries. Hence, the need for intuitive and effective image storage, indexing, classification and retrieval mechanisms rises. In this paper, an enhancement on the use of color and texture visual features in Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is proposed by adding a new color feature called Average <b>Color</b> <b>Dominance</b> which tries to enhance color description using the dominant colors of an image. The proposed methodology was compared with the work of Kavitha et al [1] and has shown an increase in the average precision from 40. 4 % to 45. 06 %...|$|E
30|$|The {{next stage}} filters the shots with green <b>color</b> <b>dominance.</b> This {{is done by}} setting {{rule-based}} thresholds on the RGB dominant colors of the image and their corresponding percentages. This information is directly extracted from the MPEG- 7 Dominant Color Descriptor (Sikora 2001). The third stage assesses the color homogeneity by analyzing the parameters from the MPEG- 7 Color Layout Descriptor (Sikora 2001). This color descriptor reduces the input image into a tiny 8  ×  8 YCrCb image and finds the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. In the long-shot view, soccer players are represented with few pixels; therefore the players can be removed. This procedure provides a uniform green image in the long-shot scenario {{in contrast to the}} mid-shot case. Consequently the system analyzes the homogeneity in the green color by calculating the variance of the first nine alternate coefficients of DCT chromas and comparing them with a low threshold. The keyframes’ variances that are below the threshold are marked as belonging to a long-shot view. The results from a total of 373 keyframes coming from the groundtruth A achieve a recall of 80.20 % and a precision of 96.25 %.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dimensional {{dominance}} {{was assessed}} by having kindergarten children make similarities judgments about geometric figures varying in form, color, and size. Children who were classified as form dominant performed better than children who were not form dominant when given a test of letter matching ability in Experiment 1 and in repeated tests of word matching ability in Experiment 2. Data from the retest in Experiment 2 supported the hypothesis that dimensional dominance progresses from <b>color</b> <b>dominance</b> to form dominance, and then to mixed responding. When a child makes similarities judgments about stimuli, it is frequently observed that he will base his responses on one dimension more than on other dimensions. For example, a child may be presented a large red circle, a small blue circle, and a large blue triangle and asked "which two {{of these things are}} the same or most alike? " If he picks the two circles, he has made a form response, if he picks the two blue items, a color response, and if he picks the large items, a size response. The consistent tendency for subjects to select a single dimension has been referred to as "dimensional dominance " (Smiley & Weir, 1966); "dimensional preference" (Seitz & Weir, 1971); and "dimensional salience " (Odom & Guzman, 1972). Odom and Guzman (1972) suggested that for a multidimensional set of stimuli, there is a specific order in which the dimensions will be cognitively evaluated and this ordering is referred to as a hierarchy. In addition, they provided cross-sectional developmental data indicating that there may be characteristic dimensional hierarchies for given age levels. This ordering of stimulus dimensions is conceptually similar to the proposal of several attention theorists (e. g., Trabasso & Bower, 1968; Zeaman & House, 1963) who suggest that if such a hierarchy were known for eac...|$|E
40|$|The frequency, {{magnitude}} and persistence of cyanobacteria bloom events are increasing worldwide {{and can be}} attributed to many factors associated with urban, industrial and agricultural expansion (Pittman and Pittman 2005; Ahern et al. 2006 b). In Florida, filamentous cyanobacteria of the genus Lyngbya was first observed in the early 1990 s, first documented on the southernmost extent of Broward County reefs in 2002, and have since progressed northward into West Palm Beach County (Paul et al. 2005; Tichenor 2005). Previously, cyanobacteria would appear during the summer months, however they began surviving through the winter in 2003. The two main species of Lyngbya affecting Broward County have been identified through morphological and molecular methods as Lyngbya confervoides and Lyngbya polychroa, neither of which have been established as toxic (Paul et al. 2005). The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the patterns of Lyngbya spp. presence along the southeast coast of Florida from the period of May 2004 to September 2005. Digital photographs are used to analyze the Lyngbya bloom and describe the geographical variability of Lyngbya spp. presence along a north-south and east-west gradient. Preferential relationships between Lyngbya spp. and affected reef organisms are investigated and correlations based on physical parameters of the study site are examined. Lyngbya presence is dominant in the south corridor, middle and inner reef tracts, and the crest zone of the sites evaluated in this study. Further investigation is needed to compare possible nutrient sources on the reefs to determine if a connection exists between nutrient loads and blooms. Attachment correlations exist between Lyngbya and the algae substratum as well as Lyngbya and soft corals. Lyngbya prefer to attach to live reef and do not prefer to settle on bare substrate. Areas with high live reef cover were conducive to Lyngbya settlement and proliferation. Lyngbya color variations exist within the bloom. Patterns of <b>color</b> <b>dominance</b> along the ecological gradients of the study sites exist and may provide insight into the length of blooms as well as the stage of the bloom at a given time. The overgrowth and proliferation of cyanobacteria along the coast of Broward County should raise cause for concern because of the negative effects the blooms cause to soft coral assemblages. Lyngbya is capable of nitrogen fixation which gives it a competitive edge for survival. The secondary metabolites produced by the cyanobacteria make it unpalatable to most herbivores so it can continue to grow unchecked in a reef system unless other factors play a role. The presence and persistence of Lyngbya may continue to worsen with time if the full nature of the blooms is not understood...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{dominance}} relation under a stochastic setting. Let S be {{a set of}} n colored stochastic points in R^d, {{each of which is}} associated with an existence probability. We investigate the problem of computing the probability that a realization of S contains inter-color dominances, which we call the <b>colored</b> stochastic <b>dominance</b> (CSD) problem. We propose the first algorithm to solve the CSD problem for d= 2 in O(n^ 2 ^ 2 n) time. On the other hand, we prove that, for d ≥ 3, even the CSD problem with a restricted color pattern is #P-hard. In addition, even if the existence probabilities are restricted to be 1 / 2, the problem remains #P-hard for d ≥ 7. A simple FPRAS is then provided to approximate the desired probability in any dimension. We also study a variant of the CSD problem in which the dominance relation is considered with respect to not only the standard basis but any orthogonal basis of R^d. Specifically, this variant, which we call the free-basis <b>colored</b> stochastic <b>dominance</b> (FBCSD) problem, considers the probability that a realization of S contains inter-color dominances with respect to any orthogonal basis of R^d. We show that the CSD problem is polynomial-time reducible to the FBCSD problem in the same dimension, which proves the #P-hardness of the latter for d ≥ 3. Conversely, we reduce the FBCSD problem in R^ 2 to the CSD problem in R^ 2, by which an O(n^ 4 ^ 2 n) time algorithm for the former is obtained...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an approach for defining customized color descriptors for image retrieval. In particular, a customized fuzzy dominant color descriptor is proposed {{on the basis}} of a finite collection of fuzzy colors designed specifically for a certain user. Fuzzy colors modeling the semantics of a color name are defined as fuzzy subsets of colors on an ordinary color space, filling the semantic gap between the color representation in computers and the subjec-tive human perception. The design of fuzzy colors is based on a collection of color names and corresponding crisp representatives provided by the user. The descriptor is defined as a fuzzy set over the customized fuzzy colors (i. e. a level- 2 fuzzy set), taking into account the imprecise concept that is modelled, in which membership degrees represent the <b>dominance</b> of each <b>color.</b> The <b>dominance</b> of each fuzzy color is calculated {{on the basis of}} a fuzzy quantifier representing the notion of dominance, and a fuzzy histogram representing as a fuzzy quantity the percentage of pixels that match each fuzzy color. The obtained descriptor can be employed in a large amount of applications. We illustrate the usefulness of the descriptor by a particular application in image retrieval...|$|R

30|$|We {{fabricated}} pristine rubrene NPs using {{a simple}} reprecipitation method. The {{color of light}} emission of the rubrene NPs changed from yellow-orange to blue with increasing hydrothermal temperatures. The diameters of filtered-up rubrene NPs increased from 350 to 890 nm with increasing hydrothermal temperatures, while those of filtered-down rubrene NPs were almost unchanged at approximately 120 nm. Hydrothermally treated (HT) rubrene NPs have size-dependent PL characteristics. Luminescence <b>color</b> and relative <b>dominance</b> of PL peaks at 464 nm to approximately 516 and 560 nm varied, depending on the hydrothermal temperature. As the hydrothermal temperature increased from 110 °C to 160 °C, the blue light emission at 464 to approximately 516 nm from filtered-down NPs was enhanced by H-type aggregation, which {{was supported by the}} optical absorption spectra. Filtered-up rubrene NPs treated at 170 °C and 180 °C exhibited blue luminescence due to the decrease of intermolecular excimer densities with the rapid increase in size.|$|R

40|$|Species that exhibit genetic color {{polymorphism}} {{are suitable}} for studying the evolutionary forces that maintain heritable phenotypic variation in nature. Male color morphs often differ in behavioral dominance, affecting the evolution of color polymorphisms. However, behavioral <b>dominance</b> among female <b>color</b> morphs has received far less attention. We studied a polymorphic population of the cichlid fish Neochromis omnicaeruleus from Lake Victoria, in which 3 distinct female color morphs coexist, black-and-white blotched (WB), orange blotched (OB), and plain (P) color morphs. First, we investigated dominance relationships among female morphs using triadic and dyadic encounters in the laboratory. In triadic encounters, both WB and OB females dominated plain, whereas WB females dominated OB females. Dominance of WB over OB was confirmed using dyadic encounters. In a second experiment, blotched (WB or OB) and plain full-sib sisters were bred by crossing a blotched and a plain parent. In dyadic encounters, WB female morphs dominated their plain sisters, suggesting that dominance of WB females is a pleiotropic effect of color or that genes coding for color and those influencing behavioral dominance are genetically linked, explaining the association between <b>color</b> and behavioral <b>dominance</b> despite gene flow. We conclude that behavioral dominance asymmetries exist among female color morphs of the fish N. omnicaeruleus, and discuss possible mechanisms that {{may account for the}} tight association between color and behavioral dominanc...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine a}} general {{framework}} for visualizing datasets of high (> 2) dimensionality, and demonstrate it using the morphology of galaxies at moderate redshifts. The distributions of various populations of such galaxies are examined {{in a space}} spanned by four purely morphological parameters. Galaxy images are taken from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC 2) in the I band (F 814 W). Since we have little prior knowledge on how galaxies are distributed in morphology space we use an unsupervised learning method (a variant of Kohonen’s Self Organizing Maps, or SOMs). This method allows the data to organize themselves onto a two-dimensional space while conserving most of the topology of the original space. It thus enables us to visualize the distribution of galaxies and study it more easily. The process is fully automated, does not rely on any kind of eyeball classification and is readily applicable to large numbers of images. We apply it {{to a sample of}} 2934 galaxies, and find that morphology correlates well with the apparent magnitude distribution and to lesser extents with <b>color</b> and bulge <b>dominance.</b> The resulting map traces a morphological sequence similar to the Hubble Sequence, albeit two dimensional. We use the SOM as a diagnostic tool, and rediscover a population of bulge-dominated galaxies with morphologies characteristic of peculiar galaxies. This is achieved without recourse to eyeball classification. We also examine the effect of noise on the resulting SOM, and conclude that down to I magnitude of 24 our results are reliable.

40|$|Across avian systems, plumage {{ornamentation}} {{is often}} considered {{a signal of}} individual fitness, condition, sex, or status, and varies due to genetics or environmental sources. In species with structural coloration, plumage variation results from differences {{in the amount of}} energy allocated to feather growth during molt, presenting a unique opportunity to study the link between individual quality and ornamentation. In cooperative breeding species, such as the Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), the role of structural color as a signal is particularly important because helpers may delay breeding for one to several years and competition for space is high. Florida Scrub-Jay juveniles are sexually dimorphic in the ultraviolet range, and plumage <b>color</b> predicts social <b>dominance</b> and condition, but not adult reproductive fitness. Little is known about the consistency of ultraviolet reflectance across molts, and I tested the following questions: 1) does plumage color change across molts within individuals; 2) how do environmental variables and stress affect structural color; and 3) does adult color or change in color predict reproductive fitness? I measured relative change in color within individuals by comparing their juvenile and first set of adult feathers after pre-basic molt. I used several measures of nutritional condition, social dynamics, habitat quality, and parasite infection to model color, and I experimentally administered corticosterone during pre-basic molt {{to examine the effects of}} increased stress on color. Plumage reflectance was compared with breeding status to investigate the role of color in breeding space acquisition. Plumage reflectance was significantly different within individuals across molts, but juvenile and adult color were correlated. Adults were significantly less bright than juveniles, with higher proportions of UV chroma and hues shifted toward UV wavelengths. Variation in feather color was best explained by sex, mass, parasite infection, and an interaction between area of oak scrub and group size. Juvenile feather color was also strongly associated with mother ID, but this was not the case for adults even though adult color was correlated with juvenile color. Adult chroma was reduced in birds treated with corticosterone, and hues were shifted toward longer wavelengths. No measure of adult color predicted acquisition of breeding space, but change in brightness and hue were significant predictors of acquisition for females, where breeders tended to experience greater reductions in brightness and shifts toward UV hues compared to helpers. This may be due to sex-specific differences in reproductive strategies in Florida Scrub-Jays. Females tend to disperse farther distances and breed earlier than males, potentially expending more energy foraying and searching for breeding space, which could reduce brightness if it is linked with condition. These results suggest that sexual selection is not a dominant factor in plumage ornamentation for Florida Scrub-Jays, and understanding the interaction between plumage color, personality, and reproductive fitness should be a priority for future research...|$|R

During {{had succeeded}} Tyndall {{to lead the}} proof that in {{completely}} clear, dust-free air the way of convergent, intensive light is not visible, is in liquids also with most careful purification after Lallemand {{the way of the}} light bundle to be always recognized. Lallemand believed that the molecules of the liquids take up and laterally disseminated the ether movement of the light that the lighting of the liquid is thus due by a luminous beam not to reflections at suspended parts, but to the lateral dispersion of the light by the molecules of the liquids. Also Soret had not succeeded it to clean water {{in such a way that}} it was on the inside illuminated by a light bundle; he believed however nevertheless that the lighting is due only to suspended materials. It, completely clear succeeded to the author, to manufacture optically empty water in which the way of a luminous beam is not visible. Also by most careful distillation water can be released not completely from clouding additions. Tap water even gave a distillate, which was cloudier, as the applied water. The filtration, in particular also by cotton wool, which cleans air perfectly, eliminated the turbidity, but did not increase it. On the other hand the production of a clear succeeded, from a light bundle did not illuminate water by the effect of a high-tension stream of small current on suspensions. In a U-pipe a suspension of silicic acid by a stream by 16 volts at the anode, predecting the silicic acid at the cathode was clarified set off perfectly. Similar results batten experiments with solutions of colloidal ferric oxide and with suspensions of zinc and cadmium hydroxide. It the complete removal of the turbidity is not based probably on the direct effect of the electrolysis, but on the coagulation of the suspended colloidal materials and thereby to cause entrainments of the turbidity. It succeeded also to make absolutely clear by chemical preparation of colloidal precipitations in water this to e. g. by Lime water in a solution of water-glass or of charring, and by formation of hydroxides of aluminum, iron, cadmium and zinc, whereby the containers must be always locked, since otherwise the water at air immediately takes up dust and thereby clouds themselves. The precipitation, which causes clarifying, must be colloidal; crystalline precipitation, like barium sulfate or calcium oxalate is almost non-active. Filtration water by colloidal precipitation clarifies the water likewise, if the filtrate does not find an opportunity to come with always dusty air into contact. Organic liquids could not be clarified by colloidal precipitations. That is partially because of it that the precipitation becomes complete only in presence of electrolytes, during the organic liquids usually no to electrolytes. The author believes that the translucence of organic liquids with more than four or five atoms carbon is to be led back not only to the mixed dust, but also to a natural Fluorescence. The translucence water after the principal matter probably not by the dust is even caused, but by finest, the dust stubborn adhering gas vesicles. These gas bubbles have different thickness and to show the most diverse spectral <b>colors,</b> even with <b>dominance</b> of the red and orange. The blue color the natural water cannot be caused therefore by selective reflection at the suspended materials. Reprinted with the permission of the American Chemical Society. Copyright © 2010.
