5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that Streeterville is bounded on the west by the Magnificent Mile, the City of <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Streeterville Organization of Active Residents, claim the boundary extends one block further to the west to Rush Street. Streeterville includes some of Chicago's tallest skyscrapers, such as the John Hancock Center, and upscale stores, hotels, and restaurants.|$|E

5|$|The torpedo bombers {{attacked}} Giffen's {{ships in}} two waves between 19:00 and 20:00. Two torpedoes hit the heavy cruiser , causing heavy damage and bringing {{her to a}} dead stop. Three of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships. In response, Halsey sent a tug to take Chicago under tow and ordered Giffen's task force to return to base the next day. Six destroyers were left behind to escort <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tugboat.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York City, they stayed {{for several days}} and an exhibition game was organised. The match was played in Brooklyn and {{was supposed to be}} New Zealand versus New York, however several New Zealanders played for New York to make up their numbers.

In San Francisco they played two matches against British Columbia; the first won 43–6 and the second 65–6. From there they sailed back to New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Compton, the {{chairman}} of the University of Chicago physics department, coordinated the uranium research of Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of <b>Chicago,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Berkeley. To remove disagreement and duplication, Compton transferred the scientists to the Metallurgical Laboratory at Chicago. Teller was left behind at first, because while he and Mici were now American citizens, they still had relatives in enemy countries. In early 1943, the Los Alamos laboratory was established in Los Alamos, New Mexico to design an atomic bomb, with Oppenheimer as its director. Teller moved there in March 1943. Apparently, Teller managed to annoy his neighbors there by playing the piano late in the night.|$|E
5|$|At her new job, Goldman met {{a fellow}} worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared {{her love for}} books, dancing, and traveling, {{as well as her}} {{frustration}} with the monotony of factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly the fallout of the 1886 Haymarket affair in <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> anti-authoritarian political philosophy of anarchism.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Landmark is a {{designation}} of the Mayor of <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Chicago City Council for historic buildings and other sites in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Listed sites are selected after meeting {{a combination of}} criteria, including historical, economic, architectural, artistic, cultural, and social values. Once a site is designated as a landmark, it {{is subject to the}} Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, which requires that any alterations beyond routine maintenance, up to and including demolition, must have their permit reviewed by the Landmarks Commission. Many Chicago Landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing federal tax support for preservation, and some are further designated National Historic Landmarks, providing additional federal oversight.|$|E

5|$|Compton {{felt that}} having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> University of California was {{creating}} too much duplication {{and not enough}} collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where {{he knew he had}} the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.|$|E
5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in <b>Chicago,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, {{a second}} Washington Park Race Track opened up in south {{suburban}} Homewood. The new Washington Park Race Track was located west of Halsted Street just outside Homewood village bounds. The Illinois Central Railroad built a spur line directly between <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> newly relocated track. The relocated track {{continued to be}} a famous and popular attraction. The inaugural meeting of organizers was July 3, 1926. The new track was constructed amongst a construction boom of racetracks in the United States during the 1920s, which included fifteen new large racetracks constructed during the decade. Others constructed at this time were Arlington Park nearby in Chicago and Hialeah Park in Florida.|$|E
