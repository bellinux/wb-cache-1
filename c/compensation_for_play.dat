5000|$|The world {{championship}} won clean and brilliantly, but, on January 8, 1957, the military dictatorship of Pedro Aramburu, {{who had taken}} power in Argentina via a coup d'état which called itself Revolución Libertadora, provisionally suspended the 1950 World Championship winners; a measure that was later made permanent on March 27 of that year[...]According to the polemic amateur article a professional sportsman can not receive money, but the Argentinean players -not USA- received economic <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>play.</b> The suspension was for allegedly violating the Amateur Sportsman Statute, as, according to the administrators who had been installed in the Argentine Basketball Federation, the players had been paid {{to play by the}} overthrown government of Juan Perón. With a young and inexperienced team, Argentina finished fourth in the 1958 South American Basketball Championship and 10th (over 13 teams) in the 1959 FIBA World Championship.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} main tournament a special Rice Gambit {{consultation}} tournament was contested on three consecutive Saturdays, April 30, May 7 and May 14. This is widely attributed to Rice's sponsorship of the main tournament. It is not clear if the players received additional <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>playing</b> in the Rice Gambit tournament {{or if it was}} considered part of their responsibilities for entering the main tournament.|$|R
50|$|Internationally, Cameroon, {{along with}} Morocco, {{was one of}} the first {{countries}} in Africa to establish a men's blind football team. They missed out on a tournament in 2014 because of visa issues. The following year, the country hosted 2015 IBSA Blind Football African Championship. Cameroon finished second and failed to qualify for the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Following the tournament, there was an extended pay dispute between the national blind sport federation and the government, and the national team over the team's <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>playing</b> in the tournament. In July 2016, the national team ranked twenty-fifth in the world.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{placed on}} the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board when [...] "captured". Capture happens when a stone or group of stones is {{surrounded}} by opposing stones on all orthogonally-adjacent points. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move; the game has no set ending conditions beyond this. When a game concludes, the territory is counted along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>playing</b> second) to determine the winner. Games may also be terminated by resignation.|$|R
50|$|Ernst Kuzorra {{was born}} {{as the son}} of Karl Kuzorra from East Prussia and his wife Bertha in the {{industrial}} town of Gelsenkirchen where his father worked as a coal miner. Ernst joined the club in 1920 at the age of 14, allegedly playing his first match in his confirmation shoes after being asked to join the team while watching from the sidelines. Three years later, he advanced to the first team, where he soon became one of the starting players. During the years 1930-31, he and thirteen teammates were banned for a relatively minor infraction of the strict amateur statutes, having received ten instead of the allowed five Reichsmark as <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>playing</b> in an away game.|$|R
50|$|On July 29, 2011, {{the first}} day teams were {{permitted}} to sign non-rookie free agents, Jackson signed his one-year Franchise offer, thus remaining a Charger. Because of his contract holdout during the 2010 NFL season, Jackson received only $583,000 in <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>playing</b> in the final six games of the season. For the 2011 season, under the franchise tag, Jackson received approximately $11.4 million, almost 20 times {{more than in the}} previous season.On Week 9, Jackson played a personal best of 141 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Green Bay Packers. He finished the season with totals of 60 catches for 1,106 yards and nine touchdowns. He was named to the Pro Bowl as an alternate for Wes Welker.|$|R
50|$|Komi (コミ) in {{the game}} of Go are points added to the score of the player with the white stones as <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>playing</b> second. Black's first move {{advantage}} is generally considered to equal somewhere between 5 and 7 points {{by the end of the}} game. Standard komi is 6.5 points under the Japanese and Korean rules; under Chinese, Ing and AGA rules standard komi is 7.5 points. Komi typically applies only to games where both players are evenly ranked. In the case of a one-rank difference, the stronger player will typically play with the white stones and players often agree on a simple 0.5 point komi to break a tie ("jigo") in favor of white.|$|R

40|$|NCAA Division I-A College Football post-season play is {{currently}} {{determined by a}} controversial BCS Bowl system. Due to the massive differences in <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>playing</b> in differing bowl games, heated debates arise every year as to who deserves places in the prestigious BCS bowl games. Without a round-robin approach, in which every team plays every other, {{there would be no}} absolute measure of which teams deserve BCS births. We developed a scenario involving a pseudo-playoff system to be implemented at the end of regular season conference play to create unique matchups to increase comparisons of teams across the nation. The system was modeled twice, once using Integer Programming techniques and again with Constraint Programming techniques. Instances of the two models were implemented on the 2010 NCAA football season and compared on their performance. Lastly, we discussed how certain matchups of the resulting solutions would have affected the outcomes of the season and perhaps the assignment of post-season bowl games...|$|R

In particular, we can remark that the common rules, in this case defined by greening, have very different impacts also in situation that, at the theoretical level, may look similar.|$|R
25|$|Cowens {{retired in}} 1980, however, in 1982 he was coaxed out of {{retirement}} by the Milwaukee Bucks, who were then coached by his former Celtics teammate Don Nelson. The Celtics still held his rights at the time so the Bucks gave up Quinn Buckner as <b>compensation.</b> Cowens <b>played</b> <b>for</b> the Bucks during the 1982–83 season before retiring for good.|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} ethical issues within the current structure of intercollegiate athletics. At present, {{one of the}} most hotly debated issues is {{the question of whether or}} not, in addition to their athletic scholarships, college athletes should receive financial <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>playing</b> in nationally televised games and having their likeness used to sell merchandise and concessions. This research investigates the issue from a philosophical perspective using an application of contractarian morality, an advanced ethical theory. Contractarianism analyzes ethical situations by viewing morality in terms of fairness of and agreeableness upon social contracts, such as the one between the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and its athletes, to and from all parties involved. This research focuses on case studies, scholarly editorial pieces, and the disaggregation of primary source data. I will argue that college athletes who appear in nationally televised games are being undercompensated for the value they bring to their respective universities. This value is comprised mainly of monetary contributions from the sale of television packages and team merchandise but also includes benefits that are hard to quantify, such as increases in their university profile. The popular argument defending the current NCAA system is that student-athletes are fairly compensated through academic scholarships and other preferential treatment. I will refute this claim. It is imperative that we address this issue from an ethical perspective so we can help the NCAA to establish future policies that preserve the sanctity of higher education and are grounded in the principles of justice and equalit...|$|R
40|$|While {{dentistry}} remains firstly {{a health}} profession, it is naive and unrealistic not to realise that business considerations and financial <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> services rendered <b>play</b> {{an important role}} in achieving a successful private practice. A fundamental principle of professional ethics in healthcare is that serving a patient's best interests should always take precedence over any consideration of profit or personal gain. George Merck, the founder of Merck Pharmaceuticals said 'Medicine is for the patient, not for the profits. The profits follow' [...] ., {{the same can be said}} for dentistry. However, since dentists are in a position to gain financially from their professional recommendations, there is a risk of their having a conflict of interest, whether actual or perceived. DHE...|$|R
50|$|In Japanese the 10-10 {{point on}} the board (i.e. the center) is called tengen. An opening play at tengen {{is a kind of}} {{experimental}} opening, and has at times in history been controversial. It may lead to what is called mirror go, in Japanese manego, in which Black imitates White by playing diagonally opposite with respect to the centre stone. There is another style, also called mirror go, where {{from the beginning of the}} game White imitates Black in a diagonally-opposite way. The first kind was interesting, for strong players, before the introduction of komidashi, i.e. <b>compensation</b> points <b>for</b> second <b>play.</b> The second kind became interesting only after the introduction of komidashi.|$|R

40|$|Professional musicians have {{unique and}} {{challenging}} information needs. The community of musicians who receive <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> their <b>playing</b> is diverse, ranging {{from those who}} rely primarily on performance for their income, to those who supplement performance income {{with other types of}} employment. In an attempt to examine information behavior among musicians, we set out to identify their primary information needs, to describe how they seek information relevant to their careers, and to determine how they utilize the varied and often conflicting information that they obtain. We’ve focused our lens on the category of “gigging ” musicians. Their information behaviors differ from those of amateur musicians, who <b>play</b> exclusively <b>for</b> pleasure, and salaried musicians, such as members of professional orchestras. Most individuals obtain information relevant to their professional activities from structures related to their workplace, but gigging musicians do not have the equivalent of an office or regular professional environment. Their information needs are very real. Where do they find places to practice and perform? How can they find new musicians to play with? How do they keep their instruments and equipment functioning? These broad, on-going demands, hindered by the changing physical environment of the gigging musician and coupled with the lack of an obvious information structure, are the focus of ou...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation in fricative–vowel syllables is phonologically mediated or {{a consequence of}} auditory processes. Smits (2001 a) had shown that <b>compensation</b> occurs <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in a fricative caused by a following rounded vowel in Dutch. In a first experiment, the possibility that compensation is due to general auditory processing was investigated using nonspeech sounds. These did not cause context effects akin to <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation, although nonspeech sounds influenced speech sound identification in an integrative fashion. In a second experiment, a possible phonological basis <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation was assessed by using audiovisual speech. Visual displays, which induced the perception of a rounded vowel, also influenced <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in the fricative. These results indicate that <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in fricative–vowel syllables is phonologically mediated. This result is discussed {{in the light of}} other compensation-for-coarticulation findings and general theories of speech perception...|$|R
