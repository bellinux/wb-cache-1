This propagation modeling takes into consideration propagation mechanisms such as reflections, penetration loss and cable termination that result from a particular environment, as well as specific <b>cable</b> <b>paths</b> that actual propagation models for radiating cable systems have not considered. The proposed modeling is carried out using three different propagation models and has been experimentally validated by sets of measurements performed in a university building in the frequency range from 900 MHz to 2. 5 GHz. A careful selection of the data sets validates the robustness of the proposed model. The results show a mean of the error less than 1 dB while the standard deviation is between 2. 2 dB and 4. 6 dB in all cases.

For each group, determine the conductor average keystone angle by subtracting the group side angles, and dividing by the number of conductors.

The cables laid between given connecting nodes. Engineering constraints impose that the energy flowing through a cable is unsplittable, i. e. the energy routed from turbines to a connecting node through different cables is then routed through a unique <b>cable</b> <b>path</b> from this node to the root. Knowing the location and production of turbines and the location, capacity and cost of all possible cables with their connecting nodes, the wind farm network design problem is to optimize the total length of required cables to install. A version of the problem including the possibility of parallel cables between connecting nodes and other constraints is studied in [4] where an approach based on integer linear programming is proposed to solve real-world instances. The problem is in closed relation with the well-know Steiner tree problem: given aweighted graph G, the K-Steiner tree problem is to find in G a minimum lengthtree S spanning a specified set T of K vertices called terminals. More precisely, the basic network design problem corresponds to the capacitated rooted K-Steiner tree problem. In our problem, the sub-station is the root of the graph and the wind turbines are the terminals. The possible cables are the edges of the graph and the connecting nodes are the Steiner nodes.

This diagnostic tool is used to nonintrusively obtain the local electron number density as well as provide information necessary for understanding impact to communications and other spacecraft electromagnetic systems. The use of a nonintrusive electromagnetic measurement provides highly accurate line integrated density and avoids problems caused by intrusive measurement techniques. If the plasma is symmetrical, local plasma density can also be determined accurately using well known inversion techniques. A network analyzer acts as a transmitter and receiver while a two axis positioning system maps the amplitude and phase variation of a transmitted signal over one plane of the plasma plume. The utilization of a 6 m× 9 m vacuum chamber effectively minimizes plasma boundary effects, but the longer <b>cable</b> <b>path</b> lengths have required a frequency conversion circuit to reduce power loss and phase uncertainty at high frequencies.

The midpoint of the two traction windings in choke transformers is connected by <b>cable,</b> supplying <b>path</b> for traction current. The flow path of GIC and traction current is consistent. What is different is that GIC is seen as quasi DC, but the frequency of traction current is 50  Hz, so two kinds of currents are independent of each other. When the GIC on two rails is asymmetric, the traction windings of choke transformers will generate the difference between two currents and interfered voltage will be formed. Interfered voltage is coupled to the signal coil; together with the reason that gap of choke transformer core is small, the more degree of asymmetry the GIC is, the more the interfered voltage will be [16]. As a result, due to the above-mentioned factors, GIC is easier to cause core saturation and DC bias of choke transformers, resulting in interference of track circuit equipments.|$|R
