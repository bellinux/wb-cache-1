For example, the U.S. NHTSA test only covers full frontal {{collision}} but does not test vehicles against an offset deformable frontal barrier. Frontal offset <b>collision</b> <b>tests</b> are a tougher to meet but are a better representation of real world collisions because it mimics the driver's instinctive reaction to swerve away from an obstacle to avoid an accident.

40|$|Abstract Dynamic environments, {{in which}} robots and for example humans {{share a common}} {{workspace}} impose a variety of requirements on path planning algorithms, including real-time capabilities and <b>collision</b> <b>tests</b> based on sensor input. We propose a randomized-roadmap-based path planning algorithm that limits the number of <b>collision</b> <b>tests</b> and distance calculations to a volume achievable in realtime, while still being able to achieve high path clearance and statistical completeness given an unlimited number of planning cycles. It does so by exploiting the knowledge about static portions of the environment using a static, collisionchecked roadmap and by interleaving planning and execution. Image-based distance measurements are induced by the graph search algorithm and interpolated to allow planning of time-optimized paths on the roadmap with a reduced number of distance measurements. 1...|$|E

40|$|Robotic motion {{planning}} {{aspires to}} match the ease and efficiency with which humans move through and interact with their environment. Yet {{state of the art}} robotic planners fall short of human abilities; they are slower in computation, and the results are often of lower quality. One stumbling block in traditional motion planning is that points and paths are often considered in isolation. Many planners fail to recognize that substantial shared information exists among path alternatives. Exploitation of the geometric and topological relationships among path alternatives can therefore lead to increased efficiency and competency. These benefits include: better-informed path sampling, dramatically faster collision checking, and {{a deeper understanding of the}} trade-offs in path selection. In path sampling, the principle of locality is introduced as a basis for constructing an adaptive, probabilistic, geometric model to influence the selection of paths for <b>collision</b> <b>test.</b> Recognizing that <b>collision</b> <b>testing</b> consumes a sizable majority of planning time and that only collision-free paths provide value in selecting a path to execute on the robot, this model provides a significant increase in efficiency by circumventing <b>collision</b> <b>testing</b> paths that can be predicted to collide with obstacles. In the area of <b>collision</b> <b>testing,</b> an equivalence relation termed local path equivalence, is employed to discover when the work of testing a path has been previously performed. The swept volumes of adjoining path alternatives frequently overlap, implying that a continuum of intermediate paths exists as well. By recognizing such neighboring paths with related shapes and outcomes, up to 90 % of paths may be tested implicitly in experiments, bypassing the traditional, expensive <b>collision</b> <b>test</b> and delivering a net 300 % boost in <b>collision</b> <b>test</b> performance. Local path equivalence may also be applied to the path selection problem in order to recognize higher-level navigation options and make smarter choices. This thesis presents theoretical and experimental results in each of these three areas, as well as inspiration on the connections to how humans reason about moving through spaces...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} define {{meaningful}} limit values for human-robot collisions, {{we have come}} to the conclusion that only comprehensive <b>collision</b> <b>tests</b> with live test subjects will successfully lead to verified limit values. A literature survey about current approaches for limiting the consequences of hazardous contacts between humans and moving machines (including robots) showed that limit values are often specified without an appropriate injury severity or without considering the variety of the human body.

40|$|The <b>collision</b> <b>test</b> {{suggested}} by H. Delgas Christiansen in 1975 {{is among the}} foremost statistical tests for random number generators. The test simulates throwing balls randomly into urns. The number of urns, m, is usually a power of 2 and the destination of a ball is determined by m bits produced by the generator being tested. When a ball falls into an urn that is already HKU CSIS Tech Report TR- 2000 - 05 occupied, a collision occurs. The <b>collision</b> <b>test</b> counts the number of collisions, c.

40|$|Many {{problems}} in robot motion planning involve collision testing {{a set of}} local paths. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel solution to this problem by exploiting the structure of paths and the outcome of previous <b>collision</b> <b>tests.</b> Our approach circumvents expensive <b>collision</b> <b>tests</b> on a given path by detecting that the entire geometry of the path has effectively already been tested on a combination of other paths. We define a homotopy-like equivalence relation among local paths to detect this condition, and we provide algorithms that (1) classify paths based on equivalence, and (2) circumvent collision testing on up to 90 % of them. We then prove both correctness and completeness of these algorithms and provide experimental results demonstrating a performance increase up to 300 % in the rate of path tests. Additionally, we apply our equivalence relation to the navigation problem in a planning algorithm that takes advantage of information gained from equivalence relationships among collision-free paths. Finally, we explore applications of path equivalence to several other mechanisms, including kinematic chains and medical steerable needles...|$|E

40|$|The {{collision}} test is {{an important}} statistical test for rejecting poor random number generators. The test simulates the throwing of balls randomly into urns. A problem in applying this test {{is to determine the}} number of urns, m, and the number of balls, n, so that the test is among the most powerful possible on a computer. The problem was tackled empirically. A set of canonical congruential generators with increasing periods was first implemented. The stringency of a test against congruential generators is measured as the number of canonical generators the test rejects. Experiments were then conducted to measure the stringencies of the <b>collision</b> <b>tests</b> for various (m, n) values. The results reveal that for a fixed m, the stringency of a test reaches maximum when m < n â‰¤ 2 m. Moreover, the stringency increases as m increases. Similar results were observed when the experiments were repeated on lagged Fibonacci generators and on shift-register generators. Further investigation showed that the variance of the number of collisions reaches maximum together with the stringencies, at n = âŽ£ 1. 256431 m âŽ¦.
