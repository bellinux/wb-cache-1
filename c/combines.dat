The optimal <b>combining</b> rule based on the maximum-likelihood criterion is derived for Rayleigh fading channels. Two <b>combining</b> schemes, a noncoherent <b>combining</b> and a coherent <b>combining,</b> {{are found to be}} merely extreme cases of the optimal <b>combining.</b> As a result of investigations on improved <b>combining</b> schemes, a novel differentially coherent <b>combining</b> scheme is proposed. This <b>combining</b> scheme may be viewed as a combination of differential detection and coherent <b>combining</b> techniques. The detection and mean acquisition time performances of the differentially coherent <b>combining</b> as well as the optimal <b>combining,</b> noncoherent <b>combining,</b> and coherent <b>combining</b> are analyzed for Rayleigh fading environments with frequency offset. It is found that the differentially coherent <b>combining</b> scheme significantly outperforms the noncoherent <b>combining</b> and coherent <b>combining</b> schemes for a typical range of Doppler spread and frequency offset.
