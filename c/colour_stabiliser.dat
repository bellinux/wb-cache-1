50|$|Tin oxide {{is valued}} in glazes as both an {{opacifier}} {{and as a}} white colorant. Tin oxide has long been used to produce a white, opaque and glossy glaze. As well as an opacifying agent, tin oxide also finds use as a <b>colour</b> <b>stabiliser</b> in some pigments and glazes. Minor quantities are also used in the conducting phases in some electrical porcelain glazes.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{pertains to}} the use of at least one Brönsted superacid or metal salt of said Brönsted superacid with a DeltaGacid value of 316 kcal/mol or less, as a heat and/or <b>colour</b> <b>stabiliser</b> for polyvinyl halide resin compositions. The superacid is not a perchlorate or a trifluoromethane sulphonate. The metal in the metal salt of the Brönsted superacid is preferably selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkali earth metals, transition metals, lanthanide metals, actinide metals, Al, Ga, In, TI, Ge, Sn, Pb, and Sb...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} (CaCO 3) {{has been}} authorised {{as a food}} additive (E 170) with the functional category of anti-caking/free flow agent agent, surface <b>colouring</b> and <b>stabiliser.</b> An evaluation {{on the use of}} calcium carbonate as a processing aid in the process of obtaining virgin olive oil has been requested. Calcium carbonate is a substance that is authorised in human foodstuffs but its acceptable daily intake has not been established and its use does not lead to technically avoidable residues. Once the application dossier of the calcium carbonate (Microliva) as a processing aid in the process of obtaining virgin olive oil has been evaluated and from the information provided by the applicant and in the doses and conditions proposed, the Scientific Committee concludes that the use of the calcium carbonate as a processing aid in this process is safe...|$|R
