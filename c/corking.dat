25|$|In Champagne production, {{measured}} {{quantities of}} sugar, wine, and sometimes Brandy are added after fermentation and prior to <b>corking</b> {{in a process}} known as dosage. Chaptalization, on the other hand, involves adding sugar prior to fermentation. Champagne producers sometimes employ chaptalization in their winemaking when the wine is still in the form of must.|$|E
25|$|According to Spanish wine laws, Cava can be {{produced}} in six wine regions (such as Aranda de Duero, Navarra and Rioja) but 95% of Spanish Cava production {{takes place in the}} Penedès region. In order for the wines to be called 'Cava', they must be made in the traditional méthode champenoise. Wines made via the low-cost Charmat process may only be called 'Spanish sparkling wine'. A rosé style of Cava is also produced in small quantities by adding still red wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Garnacha or Monastrell to the wine. The first Cava to use the Chardonnay grape was produced in 1981. Catalan Cava producers pioneered a significant technological development in sparkling wine production with the invention of the gyropallet, a large mechanized device that replaced hand riddling, in which the lees are consolidated in the neck of the bottle prior to disgorgement and <b>corking.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{roots of}} the modern Champagne {{industry}} were laid during the Industrial Revolution which saw vast leaps in understanding the method of making sparkling wine and improvements in the technology needed to make production more financially feasible. The French scientist Jean-Antoine Chaptal popularized the understanding that Champagne sparkled because it was sealed in a bottle before fermentation was complete. He further noted {{that it was the}} sugar in the wine that facilitated this fermentation process resulting in bubbles. Along with the bubbles came intense pressure from the carbon dioxide gas that could result in the bottles exploding. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles to instability. The British method of coal fired glassmaking contributed to stronger wine bottles being available that could withstand the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas better. In the 1830s, a pharmacist from Châlons-sur-Marne named André François outlined formulas with precise measurements of how much sugar is needed to make a wine sparkle without producing more pressure than the wine bottle could withstand. <b>Corking</b> machines and improved corks made sealing the wine easier with less opportunity for the precious gas to seep out of the bottle.|$|E

A 60-minute performer, seldom fooled by intricate maneuvers, Heikkinen is regarded by Coach Fritz Crisler as the finest guard he has ever seen.” The NEA said: “Ralph Heikkinen, Michigan senior and Ramsay, was small as guards go. He stood only five feet eight and weighed 182 pounds but he was the fastest guard in the Big Ten [...] [...] [...] one of the best Fritz Crisler ever saw. He had a great offensive charge. A <b>corking</b> blocker, especially when pulling {{out of the line}}, he was chosen as the Wolverines’ most valuable player in 1937.” Another reporter described Heikkinen as “Michigan’s 182-pound dynamo,” who was “fast as a halfback, and possessing the quickest charge his coach, Fritz Crisler, has seen.” ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{detailed}} review, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard wrote, [...] demonstrates an originality in sound {{that was necessary}} for the revitalization of the boy band movement. The electropop currently dominating Top 40 radio is seamlessly weaved into the pop harmonies made standards by 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees -- for instance, the title track sounds like a hybrid of Backstreet Boys' [...] "Larger than Life" [...] and an LMFAO song, and even includes a Katy Perry name-check. Up All Night has its ups and downs, but One Direction complete two important tasks on their debut album: the boy band notches a long-lasting hit with [...] "What Makes You Beautiful," [...] and they look forward instead of back. Get ready {{to hear a lot}} more of One Direction. Matthew Horton of Virgin Media opined that the album brims with [...] "punchy pop rock", and considered the dance-orientated [...] "Stole My Heart": [...] "the only misstep, which only reinforces their decision to go pop rock." [...] MSN Musics Ben Chalk called the album: [...] "manufactured, calculated and commercial", assessing that the resulting album [...] "is a <b>corking</b> pop album".

[...] Although he felt that the use of samples on various songs [...] "displays an attitude to plagiarism that Noel Gallagher would consider cavalier" [...] and that [...] "no one could claim Laundry Service was a groundbreaking work of art," [...] he concluded that [...] "its ramshackle production and imponderable lyrics are striking and unique. And these days, it's hard not to find any pop record that provokes those adjectives rather cheering." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau termed Laundry Service [...] "the Cher album Cher never made" [...] and attributed this to Shakira's blend of Middle Eastern styles in her music; he commented that the [...] "stylistic appetite of this Colombian superstar is pure rock en Español" [...] and appreciated Shakira's confident songwriting. Christgau also noted Shakira's strong vibrato and constant changing of timbre in her vocals. Lisa Oliver from Yahoo! Music said that Shakira's experimentation with different styles yield [...] "results ranging from <b>corking</b> to minging," [...] but experienced difficulty with the formatting of the CD, saying [...] "the biggest problem with 'Laundry Service' is the anti-copying device that renders the CD useless in anything other than a conventional CD player [...] A shame then, because this Latino hottie could dilate the musical pupils of even the most ardent homebody if only they could get off the computer long enough to hear it." ...|$|E
