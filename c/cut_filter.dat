5000|$|A {{high-pass filter}} is a filter, an {{electronic}} circuit or device, that passes higher frequencies well but attenuates (cuts or decreases) lower frequency components. A low-pass filter passes low-frequency components of signals while attenuating higher frequencies.

In audio applications these are frequently termed [...] "low cut" [...] and [...] "high cut" [...] respectively, to emphasize their effect on the original signal. For instance, sometimes audio equipment will include a switch labeled [...] "high cut" [...] or described as a [...] "hiss filter" [...] (hiss being high-frequency noise).

40|$|High {{frequency}} {{signatures of}} individual 60 cubic inch and 250 cubic inch air-guns were recorded at 10 m from source during dedicated air-gun field trials. The high frequency recordings {{were made with}} a sample rate of 300 kHz and had a flat response from 20 kHz – 100 kHz. Recordings were low <b>cut</b> <b>filtered</b> at 20 dB per decade below 20 kHz. Waveform traces were inspected and maximum pulse power was evaluated. These two air-guns {{were found to have}} substantial high frequency energy output up to 150 kHz. Maximum pulse power occurred close to the pulse onset, and ranged from approximately 170 dB re 1 uPa^ 2 / Hz at 10 kHz (both air-guns) to approximately 120 dB re 1 uPa^ 2 / Hz (60 inch air-gun) and 110 dB re 1 uPa^ 2 / Hz (250 inch air-gun) at 100 kHz. Power levels are hugely in excess of deep ocean ambient noise across the entire spectrum. Spectrum levels at 60 kHz, uncorrected for low-cut filtering, were calculated to be 173 dB re 1 uPa for the 60 inch air-gun and 178 dB re 1 uPa for the 250 inch air-gun respectively. The low <b>cut</b> <b>filtering</b> crudely simulates the low frequency attenuation inherent in the dolphin auditory system, and hence these numbers can be taken as crude estimate of the over-hearing-threshold levels at 60 kHz. However, the maximum pulse power falls within a sufficiently small time window (~ 3 ms) as to fall below the integration time of the dolphin auditory system, so further refinement would be needed. This paper demonstrates that the output of air-guns cover the entire frequency range known to be used by marine mammals, and do so at substantial energy levels. They will be clearly audible to most, if not all, members of the cetacea and pinnipeda. The potential for hearing damage will require further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Spectral {{filtering}} {{was compared}} with traditional mean spatial filters {{to assess their}} ability to identify and remove striped artefacts in digital elevation data. The techniques were applied to two datasets: a 100 m contour derived digital elevation model (DEM) of southern Norway and a 2 m LiDAR DSM of the Lake District, UK. Both datasets contained diagonal data artefacts that were found to propagate into subsequent terrain analysis. Spectral filtering used fast Fourier transformation (FFT) frequency data to identify these data artefacts in both datasets. These {{were removed from the}} data by applying a <b>cut</b> <b>filter,</b> prior to the inverse transform. Spectral filtering showed considerable advantages over mean spatial filters, when both the absolute and spatial distribution of elevation changes made were examined. Elevation changes from the spectral filtering were restricted to frequencies removed by the <b>cut</b> <b>filter,</b> were small in magnitude and consequently avoided any global smoothing. Spectral filtering was found to avoid the smoothing of kernel based data editing, and provided a more informative measure of data artefacts present in the FFT frequency domain. Artefacts were found to be heterogeneous through the surfaces, a result of their strong correlations with spatially autocorrelated variables: landcover and landsurface geometry. Spectral filtering performed better on the 100 m DEM, where signal and artefact were clearly distinguishable in the frequency data. Spectrally filtered digital elevation datasets were found to provide a superior and more precise representation of the landsurface and be a more appropriate dataset for any subsequent geomorphological applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the security, {{robustness}} and invisibility of the digital watermarking, a new adaptive watermarking algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, this algorithm uses chaos sequence, which Logistic chaotic mapping produces, to encrypt the watermark image. And then the original image is divided into many sub-blocks and discrete cosine transform (DCT). The watermark information is embedded into sub-blocks medium coefficients. With the features of Human Visual System (HVS) and image texture sufficiently taken into account during embedding, the embedding intensity of watermark is able to adaptively adjust according to HVS and texture characteristic. The watermarking is embedded into the different sub-blocks coefficients. Experiment results haven shown that the proposed algorithm is robust against the attacks of general image processing methods, such as noise, <b>cut,</b> <b>filtering</b> and JPEG compression, and receives a good tradeoff between invisible and robustness, and better security.

Thus, the Holy Grail of graphic equalizers is a device with a response that truly matches the slider settings. For years, this seemingly unobtainable goal resulted in products based on the fine art of compromise … until the DEQ 60 L. It’s not Constant—not Proportional—It’s Perfect! Digital Signal Processing (DSP) allows filter technology not possible with analog designs. Rane coined the term Perfect-Q ™ to describe the results (U. S. patent 7, 266, 205). The DEQ 60 L is the first true graphic equalizer (i. e., one providing real mechanical front panel slide controls) whose output response precisely matches its front panel settings. Perfect-Q features virtually no band interaction and extremely low ripple between adjacent bands. To keep things flexible, fear not proportional-Q lovers, each channel of the DEQ 60 L is selectable between Perfect-Q or Proportional-Q response.

40|$|For {{many years}} filters like the Kodak Wratten E series, or the {{equivalent}} Schneider B+W 415, {{were used as}} standard UV <b>cut</b> <b>filters,</b> necessary to obtain good quality on UV Fluorescence photography. The only problem {{with the use of}} these filters is that, when they receive the UV radiation that they should remove, they present themselves an internal fluorescence as side effect, that usually reduce contrast and quality on the final image. This article presents the results of our experiences on using some innovative filters, that appeared available on the market in recent years, projected to adsorb UV radiation even more efficiently than with the mentioned above pigment based standard filters: the interference filters for UV rejection (and, usually, for IR rejection too) manufactured using interference layers, that present better results than the pigment based filters. The only problem with interference filters type is that they are sensitive to the rays direction and, because of that, they are not adequate to wide-angle lenses. The internal fluorescence for three filters: the B+W 415 UV cut (equivalent to the Kodak Wratten 2 E, pigment based), the B+W 486 UV IR cut (an interference type filter, used frequently on digital cameras to remove IR or UV) and the Baader UVIR rejection filter (two versions of this interference filter were used) had been tested and compared.
