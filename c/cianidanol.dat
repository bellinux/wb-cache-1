40|$|The {{intensity}} of picryl chloride-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (PCl-DTH) was significantly lowered in mice with experimental liver injury {{induced by the}} injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) or 1 -naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT). Adherent spleen cells prepared from mice with liver injury suppressed the PCl-DTH in normal syngeneic mice by adoptive transfer {{at the time of}} immunization with picryl chloride (PCl). <b>Cianidanol,</b> administered orally to recipient mice immediately after the transfer of adherent spleen cells, caused total prevention of the PCl-DTH from suppression by the transferred adherent spleen cells. In in vitro studies, the adherent spleen cells from both CCl 4 -treated and ANIT-treated mice produced higher amounts of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) than those from normal mice. The addition of <b>cianidanol</b> at the beginning of incubation caused an inhibition of PGE 2 production of the adherent spleen cells. Furthermore, the spleen cell suspensions from CCl 4 -treated mice gave a marked increase in generation of superoxide anions (O 2 -), also inhibited by the addition of <b>cianidanol.</b> Gathered results support the adherent spleen cell as being the cell causing the suppression of DTH in mice with experimental liver injury; the important role of PGE 2 and O 2 - in the suppression of DTH mediated by the adherent spleen cells was demonstrated. <b>Cianidanol</b> eliminated the suppression of DTH, owing principally to the inhibitory effect on the production of PGE 2 and O 2 - from the adherent spleen cells...|$|E
40|$|The ultrasound-assisted {{extraction}} of phenolic compounds from Epimedium brevicornu Maxim was modeled using response surface methodology. A Central Composite Design (CCD) {{was employed to}} optimize three extraction variables, including ethanol concentration (X 1), extraction time (X 2), and ratio of aqueous ethanol to raw material (X 3), for the achievement of high extraction yield of the phenolic compounds. The optimized conditions are X 1 of 50 % (v/v), X 2 of 27. 5 [*]min, and X 3 of 250 [*]mL/g. Under these conditions, the experimental yield is 4. 29 Â± 0. 033 % (n= 3). The antioxidant activity was evaluated using the DPPH assay and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). And it indicates that the phenolic compounds from Epimedium brevicornu Maxim possess significant antioxidant activity. HPLC analysis reveals that the main phenolic compound in the extract product was identified as gallic acid, catechin (<b>Cianidanol),</b> p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, ferulaic acid, rutin, benzoic acid, and quercetin...|$|E
