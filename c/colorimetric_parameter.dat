40|$|A multi-proxy {{analysis}} of Volturno River prodelta deposits {{in the outer}} shelf of Northern Phlegraean margin (Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea) {{has been carried out}} to reconstruct the sedimentary processes acting during recent times. The late Holocene sediments were characterized through Subbottom Chirp profiles coupled with sedimentological and petrophysical data. The chronostratigraphic framework was achieved by means of <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameter</b> a* correlations with nearby dated marine sediment. A time interpretation of about 2, 300 years BP is estimated for the sedimentary record collected in the cores. Seismic stratigraphic analysis shows late Holocene outer shelf deposits, characterized by fluid escape features and small-offset faults. However, the undisturbed sedimentation and the preservation of an internal geometry at decimetre scale, as detected by the sedimentological and petrophysical analysis, indicates a slow sliding without sediment reworking for this sedimentological body. So far a possible recent (, 300 years BP) shear dominated downward displacement of high water content sediments, triggered by the occurrence of seismic activity, is inferred. Based on the depth-age conversion of the detected lithological features, a regular climatically driven change in the sediment supply of the prodelta depositional environment is suggested. The detection of spectrophotometry correlations of Holocene shelf margin sediments, several km apart, goes beyond the previous work and confirms even for continental shelf area the potential value of spectrophotometer data in high-resolution stratigraphic correlations...|$|E

Three {{year old}} samples of Vitis vinifera origin-controlled red wine samples were spiked with {{adequate}} amounts of metals and subsequent <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters</b> evolution and complexing capacity behaviour were checked. The used approach consisted {{in the study}} of the complexing capacity of natural occurring ligands on wine with respect to Zn and Cu by means of stripping voltammetry in acetate pH 4 buffered 1 : 5 diluted samples onto which increasing amounts of standard metals were added. The resulting titration curves allowed the ligand concentration to be estimated, and the Scatchard and/or Langmuir algorithm transformation permitted the elucidation of the predominant stoichiometries of existing complexes. This technique has proved very sensitive to detect changes in the composition of samples along fermentation time as a function of major ligand populations [1].

40|$|Abstract. Color {{variability}} of paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) wood {{at the tree}} level was examined in this article. Tree age, dimension, and vigor were expected to influence the proportion of discolored wood in paper birch boards; older, larger, and less vigorous trees were assumed to produce boards with higher proportions of discolored wood. The color analysis was performed on approximately 2250 boards produced from 168 paper birch trees harvested in two different stands from which only logs of sawing quality were used. An industrial scanner was used to digitize the boards and obtain colorimet-ric information. Results show that tree diameter and vigor significantly influenced the proportion of discolored wood in boards, whereas the effect of tree age {{did not have a}} significant influence in the model. An average area of 32. 4 % of discolored wood was obtained when considering all boards. Less vigorous trees showed a mean area of 45. 32 %, whereas middle-vigor and most-vigorous trees had mean areas of 30. 78 and 15. 47 %, respectively. The colorimetric values were mainly affected by tree age and diameter, but these effects were variable for every <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameter.</b> The analysis of the random effects demonstrated that most of the total random variance of the dependent factors came from the between-board, between-tree, and, to a lesser extent, between-log variation.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the temperature at which degreening begins naturally in Verna lemon, noting the evo-lution of <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameter</b> a and comparing the same with the equivalent measurements made in Eureka lemon, the most widely cultivated lemon worldwide. The influence of solar radiation on the colorimetric parameters in Verna was studied, and the influence of the minimum temperatures on the change from green to yellow, using the data collected over five growing seasons, was assessed. The results confirmed the relation between net solar radiation and degreening, a process that begins when net solar radiation reaches a value of between 2 and 4 MJ/m 2. day and when the mean temperature of the 14 days prior to sampling is 8. 8 °C or when the daily mean temperature reaches 5. 5 °C on two consecutive days.

40|$|AbstractBarberry species (Berberis vulgaris L. var. asperma) is {{cultivated}} in arid and semi arid areas of Iran (Southern Khorasan) {{and it is}} widely used as a food additive. Harvesting time awareness and proper drying and harvesting methods can cause higher production quality and enhance the position of this fruit in internal and global markets. Barberry trees were harvested at different methods (branch-cutting, cluster picking and impact force) and times (mid September-late October-mid November) as well as barberry fruits were dried with different methods (shade-drying, sun-drying and industrial-drying) in order to study their effect on achieve optimal production conditions and production quality. The {{results showed that the}} bulk density of dried barberry as the criteria for puffy barberry fruits was affected by harvesting and drying methods.

40|$|International audienceThe first {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{underline}} a relevant colorimetric co-ordinate characterizing the colour of ochres within their extremely wide range, from pale yellow to dark red. The second purpose is to link together quantitatively the variations of this colorimetric co-ordinate and the various chemical compositions of the samples, mainly hematite, goethite and white pigments. A group of 30 modern ochres and a group of 20 ancient ochres have been investigated. All these natural pigments have been commercialized. Diffuse reflectance spectrometry allows to calculate the colorimetric co-ordinates in the CIE-L*a*b* space and the position of the absorption band of each sample. Physico-chemical analysis has been obtained by quantitative X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmitting electronic microscopy and particle-size analysis by laser diffraction. The positive a* co-ordinate (redness) has been underlined, for the first time, to be the only relevant <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameter</b> to characterize the colour of the ochres. Its variations are quantitatively connected to the shift of the absorption band due to the charge transfer between the ligand (OH− or O 2 −) and the Fe 3 + ion contained in goethite and/or hematite. For ochres containing both hematite and goethite, the a* co-ordinate linearly increases with the relative amount of hematite while the absorption band progressively shifts towards the high wavelengths. Such a linear shift of the absorption band has never been underlined before. For ochres containing only one iron oxide, a* linearly decreases with the amount of white pigments, whatever the nature of the white charges. Moreover, this study gives the opportunity to show that only the nature, the amount and the size distribution of the white charges allow to discriminate the ochres according to their geographic origin...|$|E
40|$|Ocean colour {{measurements}} {{from space}} are {{well suited to}} assess phytoplankton dynamics over broad spatial scales. Closer to the coast however, the quality of these data degrades {{as a result of}} the loading of sediments and dissolved matter from terrestrial runoff, the influences of land reflection on atmospheric correction and sea-bottom reflection, which compromise their use in coastal management actions. Recently, the enabling of citizens to provide environmental observations has gained recognition as a way for enhancing the spatio-temporal coverage of satellite observations. In the FP 7 funded EU project “Citclops” (Citizens’ observatory for coast and ocean optical monitoring), a smart phone app for the classification of water colour, simplified to 21 hues of the Forel Ule (FU) scale, is developed. In this study we examine two bays in the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean) where satellite data, hyperspectral measurements, and observations with the citizen tool for colour comparison were available. FU values and their corresponding novel <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameter,</b> the hue colour angle, were derived in the bay at 12 stations with the traditional FU scale and one automated in-situ radiometric system at the Alfacs Bay aquaculture site. Both methods complied well during the study course of May–June 2011. These measurements were further compared to data from Full Resolution MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) satellite images. The quality of the retrieved hue angle varies over the image. For high-quality sites, MERIS hue colour angles and FU values gave a good estimate of seasonal algal dynamics in the bays over the year 2011, while ground measurements revealed colour changes over short space- and time frames, which are indicative of the fast dynamics of phytoplankton in the area that could not be fully resolved with MERIS data. The use of FU values and hue colour angle of water will allow a simple integration of data from hyperspectral measurements, MERIS multispectral observations and citizens observations with the (Citclops/EyeOnWater) water colour app. Such observational data can be included to local monitoring efforts, and can also foster an increased interest of the general public to local environmental management and governance issues...|$|E

Personal UV exposure (expressed in terms of Exposure Ratio, ER) of two groups of volunteers (ski instructors and skiers) at the Alpine site of La Thuile (Valle d'Aosta region, Italy) was assessed using polysulphone dosimetry which was tested in a mountainous snow-covered environment. In addition measurements of biological markers of individual response to UV exposure such as skin <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters</b> were carried out. It was found that snow and altitude of study site affect calibration curves of polysulphone dosimeters in comparison to a situation without snow. The median ER, {{taking into account the}} whole sample, is 0. 60 in winter, with a range of 0. 29 to 1. 46, and 1. 02 in spring, ranging from 0. 46 to 1. 72.

Methods: Specimens (n= 15 per material) of five different restorative materials (CER: ceramic/Vita Mark II; EMP: composite/Empress Direct; LAV: CAD/CAM composite/Lava Ultimate; COM: prefabricated composite/Componeer; VEN: prefabricated composite/Venear) were produced. Whereas CER was glazed, EMP and LAV were polished with silicon polishers, and COM and VEN were left untreated. Mean roughness (Ra and Rz) and <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters</b> (L*a*b*), expressed as colour change (E), were measured. The specimens underwent an artificial aging procedure. After baseline measurements (M 1), the specimens were successively immersed for 24 hours in coffee (M 2), abraded in a toothbrushing simulator (M 3), immersed in coffee (M 4), abraded (M 5) and repeatedly abraded (M 6). After each aging procedure (M 2 -M 6), surface roughness and <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters</b> were recorded. Differences between the materials regarding Ra/Rz and E were analysed with a nonparametric ANOVA analysis. The level of significance was set at α= 0. 05. Results: The lowest roughness values were obtained for CER. A significant increase in Ra was detected for EMP, COM and VEN compared to CER. The Ra/Rz values were found to be highly significantly different for the materials and measuring times (M) (p< 0. 0001). Regarding E most alterations were found for EMP and COM, whereas CER and LAV remained mostly stable. The E values were significantly different for the materials and M (p< 0. 0001). Conclusion: The ceramic and the CAD/CAM composite were the most stable materials with regard to roughness and colour change and the only materials that resulted in Ra values below 0. 2 μm (the clinically relevant threshold).

40|$|The "Introduction" {{describes}} topicality {{and importance}} of revealing the soil cover's disruption {{for a wide range}} of fields. It was shown that spectral brightness and <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters</b> of ground vegetation can be used for this task. However, a traditional scheme of data processing for remote sensing requires a long-term observations and cannot always be applied, if quick decision-making is necessary or there is lack of information. Such cases require the use of special methods, one of which is a dynamic model developed with authors' participation based on the following basic relationships: (+,-) (-, -) (+, 0), (-, 0) (0, 0). The section "Brief description of a dynamic model" describes the basic principles of dynamic systems used to solve the problem. Using above-mentioned relationships, the dynamics of a system consisting of several components is constructed and its main properties are listed. The main feature of this model is that the identification of structure and parameters of the dynamic system does not required sequential order of observations (as for models based on time series). This feature of the model enables for identifying the system's parameters of dynamics of the natural system to use information from a single picture taken from the spacecraft rather than long-term observations. The section "Materials and Methods" describes specific <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters</b> used to analyze the vegetation cover. The section "obtained results" contains an example of the model's application to a satellite image for detecting the differences in two sites of a field with vegetation. One site is a recultivated area near the liquidated gas-oil well, another site is non-recultivated area at a considerable distance from the well (500 - 1000 m). The simulation results are described by eight signed graphs (4 graphs for each sites), whose structure allows to identify the system differences between the two cases. The section "Conclusions" summarizes the results of previous sections. The prospects of the use of proposed methodology for soil cover's disruption are shown. Advantages of this methodology over other approaches are highlighted. ?????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????, ??????????? ?????????????? ????????????????? ??????????. ?? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ????????????? ????????? ???????? ??? ????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????...|$|R

The structural and morphological characteristics of nanocomposite are determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations. The results indicate that formation of zircon promoted with iron addition. Finally, <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters</b> of the glazed ceramic samples were measured by the CIE colorimetric method. It {{was found that the}} samples withe 20 % molar Fe has the highest red shade and is the best color according to the a * parameter...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{characteristics}} of low-fat butter produced with only milk components, a preliminary study was carried out using freeze-dried milk whey added to commercial low-fat butter (5, 10 and 20 per cent whey/water). Thus, the effects of whey protein emulsifying properties {{and the effects of}} the soluble whey components on water activity were evaluated. Low-fat butter produced in laboratory-scale equipement and commercial low-fat butter spreads were considered; in all samples the composition, water activity, colorimetric characteristics and the emulsion Stability Index (SI) were determined. Increasing the quantity of freeze-dried whey in the composition of low-fat butter decreased at the water activity values but not sufficiently to be meaningful in microbiogical terms. The <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters</b> were influenced by the quantity of freeze-dried whey employed. Freeze-dried whey addition could improve the emulsion stability, the best results being achieved with 5 per cent w/w addition, probably for the limited supplementing of whey soluble components...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{analysis}} on the suitability of employing a colorimetric analysis of the acquired plasma spectra to perform on-line arc-welding quality monitoring will be discussed. Different <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters</b> like the color temperature or the parameters associated with the hue, saturation, luminance color space will be evaluated {{in comparison with the}} standard approach based on the estimation of the plasma electronic temperature. This approach does not require the identification of the emission lines involved in the analysis, thus giving rise to a more efficient solution in terms of computational efficiency, and avoiding unambiguous identifications that may give rise to incorrect results. In particular, experimental tests performed with a tungsten inert gas arc-welding process will show the feasibility of using the proposed solution and its ability to perform an online detection of different welding perturbations. This work has been supported by the project TEC 2013 - 47264 -C 2 - 1 -R...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{evaluate}} with objective and subjective investigations how white LED light source affects the perception of visual attributes of coloured materials with different gloss values. The study compares the objective characteristics of a material (colorimetric coordinates and gloss) with the subjective evaluation of associated perceived attributes under compact fluorescent and LED lamps. 21 samples of three different colours (red, blue and green) and seven different gloss finishing were characterized in lab considering the following most substantial optical characteristics: • spectral reflectance in condition 8 /d and in the extend range 250 - 2500 nm, • gloss, • spatial radiance distribution. Then different light sources, LED and compact fluorescent, were selected and used for calculating, from samples measured data, the relevant <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters</b> and to test perceived saturation and glossiness using especially designed observation boxes. This paper shows the most interesting results obtained with the Blue colour sample with warm white lights e. g. LED and fluorescent sources...|$|R
40|$|Multifunctional chitin/lignin {{materials}} were synthesized. In order to combine mechanical milling of the biopolymers with simultaneous mixing, a centrifugal ball mill was utilized. The resulting materials, differing {{in terms of}} the proportions of precursors used, underwent detailed physicochemical and dispersive-morphological analysis. On the basis of FT-IR spectra and results of elemental analysis, the efficiency of the preparation of the materials was determined. The influence of the precursors on the thermal stability of the resulting systems was also evaluated. Zeta potential was determined as a function of pH to describe the electrokinetic stability of aqueous dispersions. This is important for evaluating the utility of the materials and indirectly confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method of synthesis of chitin/lignin products. Measurements were performed to determine basic <b>colorimetric</b> <b>parameters,</b> crucial in the production technology of multiple colored materials. It is expected that chitin/lignin materials will find a wide range of applications (biosorbents, polymer fillers, and electrochemical sensors), as they combine the unique properties of chitin with the specific structural features of lignin to provide a multifunctional material...|$|R
