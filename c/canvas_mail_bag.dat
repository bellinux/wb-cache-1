[...] USMC pilot Lt Lawson H. Sanderson mounted a carbine barrel in front of the windshield of his JN-4 (previously, an unarmed trainer that had a machine gun mounted in the rear cockpit) as an improvised bomb sight that was lined up with the long axis of his aircraft, loaded a bomb in a <b>canvas</b> <b>mail</b> <b>bag</b> that was attached to the JN-4's belly, and launched a single-handed raid at treetop level, in support of a USMC unit that had been trapped by Haitian Cacos rebels. Although the JN-4 almost disintegrated in the pullout, the attack was effective and led to Sanderson in 1920 developing further dive-bombing techniques to provide Marine pilots with close aerial support to infantry comrades.|$|E

5000|$|Private <b>Mail</b> <b>Bags</b> or {{so-called}} [...] "Locked Bags" [...] are {{a worldwide}} solution for specialized mail delivery {{to a single}} location. Like PO Box addresses, Private <b>Mail</b> <b>Bag</b> addresses omit {{the name of the}} building and street, and include only the number allocated to the user. Private <b>Mail</b> <b>Bag</b> addresses are often used in countries in Africa where there may be no street delivery service. In Europe and North America, where street delivery is more commonplace, large users may be allocated their own postal codes, and consequently need only use their physical address in correspondence; the postal code implies that the recipient receives mail by caller service. Private <b>mail</b> <b>bags</b> may be in lieu of a Post Office Box, but sometimes can {{go so far as to}} have an individualized corporate zip code.|$|R
