40|$|Four {{important}} {{arguments for}} probabilism—the Dutch Book, representation theorem, calibration, and gradational accuracy arguments—have a strikingly similar structure. Each {{begins with a}} mathematical theorem, a conditional with an existentially quantified consequent, of the general form: if your credences are not probabilities, {{then there is a}} way in which your rationality is impugned. Each argument concludes that rationality requires your <b>credences</b> <b>to</b> be probabilities. I contend that each argument is invalid as formulated. In each case there is a mirror-image theorem and a corresponding argument of exactly equal strength that concludes that rationality requires your <b>credences</b> not <b>to</b> be probabilities.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{philosophical}} study of two concepts of probability, to wit, the subjective one called credence {{and the physical}} one called chance, and the relation between them. In this study, the thesis introduces and utilizes various principles or conditions relating chances <b>to</b> <b>credences,</b> prior (or present) chances to posterior (or later) chances, and prior <b>credences</b> <b>to</b> posterior <b>credences.</b> The primary aim {{is to show that}} focusing and elaborating on these principles gives us a fruitful way of theorizing about chance and credence. The secondary aim is to show how we can combine these principles with some well-established argumentative strategies to provide insight into both notions of probability...|$|R

In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E

5|$|A further {{elaboration}} on {{this story}} is possibly found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia {{as if it were}} a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> this fanciful version of events.|$|E

According to Ritz, about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and the others signed on or after August 2.

40|$|How does logic {{relate to}} {{rational}} belief? Is logic normative for belief, as some say? What, if anything, do facts about logical consequence {{tell us about}} norms of doxastic rationality? In this paper, we consider a range of putative logic-rationality bridge principles. These purport to relate facts about logical consequence to norms that govern the rationality of our beliefs and <b>credences.</b> <b>To</b> investigate these principles, we deploy a novel approach, namely, epistemic utility theory. That is, we assume that doxastic attitudes have different epistemic value depending on how accurately they represent the world. We then use the principles of decision theory to determine which of the putative logic-rationality bridge principles we can derive from considerations of epistemic utility...|$|R
40|$|Rédei and Gyenis (2013) {{suggest that}} Lewis’s Principal Principle is {{meaningful}} {{only if it}} satisfies certain consistency conditions: starting from any assignment of subjective probabilities (<b>credences)</b> <b>to</b> some algebra of events, we should {{always be able to}} extend our algebra with events of the form “the value of the objective probability (chance) of event E is p” and assign subjective probabilities to such events in a consistent manner. We show that this extension is indeed possible in most cases. However, we also argue that this requirement is not necessary: the Principal Principle concerns subjective believes about objective chance, hence events concerning those probabilities are meant to be in the algebra initially, as Lewis’s text suggests clearly...|$|R
40|$|Bayesianism, in its {{traditional}} form, {{consists of two}} claims about rational <b>credences.</b> According <b>to</b> the first claim, probabilism, rational credences form a probability function. According to the second claim, conditionalization, rational credences update by conditionalizing on new evidence. The simplicity and elegance of classical Bayesianism make it an attractive view. But many have argued that this simplicity comes at a cost: that it requires too many idealizations. This thesis aims to provide a justification of classical Bayesianism. Chapter One defends probabilism, classically understood, against the charge that by requiring <b>credences</b> <b>to</b> be precise real numbers, classical Bayesianism is committed to an overly precise conception of evidence. Chapter Two defends conditionalization, classically understood, against the charge that epistemic rationality consists only of synchronic norms. Chapter Three defends both probabilism and conditionalization against the objection that they require us, in some circumstances, <b>to</b> have <b>credences</b> that we can know are not {{as close to the}} truth as alternatives that violate Bayesian norms. by Jennifer Rose Carr.

They also stressed that the TWG had given too much <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that {{this was not the case}} and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (rutherfordium) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E
5|$|The Davenports {{held the}} manor for around 500 years, {{and it is}} likely that they built the current house after their accession. The first William Davenport was lord of the manor from 1478 to 1528, {{and one of the first}} {{recorded}} trustees of Macclesfield Grammar School. It is possible that he was heavily involved in the final battle of the Wars of the Roses at Bosworth and thereby instrumental in gaining the crown for Henry VII, who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime. According to Dean, it was during this first William's tenure that Bramall may have been vandalised by a man named Randle Hassall, who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole the timber.

5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt {{proved to be}} a further blow to relations between the Parchamites and Khalqists. The Parchamites deny that they ever planned to assassinate the Khalqist leadership, but historian Beverley Male argues that Karmal's subsequent activities give <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> the Khalqist view of events. Because of the Parchamite {{assassination attempt}}, Amin pressed the Khalqist PDPA to seize power in 1976 by ousting Daoud. The majority of the PDPA leadership voted against such a move. The following year, in 1977, the Parchamites and Khalqists officially reconciled, and the PDPA was unified. The Parchamite and Khalqist PDPAs, which had separate general secretaries, politburos, central committees and other organisational structures, were officially unified in the summer of 1977. One reason for unification was that the international communist movement, represented by the Communist Party of India, Iraqi Communist Party and the Communist Party of Australia, called for party unification.|$|E
40|$|Bayesian {{epistemology}} addresses epistemological {{problems with}} the help of the mathematical theory of probability.

40|$|Moss (2013) {{argues that}} degrees of belief or <b>credences</b> can amount <b>to</b> {{knowledge}} {{in much the}} way that full beliefs can. This paper explores {{a new kind of}} objective Bayesianism designed to take us some way toward securing such knowledge-constituting credences, or 'probabilistic knowledge'. Whatever else it takes for an agent’s <b>credences</b> <b>to</b> amount to knowledge, their success, or accuracy must be the product of cognitive ability or skill. The brand of Bayesianism developed here helps ensure this ability condition is satisfied. Cognitive ability, in turn, helps make credences valuable in other ways: it helps mitigate their dependence on epistemic luck, for example. What we end up with, {{at the end of the}} day, are credences that are particularly good candidates for constituting probabilistic knowledge. What’s more, examining the character of these credences teaches us something important about what the pursuit of probabilistic knowledge demands from us. It does not demand that we give hypotheses equal treatment, by affording them equal credence. Rather, it demands that we give them equal consideration, by affording them an equal chance of being discovered...|$|R

Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E
