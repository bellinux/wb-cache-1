5|$|A {{member of}} the Breckinridge {{political}} family, in 1849 John C. Breckinridge became the first Democrat to represent Fayette County in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and in 1851, {{he was the first}} Democrat to represent Kentucky's 8th congressional district in over 20 years. A champion of strict <b>constructionism,</b> states' rights, and popular sovereignty, he supported Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act as a means of addressing slavery in the territories acquired by the U.S. in the Mexican–American War. Considering his re-election to the House of Representatives unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention, and although he and Buchanan won the election, he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration.|$|E
25|$|For {{some social}} <b>constructionism</b> has been {{described}} as a source of the postmodern movement, and has been influential in the field of cultural studies. Some have gone so far as to attribute the rise of cultural studies (the cultural turn) to social <b>constructionism.</b>|$|E

Republicans favor judicial restraint and have actively sought to block judges whom they see as being activist judges.|$|E
25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{study of}} mystical experience {{has shifted from}} an experiential, privatized and perennialist approach to a contextual and empirical approach. The experientalist approach sees mystical experience as a private expression of perennial truths, separate from its historical and cultural context. The contextual approach, which also includes <b>constructionism</b> and attribution theory, {{takes into account the}} historical and cultural context. Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.|$|E
25|$|The social constructionist {{perspective}} (see social <b>constructionism</b> for {{a general}} definition) on adolescent sexuality examines how power, culture, meaning and gender interact to affect the sexualities of adolescents. This perspective is closely tied to feminist and queer theory. Those {{who believe in the}} social constructionist perspective state that the current meanings most people in our society tie to female and male sexuality are actually a social construction to keep heterosexual and privileged people in power.|$|E
25|$|In sociology, social {{psychology}}, {{also known}} as sociological social psychology or microsociology, {{is an area of}} sociology that focuses on social actions and on interrelations of personality, values, and mind with social structure and culture. Some of the major topics in this field are sociocultural change, social inequality and prejudice, leadership and intra-group behavior, social exchange, group conflict, impression formation and management, conversation structures, socialization, social <b>constructionism,</b> social norms and deviance, identity and roles, and emotional labor. The primary methods of data collection are sample surveys, field observations, vignette studies, field experiments, and controlled experiments.|$|E
25|$|The OLPC {{program has}} its roots in the {{pedagogy}} of Seymour Papert, an approach known as <b>constructionism,</b> which espoused providing computers for children at early ages to enable full digital literacy. Papert, along with Nicholas Negroponte, were at the MIT Media Lab from its inception. Papert compared the old practice of putting computers in a computer lab to books chained to the walls in old libraries. Negroponte likened shared computers to shared pencils. However, this pattern seemed to be inevitable, given the then-high prices of computers (over $1,500 apiece for a typical laptop or small desktop by 2004).|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{published}} research conducted in Second Life {{is associated with}} education and learning.

One such study tested the usefuleness of SL as an action learning environment in a senior course for management information systems students. Another presented a case study in which university students were tasked with building an interactive learning experience using SL as a platform. Both problem-based learning and <b>constructionism</b> acted as framing pedagogies for the task, with students working in teams to design and build a learning experience which could be possible in real life.|$|E
25|$|In November 2003, at the University of Exeter, Kirby {{delivered}} the Hamlyn Lectures {{on the subject}} of judicial activism. Rejecting the doctrine of strict <b>constructionism,</b> Kirby declared that:Clearly it would be wrong for a judge to set out in pursuit of a personal policy agenda and hang the law. Yet it would also be wrong, and futile, for a judge to pretend that the solutions to all of the complex problems of the law today, unresolved by incontestably clear and applicable texts, can be answered by the application of nothing more than purely verbal reasoning and strict logic to words written by judges in earlier times about the problems they then faced... contrary to myth, judges do more than simply apply law. They have a role in making it and always have.These lectures sparked a debate in the Australian media, echoing an ongoing debate in the United States, as to whether judges have the right to interpret the law in the light of its intent and considerations of natural law or whether judges should (or can) simply follow the letter of the law, leaving questions of its intent and underlying principles to elected representatives.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{sociology}} expanded in the U.S., including developments in both macrosociology, {{concerned with the}} evolution of societies, and microsociology, concerned with everyday human social interactions. Based on the pragmatic social psychology of George Herbert Mead (1863–1931), Herbert Blumer (1900–1987) and, later, the Chicago school, sociologists developed symbolic interactionism. In the 1920s, György Lukács released History and Class Consciousness (1923), while a number of works by Durkheim and Weber were published posthumously. In the 1930s, Talcott Parsons (1902–1979) developed action theory, integrating the study of social order with the structural and voluntaristic aspects of macro and micro factors, while placing the discussion within a higher explanatory context of system theory and cybernetics. In Austria and later the U.S., Alfred Schütz (1899–1959) developed social phenomenology, which would later inform social <b>constructionism.</b> During the same period members of the Frankfurt school, such as Theodor W. Adorno (1903–1969) and Max Horkheimer (1895–1973), developed critical theory, integrating the historical materialistic elements of Marxism with the insights of Weber, Freud and Gramsci—in theory, if not always in name—often characterizing capitalist modernity as a {{move away from the}} central tenets of enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{conclusion}} led Heidegger {{to depart from}} the phenomenology of his teacher Husserl and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of Ontology, a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between phenomena and noumena or between things in themselves (de re) and things as they appear (see qualia): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the openness {{to the process of}} Daseins becoming was to bridge the age-old gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in Rationalism, Empiricism, and methodological naturalism, his repudiation of the idea that facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a nominalist), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are wrapped up in the practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, a priori conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Heinrich von Kleist, Weltanschauung, and social <b>constructionism),</b> and his instrumentalist and negativist notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also process philosophy, dynamism, Instrumentalism, Pragmatism, and Vitalism).|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Edward Stein {{wrote in}} Forms of Desire (1990) that Bell et al.′s data {{undermine}} {{the hypothesis that}} a person's sexual orientation {{is determined by the}} sex of the first person he or she has sex with. The psychologist John C. Gonsiorek and the sex researcher Weinrich wrote that Bell et al., like experts such as Green and Money, believe that sexual orientation is set by early childhood. They described Bell et al. as [...] "essentialists", who, unlike supporters of social <b>constructionism,</b> maintain that [...] "homosexual desire, identity, and persons exist as real in some form, in different cultures and historical eras". Gonsiorek and Douglas C. Haldeman credited Bell et al. with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|Goffman made {{substantial}} {{advances in}} the study of face-to-face interaction, elaborated the [...] "dramaturgical approach" [...] to human interaction, and developed numerous concepts that have had a massive influence, particularly in the field of the micro-sociology of everyday life. Many of his works have concerned the organization of everyday behavior, a concept he termed [...] "interaction order". He contributed to the sociological concept of framing (frame analysis), to game theory (the concept of strategic interaction), and to the study of interactions and linguistics. With regard to the latter, he argued that the activity of speaking must be seen as a social rather than a linguistic construct. From a methodological perspective, Goffman often employed qualitative approaches, specifically ethnography, most famously in his study of social aspects of mental illness, in particular the functioning of total institutions. Overall, his contributions are valued as an attempt to create a theory that bridges the agency-and-structure divide – for popularizing social <b>constructionism,</b> symbolic interaction, conversation analysis, ethnographic studies, and the study and importance of individual interactions. His influence extended far beyond sociology: for example, his work provided the assumptions of much current research in language and social interaction within the discipline of communication.|$|E

2500|$|The terms <b>Constructionism</b> and constructivism are often, {{but should}} not be, used interchangeably. [...] <b>Constructionism</b> is an {{approach}} to learning that was developed by Papert; the approach was greatly influenced by his work with Piaget, {{but it is very}} different. <b>Constructionism</b> involves the creation of a product to show learning. [...] It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including race, sexuality, and gender, as well as tables, chairs and atoms are socially constructed.

2500|$|In his {{discussion}} of sexual orientation research, Stein criticized several other authors for {{their views on the}} subject. He finds research that claims to have identified genes that cause homosexuality in drosophilia (fruit flies), including a 1995 study by Jean-François Ferveur et al. that was published in Science magazine, to be guilty of anthropomorphism. He argued that such research is irrelevant to understanding sexual orientation in humans. Stein called the journalist Chandler Burr's A Separate Creation (1996) [...] "unsophisticated" [...] and criticizes Burr for failing to discuss social constructionist views and uncritically accepting [...] "courtship" [...] behavior between male fruit flies as an example of animal homosexuality. Stein criticized Michael Ruse's views on social <b>constructionism</b> as expressed in [...] (1988). Stein criticized the neuroscientist Simon LeVay, writing that in The Sexual Brain (1993), LeVay fails to discuss social <b>constructionism</b> even though it is relevant to his subject. Stein argued that in Virtually Normal (1995), Andrew Sullivan failed to show that social <b>constructionism</b> is false. Stein argued that it has not been shown that sexual orientations are non-arbitrary groups ("natural kinds") and that the ethics of sexual orientation research are open to question.|$|E
2500|$|Bret Boyce {{described}} {{the origins of}} the term originalist as follows: The term [...] "originalism" [...] has been most commonly used since the middle 1980s and was apparently coined by Paul Brest in The Misconceived Quest for the Original Understanding. It is often asserted that originalism is synonymous with strict <b>constructionism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An overall {{distinction}} is also commonly made between a [...] "medical model" [...] (also {{known as a}} biomedical or disease model) and a [...] "social model" [...] (also known as an empowerment or recovery model) of mental disorder and disability, with the former focusing on hypothesized disease processes and symptoms, and the latter focusing on hypothesized social <b>constructionism</b> and social contexts.|$|E
2500|$|White {{believed}} {{strongly in}} the principles of strict <b>constructionism</b> and a limited federal government, and voted against fellow Jacksonians if he felt their initiatives ran counter to these principles. His independent nature and his stern rectitude earned him the appellation [...] "The Cato of the United States." [...] His congressional colleague, Henry Wise, later wrote that White's [...] "patriotism and firmness" [...] as the Senate's president pro tempore was key to resolving the Nullification Crisis.|$|E
2500|$|Nussbaum {{wrote that}} the book [...] "will advance the public debate about {{homosexuality}} and the law" [...] and praised its [...] "rigor and clarity, its wide-ranging and ingenious arguments, and its accessible style." [...] However, she also found Stein's account of natural kinds, and hence also the debate over social <b>constructionism,</b> unclear. Nussbaum maintained that the [...] "issue of natural human kinds" [...] is less important to the legal and ethical questions surrounding sexual orientation than Stein suggests.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{theories}} {{are associated with}} textualist and formalist schools of thought, however there are pronounced differences between them. Justice Scalia differentiated the two by pointing out that, unlike an originalist, a strict constructionist would not acknowledge that he uses a cane means he walks with a cane (because, strictly speaking, {{this is not what}} he uses a cane means). Scalia averred that he was [...] "not a strict constructionist, and no-one ought to be"; he goes further, calling strict <b>constructionism</b> [...] "a degraded form of textualism that brings the whole philosophy into disrepute".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions (or Resolves) were {{political}} statements {{drafted in}} 1798 and 1799, {{in which the}} Kentucky and Virginia legislatures took {{the position that the}} federal Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional. The resolutions argued that the states had the right and the duty to declare unconstitutional acts of Congress that were not authorized by the Constitution. In doing so, they argued for states' rights and strict <b>constructionism</b> of the Constitution. [...] The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 were written secretly by Vice President Thomas Jefferson and James Madison respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Stein, {{writing in}} The Mismeasure of Desire (1999), criticized Ruse's book. Stein found Ruse's {{definition}} of a [...] "homosexual" [...] to be vague and open to possible objections, noting that Ruse does not explain whether he considers someone who only rarely wants {{to have sex with}} a person of the same sex [...] "homosexual", or whether wanting to have sex with a person of the opposite sex would disqualify a person from being [...] "homosexual". Though Stein granted that Ruse's definition is wide enough to be a candidate for playing a role in explanation in the sciences or the social sciences, he maintained that its wideness does not prove that sexual orientations are non-arbitrary groups ("natural kinds"). Stein found Ruse's critique of social <b>constructionism</b> unconvincing. He rejected Ruse's suggestion that defining sexual orientation in terms of sexual feelings rather than sexual behavior shows that social <b>constructionism</b> is false. Stein observed that while Ruse refers to the work of John Boswell to support his case that there were people in periods from that Ancient Greece to that of the Renaissance who were recognized as having a homosexual orientation, such evidence can be interpreted differently. Stein rejected Ruse's defense of sexual orientation research, arguing that the ethical implications of a research program must be considered in deciding whether the program is worth pursuing.|$|E
2500|$|The Mismeasure of Desire: The Science, Theory, and Ethics of Sexual Orientation is a 1999 book by {{the philosopher}} Edward Stein, {{in which the}} author {{critically}} evaluates scientific research on sexual orientation, discusses the debate between [...] "social constructionists" [...] and [...] "essentialists" [...] over the nature of sexual orientation, and criticizes the way other authors have discussed social <b>constructionism.</b> Part of the [...] "Ideologies of Desire" [...] series edited by the queer theorist David M. Halperin, the book received mainly positive reviews and was praised by philosophers and other commentators, but also received some negative and critical responses.|$|E
2500|$|McIntosh's {{earliest}} {{research was}} {{in the field of}} criminology and the sociology of homosexuality. In 1968 she published the paper [...] "The Homosexual Role" [...] in the journal Social Problems. [...] Based on a survey of gay men in Leicester and London, this paper argued that rather than being a psychiatric or clinical pathology, homosexuality and same sex relationships were influenced by historical and cultural factors, and that [...] "homosexual" [...] is a social category coercively imposed on some individuals for the purpose of social control. This paper has been described as being crucial in the shaping of social <b>constructionism,</b> a theory later developed by, and widely attributed to, the French philosopher Michel Foucault.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is known}} today for his {{interest}} {{in a wide variety}} of subjects, ideas, vocabularies, and periods, as well as his use of authorial disguises, and for his influence (alongside György Lukács) on the growth of Western scholarship on the novel as a premiere literary genre. As a result of the breadth of topics with which he dealt, Bakhtin has influenced such Western schools of theory as Neo-Marxism, Structuralism, Social <b>constructionism,</b> and Semiotics. Bakhtin's works have also been useful in anthropology, especially theories of ritual. [...] However, his influence on such groups has, somewhat paradoxically, resulted in narrowing the scope of Bakhtin’s work. According to Clark and Holquist, rarely do those who incorporate Bakhtin’s ideas into theories of their own appreciate his work in its entirety.|$|E
2500|$|The {{psychologist}} Jim McKnight {{wrote that}} Halperin {{is one of}} several critics of evolutionary explanations of homosexuality who [...] "argue that homosexuality is not an innate but rather an acquired behavior and that Darwinistic explanations are spurious or ultimately misguided". McKnight granted the possibility that Halperin and the other critics may be correct. Nussbaum credited Halperin with providing a good discussion of the relevance of the idea that homosexuality is a cultural construct to ancient Greek culture. The jurist Richard Posner described Halperin's view that homosexuality was [...] "invented" [...] by European psychiatrists as a thesis representative of social <b>constructionism.</b> The classicist Bruce Thornton, writing in Eros: The Myth of Ancient Greek Sexuality (1997), endorsed Paglia's criticisms of Halperin and Winkler. Author Timothy F. Murphy wrote that while Halperin claims that erotic preferences are no more fundamental than dietary preferences and should therefore be explained in cultural rather than biological terms, dietary habits themselves can be explained partly in terms of inherent human needs for proteins, fats, and sugars. He criticized Halperin for claiming that the discovery of a gene for homosexuality would refute his ideas about the cultural determination of sexual object-choice, since social <b>constructionism</b> can be interpreted as claiming that sexual orientation is inevitably influenced by social forces and thus does not rule out scientific investigation of the origins of homosexuality. In The Mismeasure of Desire (1999), Stein wrote that Halperin's views about the development of contemporary categories of sexual orientation are not universally shared: while Halperin maintains that the word [...] "homosexual" [...] was coined by Karl-Maria Kertbeny in 1869 and attaches significance to this event, others, such as John Boswell, argue that the concept the word refers to has existed for centuries.|$|E
2500|$|Foucault is {{sometimes}} criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of social <b>constructionism,</b> which some see as {{an affront to}} the concept of truth. In Foucault's 1971 televised debate with Noam Chomsky, Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice. Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating [...] "He struck me as completely amoral, I’d never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bakhtin's {{communication}} legacy reaches beyond rhetoric, social <b>constructionism</b> and semiotics as he {{has been}} called [...] "the philosopher of human communication." [...] Bakhtin “concentrates heavily on language and its general use." [...] Leslie Baxter observes: “Communication scholars have much to gain from conversing with Bakhtin’s dialogism." [...] Kim argues that “theories of human communication through verbal dialogue or literary representations” such as the ones Bakhtin studied “will apply to virtually every academic discipline in the human sciences." [...] Bakhtin's theories on dialogism influence interpersonal communication research, and [...] "dialogism represents a methodological turn towards the messy reality of communication, in all its many language forms.” In order to understand Bakhtin as a communication scholar one must take all forms of communication into account. While Bakhtin’s works focused primarily on text, interpersonal communication is also key, especially when the two are related in terms of culture. Kim states that “culture as Geertz and Bakhtin allude to can be generally transmitted through communication or reciprocal interaction such as a dialogue.” ...|$|E
