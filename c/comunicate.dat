But as I am hopfull that his Majesty is fully Informed {{of all that}} is past, and what is now a Transacting, I will not trouble his Majesty with a {{repetition}} of facts, which I am hopfull he has been Informed off from the fountaine head. All I will say is that for my owne parte I will allways make very great difference t'wixt English promasis and Action, and am more fully confirmed in this opinion SINCE THE TENTH OF NOV. LAST, when the Day was fixt; But when matters come to the puish, some frivolous excuses retarded this great and Glorious blow; Thank God the Prince did not venture himself then at London, {180} tho he was upon the Coast ready at a Call to put himself at their head. I wish he may not be brought to venture sow far, upon the stress laid upon a suden blow, to be done by the English; we will see if the Month of May or June will produce something more effective than Novr., and I am sorry to aquent you that the sow great stress laid upon those projects is lick to prove fatal to some, for Lochgary, and Doctor Archibald Cameron, were sent to the Highlands to prepair the Clans to be in readiness: thire beeing sent was much against my opinion, as I allways ensisted, and will allways persist, that no stirr should be done there untill the English would be so farr engaged that they could not draw back. I hope his Majesty will aprove of my Conduct in this. Doctor Cameron was taken by a party of soldiers in Boruder [?], and is now actually secured in the Castel of Edinr. Loch still remains but what his fate will be is very precarious. The concert in Novr. was that I was to remain in London, as I had above four hundred Brave Highlanders ready at my call, and after matters had broke out there to sett off directly for Scotland as no raising would be made amongst the Clans without my presence. Now I beg in laying this before the King, you'l at same time assure his Majesty of my constant resolution to venture my owne person, let the consequence be what it will and dow everything that can convince his Majesty of my Dutifull attachmt to his sacred person and Royal Cause, for which I am ready to Venture my all, and nothing but the hand I had in those leate and present Schemes and the frequent jants I was oblidged to take in Consequence, Has hindered me from beeing settled in a very advantagious and honorable way, being affraid that Matrimony might Incline me to a less active life than my Prince's affairs now requires. I belive in a few days that I will take a private start to London, tho I am still so weake after my leate Illness at Paris {181} that I am scarse yet able to undergo much fatigue. I have left directions with Mr. Gordon, principal of the Scots Colledge, to forward any letters for me to a friend at Boulogne, HOW [who] has a secure way of forwarding by trading ships any Letters for me.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{characterize}} the achievable {{performance of a}} wavelet encoding-based videophone system, which further compresses and protects the wavelet-based video codec’s bit-stream {{with the aid of}} Reversible Variable-Length (RVLC) codes. More specifically, the video codec uses RVLC codes for compressing and protecting the video frame header. By constrast, Irregular Convolutional Codes (IRCCs) are used for Unequal Error Protection of the video bitstream generated from the wavelet-subbands, when communicating over InterSymbol Interference (ISI) contaminated channels. At the receiver, the turbo-equalizer, the IRCC decoder and the RVLC decoder all employ the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) algorithm and their operations are performed in an iterative turbo-detection style. The proposed system was designed for maintaining a near-unimpaired video reconstruction quality for channel Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) in excess of about 5 dB, when <b>comunicating</b> over a five-path dispersive AWGN channel.
