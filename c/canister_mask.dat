50|$|Numerous changes {{occurred}} in the department in the 1970s, with several improving {{the health and safety}} of firefighters. On September 20, 1970, the city hired its first black firefighter, Bobby Glenn, who later retired after serving the department for over 21 years. The city purchased its first set of MSA SCBA breathing apparatus, replacing old <b>canister</b> <b>masks</b> that were rarely worn. Also, firefighters stopped riding to emergencies on the tailboard of fire apparatus and were contained in cabs of apparatus, protecting them from various hazards including falling off the apparatus. Also, in 1971 International Association of Fire Fighters Local 1545 was created, becoming the city's first recognized labor union. In 1975 the first firefighter was hired who was also certified as a paramedic. In 1978, the city hired its first female firefighters, a group of five, many of whom would serve the department for decades. Also in 1979, the department created the hazardous material team to deal with chemical emergencies, the first created in Broward County.|$|R

40|$|I {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} suitability of four types of amine modified charcoal filter canisters (cartridge) for use with gas masks (respirators) by measuring emissions of triethylamine (TEA) and diethylamine (DEA). Sampling and analysis methods for TEA and DEA were validated and optimized to ensure accurate measurement at low levels. A total of 88 air samples were taken by the validated methods to measure concentrations of TEA and DEA emitted from gas <b>mask</b> <b>canisters</b> during simulated use in an environmental chamber. Samples were collected on a mannequin equipped with a breather pump and also on human volunteers. Very low levels of TEA and moderately low levels of DEA emissions were measured during the simulations. The C 7 (KOH-TEA-BPL/ASC 3 T) gas <b>mask</b> <b>canister</b> giving the lowest emission has been selected {{for use by the}} Canadian Forces. The potential health hazard from TEA and DEA for soldiers using the gas masks, under normal conditions, based on estimated use of one to two days per month, for a maximum of 4 hours/day for a normal working lifetime, was considered to be minimal an...|$|R
40|$|This study proposes an efficient, {{cost-effective}} {{analytical methodology}} involving {{computational fluid dynamics}} for improving the performance of industrial-grade gas <b>mask</b> <b>canisters.</b> Computational fluid dynamics and the quadratic Forchheimer equation, used for calculating high momentum loss, were applied for analyzing the flow fields of six gas <b>mask</b> <b>canisters.</b> Streakline flow visualization and compression tests were conducted to determine the design performance. The {{results indicated that the}} designed honeycomb passageway in the canister demonstrated superior aerodynamics and structural loading to the original design. The honeycomb passageway design enhanced the flow rectification and increased the passageway sizes, improving the effective flow-through area and reducing the inhalation resistance. Finally, an improved prototype was produced based on the honeycomb passageway design. Aerosol penetration and hydrogen cyanide breakthrough tests confirmed that the improved prototype achieved a P 100 -level filter efficiency performance and maintained a 60 -min breakthrough time. Without replacing the raw material, the inhalation resistance and absorbency of the improved prototype reduced by 46. 48 % and 33 %, respectively, compared with the original canister...|$|R
50|$|The {{first use}} of poison gas on the Western Front was on 22 April 1915, by the Germans at Ypres, against Canadian and French colonial troops. The initial {{response}} was to equip troops with cotton mouth pads for protection. Soon afterwards the British added a long cloth which was used to tie chemical-soaked mouth pads into place, and which was called the Black Veil Respirator. Dr. Cluny MacPherson of Royal Newfoundland Regiment brought {{the idea of a}} mask made of chemical absorbing fabric and which fitted over the entire head to England, and this was developed into the Hypo helmet or the British Smoke Hood in June 1915. This primitive type of mask went through several stages of development before being superseded in 1916 by the <b>canister</b> gas <b>mask.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{safe and}} {{practical}} technique {{for the application}} of carbon dioxide absorption from anæsthetic atmospheres is described. It has been found satisfactory in over 20, 000 administrations over a period of fifteen years. High-grade soda lime is utilized as the chemical absorbent. Granules are placed in a <b>canister</b> between face <b>mask,</b> and breathing bag. The canister is carefully checked for efficiency by both chemical analyses and physical experiments. Its size, shape and arrangement is shown to be important for safety and maximum efficiency. Detailed techniques are described for the use of various agents. Advantages of carbon dioxide absorption are set forth. The “Apnœa” suggested by Guedel is described under the term “Controlled Respiration” and attention is called to certain of its advantages...|$|R

50|$|Commercial {{aircraft}} provide {{emergency oxygen}} to passengers {{to protect them}} from drops in cabin pressure. Chemical oxygen generators are not used for the cockpit crew, who are typically supplied using compressed oxygen canisters also known as oxygen bottles. In narrow body airliners, for each row of seats there are overhead oxygen masks and oxygen generators. In some wide-body airliners, such as the DC-10 and IL-96, the <b>canisters</b> and oxygen <b>masks</b> are mounted in the top portion of the seat backs, since the ceiling is too high above the passengers. If a decompression occurs, the panels are opened either by an automatic pressure switch or by a manual switch, and the masks are released. When the passengers pull down on the mask they remove the retaining pins and trigger the production of oxygen.|$|R
50|$|Some StG 44s were {{fitted with}} the Zielgerät 1229 infra-red aiming device, also {{known by its}} codename Vampir ("vampire"). This device {{consisted}} of a large scope, rather like modern starlight scopes, and a large infra-red lamp on top, the scope being {{able to pick up}} the infra-red that would be invisible to the naked eye. The user had to carry a transformer backpack powered by a battery fitted inside the gas <b>mask</b> <b>canister.</b> Electric cables connected the power unit with the IR reflector, with the cathode ray tube mounted on the rifle imaging IR from the spotlight. The Vampir had only 15 minutes of battery life, but was able to sight within 200 meters in total darkness. A conical flash hider was added to the barrel to keep the muzzle flash from blinding the shooter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{alternative}} vapor was explored {{to replace}} carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) for testing breakthrough times of cartridges and <b>canisters</b> of gas <b>masks</b> in the National Approval Test of Respirators. Cyclohexane was single {{out as a}} candidate for the alternative vapor out of six vapors: trichloroethylene, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, toluene and cyclohexane from the viewpoints of similarity of vapor pressure and water-solubility to CCl 4, lower toxicity than CCl 4, and technical feasibility in generating an airflow of 30 L/min containing the vapor ranging from 300 to 5000 ppm. Breakthrough times of cartridges and canisters were examined by generating cyclohexane vapor in a test airflow of 30 L/min in comparison with CCl 4 vapor under various test conditions with different vapor concentrations and relative humidities (RH). As the results, the breakthrough times of the cartridges and canisters for cyclohexane were found to almost coincide with those for CCl 4 under all examined range of concentrations and RH. By an increase of humidity from 50 %RH to 80 %RH, the cartridges showed significant shortening of breakthrough times for both of CCl 4 and cyclohexane, but the susceptibility of the breakthrough time of cyclohexane to humidity was also similar to that of CCl 4. It was, therefore, concluded that cyclohexane can be recommended as the alternative vapor of CCl 4 for testing the breakthrough times of gas <b>mask</b> cartridges and <b>canisters</b> in the National Approval Test...|$|R
