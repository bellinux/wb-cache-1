Circumferential {{guided wave}} {{propagation}} {{behavior in a}} viscoelastic multi-layered hollow cylinder is studied to provide a baseline for defect detection in tar coated pipelines.

40|$|When a {{pipeline}} is installed at deep waters the primary design load is the external pressure, hence making the collapse pressure the major design parameter. Pipeline collapse formulas are functions of elastic and plastic collaspe pressure acompanied the initial ovality and yield stress. The most common formulas for collapse are the Timoshenko, Shell and Haagsma equation where {{the latter is}} the least conservative and used in the offshore standard DNV-OS-F 101. In any pipeline system onshore or offshore {{there is a need}} of pipeline protection. The purpose of coating is to isolate the pipeline steel from the seawater, the soil and to introduce a high resistance path between anodic and cathodic areas. Such coatings can be ranging from a few up to around hundred millimeter, thus the cros section of the <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> can be many times initial cros section of the bare steel pipe. Existing design formulas for collapse are neglecting the effect of pipeline coating and a study is proposed to investigate if todays practice of neglecting the coating is ac- ceptable. In this project ABAQUS finite element software has been used to examine a <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> section with various thicknesses, elasticity and ovality and compared the collapse limit to the values of a uncoated pipe. Based on the assumption of elasticity and material model of coating the results has shown to increase the collapse capacity when the coating thickness and elasticity increases. The values has shown a increase in range of 5 to 25 %. The ovality of the coating however has shown to not effect the pipe collapse capacity in any significant way. Also based on a proposed simple analytical collapse model of serial resistance where the collapse capacity of the steel pipe is added to the collapse capacity of the <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> without the steel, the model has shown a good agreement with ABAQUS collapse data and thus is recommended for use in collapse calculation of coated pipelines.

However, over time defects and areas of corrosion often form in these pipelines and so it is desirable to monitor the structural integrity of these coated pipes using techniques similar to those used on uncoated pipelines. A common approach is to use ultrasonic guided waves that work on the pulse-echo principle; however, the energy in the guided waves can be heavily attenuated by the coating and so significantly reduce the effective range of these techniques. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop {{a better understanding of how}} these waves propagate in coated pipes with a view to optimising test methodologies, and so this article uses a hybrid SAFE-finite element approach to model scattering from non-axisymmetric defects in coated pipes. Predictions are generated in the time and frequency domain and it is shown that the longitudinal family of modes is likely to have a longer range in coated pipes when compared to torsional modes. Moreover, it is observed that the energy velocity of modes in a <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> is very similar to the group velocity of equivalent modes in uncoated pipes. It is also observed that the coating does not induce any additional mode conversion over and above that seen for an uncoated pipe when an incident wave is scattered by a defect.

This makes it possible to reduce the problem of the mechanics of a deformable solid for a limited region containing cuts or inclusions to the solution of an integral equation (or system) with respect to discontinuities of the functions being defined. Methods. The method was implemented through the application to the solution of the theoretical elasticity problem for a pipe section (plane deformation) weakened by an internal radial crack. The pipe was loaded with hydrostatic pressure and a thin coating is applied on its inner surface, improving its physical and mechanical properties. The applied method, combined with the conventional integral transformation, can be effectively {{used in the}} construction of discontinuous solutions of three-dimensional problems of the theory of elasticity. Results. Specially formulated boundary conditions were used as a coating model. In order to verify the adequacy of the adopted model, a series of numerical experiments was carried out.

The GWT test range in buried, coated pipelines is greatly reduced compared to above ground configurations due to energy leakage into the embedding soil. In this paper, {{the effect of}} pipe coatings on the guided wave attenuation is investigated {{with the aim of}} increasing test ranges for buried pipelines. The attenuation of the T(0, 1) and L(0, 2) guided wave modes is measured using a full-scale experimental apparatus in a fusion-bonded epoxy (FBE) -coated 8 in. pipe, buried in loose and compacted sand. Tests are performed over a frequency range typically used in GWT of 10 â 35 kHz and compared with model predictions. It is shown that the application of a low impedance coating between the FBE layer and the sand effectively decouples the influence of the sand on the ultrasound leakage from the buried pipe. Ultrasonic isolation of a buried pipe is demonstrated by coating the pipe with a Polyethylene (PE) -foam layer that has a smaller impedance than both the pipe and sand, and has the ability to withstand the overburden load from the sand. The measured attenuation in the buried PE-foam-FBE-coated pipe is found to be substantially reduced, in the range of 0. 3 â 1. 2 dBmâ 1 for loose and compacted sand conditions, compared to measured attenuation of 1. 7 â 4. 7 dBmâ 1 in the buried FBE-coated pipe without the PE-foam.

The pipelines are suffering from corrosion, cracking and other problems. External corrosion has been recognized for many years {{as one of the}} main deterioration mechanisms that may reduce the structural life of buried transmission pipelines. Corrosion of these pipes inflicts huge costs on countries, to protect their pipelines, and make them workable for the longest possible time. One of the ways followed in pipelines protection, is by coating them with special material that protect them from affecting corrosion factors, as the type of the soil, moisture, pH, temperature variations and other factors. Organic coating is used to control corrosion by isolating the external surface of the underground or submerged pipeline from environment. This organic coating should have a high electrical resistance and high dielectric strength to provide a barrier against moisture reaching the pipelines surface. Organic coatings are usually classified according to the resin binder, which controls protectiveness and resistance to degradation. The organic coating is reasonably easy to repair in the field. The present study aims to study three types of coatings assigned for protection of these pipelines. This work was carried out by placing the pipes inside a box containing soil. The study was conducted in different operating situations. Firstly, the soil was saturated by saline water (5 % NaCl). Also, temperature changes were carried out {{for each of the three}} types of coating. The corrosion characteristics were extracted through electrochemical testings.

40|$|Raw {{sea water}} can be pumped into subsea wells where {{pressure}} drops have occurred to increase the pressure again and thereby the production rate. Thermally sprayed aluminum (TSA) is considered as internal corrosion protection in pipes conducting this raw sea water. These pipes will have an internal diameter of 6 &# 148;, be made of carbon steel (typically API 5 L X 52) and the flow rates {{will be in the}} range 3 &# 150; 6 m/s. TSA is known to provide good and long-lasting corrosion protection both alone and in combination with sacrificial anodes. Little testing has however been done to evaluate its performance when exposed to higher velocities. Aluminum is known to be subject to localized pitting corrosion at negligible flow rates. As the flow velocity increases the corrosion regime changes from local to uniform as the protective oxide film dissolves chemically due to the increased mass transport to and from the surface. Cathodic protection is not expected to hinder this dissolution as it is purely chemical in nature and the protective effect of sacrificial anodes on TSA coated structures under these conditions are therefore doubtful. The dissolution rates were calculated from mass transfer correlations for the flow rate range of interest and found to be 0. 15 &# 150; 0. 30 mm/year for a smooth surface and 0. 20 &# 150; 0. 40 mm/year for a rough surface, depending somewhat on the amount of surface roughness. Last fall a rotating cylinder electrode (RCE) was used to simulate the flow conditions and TSA samples were tested at different velocities. The obtained corrosion rates were very high, up to 1, 6 mm/year at the highest rotation velocity. Cavitation was however suspected to occur at the surface and there were therefore uncertainties related to the accuracy of the results. Another test design was therefore prepared, and cylindrical samples of TSA coated steel (sprayed with AlMg 5 wire) were exposed to sea water in a constructed flow loop. Three different flow rates, corresponding to velocities of approximately 3. 6, 4. 2 and 4. 8 m/s in a 6 &# 148; internally <b>coated</b> <b>pipe,</b> were tested. The samples were exposed at open circuit potential (OCP) for a total of eight days, and polarized to - 1040 mV SCE for 4 days. Ideally, the exposure times should have been much longer but were restricted by material deliveries. After exposure the sample surfaces were analyzed in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), then treated with chromic phosphoric acid for removal of corrosion products and weighed to determine their weight loss and corresponding corrosion rate, before finally being cut in order to examine their cross section, also in the SEM. All tests were also effectuated on solid AlMg 5 samples in order to compare the effect of different surface structure and &# 150;roughness. For the solid AlMg 5 samples, the corrosion rates were found to match fairly well with the theoretical calculated values even though the surface analysis revealed a roughened profile and thus the possibility that the samples had been subject to wear. The presence of the exposed cylindrical samples in the channel where sea water flowed at high velocities caused irregularities in the flow regime. And a regular hydraulic regime in the fluid is known to be very important to avoid cavitation-corrosion. The observed wear might therefore have been caused by cavitation. For TSA the corrosion rates (about 1 mm/year) were much higher than the theoretical calculated values indicating that other factors {{may have contributed to the}} degradation of the coating. Besides possible cavitation, this could have been the combined effect of surface roughness, sample geometry and flow turbulence causing the protective ability of the oxide film to be weakened. The surface roughness seemed therefore to cause increased corrosion rates, and not only because of a larger true available area. The measured open circuit potentials were also very low (down to - 1100 mV SCE for TSA) suggesting that the surface was activated in some way. As no especial activating element was detected from the EDS analysis, the activation was thought to possibly be due to the high flow rates causing a less protective film and thus a more activated surface. Polarization to - 1040 mV SCE was therefore in the anodic direction for TSA and small positive currents were recorded. For solid AlMg 5, which had an open circuit potential of about - 980 mV SCE, the polarization was cathodic but unusual high cathodic current demands were recorded (about - 300 mA/m 2). The current demand had however probably not stabilized and a much longer exposure would have been required to be able to conclude. Too short exposure times were a clear weakness of the performed experimental work. Questions also arose regarding the design of the test method since the varying conditions around the exposed cylinders were likely to have caused uneven corrosion rates and the velocity and pressure variations that occurred due to the obstacle these cylinders presented to the flow may have caused cavitation. In the case of internally coated pipes, these geometry effects would not be the same and the corrosion rates consequently not increased in the same way. The problem of cavitation was already suspected during previous tests with the RCE and the objective to avoid this here was not reached. The obtained corrosion rates for TSA indicate that it is not an ideal material to provide long term protection for the sea water pipes in question, but are probably falsely high. However, even the theoretical corrosion rates based on mass transfer considerations imply that the entire coating thickness would be dissolved within a year. If TSA is to be used for the desired purposes, an inhibiting factor hindering or strongly slowing down the chemical film dissolution rate must be found. </p...|$|E

In conclusion, the conjoint use of cathodic protection and coating takes advantage of the most attractive features of each method of corrosion control. Magnesium anodes proves to be more practical anode in applying Cathodic Protection for underground steel pipelines...|$|R

40|$|A gravity {{assisted}} Gold <b>coated</b> heat <b>pipe</b> (GCHP) with 5 -mm diameter {{has been}} developed and tested to cool a liquid hydrogen target for external beam experiments at COSY. The need for a narrow target diameter leads us to study the effect of reducing the heat pipe diameter to 5 mm instead of 7 mm, to study the effect of coating the external surface of the heat pipe by a shiny gold layer (to decrease the radiation heat load), and to study the effect of using the heat pipe without using 20 layers of super-insulation around it (aluminized Mylar foil) to keep the target diameter as small as possible. The developed gold <b>coated</b> heat <b>pipe</b> was tested with 20 layers of super-insulation (WI) and without super-insulation (WOI). The operating characteristics for both conditions were compared to show the advantages and disadvantages. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Geopolymer {{coatings}} were {{coated on}} glass fibre-reinforced epoxy (GRE) pipe by using kaolin, white clay and silica sand as source materials and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3) as alkaline solution. The microstructure and mechanical property of geopolymer <b>coating</b> on GRE <b>pipe</b> were methodically investigated through morphology analysis, and flexural strength test. The result indicates the microstructure and interfacial layer between geopolymer <b>coating</b> and GRE <b>pipe</b> significantly influence the mechanical property of geopolymer coating. However, different source materials gave different microstructure and property in geopolymer coating...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} report {{examines the}} origin of the uranium-concentration in pyrolitic carbon, which is deposited on spherical UO_ 2 -fuel kernels. Uranium-concentration-profiles were measured in the outer pyrolitic carbon layer (HDI) by successive mechanical removing and fluorimetrical uranium determination. According to the distribution of the uranium-concentration in the layer and according to annealing tests it was possible to exclude a contamination of the layer by Fick's diffusion of uranium through the coating of the oxide nuclear fuel. It was found that during the deposition uranium from the gas phase is stored up in the growing outer pyrolitic carbon layer. The uranium can evaporate into the coating area from the contaminated walls of the <b>coating</b> <b>pipe</b> and from fuel kernels, which are exposed during the deposition of the HDI-layer. With a model coating test at 2000 Â°C according to these results it was possible to drop the average uranium concentration in the HDI-layer to a value of 2 Â· 10 ^- 6 g U/g Pyc...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} the conceptual design of ultrasonic tomographic instrumentation system for monitoring flaw in pipeline coating. In {{oil and gas}} industry, an ultrasonic inspection is the common method used to inspect pipeline integrity due to flaw existence such as corrosion, pitting, holiday, pinhole and others. The ultrasonic tomography system is used in this project to monitor flaws circumferentially on pipeline coating with contactless measurement of distance from sensors {{which is based on}} thickness changing in coating. The design of the ultrasonic tomography system consists of ultrasonic sensing system, data acquisition and image reconstruction system. Experimental test for lab scale is performed by using 2 inch pipe. The transceiver sensors of 40 kHz are mounted around the pipe with a distance of 2 cm from sensors to the pipe surface. Reflection mode is used as the ultrasonic sensing mode for the ultrasonic signal as it propagated through air medium to the <b>pipe</b> <b>coating.</b> The data collected are based on ultrasonic signal amplitude and time of flight measured by ultrasonic transceiver sensor. Based on the time travelled by the ultrasonic signal from the sensor to the <b>pipe</b> <b>coating,</b> the distance can be determined using Time of Flight (ToF) method. The thickness changing in <b>pipe</b> <b>coating</b> indicates the existence of flaws (internal or external). From the acquired output data, a tomographic image of <b>pipe</b> <b>coating</b> thickness is reconstructed. In the image reconstruction system, the image coating will be reconstructed using MATLAB software based on suitable algorithm...|$|R
