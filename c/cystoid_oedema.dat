40|$|Fluorescein {{angiography}} of {{the iris}} {{was performed on}} patients with plastic lens implants with <b>cystoid</b> <b>oedema</b> of the macula, {{and the nature of}} the vascular changes was compared with controls provided by patients who did not have macular disease. Densitometry was used to quantitate leakage of fluorescein dye into the anterior chamber in residual angiograms 5 minutes after injection. <b>Cystoid</b> <b>oedema</b> was associated with marked increase in vascular permeability of the iris in the patients with implants, and in aphakics without implants, but to a lesser degree. Although it cannot be concluded that implants themselves cause either the increase in permeability or the onset of macular oedema, the presence of such implants must be considered an additional hazard in an eye which is already at risk. Iris angiography can be used as a diagnostic aid in patients in whom macular oedema is suspected. A persistent increase in permeability associated with a reduction in visual acuity should act as a warning of further visual loss and of eventual cystoid macular degeneration...|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} angiographic {{study of}} 77 aphakic eyes demonstrated cystoid macular oedema in 36 eyes (46 - 7 per cent) 6 to 7 weeks postoperatively. This subsequently resolved in 16 eyes, improved in eight, and {{was no better}} or worse in five (eight patients failed to return for follow-up). Of those patients with <b>cystoid</b> <b>oedema,</b> 16 - 6 per cent had a visual acuity of less than 6 / 12 {{at the time of}} the original examination; this was reduced to 13 - 8 per cent {{at the time of the}} follow-up study. The mean visual acuity of the group with oedema improved from 6 / 9 to 6 / 7 - 5 between the two examinations compared with 6 / 6 in the remaining 53 - 3 per cent without oedema.

40|$|AIM—To {{report the}} success of vitrectomy in {{eliminating}} <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema</b> and improving vision in three eyes of two patients with diabetic <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema.</b> In all of the eyes there was no ophthalmoscopic evidence of traction from a posterior hyaloid membrane or from proliferative tissue.  METHODS—Pars plana vitrectomy was performed on three eyes of two patients with diabetic <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema</b> who did not show traction upon examination with a slit lamp biomicroscope and a scanning laser ophthalmoscope.  RESULTS—Cystoid changes disappeared 1,  3, and 5  days, postoperatively, and diffuse macular oedema resolved within 2  weeks.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the new surgical technique of cystoid macular oedema puncture (CMOP) {{in patients with}} longstanding cystoid macular oedema refractory to standard treatments. Design: Interventional, retrospective case series Methods: Retrospective review of patients with chronic cystoid macular oedema from vascular retinopathy for whom maximal medical or surgical treatment failed and who underwent pars plana vitrectomy and CMOP. Clinical findings, best-corrected Snellen visual acuity, stereo colour fundus photography, intravenous fluorescein angiograms, and optical coherence tomography were obtained before and after treatment to {{evaluate the}} efficacy and safety of the treatment. Results: Seven patients {{were included in the}} study. Cystoid macular oedema was due to diabetic retinopathy in five patients, central retinal vein occlusion in one patient and branch retinal vein occlusion in one patient. Preoperative intravitreal steroids failed for all patients, and three patients also had focal grid photocoagulation. Previous pars plana vitrectomy, with elevation of the posterior hyaloid, internal limiting membrane peeling, and intravitreal steroid injection, had failed in three patients.

40|$|Background: We {{present an}} {{interesting}} case of bilateral retinitis pigmentosa (RP) -associated <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema</b> that responded on two separate occasions to intravitreal injections of aflibercept, despite previously demonstrating only minimal response to intravitreal ranibizumab. This unique case {{would support a}} trial of intravitreal aflibercept {{for the treatment of}} RP-associated <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema.</b> Case Presentation: A 38 -year-old man from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, presented to the UK with a 3 -year history of bilateral RP-associated <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema.</b> Previous treatment with topical dorzolamide, oral acetazolamide, and intravitreal ranibizumab had demonstrated only minimal reduction of <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema.</b> Following re-confirmation of the diagnosis by clinical examination and optical coherence tomography imaging, bilateral loading doses of intravitreal aflibercept were given. Central macular thickness reduced and the patient returned to Dubai. After 6 months, the patient was treated with intravitreal ranibizumab due to re-accumulation of fluid and the unavailability of aflibercept in Dubai. Only minimal reduction of central macular thickness was observed. Once available in Dubai, intravitreal aflibercept was administered bilaterally with further reduction of central macular thickness observed. Visual acuity remained stable throughout. Conclusions: This is the first case report to demonstrate a reduction of RP-associated CMO following intravitreal aflibercept, despite inadequate response to ranibizumab on two separate occasions. Aflibercept may provide superior action to other anti-VEGF medications due to its intermediate size (115 kDa) and higher binding affinity. This is worthy of further investigation in a large prospective cohort over an extended time to determine the safety and efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept for use in this condition...|$|R

40|$|This {{retrospective}} study evaluates {{the long term}} efficacy of pars plana vitrectomy on the preservation of vision in complicated chronic uveitis, including endogenous intermediate uveitis and other entities. Combined vitrectomy-lensectomy was performed in 10 eyes with complicated cataracts, and 18 vitrectomies were done without lensectomies. The mean follow up was 45 months. Additional retinal surgery (for example, scleral buckling) was performed in five eyes. Visual acuity improved in 23 eyes (82. 8 %) following surgery, with 16 eyes (57 %) achieving a vision better than 6 / 24. The main causes for vision less than 6 / 24 were persistent <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema</b> (three eyes), macular puckers (one eye), retinal vascular obliterations (four eyes), optic atrophy (five eyes), and chorioretinal scars (seven eyes). Postoperative complications were cataract formation (seven eyes), <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema</b> (one eye), and tractional retinal detachments (three eyes). The surgical intervention resulted in a remarkable reduction {{of the severity of}} inflammation or frequency of exacerbations, and allowed significant tapering (11 eyes) or withdrawal (11 eyes) of the topical steroids, or oral corticosteroids (10 cases). Pre-existent <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema</b> resolved in three eyes.

30|$|Management of <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema</b> {{following}} viral uveitis {{is always}} challenging and frustrating. There is no standard treatment regimen for uveitic macular oedema.

40|$|SUMMARY Vitreous {{samples were}} {{obtained}} from 41 eyes undergoing vitrectomy, and radio-immunoassays were performed to measure concentrations of the prostaglandins PGE 2, PGF 2 a, prostacyclin, and thromboxane. Presumably physiological levels (approximately 100 pico-grams/ml) were found in vitreous from eyes undergoing cataract extraction. Eyes with vitreous haemorrhage, retinal detachment, or <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema</b> had similarly low levels. Vitreous prostaglandins were mildly elevated in trauma and endophthalmitis and markedly elevated in aphakic bullous keratopathy. The role prostaglandins may play in <b>cystoid</b> macular <b>oedema</b> is reviewed. Prostaglandins are important mediators of inflamma-tion, and the synthesis of these vasoactive prost-aglandin compounds (PGE 2, PGF 2 a, prostacyclin [PGI 2]) by ocular tissues has been demonstrated. Low levels of these prostaglandins are found in normal human aqueous. A variety of conditions in which anterior chamber inflammation is presen...|$|R
