40|$|Abstract – A new {{approach}} to coordinated generation maintenance scheduling (GMS) in competitive electricity market, based on game theoretic framework, is presented. The main contribution of this paper can be focused on formulating the problem of ISO and modeling the <b>coordination</b> <b>procedure.</b> In competitive markets, the objective of generation company (genco) is to maximize the profits. The objective of ISO is to ensure reliability by increasing reserve capacity during peak period. The Genco and ISO determine their own GMS according to each objective, and then GMS of Genco is {{compared to that of}} ISO with ISO reliability criteria. If they are close enough, the GMS of Genco is determined as final GMS. Otherwise the <b>coordination</b> <b>procedure</b> is repeated until the GMS of Genco satisfies the ISO reliability criteria. Numerical results for two-Genco system are used to demonstrate the applicability of this framework for maintenance scheduling problem...|$|E

30|$|Inspired by {{the concept}} of {{reservation}} busy tones which are used in [28 – 30] to effectively mitigate interference, we define the Coordination mechanism (CM) to control the CCI in the uncoordinated scenarios under study. Following our approach, the tagged femtocell user (FU) triggers the coordination of surrounding FBS by issuing an in-band requesting signal to advertise its presence. To achieve that, the victim user momentarily suspend its reception and transmit a requesting signal that surrounding interferers detect [5, 29]. Different from the original busy burst solution whereby detecting transmitters estimate their interference parcel from the received feedback; herein, surrounding femtocells only use the busy tone {{as an indication of}} the nearby victim receiver presence. To reduce the likelihood that multiple simultaneous requests trigger the <b>coordination</b> <b>procedure,</b> an interference margin can be introduced {{in order to reduce the}} sensitivity of potential interferers to the triggering criterion. The beacon power is maintained low so as to ideally restrict the group of detecting femtocells to the dominant set of interferers. It is also worth noting that any FBS that has already triggered the <b>coordination</b> <b>procedure</b> ignores further requests that may occur while transactions related to the first request are still ongoing.|$|E

40|$|Assuming heterarchical {{production}} networks, capacity {{management is}} faced with uncertainties of both network orders and network capacity. In {{order to deal with}} these uncertainties we propose a flexible approach that combines capacity-oriented pricing with two modes of providing network capacity: capacity on demand and network capacity pool. Flexibility of this approach arises from additional degrees of freedom for matching capacity supply and demand. The central problem of sizing the network capacity pool is solved iteratively by a decentralised planning process applying the top-down/bottom-up principle.

We present a <b>coordination</b> <b>procedure</b> that does not require the retail groups to exchange demand information, but does allow using opportunities for demand pooling between them.

40|$|The current {{regulatory}} framework for maintenance outage scheduling in distribution systems needs revision to face the challenges of future smart grids. In the smart grid context, generation units and the system operator perform new roles with different objectives, and an efficient coordination between them becomes necessary.

30|$|This {{scenario}} {{is represented by}} the IP 5 wherein transmitters {{decide whether or not to}} coordinate based on their interference contribution to the aggregate CCI at the tagged receiver [7]. Working under the assumption that Υ 2 is met, the <b>coordination</b> <b>procedure</b> is carried out in the two following steps. After detecting the tagged receiver, intending transmitters rely on the channel reciprocity and use the received beacon strength to estimate their channel attenuation to that victim receiver. Thereafter, transmitters adapt their link to meet the minimum requirement of their desired receivers and still being able to transmit together with the tagged link. The standard power control (PC) algorithm is used by FU to adjust their power so as to compensate for the desired receiver channel attenuations [32]. We assume that FU are uniformly distributed within the transmission range of serving cells which schedule a random user in every transmission interval. The transmit power is set as a function of the distance between transmitter and receiver pairs, but independently of the interference at that receiver.|$|E

40|$|Problems of {{population}} settlement, urbanization, industrial development, technology advancement, and the depletion and dissipation {{of the natural}} resources of Washington state have initiated a variety of responses from the legislature in the form of three major environmental statutes. These ares the State Environmental Policy Act, the Shoreline Management Act, and the Environmental <b>Coordination</b> <b>Procedures</b> Act. Together, these acts constitute a unique legislative response among the states in their attempt to channel development through environmental law. It is the thesis of this case study that the legal ambit of environmental management is the continuing interaction involving the legislative intent, administrative implementation, and judicial interpretation of environmental law. The purpose of this case study is to describe this legal ambit by examining the acts themselves, their administrative guidelines, and a corpus of case arising from their implementation 1 and to suggest a coordinated administrative scheme whereby the intent of these three unique statutes can be more fully realized.
