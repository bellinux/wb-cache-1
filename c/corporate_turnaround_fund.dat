40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to identify the determinants of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> feasibility and their effect (in terms of their state of existence and their existence) on the probability of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> feasibility in Successful and Non Successful Turnaround Companies. The other objective was the development of an empirical model of the determinants of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> feasibility capable of predicting the feasibility of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnarounds.</b> One hundred 2 ̆ 7 troubled companies 2 ̆ 7 were identified out of two hundred and eleven publicly listed companies of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange through observations of their share price performance, earnings before interest and tax, earnings after interest and tax and by the Malaysian Z- Score (PNB Score) failure detection model test. They were further demarcated into 57 Successful Turnaround Companies (STC) and 43 Non Successful Turnaround Companies (NSTC). These two groups were then compared on the determinants of turnaround feasibility. The study confirms that the feasibility of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> of an organisation is dependent on the existence (exists or non existant) and the state of existence (whether favourable or non favourable) of a set of variables or determinants of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> feasibility i. e. Causes of Decline, Severity of Crisis, Company 2 ̆ 7 s Historical Strategy, Industry Characteristics, Company 2 ̆ 7 s Cost Price Structure, Commitment of Shareholders, Commitment of Bankers, Commitment of Creditors, Commitment of Employees, New Competent Management, Viable Core Business, Bridge Capital and Realistic Turnaround Plan. In identifying the existence and the state of existence of the key determinants of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> feasibility in the STC and the NSTC, {{it was found that the}} STC had higher occurrences of favourable states of existence for the key determinants than the NSTC. STC 2 ̆ 7 s were also found to experience higher occurrences of existence (exists) in the key determinants compared to the NSTC. A 2 ̆ 7 <b>Corporate</b> <b>Turnaround</b> Feasibility Intensity Model 2 ̆ 7 was developed to test <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> feasibility intensity level. Subsequently, the empirical model or the multivariate logistic regression model was then applied to finalise and reaffirm the feasibility of the <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> of the organisation. The qualitative and empirical models complement each other in their application, or used on their own can test the feasibility of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround.</b> The availability of both qualitative and empirical models above to test and to predict the feasibility of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> from this research can help solve one of the biggest dilemmas facing numerous shareholders, top management, management consultants and bankers, namely, deciding whether to go ahead with the turnaround process or not. The models can help save costly errors in terms of money, labour cost, psychological turmoil, time and wasteful resources due to wrong decision making. They also constitute a new contribution to knowledge...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} knowledge-based perspective on <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround.</b> In this research it is proposed that subverting existing knowledge {{is as much}} a part of the <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> process as other change management activities, a concept termed “dialogic knowledge subversion”. Conceptual development was supported by a literature review into change, knowledge, discourse and Bakhtinian theories. This theoretical investigation was further developed using two empirical studies. The first empirical work focused on the case study of an organisation which had turned itself around. Findings from fifteen interviews and a focus group workshop were gathered and analysed using story network architecture and dialogic concepts. The data was further developed with a second empirical study, which investigated <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> from the perspective of twelve expert practitioners. Findings from these studies were used to develop a model for knowledge subversion in <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> situations. There are a number of contributions to change management theory and practice offered by this investigation. The research finds that dialogic knowledge subversion is present and required in the process of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround.</b> Furthermore, practitioners use the breakdown of existing knowledge in the organisation to create the impetus for change and build momentum for the turnaround. Indeed the research suggests that experts regard knowledge subversion as essential to the change process and actively create the conditions where it thrives. A dialogic knowledge subversion model for <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> is proposed, which is a resource for change theorists and practitioners alike...|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{this work}} {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} status quo on turnaround research, integrating findings from relevant research streams and theoretical lenses. This article contributes to <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> research {{as a part of the}} organizational change theory as the first to consolidate and structure over 260 relevant publications according to a holistic framework, further detailing operational and strategic turnaround. We account for the different facets of content, process, and context research to bridge the gap between mostly detached substreams. Further, the review focuses on the meta-topic of measuring <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> success and aims to provide a basis for the prospective second “high tide” of turnaround research, most likely resulting from the recent global financial crises. The study summarizes the last decades of relevant research, builds on existing reviews on the matter, pinpoints still unsolved and contradicting topics, identifies important gaps, and defines an agenda for future research.|$|R

30|$|Scholars {{from various}} fields have {{steadily}} enhanced {{our understanding of}} the topic based on this initial trend in publications, yielding many findings and definitions. Generally, turnaround can be defined as “a decline and recovery from distress” (Schendel et al. 1976). Grounded in the first conceptual discussions by Hofer (1980) or Bibeault (1982), <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> literature generally clusters organizational responses during distress as either “operational” or “strategic” in nature (Eichner 2010; Hambrick and Schecter 1983; Ofek 1993; Pearce and Robbins 1993; Schendel et al. 1976; Trahms et al. 2013). Although some works integrate such new facets as different process stages (Chowdhury 2002) or contextual interdependencies (Castrogiovanni and Bruton 2000), <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> research seems to adhere to this dichotomous categorization of organizational change. The initial reviews by Pearce and Robbins (1993) and Pandit (2000) reinforce this concept, and even more recent works sort these findings accordingly, such as the overview presented by Trahms et al. (2013).|$|R
40|$|<b>Corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> {{research}} has described retrenchment and recovery as contradictory forces {{that should be}} addressed separately. While a few scholars have argued that retrenchment and recovery are interrelated and {{may have to be}} integrated, others have contended that such arguments are flawed since they downplay the contradictions between the two activities. In this paper, we clarify the nature of the retrenchment–recovery interrelations, as well as their importance for turnaround performance. Drawing on the paradox literature, we argue that retrenchment and recovery form a duality: they are both contradictory and complementary. Integrating the two activities allows turnaround firms to create benefits that exceed the costs of their integration, which affects turnaround performance positively. We test our arguments through an empirical study of 107 Central European turnaround initiatives and find evidence for the assumed duality between retrenchment and recovery. Our main contribution is integrating the hitherto disparate theory perspectives of <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> into an overarching framework...|$|R
40|$|<b>Corporate</b> <b>turnaround,</b> in {{comparison}} to financial distress, is not substantially researched either internationally or locally in South Africa. This study attempts to explore this area of research by developing models that identify financially distressed companies with a potential for turnaround. This analysis examines listed companies on both the JSE Securities Exchange ('JSE') and Alternative Exchange ('AltX') for the period 2007 to 2014 by using available data from iNet BFA. The financial distress model, Taffler's Z-score, is used to identify companies that fall within the sample.

The first model shows that efficiency is a key driver for a successful turnaround. The second model reveals that JSE-listed companies are more likely to survive than AltX companies.

We contribute to turnaround literature by offering a consolidation of 262 publications across multiple research streams and theoretical perspectives, guided by a comprehensive framework. Resorting to the more detailed corporate restructuring research classifications, we can overcome the potential shortcomings of a merely dichotomous classification according to “operational” and “strategic” turnaround actions and provide a more {{detailed analysis of the}} numerous facets of <b>turnaround</b> during <b>corporate</b> distress. The review holistically approaches the topic and considers a broad range of substreams on turnaround content, processes, and contexts, as well as the interdependencies between the various disciplines. We propose a research agenda based on a comprehensive review, by deriving potential research opportunities from systematically identified gaps in <b>corporate</b> <b>turnaround</b> research. Specifically, we discuss challenges in accurately measuring turnaround outcomes by contrasting the success measures employed by different research streams.
