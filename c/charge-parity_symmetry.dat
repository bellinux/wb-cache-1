In the early universe, it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented, and the disappearance of antimatter requires an asymmetry in physical laws called CP (<b>charge-parity)</b> <b>symmetry</b> violation, which can be obtained from the Standard Model, but at this time the apparent asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe {{is one of the great}} unsolved problems in physics.

The strong magnetic field and the QCD vacuum can both completely be produced in the noncentral nuclear-nuclear collision. Basing on the theory of Kharzeev,Mclerran and Warringa, we use the Wood-Saxon nucleon distribution to replace that of the uniform distribution to improve the magnetic field calculation method of the noncentral collision. The chiral magnetic field distribution at LHC(Large Hadron Collider) energy regions are predicted.

In this paper, we discuss different sources of systematic uncertainties, paying special attention to those arising from nuclear effects and detector response. By analyzing nuclear effects we show the importance of developing accurate theoretical models, capable to provide quantitative description of neutrino cross sections, together with the relevance of their implementation in Monte Carlo generators and extensive testing against lepton-scattering data.

40|$|Axions are {{hypothetical}} particles {{related to}} the violation of the <b>charge-parity</b> <b>symmetry,</b> being the most prone candidates for dark matter. Multiple attempts to prove their existence are currently performed in different physical systems. Here, we anticipate {{the possibility of the}} axions coupling to the electrostatic (Langmuir) modes of a strongly magnetized plasma, by showing that a new quasi-particle can be defined, the axion-plasmon polariton. The excitation of axions can be inferred from the pronounced modification of the dispersion relation of the Langmuir waves, a feature that we estimate to be accessible in state-of-the-art plasma-based experiments. We further show that, under extreme density and magnetic field conditions (e. g. at the interior of dense neutron stars), the axion-plasmon polariton becomes dynamically unstable, similarly to the case of the Jeans instability occurring in self-gravitating fluids. This latter result anticipates a plausible mechanism to the creation of axion-like particles in the universe.

40|$|Violation of <b>charge-parity</b> (CP) <b>symmetry</b> {{gives rise}} to a {{fundamental}} matter-antimatter asymmetry. However, this underlying distinction appears obscured in experiments, in part due to differences in the hadronisation process of quarks and antiquarks from proton-proton collisions leading to a production asymmetry, and due to the detection asymmetry resulting from differences in the nuclear interactions with detector material. Quantifying these effects is necessary to disentangle them from the fundamental CP asymmetry, and accordingly correct the measured raw asymmetry. Another strategy involves cancelling out the detection and production effects by taking the difference of the raw asymmetries of two decay modes [3, 6]...|$|R

40|$|We derive {{transport}} equations for fermionic {{systems with}} a space-time dependent mass matrix in flavor space allowing for complex elements leading to CP violation required for electroweak baryogenesis. By constructing appropriate projectors in flavor {{space of the}} relevant tree level Kadanoff-Baym equations, we split the constraint equations into "diagonal" and "transversal" parts in flavor space, and show that they decouple. While the diagonal densities exhibit standard dispersion relations at leading order in gradients, the transverse densities exhibit a novel on-shell structure. Next, the kinetic equations are considered to second order in gradients and the CP-violating source terms are isolated. This requires a thorough discussion of a flavor independent definition of <b>charge-parity</b> <b>symmetry</b> operation. To make a link with baryogenesis in the supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, we construct the Green functions for the leading order kinetic operator and solve the kinetic equations for two mixing fermions (charginos).

Our approach takes into account the effects of final-state interactions between the struck nucleon and the residual nucleus, neglected in the impulse approximation, through a generalization of the spectral function formalism. The calculated electron-scattering cross sections turn out to be in very good agreement with the available data over a broad kinematical region. The impact of nuclear effects on the reconstruction of neutrino energy in charged-current quasielastic processes is also studied, and {{the results of}} our approach are compared to the predictions of the relativistic Fermi gas model, routinely employed in most Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|LHCb is a {{precision}} heavy-flavour experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and in 2011 collected just over 1 fb- 1 of data at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 7 TeV. The Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors allow LHCb to identify charged hadrons by measuring their velocity. The system uses Hybrid Photon Detectors to detect rings of single photons emitted by particles travelling through the RICH radiators. The performance-monitoring of these photon detectors whilst data-taking is presented and discussed. LHCb aims to perform precise measurements of Charge-Parity violation in B and D mesons. The final state of B 0 → J/Ψ(→μ=μ-) K*(→K=π-) is an admixture of parity-odd and parity-even final states, which are either longitudinally or transversely polarized. These contributions can be separated by performing an angular analysis. The polarization amplitudes and {{phases of the}} final state are measured. No difference is observed between the B 0 and B 0 flavour eigenstates which indicates that <b>Charge-Parity</b> <b>symmetry</b> has been conserved. The ambiguity in the measurement of the strong phase has been resolved by studying the P-wave and S-wave interference in the K/π mass system.

40|$|We {{discovered}} a chiral behavior of Friedel oscillations (FOs), which have both triangular symmetry and inverse chirality from chiral charge-density waves (CDWs) in 1 T-TiSe 2 by using {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM). Surprisingly, the existence of FOs with the opposite chirality to the underlying CDWs suggests that the excess electron induced by impurity reduces the local helicity of CDWs without CDW breaking. This FOs can be explained with a two-branch model with different chiralities, which permits excitation from one branch to another, that is, Dirac-type dispersion. Moreover, we found two states that correspond to electron addition and electron removal. In terms of the chirality of electrons, these two states are the same.

40|$|One common way {{to define}} {{spontaneous}} symmetry breaking involves explicit symmetry breaking. This definition {{can be used}} in any approach to Effective Field Theory, from perturbation theory to lattice simulations. It allows us to study the spontaneous breakdown of global symmetries without assuming that the local gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is important since perturbation theory is insufficient to study extended Higgs sectors: it is insufficient to predict the physical spectrum of the SU(5) Grand Unified Theory (Georgi-Glashow) or to predict the spontaneous breakdown of global symmetries. We also study background symmetries: these are symmetries that despite they are already explicitly broken, can be still spontaneously broken. We analyse examples where a background CP (<b>charge-parity)</b> <b>symmetry</b> is not spontaneously broken: in the Standard Model, in rephasing symmetries and in geometrical CP-violation. We show that all fields are real representations of the group of symmetries, since CP is a unitary transformation. There are consequences: to study accidental symmetries (e. g. custodial symmetry, pseudo-golstone bosons) we must consider real representations; CP is a symmetry of order 4 if the neutrinos are Majorana particles and the notion of CP-violating phases is inconsistent in some Lagrangians; a recent claim that a toy model exhibits physical CP-violation while the CP symmetry is conserved by the Lagrangian and the vacuum is false.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a three-year, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). There are two {{components}} to this work. The first is a {{development of a new}} detection scheme for neutrinos. The observed deficit of neutrinos from the Sun may be due to either a lack of understanding of physical processes in the Sun or may be due to neutrinos oscillating from one type to another during their transit from the Sun to the Earth. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) is designed to use a water Cerenkov detector employing one thousand tonnes of heavy water to resolve this question. The ability to distinguish muon and tau neutrinos from electron neutrinos is crucial in order to carry out a model-independent test of neutrino oscillations. We describe a developmental exploration of a novel technique to do this using {sup 3 }He proportional counters. Such a method offers considerable advantages over the initially proposed method of using Cerenkov light from capture on NaCl in the SNO. The second component of this work is an exploration of optimal detector geometry for a time-reversal invariance experiment. The question of why time moves only in the forward direction {{is one of the most}} puzzling problems in modern physics. We know from particle physics measurements of the decay of kaons that there is a <b>charge-parity</b> <b>symmetry</b> that is violated in nature, implying time-reversal invariance violation. Yet, we do not understand the origin of the violation of this symmetry. To promote such an understanding, we are developing concepts and prototype apparatus for a new, highly sensitive technique to search for time-reversal-invariance violation in the beta decay of the free neutron. The optimized detector geometry is seven times more sensitive than that in previous experiments. 15 refs...|$|E
40|$|The {{oscillations}} {{of neutral}} mesons are {{a manifestation of}} the fact that mass eigenstates are a superposition of flavour eigenstates. Since they belong to the class of flavour changing neutral current processes, they cannot be mediated at tree level in the Standard Model and thus constitute a powerful probe of new physics at high energy scales. Violation of the <b>charge-parity</b> <b>symmetry</b> may lead to different mixing rates for a particle produced as a meson or as an anti-meson. The observation of large CP asymmetries would also be a hint of physics beyond the Standard Model. The LHCb experiment, located at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, has been designed to perform precision measurements of the decays involving the beauty and charm quark. In charm physics, the LHCb experiment realized important measurements, such as the first observation of neutral charmed mesons oscillations (D^ 0) from a single measurement. Here, oscillations are suppressed and CP violation is expected to be tiny (∼O(10 ^- 3)) within the SM. This thesis aims to measure the charm mixing parameters and search for CP violation with the decay-time-dependent ratio of D^ 0 → K^+π^- to D^ 0 → K^-π^+ rates and charge conjugate processes. The datasets used in the analysis were recorded by LHCb during 2015 and 2016 in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0. 3 fb^- 1 and 1. 6 fb^- 1, respectively.

The same system can be derived, without phenomenological assumptions, by considering the three-wave propagation in a medium with the quadratic nonlinearity, provided that the depletion of the second-harmonic pump is negligible.

The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developed plan for a world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNE is conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensity neutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstream of the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployed as a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility.

Particularly, the discrete system and lattice solitons are the main objects of investigation in this work. In this thesis, we consider a chain of dimers, that is modelled by linearly coupled DNLS equations with gain and loss terms as analogues of Parity-Time (PT) symmetric systems. We construct fundamental bright discrete solitons of the systems and explore their spectral stability. The perturbation theory is used to perform the analysis in the case of weak coupling between the lattices, which is then verified by numerical calculations. Such analysis is based on the concept of the so-called anticontinuum limit approach. Also we consider an array of dual-core waveguides (which represent an optical realisation of a chain of dimers) with an active (gain-loss) coupling between the cores, opposite signs of the discrete diffraction in the parallel arrays, and a sufficiently large phase-velocity mismatch between them, which is necessary for the overall stability of the system.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provides a copious source of bb quark pairs, offering an excellent facility to study CP violation in the B meson system. The LHC is a powerful pp collider, which will accelerate proton bunches in opposite directions in a ring of 27 km circumference. Protons will collide every 25 ns at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. It is foreseen to start operation in 2008. LHCb, one of the four experiments along the LHC ring, is dedicated to the study of CP violation and rare decays in the B meson system. Since bb pairs are mostly produced in a forward cone along the beam axis, LHCb is designed as a single-arm spectrometer, covering a region of 300 mrad and 250 mrad in the horizontal and vertical planes, respectively. The main function of the LHCb tracking system is to efficiently reconstruct charged tracks, to determine primary and secondary decay vertices and to provide particle momentum measurements. This is realized by a Vertex Locator, around the interaction region, a Trigger Tracker, {{just in front of the}} magnet and three Tracking Stations, just after the magnet. The particle identification system provides π/K separation, performed by two RICH detectors, electron, photon and hadron identification, accomplished by the calorimeters system, and muon identification with dedicated muon chambers.
