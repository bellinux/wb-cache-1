5000|$|Since {{the county}} judge is also {{responsible}} for presiding over the Commissioners Court (the main executive and legislative body of the county), in 94 counties the Texas Legislature has established county <b>courts</b> <b>at</b> law to relieve the county judge of judicial duties. The first multi-county statutory county court (composed of Fisher, Mitchell, and Nolan counties) was created in 2013. In most counties with <b>courts</b> <b>at</b> law, the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the constitutional county court has been transferred to the county <b>courts</b> <b>at</b> law. Unlike the county judge, judges of the county courts of law are required to be attorneys. The county <b>courts</b> <b>at</b> law may hear both civil and criminal matters, or hear them separately, {{depending on how the}} Legislature has structured them (Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Harris, and Tarrant counties have [...] "county criminal courts" [...] or [...] "county criminal <b>courts</b> <b>at</b> law" [...] that hear only criminal cases).|$|R

William Ewart Gladstone gave evidence in the court against a blackmailer who claimed Gladstone had frequented prostitutes in Leicester Square, while the Marquess of Queensbury's libel trial against Oscar Wilde took place here in 1895.|$|E
