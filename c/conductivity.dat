5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical <b>conductivity,</b> the thermal <b>conductivity</b> of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal <b>conductivity</b> to the electrical <b>conductivity</b> {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E

40|$|The {{authors of}} this paper intend to develop a method of {{determination}} of equivalent thermal <b>conductivities</b> for twisted flat windings. The <b>conductivities</b> determined are radial and parallel to the principal directions of the windings. A design has been realized thanks to the thermal modulus of the computation software Flux 2 D using a finite elements method. Following that phase, numerical correlations permitting to express the radial <b>conductivities</b> {{as a function of}} temperature, filling rate and insulation <b>conductivities</b> are proposed...|$|R

The agreement is satisfactory...|$|R
5|$|Around {{the year}} 2000, {{there was a}} wave of {{attempts}} to dope synthetic CVD diamond films by sulfur aiming at n-type <b>conductivity</b> with low activation energy. Successful reports have been published, but then dismissed as the <b>conductivity</b> was rendered p-type instead of n-type and associated not with sulfur, but with residual boron, which is a highly efficient p-type dopant in diamond.|$|E
5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal <b>conductivity</b> are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal <b>conductivity,</b> but negligible electrical <b>conductivity.</b> This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the model}} assumes {{homogeneous}} mixture, {{the theory is}} well applicable to study the explosive behavior of solid fuels (spontaneous ignition of bio fuels, organic materials, garbage, etc.,).

The theory predicted critical values accurately for low <b>conductivity</b> fluids/solids with high <b>conductivity</b> thin walled containers.|$|E
40|$|We prove {{uniqueness}} for Calderón's {{problem with}} Lipschitz <b>conductivities</b> in higher dimensions.

40|$|Simulation {{studies of}} cardiac {{electrophysiological}} behaviour {{that use the}} bidomain model require accurate values for the bidomain extracellular and intracellular <b>conductivities</b> to produce useful results. This work considers an inversion algorithm, which has previously been shown, using simulated data, {{to be capable of}} retrieving six bidomain <b>conductivities</b> and the fibre rotation angle from measurements of electric potential made in the heart. The aim here is to see whether it is possible to improve the accuracy of the retrieved parameters. The scenario of retrieving only <b>conductivities</b> and not fibre rotation is examined but this does not lead to a worthwhile improvement in retrieval accuracy. It is also found {{that it is possible to}} retrieve the bidomain <b>conductivities</b> using not two but just one pass of the algorithm, made on a ‘widely-spaced’ electrode set. This appears to work because the algorithm is still very sensitive to the extracellular <b>conductivities.</b> However, the single-pass method is not recommended because the intracellular <b>conductivities</b> that are retrieved are not as accurate as those that are retrieved in the usual two-pass method, particularly for higher values of added noise. The second part of this work considers retrieving the six <b>conductivities</b> and fibre rotation from realistically large sets of potential measurements and identifies the best data analysis method. It is found that, even with added noise of up to 40 %, the extracellular <b>conductivities</b> can still be retrieved extremely accurately (relative errors of around 2 % on average) and so can the intracellular longitudinal <b>conductivities</b> and fibre rotation (errors less than 8 % on average). The remaining intracellular <b>conductivities</b> have errors that are generally less than twice the added noise, particularly for the higher noise values.

The hourly variation of {{horizontal and vertical}} components of geomagnetic field data of IEEY of the African sector of 1993 was employed. The hourly dip angles derived from electrojet indices were used as input data {{in the implementation of}} appropriate program developed to obtain hourly variations of ionospheric <b>conductivities.</b> These new results reveal that the ionosphere is a 3 -dimensional structure having real values of vertical ionospheric <b>conductivities,</b> as opposed the usual 2 - D approach, which assumed the ionosphere to be a thin layer.

Phosphorus, sulfur, arsenic, selenium, antimony and bismuth also have less stable allotropes that display different behaviours.|$|E
40|$|Studies of the effective, homogeneous, {{dielectric}} constants {{of bacteria}} {{are used to}} show that the resistances of their cytoplasmic membranes are too great to explain the low-frequency <b>conductivities</b> which have been observed for these organisms. This reaffirms the conclusion that at low frequencies the <b>conductivities</b> of bacteria reflect properties of their cell walls. In the organisms studied, the <b>conductivities</b> of the cell wall region are as great as the <b>conductivities</b> of the cytoplasm. This is true even though the ion concentration in the environment is much less than that in the cells. The mobile ions of the wall are presumed to be counterions for fixed charges in this region...|$|R

Moreover, the thermal transport in the BNNRs is anisotropic. The thermal <b>conductivity</b> of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{electrical}} insulators, diamond {{is a good}} {{conductor of}} heat because of the strong covalent bonding and low phonon scattering. Thermal <b>conductivity</b> of natural diamond {{was measured to be}} about 2200W/(m·K), which is five times more than copper. Monocrystalline synthetic diamond enriched to 99.9% the isotope 12C has the highest thermal <b>conductivity</b> of any known solid at room temperature: 3320W/(m·K). Because diamond has such high thermal conductance it is already used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating. At lower temperatures <b>conductivity</b> becomes even better, and reaches 41000W/(m·K) at 104K (12C-enriched diamond).|$|E

5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical <b>conductivity</b> (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal <b>conductivity,</b> second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E

Doping of either cis- or trans-polyacetylene leads {{to an increase in}} their conductivities. Doped cis-polyacetylene films usually have conductivities two or three times greater than doped trans-polyacetylene even though the parent film has lower <b>conductivity.</b>|$|E
