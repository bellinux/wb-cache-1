Specifically, the study aimed at {{comparing}} the trends in feed costs and broiler meat {{prices in the}} study area. The study relied on monthly secondary data from the Akwa Ibom State Agricultural Development Project, complemented with primary data from some long standing feed merchants from January 2000 to December 2011. Agricultural price indices (API) and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) trend estimation procedure were adopted as analytical tools in the study. On the average, cost of broiler feeds increased by 2 %, broiler meat increased by 1. 3 % per quarter. The index of prices received by broiler and index of cost paid out for feeds was consistently below 1 indicating the existence of <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> in the broiler production enterprise. The result of the estimated regression parameters indicate a greater increase in broiler feed costs, relative to broiler meat prices.

A Johansen cointegration test between prices paid and prices received by farmers supports the presence of <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze,</b> since non-cointegration between the two price indices cannot be rejected. In other words, prices paid by farmers respond more than prices received by farmers during inflationary periods and hence affect their parity ratio. Multivariate cointegration tests indicated that forces outside agriculture can explain the non-cointegration between farm input and output prices. These forces are monetary macro variables through the country's macroeconomic policy, such as money supply, the general price level and the domestic product. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the economic, social and {{environmental}} sustainability of the conventional agri-food system has {{and continues to be}} contested within both academic and public institutions. For small farms, the unsustainability of the food system is even more serious; farms’ declining share of profit and the <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> of commodity production has increased barriers to market access with the inevitable effect of agricultural abandonment. One way forward to respond to the existing conventional agri-food systems and to create a competitive or survival strategy for small family farms is the re-construction of regional and local agri-food systems, aligning with Kramer and Porter’s concept of shared value strategy. Through a critical literature review, this paper presents “regional and local food hubs” as innovative organizational arrangements capable of bridging structural holes in the agri-food markets between small producers and the consumers—individuals and families as well as big buyers.

40|$|Significant {{research}} {{efforts have been}} devoted to understanding the effects of macroeconomic factors on the agriculture sector. Analysing the sources of volatility in the industry is critical for designing appropriate policies to stabilize agricultural markets, reduce poverty and increase economic growth. Agriculture is a competitive sector with prices that are more flexible than those in nonagricultural sectors. This article uses annual data over the 1957 - 2004 period and a vector error-correction model in investigating the dynamic effects of exchange rates, money supply and other macroeconomic variables on the agricultural sector in South Africa. Overall, real exchange rates, interest rates, inflation and money supply (M 3) shocks have significant and persistent impacts on agricultural output, prices received by farmers and farm input prices. M 3 and interest rate shocks tend to put agriculture in a <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze.</b> Agricultural price movements {{are a source of}} macroeconomic instability in the country.

40|$|Historically, {{milkfish}} (Chanos chanos Forsskal) {{has been}} the premier aquaculture product in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. However, there are {{significant differences in the}} industry's performance among and within these places, especially in terms of yield. These differences can be explained by different factor (land, labor, capital) endowments and by the fact that producers have generally been responsive to these conditions. In Taiwan and the Philippines, milkfish production is becoming less profitable over time. In both places, brackishwater pond producers of milkfish are caught in a <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> as input costs have increased more rapidly than market prices. Indonesian producers also face market constraints because high regional transport costs often isolate them from major market centers. In response to declining profitability of milkfish, producers have been changing their production techniques and shifting to the culture of other species such as tilapia that currently have greater domestic or export market potential. Although total milkfish production continues to increase, in the Philippines and Indonesia at least, milkfish's traditional share of total aquaculture production in all these places has declined quite dramatically over the last 10 years, and this trend is likely to continue...|$|E

If census data were properly collected, this in itself should not have affected TFP. The evidence for overgrazing and increasingly ineffective predator control was less convincing. For example, there is no conclusive evidence yet on whether game and lifestyle farms exert any negative externalities on remaining sheep operations. The <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> resulting from falling prices and rising input costs has led to an extension of production systems and poor maintenance which will no doubt lead to a further decline in productivity.

40|$|Does {{the current}} global {{political}} economic framework, or more specifically, the <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> associated with primary production, restrict {{the choices of}} Australian cattle graziers in moving to more sustainable practices? It has often been argued by primary producers and academics, alike, that current terms of trade have resulted in reduced profitability at the property level, and as such, have {{made it difficult for}} landholders to shift to practices which are environmentally sustainable. Whilst there is mounting evidence that this is case, there is also evidence that some graziers have been able to adapt to the prevailing market conditions through an ideological as well as ‘practice’ shift. Findings from qualitative research in Central Queensland, Australia has highlighted how ‘cell grazing’ departs from the traditional or conventional aspects of grazing which can be described as productivist, to an approach closely approximating Lang and Heasman’s (2004) ‘ecologically integrated paradigm’.

40|$|Abstract: The {{long-term}} viability of mixed grain and graze farm businesses relies {{on having a}} diverse mix of enterprises with both pasture and cropping systems. Identifying the mix of enterprises and allocation of resources that maximise profitability needs better integrative and interdisciplinary modelling tools. In Australia, farm managers continuously fine tune tactics and strategies to keep their farm business profitable over time. Present climate variability, the <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze,</b> and the possible inclusion of agriculture in the Australian Emissions Trading Scheme by 2015, will require that agriculture in general, and graziers in particular, design short and long-term adaptation strategies. In this paper we describe the development of APSFarm, a more integrative and interdisciplinary whole-farm systems model and its application in a participatory research framework to identify more resilient designs of a mixed grain and graze farm business. In this study, APSFarm was used to model a mixed cropping and grazing farm in central Queensland that is opportunistic and responsive to the highly variable climate and to prices. The whole-farm simulation of different soils, cropping and grazing systems, provides production indices and environmental impacts of the farming system. We used APSFarm to compare current management practices with two alternative strategies: (i) increased land area and resources for the cropping enterprises, thereby decreasing the grazing enterprise; and (ii) increased area and resources for the grazing enterprises. These alternative strategies were evaluate...|$|E

However, policy frameworks for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption rarely take an integrated food-systems approach that includes a focus on production. In this policy analysis and commentary we examine fruit and vegetable production in peri-urban areas of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, and highlight the significance of emerging environmental and eco­nomic pressures on fruit and vegetable production. This examination will {{be of interest to}} other locations around the world also experiencing pressure on their peri-urban agriculture. These pressures suggest that the availability and afforda­bility of fruit and vegetable supplies cannot be taken for granted, and that future initiatives {{to increase}} fruit and vegetable consumption should include a focus on sustainable production. Threats to production that include environmental pressures, together with the loss and cost of peri-urban agri­cultural land and a <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> due to rising input costs and low farm-gate prices, act in combi­nation to threaten the viability of the Victorian fruit and vegetable industries.

This area, at present unimproved, is assumed capable of establishment under improved pastures {{over a period of}} ten years. If all the investment capital required over and above the additional revenue generated by the improvement (assuming no change from present prices) were supplied as loans to landholders, the advances required would range at their maximum between Â£ 8 and Â£ 10 per acre, or Â£l 3 m. to Â£ 17 m. in aggregate, according to the pattern of improvement adopted. Under these conditions farmers would receive approximately 10 per cent return on investment, but if debts were to be amortized as soon as possible, disposable net revenue would not increase until about the eighteenth year.

40|$|Many have {{suggested}} that {{a new form of}} sustainable agricultural productivism is needed in response to the challenges to food security posed by climate change and population growth. This paper employs elements of ecological modernisation theory and focusses on sustainability challenges and solutions, as well as the knowledge networks and production rationale to assess whether the intensive horticultural industry located in the Spanish province of Almería represents sustainable productivism. The Almerían horticultural industry, lauded as an example of neo-endogenous growth, manifests a range of sustainable technologies addressing environmental impacts. Yet, we argue that Almerían horticulture represents ‘weak ecological modernisation’ and its main sustainability challenges are posed by water scarcity, a demand led production rationale and the precarious situation of family farms that at present provide a degree of economic embeddedness in this highly industrialised production model. A competitive imperative yields marketing organisations huge sway in production decision-making, and while a <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> has driven efficiency in the use of farm inputs and product innovation, it has paradoxically made further advances in sustainable water management very difficult to achieve. Transforming the Almerían horticultural industry into a truly sustainable model of productivism would require the concerted efforts of individual farmers and marketing organisations as well as regional and local water governance institutions and land use planning. A significant obstacle to this remains the dominant normative perception that justifies groundwater abstraction on the grounds of its high economic returns and the perceived inability of small farmers to invest in desalinated water or further technological solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} the impact of general inflation on prices paid and received by farmers. Specific objectives are: (1) to test the hypothesis that the farm commodity domestic demand function at the farm level is homogeneous of degree zero in price and income; and (2), conditional on not rejecting the hypothesis in (1), to test the hypothesis that general inflation changes the ratio of prices received to prices paid by farmers because of impacts unevenly on prices and income in the demand function versus the supply function for farm output. Empirical results provided no basis to reject the hypothesis that economic functions determining demand for output at the farm level are homogenous of degree zero in income and prices. A truly general increment in overall price level appears to increase nominal prices received and farm demand in proportion to the general price level but leaves real farm demand and hence real demand price unchanged. This hypothesis could not be rejected based on the domestic components of demand for farm output examined in this study. Given demand and supply functions homogeneous of degree zero in all prices and income, the second hypothesis that general inflation impacts evenly on all prices and income was rejected for the 1963 - 77 period. In that period, national inflation moved upward the supply curve through prices paid by farmers proportionately more than it moved upward the demand curve and prices received by farmers, contributing to a <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze.</b> Agricultural Finance,...|$|E

Marketing IntelliGin presented a unique challenge because although the technol-ogy would be sold to cotton gins, the cotton farmers would end up paying for it. However, everyone in the supply chain could benefit from it. His marketing team was to meet shortly to discuss once again their approach to this marketing problem. IntelliGin is another in a series of technological solutions developed by Zellweger Uster, a Swiss-owned company that is an industry leader in technical instrumentation and process control in the textile industry. They have been proactive in developing HVI technology (high volume instrumentation) applied to fiber analysis in the spinning industry and have addressed numerous quality control issues for textile manufacturers. IntelliGin is a natural progression of process control technology to the cotton ginning business. With IntelliGin, a cotton ginner would be able to gin to buyer specifications, retaining more marketable fiber of a higher quality for the farmer-client.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1969. Bibliography: leaves [136]- 142. ix, 142 lHawaii's {{skipjack}} tuna industry has exhibited {{a lack of}} growth {{during the past two}} decades in terms of quantity of catches. In order to compete with tuna fisheries in other regions the local industry has to make some improvements. To determine the most effective and feasible improvements which could be made, the economic factors which may explain the apparent lack of growth of this industry were first isolated. Population dynamics of the local skipjack fishery was examined to determine whether overfishing existed. The cost-price structure was analyzed in some depth by the cost-revenue analysis method to determine the profitability of potential investment. The possibility of replacement of tuna imports was also examined to determine the market demand for local catches. The results indicated that the catches of {{skipjack tuna}} in Hawaiian waters can be increased and there is no evidence of overfishing. However, the expected profitability of investment in this industry is low. The low profitability is apparently due to the low fish price and high fishing costs. The low fish price results from import competition and the market structure, while the high fishing costs are due to the labor- 1. ntensive fishing technique and the bait problems. This <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> situation, coupled with the increasing investment and employment opportunities in other sectors of the economy, makes the skipjack industry unattractive to both the investors and the labor force. Hawaii's skipjack tuna industry must increase its fishing efficiency in order to induce new investment in the industry, and to compete with tuna fisheries in other regions. The industry's fishing efficiency should be improved by the adoption of new fishing techniques in the long run. More immediate improvement should come from lessening the existing problems of bait supply and handling, increasing the availability of funds for new-boat construction within the state's loan program and improving the marketing efficiency of the industry...|$|E

The <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> stemming from trade liberalization places farmers in a {{race to the bottom}} that leads to displacement, poverty, and environmental degradation. Scholars and activists have proposed that alternative trade initiatives offer a unique opportunity to reverse this trend by harnessing the power of the markets to reward producers of goods with embedded superior cultural, environmental, and social values. Alternative trade via certification schemes have become a de facto prescription for any location where {{there is a need to}} conciliate economic interest with conservation imperatives. ^ Partnerships among commodity production farmers, elite manufacturers and wealthy northern consumers/activists do not necessarily have win-win outcomes. Paradoxically, the partnerships of farmers with external agencies have unexpected results. These partnerships develop into dependent relationships that become unsustainable in the absence of further transfers of capital. The institutions born of these partnerships are fragile. When these fledging institutions fail, farmers are left in the same situation that they were before the partnership, with only minor improvements to show after spending considerable amounts of social and financial capital. ^ I hypothesize that these failures are born out of a belief in a universal understanding of sustainability. A discursive emphasis on consensus, equity and mutual benefit hides the fact that what for consumers it is a matter of choice, for producers is a matter of survival. The growth in consumers’ demand for certified products creates a race for farmers to meet these standards. My findings suggest that this race generates economically perverse effects. First, producers enter into a certification treadmill. Second, the local need for economic sustainability is ignored. Third, commodity based alternative trade schemes increase the exposure of communities to global shocks. I conclude by calling for a careful reassessment of sustainable development projects that promote certification schemes. The designers and implementers of these programs must include farmers’ agenda in the planning of these programs. ...|$|E
40|$|From 1945 to 1972 Iowa farmers remade their {{landscape}} {{in the image}} of an industrial model characterized by large-scale production, the substitution of capital for labor, strict cost accounting, specialization, and efficiency. Farm families were leaders in adopting new technology to solve their problems in the post World War II period, a contrast to the pre-war years when experts such as college educated professionals, journalists, and industry leaders advocated the application of industrial ideals to agriculture. Many farmers industrialized production because of a persistent postwar farm labor shortage and a <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> in which the prices farmers paid for products increased faster than prices they received for commodities. They used pesticides, fertilizer, and feed additives to boost yields and livestock gains as well as altered crop rotations and traditional cycles of livestock production. They purchased, borrowed, or hired new machines, remodeled existing structures or built new ones. Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s landscape of the early 1970 s was still dedicated to agriculture, but new agricultural production techniques resulted in changed land use patterns and work cycles that would have been unrecognizable to farmers who lived from 1900 to 1945.;By 1972 pesticides, fertilizers, feed additives, hay balers, and combines were common on Iowa farms. While a minority of producers used combines for harvesting shelled corn and confinement feeding systems, the value of these practices for lowering unit costs and maximizing production was proven. Many new techniques that increased production simultaneously created problems. Farmers learned that success in controlling pest species allowed new pest species that were resistant to pesticides to thrive. Public concern over pesticide, fertilizer, feed additives, and manure runoff also led to government regulation that limited farmers 2 ̆ 7 technological choices. Furthermore, as farmers invested more money in pesticides and fertilizer, they found that they needed expensive new harvesting and grain storage techniques to reduce harvest losses.

Two specific periods of conflict were examined, which represented significant attempts to introduce a marketing board as a means to resolve a crisis that was afflicting each industry. Using a dual content analysis approach, this thesis examined the background papers to (i) the Ontario Milk Industry Inquiry Committee, and (ii) the Commission of Inquiry into the Marketing of Beef and Veal, {{in order to determine the}} interests of each of the participants to the Inquiry, in relation to the policy recommendations and the legislative response.;From this investigation, it was discovered that the policy outcomes from each period of conflict were directed towards the combined interests of large scale efficient producers and agribusiness firms. In the dairy industry, large scale producers were advocating a joint proposal that would protect their own interests, while large scale processors were demanding the complete overhaul of the rigid and restrictive institutional arrangements that were maintaining inefficiencies in production and processing activities, and limiting the investment of capital. The state 2 ̆ 7 s response to the crisis was to introduce 2 ̆ 7 enabling legislation 2 ̆ 7 for the complete rationalization of the dairy production process.

The resultant of these low returns has been an increased interest by {{farmers and ranchers}} as to the possible effects of federal income tax regulations on the supply and price of farm and ranch products. Some ranchers and farmers feel that the provisions of the federal income tax regulations with respect to capital gains have tended to promote the movement of excess capital into the agricultural industry, especially the beef breeding sector, through investments by high income nonfarm persons. The overvaluation of resources in the agricultural industry, specifically the beef breeding sector, is evidenced by the low returns to the resources in the agricultural industry. If overvalued resources in the agricultural industry are causing the low returns, the problem to be studied is whether the excess capital is caused to flow into the agricultural industry {{as a result of the}} federal income tax regulations on capital gains. In short, the problem to be studied is whether high-income nonfarm persons are able to increase after tax net income by investing in agriculture. This possible increase in after tax net income to be studied will come through the conversion of ordinary income into essentially capital gains under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The study will also include the effect of different systems of farm organization of after tax net income of ranch and farm owner- operators. The objectives of this study are: 1. To determine the effects of Section 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code on farm and ranch owner-operators. 2. To study the possibility of Section 1231 as an incentive for high income nonfarm individuals investing in a large ranch. 3. To determine the effects of variations in ranch and farm organization of the after tax income of the large ranch owner-operator, and of high income nonfarm persons who invest in a large ranch.

40|$|Sustainable {{agricultural}} {{research and education}} have gained acceptability within the land-grant system {{in less than a}} decade, an impressive change. Attitudes were changed by a set of forces which include lobbying by sustainable agriculture advocates, requests from farmers {{as a result of the}} <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> of the early 1980 's, changing demands for both environmental quality and less pesticide residues from food consumers, and the availability of new funding sources. Despite its hard-won acceptability, there are tensions with respect to sustainable agriculture within the land-grant system. Sustainable agricultural issues are not yet integrated into the fabric of the land-grant institution. In order to integrate it fully, challenges remain in three key areas: knowledge generation, research and education, and funding. The challenge to generate new knowledge embraces not only biological and ecological systems, but also the socioeconomic systems of the humans who manage agriculture. We must move beyond anecdotal evidence of biological integration efficiencies to scientific understanding of the underlying processes and opportunities for human intervention. The biological research agenda covers a plethora of plant-animal-environment interactions from the microbial level on upward. Socioeconomic research must grapple with human motivations to change farming methods, as well as the likely impacts of change on farmers, consumers, other species, and the quality of the environment in which we live. One important area for such knowledge-generation is the relative merits of government policy tools, which have been and will continue to be central to environmental quality assurance. Attempts to generate new sustainable agriculture knowledge have already begun to raise new challenges for the integration of research and education. Research trials conducted off the research station pose new quandaries for scientific analysis and validation. Having farmers set the research and outreach agenda can be threatening to land-grant personnel as the old distinction between research and extension begins to dissolve. This situation is complicated by the budgetary stress on land-grant institutions and uncertainty about the dividing line between public and private responsibilities in a rapidly changing agricultural business environment. Funding is the third area where more integration into the land-grant university is needed. Earmarked funding for sustainable agriculture has helped to legitimize it in the land-grant university. But earmarked funding is a two-edged sword. If sustainable agriculture fails to become integrated into the routine land-grant agenda for research and education, it will lose its newly gained momentum if those funds disappear. It needs to gain full acceptance as legitimate science that will allow its researchers to compete for "mainline" funding sources such as the USDA National Research Initiative grants. Sustainable agriculture has made strong gains within the land-grant university system. But it can easily slip from the land-grant agenda or become co-opted if sustainable agriculture research and education are not integrated further into the system while retaining a clear focus on its original goals.

40|$|The Texas Rice Industry Coalition for the Environment (R. I. C. E.) {{was formed}} in February, 1995. Their stated mission {{is to build a}} {{coalition}} of interests to foster and strengthen relationships between the rice industry and the natural resources of our rice-producing area in Texas. In June, 1995, a series of six focus groups was conducted. These round table discussions involved two groups of producers (from the East Side and West Side of Houston), two groups of environmentalists in the Houston area, and two groups of non-farming Houstonians (adults and children). These focus groups were structured to elicit opinions from various viewpoints concerning the opportunities, challenges, and priorities of Texas R. I. C. E. The goal of the two producers focus groups conducted on the East Side and the West Side of Houston was to determine whether Texas R. I. C. E. 's activities were widely known and to ascertain producers' viewpoints on the coalition's priorities. Producers were agreed on their key concerns regarding compliance with environmental policy - they face a <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> and therefore one-size-fits-all regulations are particularly burdensome. Water quality and quantity were most often mentioned as key factors in the continued viability of the rice industry in Texas. Producers recognize the natural synergy between rice production and waterfowl habitat enhancement, yet they are concerned because waterfowl habitat places increased demands on scarce water. Rice producers are concerned about the public being largely ignorant and uninterested in the environmental benefits of rice production, and they endorsed two-way education between rice producers and environmentalists. No clear consensus emerged in the focus group discussions about the role for Texas R. I. C. E. in lobbying. Some rice producers see education and lobbying as conflicting activities and would prefer for Texas R. I. C. E. to focus on education. Others were positive about collaborative opportunities between rice producers' lobbyists and environmental interest groups' lobbyists. The two environmental focus groups were a mix of bird-watchers, hunters, hikers and conservationists. These environmentalists had a good idea of where rice is grown in Texas and knew that rice production is declining in the state. Their major concerns about the environmental effects from rice production were water usage and water quality, agri-chemical runoff, food and habitat for migratory birds, and trade-offs concerning wetlands. In sum, they appreciated that rice production makes a positive contribution to waterfowl habitat. They were concerned that lost Texas rice acreage will be replaced with urban land uses, thus reducing wildlife habitat benefits. They viewed rice production as being environmentally friendly compared with other types of agricultural production, such as cotton farming. They were favorably impressed that rice producers were taking the initiative to form a coalition. They were anxious to work collaboratively and offered several concrete suggestions about forums and issues for educational campaigns. They suggested that consumptive and non-consumptive users of wildlife habitat (such as hunters and bird-watchers, respectively) should compensate private landowners for allowing access. They acknowledged problems with adversarial attitudes going both ways between environmentalists and rice producers; they brainstormed about how Texas R. I. C. E. could help break down barriers. The general public adult focus group, comprised of non-farming Houstonians, established a general interest and awareness concerning rice production. However, the Houstonians participating in this focus group were uninformed about the waterfowl habitat benefits associated with rice production. They offered positive endorsement of the Texas R. I. C. E. effort and expressed sincere (and specific) interests in educational programming. The general public children focus group included several children from the Clear Lake area south of Houston. These children exhibited a natural inquisitiveness and concern regarding the environment and food safety. They were largely ignorant of commercial agriculture, excepting several recollections of "visits to relatives' farms. " They expressed considerable interest in more agricultural-related curriculum being incorporated into their science and/or social studies curricula. Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|In the past, in some wheat growing {{areas of}} Victoria, {{particularly}} the Wimmera, {{there has been}} almost total reliance on wheat, other enterprises filling a minor role in the farming system. With the introduction of wheat delivery quotas in April 1969, farm operators were faced with a sudden drop in income. The <b>cost-price</b> <b>squeeze</b> has aggravated the income problem. A typical Wimmera Plains wheat farm of 625 acres is small by Australian standards, but {{it has the potential}} to produce 7, 500 bushels of wheat, or more, under a fertility-maintaining rotation. In 1970 - 71, however, farms of this size had, on average, a quota of only 4, 700 bushels. The possible level of gross income from wheat has been reduced by between $ 400 and $ 3, 000 per annum, depending on the comparative profitability of alternative enterprises to wheat. The aim of the study was to investigate two important aspects of the farm adjustment problem on the Wimmera Plains; firstly, the best use of resources released from wheat production, and secondly, the potential for adjustment towards optimal resource combinations. A sample of 20 farms, chosen at random from a population of 129, was surveyed in May and June, 1970. The data collected, together with information supplied by the Victorian Department of Agriculture, provided farm planning coefficients. Because of the relatively homogeneous nature of farms with respect to resource complements and enterprise possibilities, the representative farm model approach was considered to be satisfactory for the examination of farm adjustment possibilities on the Wimmera Plains. Using a representative model, linear programming was used to generate profit-maximising farm plans. Variable price programming was used to study the effect of commodity price changes on income. Because of the dominating importance of feed grains in plans, and uncertainty about their prices, enterprise combinations were studied at both "high" and "low" feed-grain prices. To substantiate the results generated for the representative farm model, five of the sample farms were studied individually. When only the "traditional" enterprises (cereals and sheep) were considered, planning results suggested that the five course rotation, pasture, fallow, crop, fallow, crop, with winter-lambing Merino ewes, is the maximum profit plan at both "high" and "low" feed grain prices. Wheat is grown to the level of quota and barley is grown on the remaining cropped area. Income from livestock is minor relative to crop income, providing only 15 to 30 per cent of total gross margin. However, several alternative (or "new') enterprises which are not vet commonly practised in the area were found to offer considerable promise. Oilseed crops, especially oilseed rape, are profitable alternatives to barley, particularly at low feed-grain prices. Even at the current relatively high feed grain prices, and assuming a conservative yield, rapeseed has the potential to lift income from the 625 acre representative farm model by up to $ 700 per annum. More experience is required with oilseed crops in the area before firm recommendations can be made. Beef cattle, grain feeding of beef, and pigs, can also contribute to increased farm income. Cattle compete directly with sheep for feed, but pigs can be integrated into the existing farming system using farm-grown barley and surplus operator labour. The returns to capital investment in the cattle and pig enterprises were found to be favourable, especially in the case of pigs. If the necessary capital is to be borrowed, however, it is unlikely that there will be surplus disposable income from cattle enterprises during a ten-year repayment period. Gains to the individual farmer from wheat quota negotiability were investigated. The five case-study farms were considered as a "mini-market" for wheat quota under perfect competition. Assuming that the five operators bought or sold quota in order to maximise their income, the average theoretical gain per farm, from negotiability, was between $ 100 and $ 200 per annum, depending on the price of barley. In the theoretical quota market seven thousand bushels of wheat quota were exchanged between the five farms. The return to labour and management which is possible on the typical 625 acre Wimmera Plains farm was found to be below an "acceptable" level of $ 3, 500 per annum. However, at current land values, which have fallen substantially since 1968, the purchase or lease of additional land by typical farmers seems to be profitable. Results indicated that the machinery and labour capacity of the "typical" 625 acre property was sufficient to effectively farm more than 1, 000 acres. Eleven per cent of the 129 farms in the Wimmera study area were found to be smaller than 500 acres in size. For such farms, additional land as well as additional quota would probably be necessary for viability, at least at low feed-grain prices.
