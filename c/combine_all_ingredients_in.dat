Its dynamic relied on self-sacrifice rather than any heroic prowess, and acquired a strong power of attraction in that it fundamentally asserts that anyone, whether illiterate, poor or of the lowest status, is of ‘priceless’ value, and can contribute to the project to change the order of things by putting their lives at stake. The People's War also brought about a wave of ‘Living Martyrs’, who survived the war and who are now busy recording their past experiences.

Methods: Microwave-assisted extraction was applied to extract the active <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> Nanwuweizi and Beiwuweizi, with methanol as the solvent. High performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection ℃; mobile phase: water (A) - acetonitrile (B); gradient elution: 0. 8 mL/min; and detection wavelength: 225 nm.

40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of irradiation of individual ingredients or the whole diet on growth performance in nursery pigs. The response was similar for both trials with pigs fed diets containing irradiated spray-dried animal plasma or soybean meal having increased (P< 0. 05) ADG compared with pigs fed the control diet with no irradiated ingredients or the complete diet that was irradiated. Also, ADFI (P< 0. 05) was higher for pigs consuming the diet with irradiated soybean meal compared with those fed the irradiated whole diet. Pigs fed irradiated spray-dried animal plasma also had superior F/G (P< 0. 05) compared with those fed diets containing irradiated microingredients or if <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> had been irradiated before manufacturing. Therefore, irradiation of certain feed ingredients can improve growth performance in nursery, whereas irradiation of <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> the diet or the whole diet does not enhance performance...|$|R
