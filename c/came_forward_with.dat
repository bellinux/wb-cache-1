5|$|The Czech Catholics, {{who were}} led by Zdeněk of Šternberk, joined forces with Matthias in February 1469. Their united troops were encircled at Vilémov by George of Poděbrady's army. In fear of being captured, Matthias opened {{negotiations}} with his former father-in-law. They met in a nearby hovel, where Matthias persuaded George of Poděbrady to sign an armistice promising that he would mediate a reconciliation between the moderate Hussites and the Holy See. Their next meeting took place in Olomouc in April. Here the papal legates <b>came</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> demands including {{the appointment of a}} Catholic Archbishop to the See of Prague, which could not be accepted by George of Poděbrady. The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May but he was never crowned. Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Poděbrady. The Estates of Bohemia even acknowledged the right of Vladislaus Jagiello, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland, to succeed king George of Poděbrady.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers <b>came</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out from under his blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} divided into three phases, {{expected}} to cost a total of $68million. Phase1 consisted of the prevention of erosion along the shorelines, improvements to the nearby drainage system, {{and the construction of}} dikes and aboiteaux; the work was carried out from 7 July 2008, to 14 April 2010. Phase2 consists of opening the gates to monitor river flow, both upstream and downstream, for two years. Phase3, commenced in 2012, consisted of the bridge's development and the removal of the causeway, and is anticipated to be completed in 2015. Confusion arose {{as to whether or not}} the project would be funded by the federal government. They refused, in spite of an earlier comment from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which had hinted at a possible negotiation. Unwilling to wait, the provincial government <b>came</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> an initial $20million on 7 July 2008, to begin the first phase.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} other points which cast serious doubt on Leod's {{traditional}} ancestry. In 1265, Magnus, King of Mann, the last king of this Manx dynasty died. Later in 1275, Magnus's illegitimate son, Godfrey died while leading a revolt. At least two women later <b>came</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> claims for the kingdom—yet Leod {{and his sons}} did not. According to W.D.H. Sellar, {{it is hard to}} believe that a descendant of the royal line would not have put forward a claim. Another point put forward is that the MacLeods did not adopt the royal names of the 13th century Manx dynasty—names such as Godfrey (Old Norse: Guðrøðr; Gaelic: Gofraid), Ranald (Old Norse Rögnvaldr; Gaelic: Raghnall), Olaf (Old Norse Óláfr; Gaelic Amlaíb), and Harald (Old Norse Haraldr; Gaelic Aralt). Sellar illustrated his point by noting the royal names adopted by the descendants of Somerled (d.1164) and his wife Ragnhild, daughter of Olaf the Red (grandfather of Olaf the Black).|$|E

The father began habeas corpus proceedings against the mother, the grandfather, the grandmother, the great grandmother, and another person alleged to have assisted in the kidnap of the child. The mother did not present the child to the court and so was imprisoned for contempt of court.

25|$|During these investigations, {{numerous}} witnesses <b>came</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> damning testimony, {{almost all}} of which was corroborated by other witnesses. One witness, Captain Silas Soule, who had ordered the men under his command not to fire their weapons, was murdered in Denver just weeks after offering his testimony. However, despite the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Wars' recommendation, no charges were brought against those who committed the massacre. Chivington was {{beyond the reach of}} army justice because he'd already resigned his commission. The closest thing to a punishment he suffered was the effective end of his political aspirations.|$|E

Maxson said that there were many deep depressions in the ground that had been covered by dirt. These filled-in holes, Gunness had told Maxson, contained rubbish. She wanted the ground made level, so he filled in the depressions.|$|E
25|$|USAir was {{a launch}} {{customer}} for the Boeing 737-300, as the airline needed an aircraft with greater capacity to serve its rapidly growing Florida markets. USAir was the world's largest operator of DC-9 aircraft {{at the time}} and approached McDonnell Douglas to negotiate a new airplane design. However, in the late 1970s, the McDonnell Douglas' proposed successor to the DC-9-50 did not suit USAir's requirements. After the negotiations with McDonnell Douglas broke down, Boeing <b>came</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a proposed variant of the 737. USAir selected the new 737 aircraft and the company worked closely with Boeing during its development, taking delivery of the first plane on November 28, 1984.|$|E

25|$|The {{incident}} {{sparked a}} high level of discussion on Internet forums where commentators were split over whether the incident was playful fun or actual assault. In many forums there was overwhelming censure of the Big Brother series itself, with many calling for the show to be cancelled. Subsequent to the controversy the program's ratings showed an increase, however this proved to be only a temporary boost; the show's regular ratings did not show a significant overall increase and the Daily Show continued to rate significantly lower than its competitors on other commercial networks. Network Ten indicated that they planned to continue producing the series despite the barrage of criticism. In the wake of the controversy, several former housemates <b>came</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> descriptions of audition processes that require potential housemates to parade nude, and the frequent occurrence of sexual acts in the house similar to the one that the two housemates were ejected for.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 1910, the Rev. E. A. Schell <b>came</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a {{confession}} {{that he said}} Lamphere had made to him when the minister was comforting the dying man. In it, Lamphere revealed Gunness' crimes and swore {{that she was still}} alive. Shortly before his death, Lamphere had told the Reverend Schell and a fellow convict, Harry Meyers, that he had not murdered anyone, but that he had helped Gunness bury many of her victims. When a victim arrived, she made the man comfortable, charming him and cooking a large meal. She drugged his coffee and, when the man was in a stupor, she split his head with a meat chopper. Sometimes she would wait for the suitor to go to bed and enter the bedroom by candlelight and chloroform her sleeping victim. A powerful woman, Gunness would carry the body to the basement, place it on a table, and dissect it. She bundled the remains and buried these in the hog pen and the grounds about the house. She had become an expert at dissection, thanks to instruction she had received from her second husband, the butcher Peter Gunness. To save time, she sometimes poisoned her victims' coffee with strychnine. She also varied her disposal methods, sometimes dumping the corpse into the hog-scalding vat and covering the remains with quicklime. Lamphere said that if Gunness was overly tired after murdering one of her victims, she chopped up the remains and, {{in the middle of the}} night, fed the remains to the hogs.|$|E
