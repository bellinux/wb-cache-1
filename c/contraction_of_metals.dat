40|$|To {{provide insight}} into the factors causing {{recrystallisation}} of nickel-based single crystal superalloys, analysis of the thermal-mechanical deformation caused by investment casting of these components is presented. Three-dimensional thermal-mechanical finite element analysis is first used to demonstrate that the reaction of the casting and mould-at least in the aerofoil section-can be approximated as one-dimensional. One-dimensional models are then built based upon static equilibrium for plasticity on the microscale caused by differential thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> mould and core, using temperature dependent material properties. The models take various forms to study the mechanical response under different situations relevant to practical applications. The results indicate that the plastic strain causing recrystallisation is likely to be induced during cooling at temperatures above 1000 °C. The relative importance of thicker and stiffer ceramic shells is studied.

40|$|Abstract. During the {{manufacture}} of turbine blades from single crystal nickel-based superalloys by investment casting, recrystallisation can occur during solution heat treatment. The introduction of grain boundaries into a single crystal component is potentially detrimental to performance, and therefore manufacturing processes and/or component geometries should be chosen to prevent their occurrence. In this work, numerical models {{have been designed to}} enable a predictive capability for the factors influencing recrystallisation to be constructed. The root cause is plasticity on the microscale caused by differential thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> mould and core; when the plastic deformation is sufficient, recrystallisation can take place subsequently. The models take various forms. First, one-dimensional models based upon static equilibrium have been produced – our calculations indicate that plastic strain is likely to take place in two temperature regimes: by creep between 1150 ºC and 1000 ºC and by tensile (time-independent) strain below 650 ºC. The idea of a strain-based criterion for recrystallisation is then proposed. Second, more sophisticated three-dimensional calculations based upon the finite element method are carried out.

40|$|Production of gas {{turbines}} for jet propulsion and power generation requires {{the manufacture of}} turbine blades from single crystal nickel-based superalloys, most typically using investment casting. During the necessary subsequent solution heat treatment, the formation of recrystallised grains can occur. The introduction of grain boundaries into a single crystal component is potentially detrimental to performance, and therefore manufacturing processes and/or component geometries should be designed to prevent their occurrence. If the boundaries have very low strength, they can degrade creep and fatigue properties. The root cause for recrystallisation is microscale plasticity caused by differential thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> mould and core; when the plastic deformation is sufficiently large, recrystallisation takes place. In this thesis, numerical and thermo-mechanical modelling is carried out, {{with the aim of}} establishing computational methods by which recrystallisation during the heat treatment of single crystal nickel-based superalloys can be predicted and prevented prior to their occurrence. This work shows that recrystallisation is most likely to occur following 1. 5 - 2. 5 % plastic strain is applied at temperatures between 1000 oC and 1300 oC. This emphasises that high temperature deformation is more damaging than low temperature deformation...|$|R
40|$|Solid-state {{grinding}} of palladium {{and copper}} salts allowed {{the growth of}} palladium/copper oxide interface at the zeolite-Y surface. The hybrid nanostructured material was used as reusable heterogeneous catalyst for selective oxidation of various benzyl alcohols. The large surface area provided by the zeolite-Y matrix highly influenced the catalytic activity, {{as well as the}} recyclability of the synthesized catalyst. Impregnation of PdO-CuO nanoparticles on zeolite crystallite leads to the generation of mesoporous channel that probably prevented the leaching of the metal-oxide nanoparticles and endorsed high mass transfer. Formation of mesoporous channel at the external surface of zeolite-Y was evident from transmission electron microscopy and surface area analysis. PdO-CuO nanoparticles were found to be within the range of 2 - 5 nm. The surface area of PdO-CuO-Y catalyst was found to be much lower than parent zeolite-Y. The decrease in surface area as well as the presence of hysteresis loop in the N 2 -adsoprtion isotherm further suggested successful encapsulation of PdO-CuO nanoparticles via the mesoporous channel formation. The high positive shifting in binding energy in both Pd and Cu was attributed to the influence of zeolite-Y framework on lattice <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> oxides via confinement effect.

40|$|Modelling and {{targeted}} experimentation {{are used to}} quantify the processing conditions which cause recrystallization in a single-crystal superalloy. The plasticity needed is traced to the differential thermal <b>contractions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>metal</b> and its ceramic mould during processing. For typical cooling rates, the plasticity causing recrystallization is induced above 1000 °C, thus over a temperature interval of approximately 300 °C after solidification is complete. The total accumulated plastic strain needed for recrystallization {{is estimated to be}} in the range of 2 - 3 %. Modelling is used to rationalize the influence of mould thickness, stress concentration factor and geometry on the induced plasticity. Negligible plastic strains were predicted in a solid casting with no stress concentration features, as found experimentally. However, recrystallization occurred in thin-walled sections, particularly beneath shroud-like features due to the plasticity induced there. The model provides the foundation for a systems-based approach which enables recrystallization to be predicted and thus avoided in new designs of turbine blade aerofoil. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|Intermetallic alloys {{have been}} {{investigated}} for many years as anode materials for lithium batteries and, more recently, as alternative electrodes to carbon, because of several intrinsic advantages including high capacity and safety. Some of the most studied alloys utilize tin as the active component because of its high theoretical capacity (996 mAh/g) and its slightly higher operating voltage (< 400 mV) compared to metallic lithium. To date, the use of binary lithium alloys as anodes has been limited to the select number of main group elements (e. g. Sn) that can be lithiated at an appropriate voltage with acceptable kinetics. A major disadvantage of binary Li{sub x}M alloy systems is that major phase changes occur during the electrochemical cycling of lithium. Severe volume expansion and <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>metal</b> matrix, which limit the cycle life of the lithium cell, normally accompany these phase changes. The. most successful approach to overcoming this limitation has been the use of intermetallic alloys MM{prime} consisting of two (or more) metals, {{at least one of}} which is an ''active'' alloying element (M) and the other an ''inactive'' (M{prime}) element. During the reaction with lithium, such a system breaks up into regions of Li{sub x}M and inactive M{prime}.

40|$|The {{roofing nail}} is an {{important}} and often a limiting factor in successfully using metal building sheets. This study has been directed toward {{an analysis of the}} problems involved and the comparative performance of typical special nails offered commercially for fastening building sheets. All nails used for fastening steel sheets exposed to the weather should have a protective coating such as galvanizing, and a head which will exclude moisture from the hole made by the nail. The tendency of nails to 2 ̆ 2 creep 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 or move outward without any apparent cause, thus necessitating renailing, has been a troublesome problem. No definite conclusions have been reached regarding the causes of this phenomenon, but some suggestions are offered for its remedy.

Creeping of nails from asphalt roofing and from boxes, however, shows that internal forces are probably of major importance.

Screw shank nails probably creep less than plain shank nails, and it appears that ring shank nails will not creep.

40|$|Ab initio {{calculations}} {{have been}} used to study the effects of hydrogen on vacancy concentrations in αα-Fe and Ni. The presence of H interstitials aided vacancy formation in both metals but via two different mechanisms. In αα-Fe, trapping of H by a vacancy is favourable. However binding of further hydrogen atoms was not predicted to proceed. The thermal equilibrium concentration of H interstitials in comparison to vacancies in αα-Fe is many orders of magnitude higher over a wide temperature range. Excessive H interstitials in solid solution facilitate vacancy formation, lowering the required energy by 0. 79 eV (down to 1. 41 eV). In Ni, a single H interstitial is not expected {{to have an impact on}} the vacancy population, increasing the vacancy formation energy by 0. 32 eV. Two bound H interstitials however are predicted to decrease the vacancy formation energy by 0. 52 eV with expected arrangement along a 〈〈 1 1 1 〉〉 direction around the vacancy.
