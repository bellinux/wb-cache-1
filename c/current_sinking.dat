For the power stage, the power switches are individually controlled by their phase signals using a phase-delayed gate drive scheme, and are turned {{on and off}} in proper sequence to eliminate both short-circuit and reversion currents during phase transitions. For the regulator, the two branches operate in an interleaving fashion to achieve continuous output regulation with small output ripple voltage. Dual-loop feedback capacitor multiplier is adopted for loop compensation and a P-switch super source follower with high <b>current</b> <b>sinking</b> capability is inserted to drive switching capacitive load, and push the pole at {{the gate of the}} output power transistor to high frequency for better stability. The regulated doubler has been fabricated in a 0. 35 mu m CMOS process.

40|$|In modern {{integrated}} circuits, {{electrostatic discharge}} (ESD) {{is a major}} problem that influences the reliability of operation, yield and cost of fabrication. ESD discharge events can generate static voltages beyond a few kilo volts. If these voltages are dissipated in the chip, high electric field and high current are generated and will destroy the gate oxide material or melt the metal interconnects. In order to protect the chip from these unexpected ESD events, special protection devices are designed and connect to each pin of the IC for this purpose. With the scaling of nano-metric processing technologies, the ESD design window has become more critical. That leaves little room for designers to maneuver. A good ESD protection device must have superior <b>current</b> <b>sinking</b> ability and also does not affect the normal operation of the IC. 	The two main categories of ESD devices are snapback and non-snapback ones. Non-snapback designs usually consist of forward biased diode strings with properties, such as low heat and power, high current carrying ability. Snapback devices use MOSFET and silicon controlled rectifier (SCR). They exploit avalanche breakdown to conduct current. 	In order to investigate the properties of various devices, they need to be modeled in device simulators. That process begins with realizing a technology specific NMOS and PMOS in the device simulators. The MOSFET process parameters are exported to build ESD structures. Then, by inserting ESD devices into different simulation test-benches, such as human-body model or charged-device model, their performance is evaluated through a series of figures of merit, which include peak current, voltage overshoot, capacitance, latch-up immunity and current dissipation time. A successful design can sink a large amount of current within an extremely short duration, while it should demonstrate a low voltage overshoot and capacitance. In this research work, an inter-weaving diode and SCR hybrid device demonstrated its effectiveness against tight ESD test standards is shown...|$|E

50|$|Current source density {{analysis}} (which {{could more}} accurately be called <b>current</b> source and <b>sink</b> density analysis) is {{the practice of}} placing a microelectrode in proximity to a nerve or a nerve cell to detect current sourcing from, or sinking into, their plasma membranes. When positive charges, for example, flow quickly across a plasma membrane {{to the inside of}} a cell (sink) this creates a transient cloud of negativity {{in the vicinity of the}} sink. This is because the flow of positive charges into the interior of the cell leaves behind uncompensated negative charges. A nearby micro-electrode with substantial tip resistance (on the order of 1 MΩ) can detect that negativity because a voltage difference will develop across the tip of the electrode (between the negativity outside the electrode, and the electroneutral environment inside the electrode). Put another way, the electrode internal solution will donate some of the positive charge needed to compensate the negativity caused by the <b>current</b> <b>sink.</b> Thus, the inside of the electrode will become negative relative to ground for as long as the extracellular negativity persists. The extracellular negativity will persist as long as the <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> is present. Thus, by measuring a negativity relative to ground, the electrode indirectly reports the presence of a nearby <b>current</b> <b>sink.</b> The size of the recorded negativity will vary directly with the size of the <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> and inversely with the distance between the electrode and the sink.|$|R

40|$|Portable {{applications}} {{often need}} step-up power converters in generating {{from a low}} battery voltage to higher voltages for functional blocks such as E 2 PROM and LCD drivers. Switched capacitor DC-DC power converters, often known as charge pumps, are attractive candidates as {{they do not need}} bulky inductors and cause less EMI problems. High efficiency is needed to extend the battery cycle, and compactness is crucial for portable applications. Very often, the conversion ratio (or voltage gain) should be adjusted according to the slowly discharging battery voltage to maintain a high efficiency. For driving noise sensitive circuits, regulated outputs are needed. In this research, a systematic study of switched-capacitor DC-DC power converters is presented. First, gate control strategies in turning on and off all charge transfer MOS transistors completely for a higher efficiency are investigated. Second, the number and configurations of charge pumps with a 2 -phase clock are addressed. The straightforward criterion is to consider those configurations with the negative terminals of the flying capacitors connected to ground during the charging phase, and a topological tree, the ANTZ (All Negative Terminal connected to Zero) tree, is constructed. All prior published charge pumps are elements of this tree, and the rest are new configurations previously unknown. An integrated charge pump is designed as an example, with a variable gain of 6 x and 7 x in a standard 0. 35 μm CMOS process using only 4 flying capacitors. The ANTZ tree excludes many non-ANTZ topologies that could be useful in realizing charge pumps with variable conversion ratios, and a more relaxed criterion is to consider all efficient configurations, and the CCA (Capacitor Charging Arrangement) tree, is constructed. An integrated charge pump with variable conversion ratios of 4 x/ 5 x/ 6 x/ 7 x/ 8 x for LCD driver applications is designed and tested. Third, to further reduce the number of flying capacitors as well as related package pins, charge pumps operating with multiphase are proposed. A 3 / 4 -phase charge pump with variable conversion ratios of 4 x/ 5 x/ 6 x/ 7 x is demonstrated for LCD driver applications. It requires only 3 off-chip flying capacitors and 5 package pins, which is the most component-efficient design among published literatures. Fourth, to minimize the effects on voltage gain and efficiency due to the parasitic capacitors of on-chip flying capacitors, a 3 -phase charge recycling scheme (CRS) is proposed. Charge redistribution loss of parasitic capacitors is reduced, which help to enhance efficiency with bottom-plate CRS, or both efficiency and voltage gain with top-plate CRS. An interleaving multi-branch topology is also suggested to increase the effective switching frequency and thus greatly suppress output voltage ripples. Fifth, to suppress switching noise and reversion leakage in dual-branch voltage doublers delivering hundreds of mA, phase delay control is proposed. Power switches are individually controlled by their lossless phase signals, and are turned on and off in proper sequence to eliminate both short-circuit and reverse leakage during phase transitions. Power transistors are partitioned into smaller groups with scheduled delay to further reduce switching noise in light load conditions. A 4 -phase driving scheme is proposed that allow interleaving the dual-branch charge pump to work with continuous input and output charging currents, further reducing switching noise. Sixth, the interleaving driving scheme is employed to a regulated voltage doubler with area-efficient continuous output regulation (COR). Dual-loop feedback capacitor multiplier is adopted for loop compensation and a super buffer with excellent <b>current</b> <b>sinking</b> capability is inserted into the loop to drive the switching capacitive load and push the pole locating at the gate of the output power transistor to high frequency for better stability. To conclude, this research addresses the important issues of topology generation, control methodology and circuit implementation of switched-capacitor DC-DC power converters...|$|E

30|$|In {{preparation}} {{for the beginning of}} the new setup procedure, after some time of working in the normal operation phase, the <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> will broadcast a RCWK (wake up) message that will be repeatedly rebroadcast by CHs, {{at the beginning of each}} subsequent cycle, with the goal of eventually reaching the sink that has to be active during the next superframe.

The CHs that hear the RCWRP message will forward it until it reaches the currently-active sink; they will also stop rebroadcasting the RCWK message previously received. It is clear that sleeping sinks will have to turn on their receivers periodically to listen for wake-up messages. It is also recommended for them to use overheard synchronization-related messages to remain synchronized with the currently active sink.

40|$|Primates perform {{frequent}} saccadic eye movements (SEMs) {{to sample}} visual information from theirenvironment. These SEMs are accompanied {{in the primary}} visual cortex (V 1) by local fieldpotential (LFP) modulations that precede {{the arrival of the}} visual input [Ito et al. (2011) CerebCortex 21 : 2482 - 97]. In the present study we aim to elucidate how the SEM related LFP modulations depend on theproperties of visual input during saccades. For this purpose, we presented stationary, full-fieldgrating stimuli to an awake macaque monkey, who freely explored the stimuli with voluntarysaccadic eye movements. Eye movements were recorded with a scleral eye coil and the LFP fromV 1 with a 24 -channel linear electrode array. We identified SEM related LFP modulations byaveraging the LFP signal aligned to the onsets of saccades and subsequent fixations, andreconstructed the corresponding current source density (CSD) signal (Figure a and b) from the LFPvia the inverse CSD method [Pettersen et al. (2006) J Neurosci Meth 154 : 116 – 33]. For acomparison we also computed the average LFP and CSD signal aligned to the onset of the stimulusimages preceded by fixation on a central fixation spot (Figure c). The monkey preferred to perform saccades in the direction parallel to the stripes of the stimulusimage. Those parallel saccades (PSs) had a larger median amplitude, velocity and duration thanorthogonal saccades (OSs) and intermediate saccades. We found that the SEM related LFPmodulation was stronger for OSs than for PSs. The CSD signal showed a <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> in thegranular layer, that was observed for the saccade-onset and fixation-onset triggered averages but notfor the image-onset triggered averages, confirming that this sink reflected SEM related activity(Figure a and b, red frames vs. c, red frame). The OSs evoked stronger <b>current</b> <b>sinks</b> than the PSs. We observed a positive correlation between the amplitude of saccades and the magnitude of theevoked <b>current</b> <b>sink.</b> The increase of the CSD signal for larger saccades saturated more quickly forOSs than for PSs (Figure d vs. e). This SEM related <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> probably reflects an inhibitoryprocess because it was accompanied by a concurrent decrease in high-gamma band (~ 160 Hz) power, which {{has been shown to be}} strongly positively correlated to the firing rates of local neurons[Ray et al. (2008) J Neurosci 28 : 11526 - 36]. In summary, saccades causing larger changes in the retinal image, such as those with largeramplitude and/or in directions more orthogonal to the stripes of the stimulus images, evokedstronger CSD modulations. This seems to suggest mere excitation of V 1 by the retinal changescaused by saccades, but a comparison with the concurrent high-gamma power modulation rathersuggests that the CSD modulation reflects an inhibitory process. A possible implication of theseobservations would be that the CSD signal might reflect an active suppression mechanism thatmatches the amount of inhibition to the strength of the visual input during saccades...|$|R
