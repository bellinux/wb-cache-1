40|$|We have {{identified}} addimer <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> as metastable precursors to compact epitaxial islands on the (2 · n) reconstructed SiGe wetting layer, using polarity-switching {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM). These <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> are comprised of 2 – 12 addimers residing in the troughs of neighboring substrate dimer rows. The <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> extend along equivalent h 130 i directions across the substrate dimer rows in a zigzag fashion, giving rise to kinked and straight segments. We measure a kink-to-straight ratio of nearly 2 : 1. This ratio corresponds to a free energy difference of 17 ± 4 meV, favoring the formation of kinked segments. The <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> convert to compact epitaxial islands at elevated temperatures (P 90 °C). This conversion suggests that the <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> are a precursor for compact island formation on the SiGe wetting layer. We digitally process filled- and empty-state STM images to distinguish <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> from compact islands. By monitoring the populations of both species over time, the chain-to-island conversion rates are measured at substrate temperatures ranging from 90 to 150 °C. The activation energy for the conversion process is measured to be 0. 7 ± 0. 2 eV with a corresponding pre-exponential factor of 5 · 10 4 ± 2 s 1. Ó 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

25|$|It is well {{established}} that the macromolecular structure of nonviral gene delivery vectors alters their transfection efficacy and cytotoxicity. The cyclized structure has been proven to reduce cytotoxicity and increase circulation time for drug and gene delivery applications. The unique structure of cyclizing chains provides the single chain cyclized polymers a different method of interaction between the polymer and plasmid DNA, and results in a general trend of higher transfection capabilities than branched polymers. Moreover, {{due to the nature}} of the single <b>chain</b> <b>structure,</b> this cyclized polymer can “untie” to a linear chain under reducing conditions. Transfection profiles on astrocytes comparing 25 kDa-PEI, SuperFect® and Lipofectamine®2000 and cyclized polymer showed greater efficiency and cell viability whilst maintaining neural cell viability above 80% four days post transfections.|$|E
25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} <b>chain</b> <b>structure,</b> such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|E

25|$|Potassium ion {{channels}} {{remove the}} hydration shell from the ion when {{it enters the}} selectivity filter. The selectivity filter is formed by a five residue sequence, TVGYG, termed the signature sequence, {{within each of the}} four subunits. This signature sequence is within a loop between the pore helix and TM2/6, historically termed the P-loop. This signature sequence is highly conserved, with the exception that a valine residue in prokaryotic potassium channels is often substituted with an isoleucine residue in eukaryotic channels. This sequence adopts a unique main <b>chain</b> <b>structure,</b> structurally analogous to a nest protein structural motif. The four sets of electronegative carbonyl oxygen atoms are aligned {{toward the center of the}} filter pore and form a square anti-prism similar to a water-solvating shell around each potassium binding site. The distance between the carbonyl oxygens and potassium ions in the binding sites of the selectivity filter is the same as between water oxygens in the first hydration shell and a potassium ion in water solution, providing an energetically-favorable route for de-solvation of the ions. This width appears to be maintained by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces within a sheet of aromatic amino acid residues surrounding the selectivity filter. The selectivity filter opens towards the extracellular solution, exposing four carbonyl oxygens in a glycine residue (Gly79 in KcsA). The next residue toward the extracellular side of the protein is the negatively charged Asp80 (KcsA). This residue together with the five filter residues form the pore that connects the water-filled cavity in the center of the protein with the extracellular solution.|$|E

As a consequence, also the influence of frozen disorder is still visible above the melting temperature.

40|$|Abstract [...] We {{propose a}} new {{mechanism}} for formation of DNA and proteins {{in the process}} of origin of life based on the discovery of clustered chain of water molecules in water. We suggest that not only was water a suitable environment for appearance of DNA and proteins in primordial times but also that water molecules were their templates of formation. The growth of nucleotide and amino acid molecules along these clustered chains resulted {{in the formation of the}} preliminary <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> of DNA and proteins. This is just one reason why there is not life without water in the world. Our experiments shed new light on the existence of linear and ring hydrogen-bonded chains of water molecules in water. The experiments included infrared absorption spectrum, polarization of molecules, characteristics of first order phase-transition, measurements of heat of vaporization, X-ray diffraction, magnetization of water and self-assembly of linear and helical chains of (H 2 O) n. Finally, we propose a mechanism for the specific conformations of DNA and proteins arising from the assembly of nucleotide and amino acid precursors on the templates of these clustered <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> of water molecules. These results could provide an explanation for the original appearance of the preliminary <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> of DNA and protein molecules in process of the origin of life. Since the probability forming these preliminary <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> of DNA and protein molecules on the templates is very small, so, form of life needs very long times...|$|R

We develop an analytical framework to evaluate four major supply <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> that we observed in practice. We derive the optimal supply chain decisions for each structure and investigate various business environments under which one of the structures is preferred over the others. Our analysis indicates that the ultimate purpose of a product sold in the China market (i. e., whether it will be consumed domestically or be assembled in another exported product) may {{have a significant impact on}} the structure preference. In addition, threshold values exist for several key business parameters over (or under) which certain supply <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> are favored over others. Managerial insights based on such results are useful for multinational firms who are challenged to develop effective supply chain strategies in the region's increasingly volatile business environment. tax-effective supply chain management, international tax and tariff, supply <b>chain</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
