A unit constructed of <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> was prepared so that the arrangement of magnets could be seen and {{to demonstrate that the}} device operated without external power sources. The public demonstration was delayed and then cancelled because of technical difficulties. Steorn initially said that the problems had been caused by excessive heat from the lighting.|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in <b>clear</b> <b>plastic,</b> are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E

5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains often {{takes into account}} environmental factors that affect decomposition. Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.|$|E

25|$|Coin {{collecting}} {{can become}} a competitive activity, as prompted by the recent emergence of PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) and NGC (Numismatic Guarantee Corporation) Registry Sets. Registry Sets are private collections of coins verified for ownership and quality by numismatic grading services. The grading services assess collections, seal the coins in <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> holders, then register and publish the results. This can lead to very high prices as dedicated collectors compete for the very best specimens of, for example, each date and mint mark combination.|$|E

However, these poles are not favorable to a dancer wanting to achieve better pole tricks, as they bend slightly and have a tendency to create a friction burn when slid down with any sort of speed.|$|R
50|$|Oriented {{polystyrene}} (OPS) {{is produced}} by stretching extruded PS film, improving visibility through the material by reducing haziness and increasing stiffness. This is often used in packaging where the manufacturer would like the consumer to see the enclosed product. Some benefits to OPS are that it is less expensive to produce than other <b>clear</b> <b>plastics</b> such as PP, PET, and HIPS, and it is less hazy than HIPS or PP. The main disadvantage to OPS {{is that it is}} brittle, and will crack or tear easily.|$|R
40|$|Children are {{sensitive}} to exposure of endocrine disrupting substances that may affect reproduction, cognition {{and the development of}} allergies and cancer. Therefor it is of importance to strive for a toxic free indoor environment both at home and at preschools. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine to what extent preschools are eliminating plastic to diminish the toxic environment in different municipalities of Sweden. The report will also investigate more specific how an information campaign conducted by the environmental office in Umeå affected the reduction of plastic at preschools in the municipality. The study included three different surveys directed to municipalities of Sweden, the management of preschools of Umeå and preschool teachers in Umeå. Despite the low response rate in the different surveys the result of <b>clearing</b> <b>plastic</b> was positive. Among municipalities of Sweden, 42 % indicated that they have started the process of <b>clearing</b> <b>plastic,</b> the management of preschools of Umeå, 94 % answered that the work has started. The preschool teachers in Umeå, 93 % of the respondents stated that the process of eliminating plastic have started and approximately 2 / 3 of the plastic toys were eliminated. To conclude the work for a more toxic free environment in preschool in Sweden is progressing in a right direction towards a healthier setting for the children...|$|R

25|$|Typical normal {{coronary}} artery pressures are in the <200 mmHg range (27 kPa). The hydraulic pressures applied within the balloon may extend to as high as 19000 mmHg (2,500 kPa). Prevention of over-enlargement is achieved by choosing balloons manufactured out of high tensile strength <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> membranes. The balloon is initially folded around the catheter, near the tip, to create a small cross-sectional profile to facilitate passage though luminal stenotic areas, and is designed to inflate to a specific pre-designed diameter. If over inflated, the balloon material simply tears and allows the inflating radiocontrast agent to simply escape into the blood.|$|E

40|$|A process {{temperature}} of ~ 300 °C produces amorphous-silicon (a-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs) {{with the best}} performance and long-term stability. <b>Clear</b> organic polymers (<b>plastics)</b> are the most versatile substrate materials for flexible displays. However, <b>clear</b> <b>plastics</b> with a glass-transition temperature (Tg) in excess of 300 °C can have coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) much larger {{than that of the}} silicon nitride (SiNx) and a-Si in TFTs deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The difference in the CTE that may lead to cracking of the device films can limit the {{process temperature}} to well below that of the Tg of the plastic. A model of the mechanical interaction of the TFT stack and the plastic substrate, which provides design guidelines for avoid cracking during TFT fabrication, is presented. The fracture point is determined by a critical interfacial stress. The model was used to successfully fabricate a-Si TFTs on novel clear-plastic substrates with a maximum process temperature of up to 280 °C. The TFTs made at high temperatures have higher mobility, lower leakage current, and higher stability than TFTs made on conventional low-Tg clear-plastic substrates...|$|R

25|$|Schiaparelli's output also {{included}} distinctive costume jewellery {{in a wide}} range of novelty designs. One of her most directly Surrealist designs was a 1938 Rhodoid (a newly developed <b>clear</b> <b>plastic)</b> necklace studded with coloured metallic insects by Clément giving the illusion that the bugs were crawling directly on the wearer's skin. During the 1930s her jewellery designs were produced by Schlumberger, Clemént and Jean-Pierre, who also made up designs for buttons and fasteners. Schlumberger's jewellery with its inventive combinations of precious and semi-precious stones proved successful, and at the end of the 1930s, he left to launch his jewellery business in New York. Schiaparelli also offered brooches by Alberto Giacometti, fur-lined metal cuffs by Méret Oppenheim, and pieces by Max Boinet, Lina Baretti, and the writer Elsa Triolet. Compared to her unusual couture 1930s pieces, 1940s and 1950s Schiaparelli jewellery tended to be more abstract or floral-themed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of PBR composition [clear polyurethane (PolyU) vs. clear linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) (top) and black opaque high-density polyethylene (bottom) ] and shape (rectangular vs. tubular) on biofouling and the {{influence of}} biofouling on algae productivity were investigated. In 9 -week experiments, PBR biofouling was dominated by pennate diatoms and <b>clear</b> <b>plastics</b> developed macroalgae. LLDPE exhibited lower photosynthetic-active-radiation (PAR) light transmittance than PolyU before biofouling, but higher transmittance afterwards. Both rectangular and tubular LLDPE PBRs accumulated biofouling predominantly along their wetted edges. For a tubular LLDPE PBR after 12 weeks of biofouling, the correlation between biomass, percent surface coverage, and PAR transmittance was complex, but in general biomass inversely correlated with transmittance. Wrapping segments of this biofouled LLDPE around an algae culture reduced CO 2 and NH 3 -N utilization, indicating that external biofouling must be controlled...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} and radiometric properties of silicon detectors coated with fluorescent thin films are described. The films are deposited from solutions of <b>clear</b> <b>plastics,</b> such as acrylic resins, polyvinyl toluene or polystyrene, and of organic laser dyes {{in a common}} solvent.

Multiple doped films of a few microns thickness exhibit broad-band absorption from less than 250 nm to about 450 nm and narrow band emissions with peaks ranging from 380 nm to 600 nm. Internal quantum efficiencies are close to 100 percent and fluorescence decay times are in the nanosecond range. When deposited on optically denser media, a large fraction of the fluorescent emission is trapped in the substrate. Silicon photodiodes coated with multiple doped films exhibit high external quantum efficiencies and virtually flat photon response in the near UV...|$|R
