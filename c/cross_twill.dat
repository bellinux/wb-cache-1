40|$|The {{results of}} thread {{slippage}} tests {{carried out by}} the method of piercing woven fabric with a cone are presented in this paper. In order to perform a comprehensive analysis, special cotton woven fabrics were selected; these fabrics were manufactured with a constant sett of warp and weft, and with the follow-ing weaves: plain, fundamental twill, shaded (reinforced) twill, <b>cross</b> <b>twill,</b> compound twill, funda-mental sateen, warp rep, and weft rep. The quotient of force F, which is generated by piercing the woven fabric with a cone, and the area P of the hole formed by this cone was accepted as the index which will characterise the thread slippage in the woven fabric. An analysis of the results obtained indicates that on the basis of knowledge of the index calculated, and by knowing the fabricâ€™s weaves, a possibility exists of predicting thread slippage in woven fabrics...|$|E
