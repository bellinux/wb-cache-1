5000|$|El Nuevo Constante was a Spanish {{merchant}} ship that was run aground {{on the coast}} of Louisiana, U.S., after serious leaks had been incurred during a hurricane in September 1766. [...] Much of the cargo was salvaged at the time by the Spanish working into November after burning the part of the ship that was above the water line, but then the wreck was abandoned and forgotten. It was rediscovered in 1979, making it the first historic shipwreck found off that state's coast. [...] Excavation of the wreck and its well-preserved artifacts has revealed details of the construction of this British-made vessel, and of life aboard ship and of the cargo carried. These details have been augmented by considerable documentary material such as the ship's manifest and <b>cargo</b> <b>list.</b> The excavation of the ship was concluded in 1981.|$|E

40|$|This {{summary report}} is a {{compilation}} of six reports previously released on the verification efforts for the Port Simulation (PORTSIM) model, a discrete-event simulation model used for analyzing military seaport operations for embarkation. In addition to describing the PORTSIM verification efforts, the report also comments on the entire verification process, including {{an overview of the}} findings. The six verification reports correspond to the six combinations of cargo types-transportation modes modeled in PORTSIM. For each of the six studies, a simplified scenario and force file (i. e., <b>cargo</b> <b>list)</b> were created and implemented to facilitate verification of basic timing data. The patterns and logic used to compute the timing data were identified and quantified and are included for each of the six reports, along with details on scenario setup parameters. The verification efforts confirmed the accuracy of simulation output results and added greater levels of quality, confidence, and usefulness to PORTSIM. These efforts improved the model and user interface, uncovered and corrected numerous bugs and anomalies, and provided insights into model behaviors and relationships...|$|E

40|$|During {{the second}} half of the 18 th century St. Eustatius became an {{important}} regional trading hub, where European and North American goods and African slaves were exchanged for tropical produce from the neighbouring British, French, Spanish and Danish colonies. The island played an important role in supplying the rebellious British colonies in North America with arms and ammunition during the American War of Independence (1775 - 1783). In February 1781, within months after the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780 - 1784), the island was occupied by the British. Although this occupation only lasted for about half a year, it had devastating effects; the British thoroughly looted the island. After the French ally dislodged the British in the fall of 1781, the Statian merchants returned to business. In 1783 a first shipment of tropical produce was sent to the mother country. During the following years St. Eustatius economically recovered. A French occupation in 1795 marked the end of the position of the island as an important freeport. Between 1783 and 1795 180 return shipments of tropical produce were sent to the Dutch Republic. For most of these shipments the <b>cargo</b> <b>lists</b> were preserved in the old archives of St. Eustatius (1781 - 1828), which are kept in the National Archive in The Hague.

40|$|Propensity of cargoes to {{self-heating}} {{is determined}} by many factors which {{can be divided into}} two main types - properties of the cargo and environment/storage conditions. Some agricultural products are susceptible to self-heating which can cause many serious problems during handling, storage and sea transportation of such commodities. Palm kernel shells (PKS) have been shipped in bulk since 2007 but they are not a currently <b>listed</b> <b>cargo</b> in the IMSBC. PKS are a natural by-product of palm oil processing and differ materially from the palm kernel expellers currently regulated by the IMSBC Code. However, their specific characteristics and negative external influences may cause them to behave like a substance from Class 4. 2 (Substances liable to spontaneous combustion) or MHB cargo. Due to the importance of spontaneous combustion, particularly with respect to the storage and sea transportation of PKS, an investigation has been conducted...|$|R
40|$|In 2013, {{over 500}} million tonnes of Iron Ore Fines (IOF) were transported {{around the world}} using bulk carriers, {{more than any other}} {{unrefined}} mineral. Since the holds of bulk carriers have not been designed to carry liquid, if liquefaction of IOF or other minerals occur it can cause the vessel carrying the <b>cargo</b> to <b>list</b> or even capsize. Since 2006, there have been at least eight reported bulk carrier incidents possibly caused by the iron ore cargo shifting. Currently, the only available parameter used to prevent this from occurring is the Transportable Moisture Limit (TML). The TML is the maximum gross water content that certain mineral cargoes may contain, while being loaded in bulk carriers, without being at risk of liquefying during transportation. The objective {{of this study is to}} compare the three test methods stated in the 2013 International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code (IMSBC Code), which are used to determine the TML of IOF. They are the Proctor/Fagerberg, Flow Table and Penetration test methods. The study also covers recent developments and advancements made in the field, which includes the Modified Proctor/Fagerberg test along with goethite content provisions, which are included in the 2013 draft individual schedule for IOF, and to be amended in the 2015 IMSBC Code. This study shows that the three test methods, stated in the 2013 IMSBC Code, which are used to determine the TML of minerals, are not appropriate for testing of IOF and that recent developments, such as the Modified Proctor/Fagerberg test along with goethite content provisions, permits IOF to be transported at higher moisture contents than if one of the previous three test methods were used...|$|R
