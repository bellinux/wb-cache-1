5|$|In this episode, a {{group of}} demons convene in a {{doughnut}} shop to share stories of tempting and damning humans. However, their stories all seem to include one mysterious figure who <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> for who they really are—Frank Black (Lance Henriksen).|$|E
5|$|Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb {{learn from}} their friend Baljeet that a tool they need for their latest project {{has yet to be}} invented. They and their friend Isabella borrow the time machine on display at the local museum to travel twenty years into the future. Once they arrive, Isabella stays behind with the time machine while the boys enter their sister Candace's backyard, where her sons Fred and Xavier are sitting under a tree doing nothing. The boys {{convince}} their future nephews to be active and in return are given the tool they need. As they leave, Candace spots them and it brings back upsetting memories of never being able to bust the boys. She takes her mother Linda to the museum where the boys leave, right before Linda <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{recent studies}} have {{revealed}} that sometimes structural and functional abnormalities are so striking that anyone <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> Some violent offenders, however, have subtle structural or functional abnormalities and even highly experienced neuroradiologists cannot detect these irregularities right away. Yet, the abnormalities can be detected using brain imaging and state-of-the-art analytic tools.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's the idea, Scraps," [...] {{said the}} Glass Cat, approvingly. [...] "I'm glad {{to find you}} have decent brains. Mine are {{exceptionally}} good. You <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work; they're pink." ...|$|R
25|$|Three new {{exhibits}} {{opened in}} 1995. Animals of the Night {{is devoted to}} nocturnal animals, and reverses their hours from normal so visitors <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> at their most active. Once Upon A Farm was built to resemble an early 1900s farm. 'Primate Canyon features naturalistic, outdoor exhibit areas {{for a variety of}} monkeys and apes.|$|E
25|$|On 15 September 1959, José Humberto Gómez, a local guide, {{discovered}} a false {{wall in the}} cave. Behind it he found an extended network of caves with significant quantities of undisturbed archaeological remains, including pottery and stone-carved censers, stone implements and jewelry. INAH converted the cave into an underground museum, and the objects after being catalogued were returned to their original place so visitors <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in situ.|$|E
25|$|Condor Ridge {{displays}} endangered North American desert wildlife. The featured {{species are}} California condors (the Wild Animal Park {{was the key}} force in the recovery effort for these birds {{and this is one}} of the only places in the world where the public <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in captivity) and desert bighorn sheep. Other species displayed include aplomado falcons, thick-billed parrots, bald eagles, prairie dogs, black footed ferrets, magpies, ocelots, porcupines, and desert tortoises.|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg {{to differ}} with you," [...] {{returned}} the cat, in a haughty tone. [...] "Three heads are better than two, and my pink brains are beautiful. You <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glass, and transparent, too, {{which is}} more than can be said of some folks," [...] {{answered}} the cat. [...] "Also I have some lovely pink brains; you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never. I don't complain, you know, {{at the way}} I'm made, for I've never {{yet seen}} any living thing as {{beautiful}} as I am. I have the handsomest brains in the world. They're pink, and you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
25|$|Bishop-Favrao Hall {{is home to}} the Department of Building Construction, {{which is}} under the College of Architecture and Urban Studies (CAUS), and the Myers-Lawson School of Construction. Much of the {{building}} has its systems exposed so that students <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> and learn about the systems. Bishop-Favrao was completed in December 2007 and is named after Richard Bishop and William Favrao, the Department of Building Construction's founder and department head until 1977.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{server-based}} streaming, p2p-based streaming saves on data {{costs for}} the service provider, {{at the same time}} as the distribution becomes more robust, since it only grows stronger with every additional user. What distinguishes Vnet from traditional p2p is that Vnet allows an administrator to have central control over which movies are in the network and which users that <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> Publishing into the network and access to the network is thus centrally controlled.|$|E
25|$|Taqī al-Dīn {{tried to}} {{disprove}} the widely held belief that light is emitted by {{the eye and}} not the object that is being observed. He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars {{for us to see}} them while we are still looking at them, because they are so far away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> as soon as we open our eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Scraps hasn't enough {{brains to}} hurt her, so don't worry," [...] remarked the cat, which was {{trotting}} {{along in a}} very dainty and graceful manner. [...] "The only brains worth considering are mine, which are pink. You <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A pretty scene, ain't it?" [...] said Mr. M'Leod. [...] "My good lady's {{sitting under}} the tree, and that's {{my little girl}} in pink on the far court. But I'll take you to your room, and you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> all later." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pah!" [...] sneered the Glass Cat, [...] "such {{colors are}} not beautiful; they're ugly, and in bad taste. Please notice that my body has no color at all. I'm transparent, {{except for my}} {{exquisite}} red heart and my lovely pink brains--you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
25|$|This game {{requires}} two players, {{a referee}} and three playing sets. Each player sees only his own board, while the referee <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> both {{and also has}} his own set. Players place stones on their boards, with no knowledge of what other players are doing. A referee keeps track of the game on the central board. If any player makes an illegal move, the referee informs him about it (some play that the referee says only that the move is illegal, while some, that the player is told whether the intersection is occupied or there is illegal ko capture). The player is allowed to make another move.|$|E
25|$|In Spain {{and some}} Latin American countries, Epiphany day is called El Día de los Reyes i.e., {{the day when}} a group of Kings or Magi, as related in the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, arrived to worship and bring three gifts to the baby Jesus after {{following}} a star in the heavens. This day is sometimes known as the Día de los Tres Reyes Magos (The day of the Three Royal Magi) or La Pascua de los Negros (Holy Day of the Black men) in Chile, although the latter is rarely heard. In Spanish tradition on January 6, three of the Kings: Melchior, Gaspar, and Balthazar, representing Arabia, the Orient, and Africa, arrived on horse, camel and elephant, bringing respectively gold, frankincense and myrrh to the baby Jesus. Before going to bed on the eve of January 6, children polish their shoes and leave them ready for the Kings' presents to be put in them. The next morning presents will appear under their shoes, or if the children are deemed to have misbehaved during the year, coal (usually a lump of hard sugar candy dyed black, called Carbón Dulce). Most towns in Spain arrange colorful parades representing the arrival of the Reyes Magos to town so children <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in their camels or carriages before they go to bed. The oldest of this parades is held in Alcoi, Alacant – Alicante (Valencian Community) which has hosted an annual parade since 1885. Sweet wine, nibbles, fruit and milk are left for the Kings and their camels. In Spain, children typically receive presents on this day, rather than on Christmas, though this tradition has changed lately, and children now receive presents on both days. The Epiphany bread/cake is known as Roscón, Tortell de Reis in Catalan, and in Mexico as Rosca de reyes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Pure glass," [...] {{answered}} the cat, {{proud to have}} attracted the Scarecrow's attention. [...] "I am much more beautiful than the Patchwork Girl. I'm transparent, and Scraps isn't; I've pink brains--you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work; and I've a ruby heart, finely polished, while Scraps hasn't any heart at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{really is}} crazy," [...] remarked the Glass Cat. [...] "But that isn't to be {{wondered}} at when {{you remember how}} many different things she's made of. For my part, I'm made of pure glass--except my jewel heart and my pretty pink brains. Did you notice my brains, stranger? You <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it is, partly; but {{it serves}} {{to keep the}} water out in the wet season too. If you watch <b>'em</b> you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> {{building}} the earth up and patting it down hard if it gets broken down. Sometimes, in very wet weather, thar will be a flood, and then the whole lot, dogs and owls and snakes, get drowned all together. Mighty nasty places they are, I tell yer, when they are desarted. At other times you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> plain enough, and can ride through 'em at a gallop, for the horses are accustomed to pick thar way; but {{after a year or}} two, when the grass grows again, and is breast high in summer, and you come across one of them, the first you know about it is the horse puts his foot in a hole, and you are flying through the air. Many a fall have I had from them darned little things." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1966, Wilson {{elaborated}} {{that his}} writing process involved {{going to the}} piano and finding [...] "feels," [...] which he described as [...] "brief note sequences, fragments of ideas," [...] and that [...] "once they're {{out of my head}} and into the open air, I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> and touch them firmly. They're not 'feels' anymore." [...] Mike Love remembered: [...] "Brian is so spontaneous that if there's a piano and two or three people around to sing parts, he’ll sit down and write a song in five minutes. But if you don’t get it right then, he goes off and drops it." ...|$|E

[...] Some of his stylistic markers include slash chords, key modulations, [...] "stepwise falloffs", the use of minor seventh chords drawn from Burt Bacharach, piano triads [...] "hammered" [...] in eighths, and a tendency for his harmonic progressions to wander far from the tonal center. Musicologist Daniel Harrison notes that [...] "even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone." [...] Lyrics were usually written by an outside collaborator after the melody and chord patterns were established.|$|E
