5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, while {{going through}} {{insurance}} papers in his parents' home, Rose learned of his biological father's existence, and he unofficially readopted his birth name. However, he referred to himself only as W. Rose, {{because he did not}} want to share a first name with his biological father. Following the discovery of his true family origins, Rose became the local juvenile delinquent in Lafayette; he was arrested more than 20 times on charges such as public intoxication and battery, and served jail terms up to three months. After Lafayette authorities threatened to charge him as a habitual criminal, Rose moved to Los Angeles, California, in December 1982. After moving to Los Angeles, he became so engrossed in his band AXL that his friends suggested he <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> Axl Rose; he legally changed his name to W. Axl Rose prior to signing his contract with Geffen Records in March 1986.|$|E
5|$|In March 1981, {{widespread}} violence {{took place}} in Bangui following elections, after Operation Caban led the French to drop Bokassa (who had begun to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> Emperor Bokassa I), and replaced him with David Dacko. Opponents of the President met in Bangui and were forced to flee the country. After returning voluntarily to Bangui {{in the autumn of}} 1986, Bokassa went on trial. Initially faced with the death penalty, in February 1988 he was instead sentenced to life imprisonment. His successor was General André Kolingba, army chief of staff of Decko’s army, who took over control from the local French military on 1 September 1981 under the pretext that the country was heading towards civil war. Although he attempted to combat corruption and control the national economy, he was unable to achieve his reforms. By the middle of the 1980s the country’s economic situation had deteriorated as 80% of the revenue went towards meeting the salaries of the staff. Under pressure from France and other western countries, Kolingba restored democracy in the country in 1991 with a multiparty government but elections could be held only three years later in August 1994. During the elections, Ange-Félix Patassé was elected to the post of president. Since he was from northern CAR, the southern group of Kolingba started a rebellion during 1996.|$|E
25|$|Such {{policies}} are {{what are called}} in France libéral (that is, in favour of laissez-faire economic policies) or, with a pejorative undertone, ultra-libéral. Sarkozy rejects this label of libéral and prefers to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> a pragmatist.|$|E

25|$|In 1760, Casanova started styling {{himself the}} Chevalier de Seingalt, a name he would {{increasingly}} {{use for the}} rest of his life. On occasion, he would also <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> Count de Farussi (using his mother's maiden name) and when Pope Clement XIII presented Casanova with the Papal Order of the Éperon d'or, he had an impressive cross and ribbon to display on his chest.|$|E
25|$|After {{the reign}} of Dagobert I (629–639) the Merovingians {{effectively}} ceded power to the Pippinid Mayors of the Palace, who ruled the Frankish realm of Austrasia in all but name. They controlled the royal treasury, dispensed patronage, and granted land and privileges {{in the name of}} the figurehead king. Charles' father, Pepin of Herstal, was able to unite the Frankish realm by conquering Neustria and Burgundy. He was the first to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> Duke and Prince of the Franks, a title later taken up by Charles.|$|E

Tipu Sultanwho became the ruler after Hyder Ali was also very able at military tactics. He defeated and repelled the British several times.

60|$|This {{project was}} no sooner propounded, but was as highly accepted, and forward were all Diabolonians now {{to engage in}} so {{delicate}} an enterprise: {{but it was not}} thought fit that all should do thus; wherefore they pitched upon two or three, namely, the Lord Covetousness, the Lord Lasciviousness, and the Lord Anger. The Lord Covetousness <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> by the name of Prudent-Thrifty; the Lord Lasciviousness <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> by the name of Harmless- Mirth; and the Lord Anger <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> by the name of Good-Zeal.|$|R

25|$|In 1982, Warnke {{began to}} exaggerate his achievements. During the 1980s, Warnke's claims of {{academic}} degrees increased from two Bachelor's degrees to two Master's Degrees to a Doctorate of Philosophy. In The Satan Seller, Warnke {{says he was}} wounded twice while in Vietnam. In Hitchhiking on Hope Street, {{he said he had}} been wounded five times. Warnke followed up his interest in the Syro-Chaldean tradition and his 1970s ordination as a deacon with a 1983 ordination by independent bishop Richard Morrill, lately of the Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc. This ordination allowed Warnke to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> bishop.|$|E
25|$|While at Sagegi in 1958, {{serving as}} a Catholic catechist, and living {{in the home of}} another catechist known as Petrus Pitalis Ogeka, Simeo Ondeto is said to have died for 3 days and came back to life with a mission-focused approach. After rising from death, Ondetto began to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> the son of God. He was now preaching that he had gone to confer with God the Father about his mission and was freed to begin his mission. He {{describes}} a visit to heaven, chats with saints, angels, and God. Simeo Ondetto permitted the baptism of polygamists and the baptism of old Catholic converts without going through catechism training. He also said that he was sent to start a church called Legio Maria.|$|E
25|$|After Grand Rabbi Naftali Halberstam of Bobov died in 2005, {{a dispute}} arose among Bobover Hasidim {{as to who}} should succeed the dynasty leadership; most {{preferred}} Grand Rabbi Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam, while the rest preferred Grand Rabbi Mordechai Dovid Unger, the son in law of the late Rebbe. For seven years, while a prolonged arbitration proceeding at a Beth Din was going on, both groups claimed the rightful Bobov leadership. After seven years of deliberation, Beth Din ruled that only Grand Rabbi Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam, brother of the previous Rebbe, can lay claim as the Bobover Rebbe. However, the ruling allowed Rabbi Mordechai Dovid Unger to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> Bobov-45, {{as long as a}} distinction is noted.|$|E

25|$|Before World War I, Gleizes {{had always}} been {{identified}} as a Cubist avant-garde. And during the twenties he continued to hold a prominent position, but he was no longer identified with the avant-garde since Cubism had been superseded by Dada and Surrealism. Even after historians began their attempts to analyze the vital role played by Cubism, the name of Albert Gleizes was always mentioned because of his early and important participation in the movement. Gleizes had never ceased to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> a Cubist and theoretically a Cubist he remained. In many ways his theories were close to those developed by Mondrian, though his paintings never submitted to the discipline of primary colors and the right angle; they were not Neo-Plastic (or De Stijl) in character. In fact, his works from the late 1920s through the 1940s looked like nothing else that was being done, and indeed, they were rarely seen in the art world because Gleizes deliberately distanced himself from extensive participation in the Parisian scene.|$|E
25|$|In 1619 his {{daughter}} died shortly after birth, {{the only child}} he was to have. In 1620 after the execution of his father he began to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> the Baron of Muiresk, which in Scotland was considered an illegitimate claim. His brother James, though disinherited from the estate, still had a claim to the title, which was considered to end with his death, as he had no heir. In any case Thomas was not the second son but the third. The second (Robert) had no heirs, either, which did not strengthen {{the case of the}} Dempsters. They were forced to accept the end of their clan; that is, there were no further charters to Dempsters from the king, nor was anyone entitled to be called Baron Dempster or use the coat of arms. Modern Dempsters, of course, may do as they please in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they reside.|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{decided to}} raise the Duchy of Prussia to a kingdom. [...] Within the Holy Roman Empire, no one could <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> king except the emperor and the king of Bohemia. [...] However, Prussia was outside the empire, and the Hohenzollerns were fully {{sovereign}} over it. The practicability of this plan was doubted by some of his advisors, {{and in any case}} the crown was only valuable if recognized by the European nobility, most important the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1699, negotiations [...] were renewed with emperor Leopold I, who in turn was in need of allies since the War of the Spanish Succession was about to break out. On 16 November 1700, the emperor approved Frederick's coronation in the Krontraktat ("Crown tract"). With respect to Poland-Lithuania, who held the provinces of Royal Prussia and Ermland, it was agreed that Frederick would <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> King in Prussia, instead of King of Prussia. Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, for similar reasons as the emperor, accepted Frederick's elevation prior to the coronation.|$|E

500|$|Einstein {{spoke of}} his {{religious}} outlook in {{a wide array of}} original writings and interviews. Einstein stated that he believed in the pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza. He did not believe in a personal God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve. He clarified however that, [...] "I am not an atheist", preferring to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> an agnostic, or a [...] "deeply religious nonbeliever". When asked if he believed in an afterlife, Einstein replied, [...] "No. And one life is enough for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{political}} philosopher to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, {{marking the}} formal birth of anarchism {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century. Since the 1890s, and beginning in France, the term [...] "libertarianism" [...] has often {{been used as a}} synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as libertarian anarchism.|$|E

500|$|During {{the same}} period, the Serbian king took {{advantage}} of the Byzantine civil war to take possession of what is now Macedonia, and of most of Albania and northern Greece. In 1345 he began to <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "Emperor of Serbs and Greeks", and in 1346 he was crowned as such by the newly created Serbian Patriarch. These actions, which the Byzantines received with indignation, appear to have been supported by Bulgaria, as the Patriarch of Bulgaria Simeon had participated in both the creation of a Serbian Patriarchate of Peć and the imperial coronation of Stefan Uroš IV Dušan.|$|E

Shobhaa De of the Bangalore Times {{was critical}}, concluding [...] "Let’s hand it to Salman who has pulled off the stunts and pelvic thrusts. Nothing new there.
