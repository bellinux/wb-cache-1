5|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{progress}} accelerated {{towards a}} <b>comprehensive</b> <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> <b>treaty</b> (CTBT). Following {{a series of}} international meetings on the subject, the UN General Assembly approved resolution 50/64, which appealed for states to follow the PTBT and called for conclusion of the CTBT talks. In September 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect for states not party to the CTBT. The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China. France, Russia, and the UK have ratified the CTBT. The technology for detecting underground tests has significantly improved since the 1950s and 1960s, with monitors detecting tests down to 1 kiloton {{with a high degree}} of confidence.|$|E

40|$|Glenn Theodore Seaborg (1912 - 199) was a world-renowned nuclear chemist, a Nobel Laureate in {{chemistry}} in 1951, co-discoverer of plutonium and nine other transuranium elements, Chairman of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission from 1961 - 71, scientific advisor to ten U.

He was known and esteemed not only by chemists and other scientists throughout the world, but also by lay people, politicians, statesmen, and students of all ages. This memorial includes a brief glimpse of Glenn Seaborg's early life and education, describes some of his major contributions to nuclear science over his long and fruitful career, and highlights the profound impact of his contributions on nuclear science, both in the U.

40|$|The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) {{has long}} been the {{cornerstone}} of the international effort to retard the spread of nuclear weaponry to additional countries, now appreciated as the greatest post-cold war threat to international peace and security. Under this treaty, the parties also undertook to pursue in good faith additional negotiations leading to further reductions in nuclear weapons-and, in fact, such subsequent bargaining has recently yielded dramatic, far-reaching successes. Professor Koplow, however, argues that in one crucial respect, the United States has been derelict in implementing the obligations of the NPT: Recent American presidents have rigidly refused to participate in negotiations {{that could lead to a}} <b>comprehensive</b> nuclear <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> <b>treaty,</b> abolishing all nuclear explosions everywhere. Although the NPT 2 ̆ 7 s requirement of <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> negotiations is ambiguously stated, a close reading of the legal materials establishes that it was a key ingredient in the basic bargain of the NPT, and that numerous countries consider it a major, unresolved treaty controversy. Professor Koplow contends that this United States refusal to pursue a <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> <b>treaty</b> is not merely unwise strategy, it is a violation of the country 2 ̆ 7 s international law commitments, exposing the United States to legal remedies and undermining both the global nonproliferation regime and the more general campaign to build support for a new world order based upon greater fidelity to the rule of law...|$|R

25|$|Earthquakes {{not caused}} by fault {{movement}} have quite different patterns of energy radiation. In {{the case of an}} underground nuclear explosion, for instance, the seismic moment tensor is isotropic and this difference allows such explosions to be easily discriminated from their seismic response. This {{is an important part of}} monitoring to discriminate between earthquakes and explosions for the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{underground}} test {{took place in}} 1951; further tests provided information that {{eventually led to the}} signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which banned all nuclear tests except for those performed underground. From then until the signing of the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> in 1996, most nuclear tests were performed underground, in order to prevent nuclear fallout from entering into the atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|Abstract North Korea detonated {{its first}} known nuclear device, a moderate-sized {{event in the}} northeastern corner of the Korean Peninsula, on 9 October 2006. A second one, several times more powerful, was set off nearby on 25 May 2009. Both were {{recorded}} at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by a modern broadband (0. 03 – 30 Hz) network of seismographs deployed since 2004 along the Sino–Korean border, and by station MDJ due north of ground zero. Spanning {{a wide range of}} station azimuth (259 °– 11 °), the near-regional (1. 3 °– 3. 3 °) paths are all purely continental and away from continental margins, making the resulting data uniquely suited for assessing the capabilities of an out-country network to verify the compliance by North Korea with a future <b>comprehensive</b> nuclear <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> <b>treaty.</b> The mbLg magnitudes for the 2006 and 2009 nuclear explosions were determined anew, giving 4 : 32 0 : 13 and 4 : 86 0 : 13, respectively. We show that the MS–mbLgmethod correctly differenti-ates these nuclear explosions from natural earthquakes, although the differentiation was not achieved in studies based on published mbLg values. An analysis of the Pg∶Lg ratio, derived from recordings of the two nuclear tests and of four regional earthquakes selected for their comparable magnitudes (4 : 2 ≤ mb ≤ 4 : 8), reveals that the ratios associated with the explosion and earthquake populations showed surpris-ingly little overlap for a broad frequency range of 3 to 11 Hz. In principle,MS–mb {{can also be used to}} correctly identify the nuclear tests as explosions, but the mb measure-ment for such moderate-sized events is not as robust as the mbLg measurement, rendering this traditionally favored method less practical...|$|R

25|$|The UK {{government}} {{signed the}} Partial Test Ban Treaty on 5 August 1963 {{along with the}} United States and the Soviet Union which effectively restricted it to underground nuclear tests by outlawing testing in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space.

He advised ten US Presidentsfrom Harry S. Truman to Bill Clintonon nuclear policy and was Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial nuclear energy and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the Franck Report and contributed to the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty.</b> He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the Eisenhower administration, he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President Ronald Reagan's National Commission on Excellence in Education, he was a key contributor to its 1983 report [...] "A Nation at Risk".|$|E

[...] Before the end of 1991, China normalized ties with the Russian government's newly elected president, Boris Yeltsin. The PRC also welcomed Taiwanese business as a replacement for Western investment. Further, China expedited negotiations with the World Trade Organization as well as established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea, and others in 1992. Regarding defense alignments, the government signed The Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992, The Convention on Chemical Weapons in 1993, and The <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> in 1996. Whereas China {{had been a member of}} just 30 international organizations in 1986, this membership increased to over 50 by 1997.
