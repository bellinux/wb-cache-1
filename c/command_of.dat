40|$|Guidance command for {{re-entry}} vehicle {{can be in}} lots of formats, but the Euler angles can be provided directly by gyros, so designers used to develop autopilot with <b>commands</b> <b>of</b> Euler angles. After the generation <b>of</b> <b>commands</b> <b>of</b> attack angle and sideslip angle, it’s important to settle how to convert <b>commands</b> <b>of</b> attack angle and sideslip angle to <b>commands</b> <b>of</b> Euler angles. Traditional conversion strategy relies on bank angle, solution to bank angle comprises complicated calculation and can’t be precise. This paper introduces a new conversion strategy <b>of</b> guidance <b>command.</b> This strategy relies on the relative position and velocity measured by seeker, an auxiliary coordinateis established as a transition, the transformation matrix from launch coordinate to body coordinate is solved in a new way, then the <b>commands</b> <b>of</b> Euler angles are obtained. The calculation of bank angle is avoided. The autopilot designed with the converted Euler-angle commands, can track <b>commands</b> <b>of</b> attack angle and sideslip angle steadily. The vehicle reaches the target point precisely. Simulation {{results show that the}} new conversion strategy based on seeker information from <b>commands</b> <b>of</b> attack angle and sideslip angle to Euler-angle commands is right.
