5|$|High Speed 1 {{was built}} to allow eight trains per hour through to the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel.</b> As of May 2014, Eurostar runs two to three trains per hour in each {{direction}} between London and the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel.</b> Southeastern runs in the high peak eight trains per hour between London and Ebbsfleet, two of these continuing to Ashford. During the 2012 Olympic Games, Southeastern provided the Olympic Javelin service with up to twelve trains per hour from Stratford into London.|$|E
5|$|At present, only Deutsche Bahn {{has applied}} {{for use of the}} line and in 2009 {{regulations}} were relaxed to allow its trains to use the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel.</b> Other proposals are yet to be formalised.|$|E
5|$|Eurostar is a {{high-speed}} railway service connecting London with Avignon, Brussels, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Paris. All its trains traverse the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> between the United Kingdom and France, {{owned and operated}} separately by Eurotunnel.|$|E
50|$|The chosen route {{includes}} two new locks, open <b>channels,</b> <b>tunnels</b> and culverts. Two new highway bridges were built, {{as well as}} flow control structures and utility diversions.|$|R
50|$|Stratified {{sediment}} was deposited rapidly on the high-relief erosional surface. Up to 150 m (500 ft) in some areas, the deposits {{occurred on}} surfaces defined by highly eroded channels and drumlin uplands. The <b>channel</b> <b>tunnels</b> were primarily {{created by the}} erosion from glacial rivers, a typical process before moraine formation.|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{developments}} of high-speed trains (HSTs) introduce new challenges to HST wireless communication systems. Realistic HST channel models {{play a critical}} role in designing and evaluating HST communication systems. Due to the length limitation, bounding of tunnel itself, and waveguide effect, <b>channel</b> characteristics in <b>tunnel</b> scenarios are very different from those in other HST scenarios. Therefore, accurate <b>tunnel</b> <b>channel</b> models considering both large-scale and small-scale fading characteristics are essential for HST communication systems. Moreover, certain characteristics of <b>tunnel</b> <b>channels</b> have not been investigated sufficiently. This article provides a comprehensive review of the measurement campaigns in tunnels and presents some <b>tunnel</b> <b>channel</b> models using various modeling methods.

5|$|In 2009, Eurotunnel (the {{owners of}} the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel)</b> {{announced}} that it was prepared to start relaxing the fire safety regulations, in order to permit other operators, such as Deutsche Bahn, to transport passengers via the Tunnel using other forms of rolling stock. Under the deregulation of European railway service, high-speed lines were opened up to access by other operators on 1 January 2010; the Inter-Governmental Commission on the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (IGC) {{announced that it was}} considering relaxing the safety requirements concerning train splitting. LCR suggested that high-speed rail services between London and Cologne could commence before the 2012 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, it was {{reported}} that Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national train company, had applied to use the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> and High Speed 1 into London.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the launch}} of Eurostar services, severe {{disruptions}} and cancellations {{have been caused by}} fires breaking out within the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> such as in 1996, 2006 (minor), 2008 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> used by Eurostar {{services}} {{holds the}} record for having the longest undersea section anywhere in the world, {{and it is the}} second longest rail tunnel in the world.|$|E
5|$|Ditton has {{extensive}} transport links, {{being close}} to the M20 motorway and the national railway network with its regular connections to London. The <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> is within easy driving distance and the village is twinned with Rang-du-Fliers in the Pas-de-Calais department of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France.|$|E
50|$|The {{main river}} through {{here is the}} Tacubaya River, but since the 1970s this river has been <b>channelled</b> into <b>tunnels</b> {{underneath}} the streets.|$|R
50|$|The Straight River {{flows through}} the Straight River <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Channel,</b> a well-preserved glacial tunnel flanked by the Ice Age National Scenic Trail. This <b>tunnel</b> <b>channel</b> was formed between 15,000-18,000 years ago, {{near the end of}} the most recent Ice Age. During this time, melt water from deep beneath the layer of ice on the glacier's surface was forced under extreme {{pressure}} towards the glacier's margin. The Straight River <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Channel</b> is considered to be the finest example of this rare glacial phenomenon in Wisconsin.|$|R

5|$|Freight trains {{operated}} by EWS first ran over CTRL Section 1, on the consecutive evenings of 3–4 April 2004. Five freight trains {{that would have}} run via the classic lines were diverted to run over the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Rail Link instead: three southbound intermodal trains on 3 April 2004 and two northbound intermodal trains on 4 April 2004.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, British Rail {{proposed}} {{building a}} new station with four platforms for international trains through the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> and four for Thameslink trains under King's Cross. After six years of design work, the plans were abandoned, and the international terminal was constructed at St. Pancras.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 2010 a Brussels-London train {{broke down}} in the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> {{resulting}} in three other trains failing to complete their journeys. The cause of the failure was the onboard signalling system. Due to the severe weather, a limited service was operated {{in the next few}} days.|$|E
50|$|A cross <b>channel</b> rail <b>tunnel</b> {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1802 and construction actually started in 1881 before being abandoned. Roll-on Roll-off ferry services provided links across the channel for vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Synthesis of outcrop and {{subsurface}} sedimentological and geomorphological datasets across North Africa {{allows a}} tentative palaeo-glaciological {{model of the}} flow dynamics and recessional character of a 440 Ma old (Hirnantian) ice sheet to be proposed. A system of eight cross-shelf trough depocentres is identified from the Late Ordovician of the Sahara region. These are interpreted to have been carved and occupied by ice streams, providing evidence for widespread heterogeneous flow within the ice sheet. During retreat, two key geological features were produced: (1) laterally extensive, sinuous to linear piles of sediment dumped parallel to the ice margin; (2) large meltwater <b>channels</b> (<b>tunnel</b> valleys) cut near the grounding line...|$|R
5|$|Some {{international}} railway {{services to}} Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains, {{such as the}} Admiraal de Ruijter to Amsterdam and the Night Ferry to Paris and Brussels. The opening of the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Paris, Brussels and European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel.</b> The first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London. There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|This {{was denied}} by Deutsche Bahn, and the bi-national <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Safety Authority {{confirmed}} {{that it had}} not received such an application. The plan was delayed by safety regulations as Deutsche Bahn's fleet of ICE 3M high-speed trains could not be divided in the tunnel in an emergency.|$|E
5|$|Waterloo International {{closed on}} 13 November 2007 when the Eurostar service {{transferred}} to the new St Pancras railway station {{with the opening of}} the second phase of High Speed 1, also known as the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Rail Link. Ownership of the former Waterloo International terminal then passed to BRB (Residuary) Limited.|$|E
50|$|Tunneling the English <b>Channel</b> (Le <b>Tunnel</b> sous la Manche ou le Cauchemar anglo-français) is a 1907 silent film by pioneer filmmaker Georges Méliès. The plot follows King Edward VII and President Armand Fallières {{dreaming of}} {{building}} a tunnel under the English Channel.|$|R
60|$|It may be objected {{that the}} writer, feeling the danger so strongly, {{should have taken}} other means than fiction to put his views before the authorities. The answer to this {{criticism}} {{is that he did}} indeed adopt every possible method, that he personally approached leading naval men and powerful editors, that he sent three separate minutes upon the danger to various public bodies, notably to the Committee for National Defence, and that he touched upon the matter in an article in The Fortnightly Review. In some unfortunate way subjects of national welfare are in this country continually subordinated to party politics, so that a self- evident proposition, such as the danger of a nation being fed from without, is waved aside and ignored, because it will not fit in with some general political shibboleth. It is against this tendency that we have to guard in the future, and we have to bear in mind that the danger may recur, and that the remedies in the text (the only remedies ever proposed) have still to be adopted. They are the sufficient encouragement of agriculture, the making of adequate <b>Channel</b> <b>tunnels,</b> and the provision of submarine merchantmen, which, on the estimate of Mr. Lake, the American designer, could be made up to 7,000 ton burden at an increased cost of about 25 per cent. It is true that in this war the <b>Channel</b> <b>tunnels</b> would not have helped us much in the matter of food, but were France a neutral and supplies at liberty to come via Marseilles from the East, the difference would have been enormous.|$|R

5|$|Although {{rail freight}} levels are far down {{compared}} to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried {{into and out of}} London by rail; chiefly building materials and landfill waste. As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as container freight from the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> and English Channel ports, and nuclear waste for reprocessing at Sellafield.|$|E
5|$|Ashford {{has been}} a {{communications}} hub and has stood at the centre of five railway lines since the 19th century. The arrival of the railways became a source of employment {{and contributed to the}} town's growth. With the opening of the international passenger station it is now a European communications centre, with new lines running between London and the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (via High Speed 1). The M20 motorway also links Ashford to those two destinations for road traffic.|$|E
5|$|Like other London termini, steam trains were {{phased out}} of Victoria by the 1960s, to be {{replaced}} by suburban electric and Diesel Multiple Unit services. Despite the end of international services following the opening of the <b>Channel</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> Victoria still remains an important London station, and its underground facilities in particular suffer from overcrowding. The Gatwick Express service provides easy access between Central London and Gatwick Airport for international travellers.|$|E
40|$|Biomolecular {{channels}} play {{important roles}} in many biological systems, e. g. enzymes, ribosomes and ion channels. This article introduces a web-based inter-active MOLEonline 2. 0 application {{for the analysis of}} access/egress paths to interior molecular voids. MOLEonline 2. 0 enables platform-independent, easy-to-use and interactive analyses of (bio) macro-molecular <b>channels,</b> <b>tunnels</b> and pores. Results are presented in a clear manner, making their interpret-ation easy. For each channel, MOLEonline displays a 3 D graphical representation of the channel, its profile accompanied by a list of lining residues and also its basic physicochemical properties.

40|$|SummaryWe have {{developed}} an algorithm, “MOLE,” for the rapid, fully automated location and characterization of molecular <b>channels,</b> <b>tunnels,</b> and pores. This algorithm has been made freely available on the Internet ([URL] and overcomes many of the shortcomings and limitations of the recently developed CAVER software. The core of our MOLE algorithm is a Dijkstra's path search algorithm, which is applied to a Voronoi mesh. Tests {{on a wide variety}} of biomolecular systems including gramicidine, acetylcholinesterase, cytochromes P 450, potassium channels, DNA quadruplexes, ribozymes, and the large ribosomal subunit have demonstrated that the MOLE algorithm performs well. MOLE is thus a powerful tool for exploring large molecular channels, complex networks of channels, and molecular dynamics trajectories in which analysis of a large number of snapshots is required...|$|R
