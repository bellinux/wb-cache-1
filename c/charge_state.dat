25|$|When {{the main}} {{electron}} gun writes an image to the screen, the {{energy in the}} main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily {{to turn off the}} flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial <b>charge</b> <b>state.</b> By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained.

The technique observes the device space charge region capacitance where the defect <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> recovery causes the capacitance transient.

50|$|Tandems {{locate the}} ion source outside the terminal, {{which means that}} {{accessing}} the ion source while the terminal is at high voltage is significantly less difficult, especially if the terminal is inside a gas tank. So then an anion beam from a sputtering ion source is injected from a relatively lower voltage platform towards the high voltage terminal. Inside the terminal, the beam impinges on a thin foil (on the order of micrograms per square centimeter), often carbon or beryllium, stripping electrons from the ion beam so that they become cations. As {{it is difficult to}} make anions of more than -1 <b>charge</b> <b>state,</b> then the energy of particles emerging from a tandem is E=(q+1)V, where we have added the second acceleration potential from that anion to the positive <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> q emerging from the stripper foil; we are adding these different charge signs together because we are increasing the energy of the nucleus in each phase. In this sense, we can see clearly that a tandem can double the maximum energy of a proton beam, whose maximum <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> is merely +1, but the advantage gained by a tandem has diminishing returns as we go to higher mass, as, for example, one might easily get a 6+ <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> of a silicon beam.|$|E

These new materials are likely to contain significantly higher concentrations of impurities and crystallographic defects than current high purity silicon. One of the most common approaches to deactivation of these defects is the use of hydrogen passivation, which has been an area of significant research for the photovoltaic community. This thesis explores the importance of the <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> of hydrogen for effective passivation of defects in silicon, and how these <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> may be manipulated. The main areas of work are modelling of hydrogen <b>charge</b> <b>states,</b> hydrogen-dopant interaction in silicon and manipulation of hydrogen <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> through illumination to greatly enhance defect passivation in solar cells. Modelling of hydrogen <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> explores the factors that govern the fractional concentrations of the three <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> of interstitial hydrogen in silicon, H+, H 0 and H-. The importance of the silicon doping concentration and excess carrier density is established. The properties of the various <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> are also explored, and it is identified that, while H+ is dominant in p-type silicon under almost all conditions, there are reasons to expect that H 0 and H- may be important for the passivation of some defects in silicon. Hydrogen-dopant interaction focuses upon the use of hydrogen to electrically deactivate dopant impurities. Dopant impurities, and in particular boron, are difficult to remove from silicon using metallurgical processes due to their low segregation coefficients, and so high concentrations are likely to exist in UMG silicon. It is demonstrated how hydrogen may be used to deactivate boron in the near-surface region of a heavily boron doped silicon wafer, and how this may improve the performance of a photovoltaic device fabricated on such a substrate. Finally this thesis will examine how manipulation of the hydrogen <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> through illumination can increase the effectiveness of hydrogen passivation in UMG silicon.
