50|$|George Wallace's {{transition}} from stage to screen parallels the <b>career</b> <b>progressions</b> of many internationally famous vaudeville performers {{in a period}} when movies' popularity was eclipsing live theatre. However, the financially struggling Australian film industry of the 1920s and 1930s provided fewer opportunities than Hollywood did. Although Wallace continued to work after World War II, with a successful career in radio and on stage as well as occasional film roles, his film career never returned to its 1930s peak. This was undoubtedly influenced by factors outside his control, such as F. W. Thring's death in 1936 and Cinesound Productions' decision to cease feature film production in 1940.

25|$|In 1955, Ganpal Lal Batto died {{suddenly}} in a road accident. His death left Shamshad very distraught, {{because her husband}} had been the focus of her life and they had both been extremely devoted to each other. He had handled many aspects of her career and contracts and had been a major positive energy behind her <b>career</b> <b>progression.</b> After his death, Shamshad became listless and lost the fighting spirit to pursue her career, which registered a sharp decline thereafter. Indeed, while Shamshad Begum was both an outstanding singer and a successful famous one, she was at some deeper level always a wife and mother first, someone who instinctively prioritised her family over her career. By nature, she preferred to keep away from the public glare and from business dealings, taking the view that it was rather unseemly for a lady to be involved in such things. After her husband's death, Shamshad Begum began living with her daughter and son-in-law in Mumbai, first in south Mumbai and later at Hiranandani Gardens in the Powai neighbourhood. She gradually became a recluse and devoted herself entirely to her grandchildren, {{to the point that the}} general public was unaware of whether she was alive or dead. In 2004, a controversy erupted in the media, when several publications wrongly reported that Shamshad Begum had died a few years previously. Shamshad's family clarified in a press release that this was not so; and it later emerged that the Shamshad Begum who had died in 1998 was Saira Banu's maternal grandmother. Her self-imposed seclusion is remarkable, because during all those decades away from the public eye, her old songs remained popular with the public and not a day passed without at least a couple of songs being played on Vividh Bharati and All India Radio.|$|E
25|$|The architect's <b>career</b> <b>progression</b> is impressive. He {{was made}} an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1840 and a Fellow in 1850 {{at the age}} of 36. The RIBA, a prestigious {{national}} body of architects, had been formed in 1834 for the advancement of the profession and its members. Christian was elected Vice-President of the Institute in 1880 and reached the height of his career when he served as President of the RIBA from 1884 to 1886 and was awarded the Institute's Royal Gold Medal in 1887. During his long career Christian was a very busy and productive architect producing over 2,000 works, much of it for the Church of England. He carried out about 1,300 restorations and additions to churches throughout England and Wales and built some 90 complete new churches, as well as building, restoring and adding to many vicarages, deaneries, canonries and bishops palaces. Much of his church work, particularly his 880 chancel restorations, was carried out in his capacity as Architect to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, a very influential post to which he was appointed in 1851 and which he held until his death in 1895. As such, this gave him considerable control over the construction and restoration of many buildings for the Established Church across the country at a crucial time of church expansion and development in Victorian Britain. On his appointment Christian moved his practice into the Commissioners premises in Whitehall Place, Westminster, later converting nearby stables into his offices when the Commissioners needed more space. Here Christian was to remain {{for the rest of his}} life and during this time, in addition to his building and restoration work, produced thousands of reports on designs for Church of England buildings that were submitted to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for approval, completed surveys on the fabric of ancient churches including 14 cathedrals and assessed many architectural competitions, work which continued to within four days of his death {{at the age of}} 80.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} job profiles in humanitarian logistics, and assess current task priorities in light of further training and educational needs. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents findings from a survey among humanitarian logistics practitioners and compares these to other studies in this area. It uses econometric models to evaluate the impact of managerial responsibilities in training needs, usage of time and previous training. Findings - The results show that the skills required in humanitarian logistics seem to follow the T-shaped skills model from Mangan and Christopher when looking at training wanted and time usage. Research limitations/implications - Survey respondents being members of the Humanitarian Logistics Association (HLA) may be more interested in developing the humanitarian logistics profession than other populations. Originality/value - This paper offers an insight in the specific skill requirements of humanitarian logisticians from members of the HLA and allows to understand which type of skills are linked to managerial responsibilities.

40|$|Thesis (M. I. S.) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2002. The {{general purpose}} of the {{research}} was to do a comparative study of first level library and/or information science (LIS) qualifications offered at South African universities and technikons. These qualifications included the National Diploma: Library and Information Studies (ND: LIS), the Bachelor of Technology: Library and Information Studies (B. Tech. (LIS)), the Post-graduate Diploma in Library and/or Information Science and the Bachelor of Library and Information Science (B. Bibl.) or equivalent four-year university degree. Self-administered questionnaires were used to survey the views of employers, past students and educators in the LIS field regarding these qualifications and their relevance to the LIS services work environment. Descriptive statistics as well as content analysis were used to analyse the data collected. Discussion of findings based on analysis of data and {{in the context of}} related literature, resulted in a number of conclusions. The study supports the view that general education as provided by a university bachelor's degree distinguishes between professional and paraprofessional LIS education and training. The study confirms that the university Post-graduate Diploma in Library and/or Information Science and the B. Bibl. (or equivalent four-year university degree) are established professional LIS qualifications in South Africa. While the technikon ND: LIS is generally viewed as a paraprofessional qualification, LIS services employers are not using this qualification in its paraprofessional context with paraprofessional post designations and <b>career</b> <b>progressions.</b> The technikon B. Tech. (LIS) cannot be viewed as a professional LIS qualification as it lacks general education. Furthermore, it is a qualification in the hierarchy of paraprofessional LIS qualifications that runs parallel to the professional LIS career path and thus the B. Tech. (LIS) is not a step in the direction of LIS professionalism. It is part of an alternative career direction. A further conclusion is that in view of the traditional purpose of technikon education and training vis-a-vis university education and training, limited general education and not extended general education is necessary in the technikon LIS curriculum. The study suggests that the professional LIS body, educators, employers and graduates and diplomates in the LIS field in South Africa have specific roles to play in ensuring understanding that LIS professionalism and paraprofessionalism are alternative or parallel career paths each with its own <b>career</b> <b>progressions</b> and with valuable roles to play in LIS services. However, there should be possibilities for articulation between LIS professionalism and paraprofessionalism at the education and training level...|$|R

We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E

Reflecting its title, Modern Hits incorporates songs published {{within the last}} five years of its release, and the developers had to balance what songs were included {{in order to make a}} setlist with a wide appeal. The engine of the game has no major changes, but Vicarious Visions stated that it has continued to work on strum detection on the DS touchpad to meet a wide range of playstyles. The interface, however, has been revised over the previous two On Tour titles to feature a more modernized look (particularly in-game on the touch screen side). The game includes a new single player <b>career</b> <b>progression</b> using [...] "Fan Requests" [...] to create a new non-linear progression through the songs in the games.

The developers also noted that the Fan Requests helped to tap into the way that players had previously played games in the series, setting their own personal goals for certain songs. Audio designer Jason Willey created the game's theme song (titled [...] "S.U.P.R.A.H.U.M.A.N.") through his two-man band, Protoshredanoid, to capture the Modern Hits theme of the game, and after demonstrating a sampling of the song to the rest of the team, were asked to create the whole song.
