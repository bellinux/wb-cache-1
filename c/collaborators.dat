40|$|Virtual <b>Collaborator</b> ” is an {{intelligent}} interface agent to help machine operators controlling {{a large scale}} plant system such as power plant. A prototype system of the virtual <b>collaborator</b> has been developed, and the major functions of the present virtual <b>collaborator</b> are that when an anomaly occurs in a plant, the virtual <b>collaborator</b> can autonomously detect it, diagnose the root cause, and operator the control panel in accordance to the operation procedure. The designed function of the virtual <b>collaborator</b> is validated by demonstrative simulation on a distributed computer network. The implication of this virtual <b>collaborator</b> experiment is discussed {{with respect to the}} human-centered automation...|$|R

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the end of the hostage crisis, President Claire Haas (Marcia Cross) and CIA {{director}} Matthew Keyes put forth a covert joint task force between the FBI and CIA. President Haas mentions that there were eight <b>collaborators</b> within the shadowy cabal group who are secretly involved with the AIC. As a result of Lydia's actions, the <b>collaborators</b> gained access to sensitive U.S intelligence. This information was vital to their goal of controlling certain areas within the government. As a response, the task force is assigned to uncover the conspiracy and expose the involvement of the <b>collaborators</b> in orchestrating the hostage crisis. Alex is hired to be a member of the task force along with Ryan Booth, Nimah Amin, Shelby Wyatt, and Dayana Mampasi. The leader of the group is Clay Haas (Hunter Parrish), a renowned political advisory strategist. Prior to the formation of the task force, Alex is re-instated as an FBI agent.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this voyage is to explore the {{phenomenon}} of resilience with a South African child survivor of abuse. This research {{may be used to}} foreground elements in narrative conversations that can be employed to enhance resilience in other child survivors of abuse. The <b>collaborator</b> was identified using a constructivist approach of selection, incorporating the Indigenous Knowledge of the staff involved in the care of abuse survivors in a place of safety. The selection work session led to the generation of an operationalisation of the concept resilience, as well as an observation schedule for resilience specific to this environment. A 16 -year-old female <b>collaborator</b> was identified as resilient for the {{purpose of this}} research. A number of in-depth interviews with the <b>collaborator</b> were conducted whilst the <b>collaborator</b> was in the place of safety, as well as after her move to a children’s home. Narratives about the <b>collaborator’s</b> life were generated and computer aided qualitative data analysis was undertaken. This facilitated the generation of networks of codes which allow for the representation of the particular resilience processes present in the <b>collaborator.</b> In this study the ability to adapt and utilise new environments is identified as a major factor in the <b>collaborator’s</b> resilience.

5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} {{have been met}} with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due to mass segregation.

A second TV ad also premiered that was similar to the first on Saturday Night Live, but with a different music clip and the title Random Access Memories in place of the stylized Daft Punk logo. During the first night of Coachella Festival 2013, a third trailer debuted that featured Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams and Rodgers performing, as well as a list of <b>collaborators</b> on the album. The trailer also aired during Saturday Night Live the following evening, but without a list of <b>collaborators.</b>|$|E
