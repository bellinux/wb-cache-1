2500|$|Meanwhile, Ogilby's daughter, Sharlene, had {{returned}} from the shops; she entered the club, <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the first floor and began banging {{on the door and}} crying for her mother. Although by this stage Ogilby had sustained severe head injuries from the brutal assault, Sharlene heard her screaming and pleading with her assailants for mercy while they danced to blaring disco music. Ignoring the injured woman's pleas for her life and Sharlene's cries, [...] Henrietta Cowan, once again wielding a brick, resumed beating Ogilby on the head with renewed vigour until she lay dead on the floor. The beating session had lasted for over an hour. Ogilby received (according to the later autopsy report) a total of 24 blows to the head and body with a blunt object, 14 of which had caused [...] "a severe fracture to the bulk of the skull".|$|E
2500|$|Dodge {{approached}} Jacques Gershkovitch, a Russian immigrant in Portland guest {{conducting the}} Portland Symphony (which {{would later become}} the Oregon Symphony), about the orchestra after seeing him conduct. Though Gershkovitch first explained {{that he did not}} teach children, Dodge insisted that he come listen to the youth ensemble she had assembled. One orchestra member recalled: [...] "I well remember the excitement of that night when Gershkovitch <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> Mary Dodge's attic, where we had assembled to play for him. He listened as we played our hearts out. He applauded us and said that if we got the missing instruments, he would take us on." [...] In an attempt to hand over the baton to Gershkovitch, he simply stated [...] "I take." [...] Initially, Dodge remained as associate director of the orchestra; she also assisted with sectionals, appointed a board of directors, and designated the ensemble as the Portland Junior Symphony Orchestra in 1924. The original board of directors established the mission of the orchestra: [...] "to encourage appreciation and rendition of orchestral music by young people, to give public symphonic and popular concerts, to discover and develop latent talent among the children of Portland." [...] Six years later, Dodge resigned while the orchestra was financially sound. She continued to teach and became increasingly dedicated to a scientific approach to bowing. Dodge died in 1954.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the murder {{was the result of}} a power struggle, a {{financial}} dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at [...] "outdoing" [...] the stabbing in Lillehammer. Vikernes denies all of these rumours, stating that he killed Euronymous in self-defense: he says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: [...] "If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me." [...] He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous [...] "panicked" [...] and kicked him in the chest. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes contends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the slaying, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. The self-defense story is doubted by Emperor drummer Faust.|$|E

A puzzled doctor was standing by the bedside. A nurse, who was smoothing the bedclothes, glanced around at Prince Shan's entrance. The invalid started convulsively, and, clutching the pillows with his right hand, turned towards his visitor.|$|E

60|$|But now Marcella's {{courage and}} hopefulness {{had gone out}} like a spent candle. She was late at the store, and that meant a fine; her head ached, and her feet felt like lead as she <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> her department--a hot, dark, stuffy corner behind the shirtwaist counter.

The heat and noise and chatter got on Marcella's {{tortured}} nerves. She felt that she wanted to scream, but instead she turned calmly to a waiting customer--a big, handsome, richly dressed woman. Marcella noted with an ever-increasing bitterness that the woman wore a lace collar the price of which would have kept Patty in the country for a year.|$|E
60|$|Arnold, as he {{neared the}} end of his journey, felt, indeed, that he had found his way into some alien world. The streets through which, after many directions, he had passed, had all been strange to him, strange not only because of their narrowness, their poverty, their ill flavor, but on account, also, of the foreign names above the shops, the street cries, and the dark, {{unfamiliar}} aspects of the people. After losing his way more than once, he discovered at last a short street branching out of a narrow but populous thoroughfare. There were no visible numbers, but counting the houses on the left-hand side, and finding the door of the seventh open, he made his way inside. The place was silent and seemed deserted. He <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the second story and knocked {{at the door of the}} front room. So far, although barely a hundred yards away was a street teeming with human beings, he had not seen a soul in the place.|$|E

50|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{features a}} woman's gallery against the south-west wall, {{built over the}} front entrance foyer and classroom, although it is rarely used.
