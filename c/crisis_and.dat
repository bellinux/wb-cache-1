40|$|It {{is widely}} {{suggested}} {{that there is some}} relationship between banking <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> recessions. We assess whether there is evidence for interdependency between recessions <b>and</b> banking <b>crises</b> using both non-parametric tests and unconditional bivariate probit models and find strong evidence for interdependence. We then consider whether leading indicators can help predict banking <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> recessions and if these variables can explain the previously observed interdependence. Inclusion of exogenous variables means that the observed interdependence between banking <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> recessions disappears - indicating that the observed interdependence is a result of easily observable common causes rather than unobserved links...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{attempts}} {{to show how}} the quality of the social fabric of a com-munity or nation affects its capacity to deal with <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> to develop human and natural resources in ways that maintain and sustainably improve subjective well-being. Three types of crisis will be used as examples. These include economic crises; transition and other institutional crises; and conflicts over sustainable resource use. The bulk of the new results in this paper relate to economic <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> institutional transitions, and shows that communities and nations with better social capital and trust respond to <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> transi-tions more happily and effectively...|$|R
