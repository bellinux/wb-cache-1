40|$|The <b>cease-fires</b> of 1994 {{marked the}} {{transition}} of Northern Ireland toward peace. Local media, public perception, and claims by "drug authorities" suggest an increase in drug use subsequent to the <b>cease-fires.</b> This article suggests that social problems in Northern Ireland must be understood {{in the context of}} wider political conflict and that the conflict affects all social phenomena. Therefore, the extent and patterning of drug use in young people in Northern Ireland are explored, linked to the major <b>cease-fires.</b> The historical influences of the key paramilitary groups are outlined in relation to their drug ideologies. Media and professional perceptions are examined alongside available evidence constructed from multiple indicators of drug use. Our review of the evidence suggests that it is incorrect to assume that most drug use has increased since the <b>cease-fires.</b> One notable exception to that general conclusion is that a heroin scene may be developing in Northern Ireland...|$|R
5000|$|By early October, {{there were}} no cigarettes. People were smoking grape leaves or tea. There was no yeast for bread. My son was eating tinned food with me and my wife. There was less and less of that. The {{shelling}} became 24 hours a day, and the <b>cease-fires</b> were worse. When people {{came out of the}} shelters to go to the well during the <b>cease-fires,</b> the snipers shot them. You can't keep children in for two months, and when they ran outside, when there was sun in the morning, they shot at them, too.|$|R
5|$|Japan's {{forces were}} still {{fighting}} against the Soviets {{as well as the}} Chinese, and managing their <b>cease-fire</b> and surrender was difficult. The last air combat by Japanese fighters against American reconnaissance bombers took place on August 18. The Soviet Union continued to fight until early September, taking the Kuril Islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{first was}} that the Paris Accord that ended the American {{commitment}} was seriously flawed at the outset, in that it permitted the North Vietnamese to maintain their forces within territorial South Vietnam after {{the signing of the}} agreement, thereby dooming the <b>cease-fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} {{culminated in}} the Algiers putsch of 1961, led by retired generals. After its failure, on 18 March 1962, de Gaulle and the FLN signed a <b>cease-fire</b> agreement, the Évian Accords, and held a referendum. In July, Algerians voted 5,975,581 to 16,534 to become independent from France.|$|E
40|$|In {{the closing}} months of 1994, the {{principal}} paramilitary organizations in Northern Ireland declared that their campaigns of violence were at an end. The <b>cease-fires</b> called by republican and loyalist groupings represented {{the most significant}} heralds of a complex process of conflict transformation that continues to unfold even twenty years on. In this introduction, {{we set out to}} map the key developments that have shaped the tortuous narrative of the Northern Irish ‘peace process’, thereby providing the historical backdrop for the articles that follow. While remarkable progress has been made over the two decades since the paramilitary <b>cease-fires,</b> the political context and future of the region remain rather more fraught than is often assumed abroad. It is perhaps best, then, to speak of the six counties in terms not of resolution but rather of ambiguity. Twenty years on from the optimism that greeted the paramilitary <b>cease-fires,</b> Northern Ireland retains the essential ‘inbetweenness’ of a political space that has moved from a ‘long war’ through a ‘long peace’ and into a profoundly undecided future...|$|R
25|$|While the Agreement was repudiated and {{condemned}} by Unionists, {{it was said}} to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the governments, which in time would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993, and the subsequent republican and loyalist <b>cease-fires.</b>|$|R
50|$|Paramedics on the Syrian side of {{the border}} asked that the IDF grant them <b>cease-fires</b> to clear the wounded. The army agreed to the request, but then saw activists {{exploiting}} the quiet to try to cut the border fence, bringing the truce to an end.|$|R
5|$|In 1990, the {{division}} sent 1,200 soldiers to support Operation Desert Storm. The largest of these units was the 548th Supply and Services Battalion with almost 1,000 soldiers, which supported the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) in Iraq. Following a <b>cease-fire</b> in March 1991, the support soldiers began redeploying to Fort Drum through June of that year.|$|E
5|$|Later, the United Nations Security Council issued {{resolution}} 248 which {{condemned the}} Israeli raid on Jordanian territory and {{the violation of}} the <b>cease-fire</b> line, it recalled on resolutions 237 which had encouraged Israel {{to ensure the safety}} of civilians in military areas. The resolution affirmed that reprisals were not to be tolerated and that repetitions of such violations would have forced the Security Council to take further steps.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1961 Hammarskjöld flew to Ndola, {{just across}} the border in Northern Rhodesia, to attempt to broker a <b>cease-fire</b> between UN and Katangese forces. His {{aircraft}} crashed before landing at Ndola Airport, killing him and everybody else on board. In stark contrast to Hammarskjöld's attempts to pursue a moderate policy in the Congo, his successor U Thant supported a more radical policy of direct involvement in the conflict. Katanga released the captured Irish soldiers in mid-October as part of a <b>cease-fire</b> deal in which ONUC agreed to pull its troops back—a propaganda coup for Tshombe. Restated American support for the UN mission, and the murder of ten Italian UN pilots in Port-Émpain in November 1961, strengthened international demands to resolve the situation. In December 1961, South Kasai was finally overrun by ANC troops and Kalonji was arrested, ending the South Kasai secession.|$|E
50|$|While the Agreement was repudiated and {{condemned}} by Unionists, {{it was said}} to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the governments, which in time would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993, and the subsequent republican and loyalist <b>cease-fires.</b>|$|R
50|$|Subsequent UN-sponsored <b>cease-fires</b> followed, and {{the warring}} parties mostly entrenched. The Yugoslav People's Army retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina where a new cycle of {{tensions}} were escalating: the Bosnian War was to start. During 1992 and 1993, Croatia also handled an estimated 700,000 refugees from Bosnia, mainly Bosnian Muslims.|$|R
5000|$|Israel on {{principle}} {{refused to accept}} <b>cease-fires</b> with militant groups, because [...] "Israel deals only with the Palestinian Authority" [...] and [...] "The Israelis don't deal with these terrorist organizations", while advancing its policy of targeted killing. Instead, Israel reacted on terrorist attacks by attacking the PA's Security Forces and its offices.|$|R
5|$|On 21 February, Souvanna {{signed an}} Agreement on the Restoration of Peace and Reconciliation in Laos between the central {{government}} and the Pathet Lao. The agreement was preceded by intense fighting, as both sides attempted to seize as much territory as possible before the <b>cease-fire</b> went into effect. The agreement was moot, however, since Hanoi {{had no intention of}} removing its troops or abandoning its logistical system.|$|E
5|$|Regiment 95 survived Operation Camargue {{and resumed}} ambushes in 1954, {{as well as}} assaulting a Vietnamese {{garrison}} near Hué. The regiment remained in the area, taking part in General Giáp's 1954 campaign season, until Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam by the <b>cease-fire,</b> whereupon it infiltrated back to the north along Route One during broad daylight, leaving small cells of guerillas in the area. The regiment returned to resume ambushes of the South Vietnamese Army in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of North Vietnam's period of recuperation in 1974, President Thiệu stretched his forces thin by launching offensives that retook {{most of the}} territory captured by PAVN forces during the land grab of 1973 and 15 {{percent of the total}} land area controlled by the communists {{at the time of the}} <b>cease-fire.</b> In April, Thiệu launched the Svay Rieng Campaign against communist strongholds in eastern Cambodia. This proved to be the last major offensive operation launched by the ARVN.|$|E
50|$|Phase 4: Monitoring the Muslim-Croat Federation and Weapons Exclusion Zones - Eventually, UNPROFOR {{monitored}} a US-brokered <b>cease-fires</b> in Bosnia in February 1994, {{creating the}} Muslim-Croat Federation. UNPROFOR {{was responsible for}} monitoring the zones of separation and weapons control points. In addition, the UNSC increased UNPROFOR's authorized strength to monitor weapons exclusion zones, but never actually altered the operation's mandate.|$|R
5000|$|Australians {{were the}} first peacekeepers to serve under United Nations auspices when they sent {{military}} observers to Indonesia in 1947 during the independence struggle. About 65,000 Australian personnel have partaken in more than fifty peacekeeping operations, in about 25 different conflicts. [...] Operations include military observation, monitoring <b>cease-fires,</b> clearing landmines, humanitarian aid and the repatriation of refugees.|$|R
5000|$|A {{second example}} is the manual used for {{training}} of Union troops in 1861. [...] While not always dictating the stance (as reference is made to loading from horseback), specific instructions were given for drawing on command (specifically the rifle and pistol), loading, firing, <b>cease-firing,</b> inspecting and returning the weapons to their carrying position (slinging the carbine, or holstering the revolver).|$|R
5|$|The International Control Commission, {{in order}} to avoid a major {{escalation}} of the armed conflicts with disastrous results, decided to intervene. On May 6, Zografos received a communication to initiate negotiations on a new basis. Zografos accepted the proposal and an armistice was ordered the next day. By the time the <b>cease-fire</b> order was received, the Epirote forces had secured the Morava heights near Korçë, making the city's Albanian garrison's surrender imminent.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Security Council {{brokered}} the Renville Agreement in {{an attempt}} to rectify the collapsed Linggarjati Agreement. The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a <b>cease-fire</b> along the so-called 'Van Mook line'; an artificial line which connected the most advanced Dutch positions. Many Republican positions, however, were still held behind the Dutch lines. The agreement also required referenda to be held on the political future of the Dutch held areas. The apparent reasonableness of Republicans garnered much important American goodwill.|$|E
5|$|The two {{met at the}} {{outskirts}} of Wola {{in the early hours}} of 7 September. Paskevich proclaimed a <b>cease-fire</b> and invited Krukowiecki to meet him at 9:00. The meeting was held in the village tavern of Wola. Paskevich demanded that Warsaw and Praga be surrendered unconditionally and that the Polish Army be evacuated and disarmed in Płock, where it was to await the decision of the tsar either to pardon the Polish soldiers or imprison them as rebels. Krukowiecki declined and insisted that the uprising was not a rebellion but a war waged by two independent states. He wanted Paskevich and Grand Duke Michael to promise the return of Poland's independence and a general amnesty in exchange for revoking the act of deposition of Nicholas from the Polish throne. The negotiations were stormy and around noon the Polish commander departed for Warsaw to consult the Sejm about further actions. Paskevich agreed to extend the <b>cease-fire</b> to 13:00, and to continue negotiations even if warfare was resumed.|$|E
5|$|OPCW {{director-general}} Ahmet Uzumcu {{stated in}} early October that completing the destruction process by the mid-2014 deadline {{will depend on}} whether temporary <b>cease-fires</b> can be arranged between opposition and government forces. A nine-month ceasefire to allow the OPCW {{to carry out the}} entire chemical weapons destruction process was rejected by the Free Syrian Army (FSA), {{according to a report in}} Asharq Al-Awsat (a Saudi-linked pan-Arab newspaper).|$|R
25|$|The {{situation}} remained {{tense and}} fights occurred again in September 1985 and March 1986. On May 19, 1986, heavy fighting erupted again. Despite new armaments provided by Syria, Amal {{could not take}} control of the camps. Many <b>cease-fires</b> were announced, but most of them did not last more than a few days. The situation began to cool after Syria deployed some troops on June 24, 1986.|$|R
50|$|Continual {{diplomatic}} pressure {{against the}} Israeli policy, and {{the announcement of}} temporary <b>cease-fires</b> at various times by Hamas, are seen by some as further proof of the policy's efficacy. Some observers, however, argue that other factors are at play, including improved intelligence-gathering leading to more arrests, {{and the construction of}} the Israeli West Bank barrier which has made it more difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.|$|R
5|$|Although the Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—had {{achieved}} several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, in Italy the Coalition's achievements {{were more}} limited. In northern Italy, {{despite the presence}} of the most experienced of the Austrian generals—Dagobert Wurmser—the Austrians could not lift the siege at Mantua, and the efforts of Napoleon in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a <b>cease-fire</b> at Leoben on 17 April 1797, which led to the formal peace treaty, the Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797.|$|E
5|$|Armenia {{declared}} its independence on September 21, 1991 after the unsuccessful coup attempt in Moscow by the CPSU hardliners. Greece {{became the first}} country to recognize the newly minted Armenian nation a few days later. Tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan continued to escalate, ultimately leading to {{the outbreak of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh War. Despite a <b>cease-fire</b> in place since 1994, Armenia has yet to resolve its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. The Soviet Union itself ceased to exist on December 26, 1991 and Armenia became an sovereign independent state in the international stage. The United States recognized Armenia's independence a day before.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 on 29 January 1968, South Vietnamese forces began a 36-hour ceasefire {{in celebration}} of {{the arrival of the}} Year of the Monkey. Earlier, the communists had {{declared}} a seven-day ceasefire as part of the Tet festival, that was normally a period of truce and for community gatherings and family reunions in Vietnamese society. However, unbeknown to the South Vietnamese and their allies, the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to use the <b>cease-fire</b> to launch a large offensive in the south in order to break the deadlock that had developed in the conflict—despite the reluctance of Democratic Republic of Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh and Defence Minister General Vo Nguyen Giap.|$|E

Players can also threaten each other, declare war and arrange <b>cease-fires.</b> Each AI player remembers others' actions, both positive and negative, and will be unwilling to form alliances with a player who has broken previous treaties with it.|$|R
