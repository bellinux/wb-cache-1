2500|$|According {{to various}} traditions, the MacNeacails once had {{possession}} of Lewis before losing their lands to the MacLeods through {{the marriage of}} a MacNeacail heiress. In the 17th century, John Morison of Bragar stated as much when he wrote: [...] "... Macknaicle whose onlie daughter Torquill the first of that name (and sone to Claudius the sone of Olipheous, who likewise {{is said to be}} the King of Noruway his sone,) did violentlie espouse, and <b>cutt</b> <b>off</b> Immediatlie the whole race of Macknaicle and possessed himself with the whole Lews ...". Similarly, the garbled Bannatyne Manuscript indicates that the MacNeacails held Lewis from the Kings of Mann, and that the clan's possession of the island terminated though the marriage of an heiress to a MacLeod. The manuscript also states that a branch of the MacNeacails held Waternish on Skye before the MacLeods. Other traditions associate the MacNeacails with the mainland in Assynt and Coigach; the ruins of Caisteal Mhic Neacail ("MacNeacail's Castle") near Ullapool may well corroborate these links[...] Producing a description of Assynt to accompany the Statistical Account of 1794, Rev William Mackenzie drew upon a local tradition that the district had been granted by the Thane of Sutherland to one 'MacKrycul', in recognition of his service against Viking cattle-raiders. The local belief that MacKrycul was the 'potent man' from whom the MacNicols descended is seemingly backed up by the MS. 1467, in which the first of two Nicails - living approximately in the mid-twelfth century - is listed as the son of 'Gregall'.|$|E
5000|$|Poor Barrell's {{regiment}} were sorely {{pressed by}} those desperadoes and outflanked. One stand of their colours was taken; Collonel Riches hand <b>cutt</b> <b>off</b> in their defence ... We marched {{up to the}} enemy, and our left, outflankingthem, wheeled in upon them; the whole then gave them 5 or 6 fires with vast execution, while their front had nothing left to oppose us, but their pistolls and broadswords; and fire from their center and rear, (as, by this time, they were 20 or 30 deep) was vastly more fatal to themselves, than us.

50|$|To knit {{the sleeves}} the knitter {{picks up the}} front half of the armhole {{stitches}} on the safety pin, picks up stitches around the sleeve front and sleeve back and then adds the back half of the held stitches. Sleeves are knit on three to five needles {{depending on the size}} of the garment. The shaping of the sleeve depends on the needle sizes and the designs. Knitters decrease as needed, mostly in the elbow area and <b>cutt,</b> and cast <b>off</b> at the wrist. Knitting down the sleeve, rather than attaching on a separate sleeve, produces a better fitting garment. It also easily enables a sleeve to be lengthened or a cuff repaired. The actual knitting process usually takes two to three days.|$|R

One of his stops was at Ganondagan, which he referred to as Canagora and as Canagorah: [...] Canagorah lyes {{on the top of}} a great hill, and in that, as well as in the bignesse, much like Onandago, contayning 150 houses, northwestward of Caiougo 72 miles. Here ye Indyans were very desirous to see us ride our horses, wch wee did: they made great feasts and dancing, and invited us yt when all ye maides were together, both wee and our Indyans might choose such as lyked us to ly with. Wentworth Greenhalgh Greenhalgh wrote that none of the Seneca towns were [...] "stockadoed" [...] (stockaded), and related the following incident: The 18th going to Canagorah, wee overtook ye prisoners; when the soudiers saw us they stopped each his prisoner, and made him sing, and <b>cutt</b> <b>off</b> their fingers, and slasht their bodies wth a knife, and when they had sung each man confessed how many men in his time hee had killed. Thatt day att Canagorah, there were most cruelly burnt four men, four women and one boy. The cruelty lasted aboutt seven hours.

40|$|The {{chance of}} {{predicting}} a preterm delivery {{may be the}} keystone to preventing or at least best management of it. The aim of our study, was to test {{the possibility of using}} vaginal -HCG level measurement to predict the spontaneous preterm delivery. In this prospective study, 150 pregnant women referred for prenatal care to Asadabadi university hospital clinic were studied. At a gestational age of 20 - 28 weeks, a cotton tip swab was placed into the endocervix and posterior vaginal fornix and sent to laboratory for -HCG measurement. Data were entered into the computer and analyzed using SPSS 11 and medcalc 8 Statistical software packages. Mean age of participants was 26 years (Â± 25. 9). Mean gestational age at time of sampling was 25 weeks. The relative risk of developing a preterm delivery for those having a vaginal -HCG above 30 mIU mL- 1 was calculated to be 2. 61 (95 % CI: 1. 25 - 5. 5). The relative risk of developing a preterm delivery for vaginal -HCG level above 45 mIU mL- 1 was 4. 5 (95 % CI: 1. 98 - 10. 1). The test for a cutoff value of 45 was quite specific and half sensitive with a negative predictive value of 95. 4 %. A cervicovaginal -HCG test with a <b>cutt</b> <b>off</b> value of 45 mIU mL- 1 can predict the preterm delivery, but a combination screening of cervicovaginal -HCG test along with clinical risk factor scoring for preterm delivery is suggested to be used in clinical practice...|$|E
