Each group of two turrets would have had a fire control system, with a [...] OR; for the forward groups this would be {{on each side of the}} fore tower, and for the aft turret groups it would be atop the aft tower. Thus, the backup system for the [...] battery would have been eliminated, and the secondary battery's fire control direction insured by the upper system in the fore tower for anti-ship gunnery and by the [...] battery's systems for anti-aircraft gunnery.|$|E
2500|$|... 3D printing, {{also known}} as {{additive}} manufacturing (AM), refers to processes {{used to create a}} three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object. Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. Stereolithography (STL) {{is one of the most}} common file types that 3D printers can read. Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional machining process, 3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design (<b>CAD)</b> <b>model</b> or AMF file by successively adding material layer by layer.|$|E
2500|$|As {{war began}} in November 1939, it became {{evident that the}} {{projected}} [...] ACAD Model 1935 (automatic anti-aircraft twin) mountings would not be provided in time for Richelieus completion; thus, a drastic revision of the AA battery was needed. The midship [...] turrets had to be canceled, and twelve /45 Model 1930 guns in six twin [...] mountings, <b>CAD</b> <b>Model</b> 1931, were instead fitted, {{as they had been}} on the last [...] Treaty cruiser (...) [...] To speed the completion of the Richelieu, four mountings had to be removed from the reconstructed battleship , and two from a battery near Marseilles. The [...] amidships turrets were not even mounted on Jean Bart; nor were barbettes installed. The [...] mountings were fitted on Richelieu in April–May 1940.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> of {{mechanical}} parts usually have many blends and chamfers, {{and the existence}} of these machining features can greatly change the geometric and topological patterns of the <b>CAD</b> <b>models,</b> but the existing partial matching algorithms cannot match the <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> which contain machining features such as blends and chamfers. In this paper, a new approach to partial matching based on the constraints of transition features is proposed. Firstly, the transition features are identified by feature recognition, and then these machining features are removed to eliminate the impacts to the geometric and topological information of the <b>CAD</b> <b>models,</b> and the attribute adjacent graph is reconstructed, finally, the sub-graph isomorphism approach is used to achieve the partial matching. Experimental results show that this method can achieve partial matching of <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> which contain machining features such as blends and chamfers, and the matching efficiency can satisfy the requirement of the engineering retrieval...|$|R
40|$|In {{a typical}} Concurrent Engineering scenario, users can discuss {{currently}} their 3 D <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> in Collaborative <b>CAD</b> environments {{to a certain}} extent, but the valuable functionality of Virtual Assembly of dispersed 3 D CAD parts steming from heterogeneous systems is not well addressed yet. Users {{should be able to}} examine their models in relation to others and verify that they match properly as a powerful decision-making tool independent of any specific CAD system. We present a novel user-driven approach, based on highly intuitive sequential steps, to assembly parts of 3 D <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> using a 2 D input device which is completely integrated in an environment supporting geographically dispersed and heterogeneous <b>CAD</b> <b>models.</b> Users with different skills (even non-CAD users) are enabled to assemble 3 D <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> in this scenario.

2500|$|The [...] <b>CAD</b> <b>Model</b> 1930 turrets were dual-purpose. SAP shells ( [...] OPf Model 1928, {{weighing}} [...] ) {{would be}} used for sea targets, with a muzzle velocity of [...] and a [...] maximum range, but only 10 rounds per gun were intended, due to the belief that anti-ship fire would mainly come from the stronger [...] guns. HE shells ( [...] OEA Model 1928, weighing [...] ) {{would be used}} on aerial targets, with a muzzle velocity of [...] and a [...] ceiling (at the 80° maximum elevation). The rate of fire was 10rpm. Illuminating shells ( [...] OEcl Model 1928) were provided to replace the [...] OEcl Model 1936. The [...] guns proved to be the only reliable arms of Richelieu until 1942, due to the uncompleted or obsolescent fire control of the 380mm and 152mm batteries.|$|E
2500|$|For {{short range}} {{anti-aircraft}} defense, the French Navy {{had planned to}} develop for the Dunkerque-class battleships an automatic version ( [...] ACAD Model 1935) of the [...] semi-automatic anti-aircraft with twin mountings (<b>CAD</b> <b>Model</b> 1933); the latter had a theoretical firing rate of 30 to 40rpm. Hand loaded using a six-round box magazine, the actual firing rate was 15 to 20rpm; {{in the same time}} period, the British Pom Pom gun and the Swedish designed Bofors 40 mm/L60 gun had a 120 to 200rpm firing rate. Therefore, the [...] ACAD Model 1935 was expected to have a firing rate of 120rpm or above. However, in 1940 only a prototype ACAD mounting (designated Model 1936) was tested (aboard the old patrol sloop Amiens; it was apparently successfully used during the Dunkirk evacuation).|$|E
2500|$|On Clemenceau, {{the main}} {{artillery}} arrangement was as on Richelieu and Jean Bart. But the [...] battery would have consisted of four triple turrets of [...] caliber, two amidships (one on each side), and two aft in superfiring positions. Darlan {{thought that the}} three [...] turrets aft on Richelieu were a mistake, since two turrets in centerline positions would provide the same broadside of six guns and save nearly , allowing six more [...] AA mountings. Two of these mountings would have been positioned {{in front of the}} fore tower in superfiring position abaft the fore [...] turrets, and four others, abeam the funnel and the axial aft [...] turrets, and abaft the [...] amidships turrets. As the firing arcs of the [...] turrets amidships were intended to be mainly directed forwards, the [...] AA battery would have been shielded enough from their blast effects. Moreover, these [...] turrets would have been fully enclosed, with a [...] plating against shrapnel. This new model of turrets was known as the [...] <b>CAD</b> <b>Model</b> 1937, and also as the mine sweeper sloop type, since it was intended to be installed on the [...] and [...] minesweeper sloop classes; it was also intended for the [...] destroyer class and as a secondary battery on the De Grasse cruiser class, to be commissioned in the late 1930s or early 1940s.|$|E
40|$|The {{compression}} of <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> {{is a key}} technology for realizing Internet-based collaborative product development because big model sizes often prohibit us to achieve a rapid product information transmission. Although there exist some algorithms for compressing discrete <b>CAD</b> <b>models,</b> original precise <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> are focused on in this paper. Here, the characteristics of hierarchical structures in <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> {{and the distribution of}} their redundant data are exploited for developing a novel data encoding method. In the method, different encoding rules are applied to different types of data. Geometric data is a major concern for reducing model sizes. For geometric data, the control points of B-spline curves and surfaces are compressed with the second-order predictions in a local coordinate system. Based on analysis to the distortion induced by quantization, an efficient method for computation of the distortion is provided. The results indicate that the data size of <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> can be decreased efficiently after compressed with the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Difficulty {{exists in}} scalp {{adaptation}} for cranioplasty with customized computer-assisted design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) implant {{in situations of}} excessive wound tension and sub-cranioplasty dead space. To solve this clinical problem, the CAD/CAM technique should include algorithms to reconstruct a depressed contour to cover the skull defect. Satisfactory CAM-derived alloplastic implants are based on highly accurate three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>CAD</b> <b>modeling.</b> Thus, it is quite important to establish a symmetrically regular CAD/CAM reconstruction prior to depressing the contour. The {{purpose of this study}} is to verify the aesthetic outcomes of <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> with regular contours using cranial index of symmetry (CIS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2011 to June 2012, decompressive craniectomy (DC) was performed for 15 consecutive patients in our institute. 3 -D <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> of skull defects were reconstructed using commercial software. These models were checked in terms of symmetry by CIS scores. RESULTS: CIS scores of CAD reconstructions were 99. 24 ± 0. 004 % (range 98. 47 - 99. 84). CIS scores of these <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> were statistically significantly greater than 95 %, identical to 99. 5 %, but lower than 99. 6 % (p< 0. 001, p =  0. 064, p =  0. 021 respectively, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test). These data evidenced the highly accurate symmetry of these <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> with regular contours. CONCLUSIONS: CIS calculation is beneficial to assess aesthetic outcomes of CAD-reconstructed skulls in terms of cranial symmetry. This enables further accurate <b>CAD</b> <b>models</b> and CAM cranial implants with depressed contours, which are essential in patients with difficult scalp adaptation...|$|R
