25|$|With the {{inclusion}} of the mafia conspiracy in article 416 bis of the Italian Penal Code, a serious gap was filled. In spite of its obvious danger, mafia conspiracy had not been recognized by the Penal Code as a criminal phenomenon. As a result, many judges had not considered the Mafia a <b>criminal</b> <b>association.</b> The provisions contained in article 416 of the Penal Code concerning <b>criminal</b> <b>association</b> were suitable to cope with local and limited phenomena of associated delinquency, but not with organized crime.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to exactly define the single function or goal of {{the phenomenon of the}} Mafia. Until the early 1980s, mafia was generally considered a unique Sicilian cultural attitude and form of power, excluding any corporate or organisational dimension. Some even used it as a defensive attempt to render the Mafia benign and romantic — not a <b>criminal</b> <b>association,</b> but the sum of Sicilian values that outsiders never will understand.|$|E
25|$|Ulrike Marie Meinhof (7 October 1934 – 9 May 1976) was a German far-left terrorist. She co-founded the Red Army Faction (Rote Armee Fraktion or RAF) in 1970, {{after having}} {{worked as a}} {{journalist}} for the monthly left-wing magazine konkret. She was arrested in 1972, charged with numerous murders {{and the formation of}} a <b>criminal</b> <b>association.</b> In 1976, before the trial concluded, Meinhof was found hanged in her prison cell. The official statement claimed that Meinhof had committed suicide, however several facts led to public controversy about her death.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{article will}} deal with the {{development}} of organized crime in the Puglia region of Southern Italy. The present study will trace the different criminal dynamics present in this territory and discuss the multiple typologies and structures of organized mafia-type associations. This study will also emphasize the presence of women in the <b>criminal</b> <b>associations</b> and analyze the evolution of women’s roles {{from the end of the}} 1980 ’s till the most recent judgments by the Italian Courts, in which the perpetrator or the co-perpetrator was for the first time found to be a woman. Throughout this mapping of organized crime groups within the local area, the author will examine the basic dimension of <b>criminal</b> <b>associations</b> reporting to the legal penal provisions: activities, rationale and scope...|$|R
25|$|Berlusconi {{has never}} been tried on charges {{relating}} to the Cosa Nostra, although several Mafia turncoats have stated that Berlusconi had connections with the Sicilian <b>criminal</b> <b>association.</b> The claims arise mostly from the hiring of Vittorio Mangano, {{who was accused of}} being a mafioso, as a gardener and stable-man at Berlusconi's Villa San Martino in Arcore, a small town near Milan. It was Berlusconi's friend Marcello Dell'Utri who introduced Mangano to Berlusconi in 1973. Berlusconi denied any ties to the Mafia. Marcello Dell'Utri even stated that the Mafia did not exist at all.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{advantage}} of {{the attention of the}} media and public opinion during the Carnival of 1993, Castor gave a 5-minute speech angrily condemning the persecution of bicheiros in full Sambadrome. Three months later, judge Denise Frossard convicted Castor and 13 other major bicheiros (among them Capitão Guimarães, Luizinho Drummond, Antonio Petrus Kalil, alias Turcão, and Anísio Abraão David) to six years of prison for <b>criminal</b> <b>association.</b> Formally, 53 deaths were attributed to the group.". However, in the same year Castro obtained a habeas corpus and was released and by December 1996 the rest of the bicheiros were all back on the streets, granted parole or clemency.|$|E
25|$|At the scene, {{the police}} took Aldrete, De León, Orea Ochoa, Juan Carlos Fragoso, and Jorge Montes into custody. The police also arrested María de Lourdes Güero López and María del Rocío Cuevas Guerra, other cultists under Constanzo, in Mexico City later that day. They were renting one of Constanzo's apartments. The {{individuals}} arrested that day were held for homicide, <b>criminal</b> <b>association,</b> wounding an officer, and damage to property. Fearing that Constanzo might have purposely faked his own death, investigators conducted fingerprint analysis. They {{concluded that the}} corpse was indeed Constanzo's. Constanzo's 9mm Uzi submachine gun and his supposed suitcase were never formally presented by the police as seized items. On May 15, a judge refused to set bail for them because they were wanted for crimes accumulating over 50 years in prison.|$|E

25|$|The {{most serious}} {{conflict}} has been between the “campesinos” (peasant farmers) and local caciques (bosses) over logging and drug crop growing/transport {{in the mountain}} areas of the municipality {{and other parts of}} the Costa Grande of Guerrero. In the 1990s, the logging company Boise Cascade Corp. made efforts to establish itself in this part of Guerrero state, making arrangements with national and local leaders to log forests located on ejido land in the area. The logging quickly began to exceed legal limits and began seriously damaging the ecology of the area, such as causing rivers and streams like the Coyuquilla River to dry up. Local farmers depend on these resources and, in the late 1990s, banded together to form the Campesino Environmentalist Organization of Petatlan and Coyuca de Catalan (OCEP). The group is best known for blocking logging roads, which had an effect on the industry. In 1998, two of the movement’s leaders, Rodolfo Montiel and Teodoro Cabrerea, confessed to charges. With the support of Amnesty International, Greenpeace and others, the two were released in 2001. Since then, there has been continued sporadic violence, including killings, leading to human rights condemnations. Another activist, Felipe Arriaga Sanchez, was detained on charges of murder and <b>criminal</b> <b>association</b> in 2004. Amnesty International believes that it is politically motivated. The OCEP continues to exist and fight deforestation mostly through legal channels, although some are still accused by authorities of drug trafficking and membership in a guerrilla group. The group states the charges come from local caciques when the group pushes for new legal actions. The group has had more success in the Petatlan Valley than in Coyuquilla Valley, but in both areas there continues to be large-scale illegal cutting, with cleared areas then being used for pasture or to grow drugs. The environment destruction forces many local farmers to become part of the drug production to survive.|$|E
25|$|For {{the rest}} of the 20th century to the present, the history of the area has been {{dominated}} by the struggles of campesinos against local and regional caciques, along with national and international interests which have worked with caciques for their own ends. Early efforts, to strengthen campesino rights included a league established in 1925, in Atoyac by Amadeo Vidales. In the 1930s, the ejido system gained the support of the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas, and it was strengthened with thirty six created in the municipality of Atoyac alone. However, large estates still remained such as the lands belonging to the Guerrero Land and Timber Co. which included parts of La Unión, Petatlán, Técpan, Atoyac, as well as Ajuchitlán, Coyuca de Catlán and even Chilpancingo in the interior. This left large parts of the Costa Grande still under the control of a few landholders. Labor movements in general were active from the 1930s to the 1950s, culminating is a strike by workers on coconut plantations from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo in 1952, which blocked roads. In the 1990s, guerrillas of the EZLN based in Chiapas gained footing in the Costa Grande, especially in the municipalities close to Acapulco such as Coyuca. These fought police and military forces {{for a number of years}} during this decade along with local groups such as the Comando Armado Revolucionario del Sur (CARS). This fighting lead to the militarization of many of the roads in the Costa Grande, including Highway 200. This fighting also coincided with the political struggles between the PRD party and the then-ruling PRI. Another struggle has been between local farmers and logging interests, especially in Petatlán. In the 1990s, arrangements with national and local leaders to log forests located on ejido land in the area. The logging quickly began to exceed legal limits and began seriously damaging the ecology of the area, such as causing rivers and streams like the Coyuquilla River to dry up.

With the support of Amnesty International, Greenpeace and others, the two were released in 2001.
