5000|$|... "Unlidded" [...] mugs and lidded tankards may be {{the most}} {{familiar}} pewter artifacts from the late 17th and 18th centuries, although the metal was also used for many other items including porringers, plates, dishes, basins, spoons, measures, flagons, <b>communion</b> <b>cups,</b> teapots, sugar bowls, beer steins, and cream jugs. In the early 19th century, changes in fashion caused a decline in the use of pewter flatware. At the same time, production increased of both cast and spun pewter tea sets, whale-oil lamps, candlesticks, and so on. Later in the century, pewter alloys were often used as a base metal for silver-plated objects.|$|R

5000|$|Nikolaus Pevsner {{considers}} the chapel [...] "has the best-preserved C18 ecclesiastical interior in South Lancashire". The original box pews {{are in place}} upstairs and down, there is a three tier pulpit on the north wall.

Other surviving artefacts brought from the 1645 building are the communion table and two Commonwealth silver <b>communion</b> <b>cups</b> gifted by Robert Mort in 1654. The cups are not kept at the chapel and are rarely displayed. Some of the stained glass windows are by Shrigley and Hunt.|$|R
2500|$|John Wesley, {{a founder}} of Methodism, {{said that it was}} the duty of Christians to receive the sacrament as often as possible. Methodists in the United States are {{encouraged}} to celebrate the Eucharist every Sunday, though it is typically celebrated on the first Sunday of each month, while a few go as long as celebrating quarterly (a tradition dating {{back to the days of}} circuit riders that served multiple churches). Communicants may receive standing, kneeling, or while seated. Gaining more wide acceptance is the practice of receiving by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). The most common alternative to intinction is for the communicants to receive the consecrated juice using small, individual, specially made glass or plastic <b>cups</b> known as <b>communion</b> <b>cups.</b> The United Methodist Church practices open communion, inviting [...] "all who intend a Christian life, together with their children" [...] to receive Communion.|$|R
50|$|Walker {{spent most}} of his life {{travelling}} between the fringe camps inhabited by displaced Aboriginals and, although he spurned white settlements and the restrictions of mission life, frequently visited the Point McLeay Mission (Raukkan) on the banks of Lake Alexandrina. Often arrested for drinking offenses he was popular in Point McLeay for his wit. One story that became almost legendary regarded his church attendances. Whenever the <b>communion</b> <b>cup</b> was passed to Walker, he would drain it then call out, Fill 'im up again. From the 1870s he was never seen without his companion Mary.|$|E
5000|$|The cup {{dates from}} the mid-15th century, and has been {{described}} as [...] "one of the most significant pieces of secular English medieval silver". Most such ing cups have been destroyed, or were altered due to changing fashion. However, the Lacock Cup was donated to the church soon after creation, and so it has survived in its original condition. The cup's function changed after the English Reformation, as new religious practices meant that a larger <b>communion</b> <b>cup</b> was required to hold sufficient wine for the whole congregation, in a time when strict laws prohibited the use of religious images. Since 1962, it has been on display at the British Museum.|$|E

60|$|Rollo and Carlos had {{not gone}} far before {{they came to a}} place where two {{children}} had set up what they called a chapel, under the archway which led to the interior of the house where they lived. A real chapel, in Catholic countries, is any consecrated place, large or small, containing an altar, and a crucifix, and other sacred emblems, where masses are said and other religious services are performed. Real chapels are made in the alcoves of churches, in monuments over tombs, and in other similar places, and children have toy chapels to play with. There are little crucifixes, and candlesticks, and <b>communion</b> <b>cups,</b> and other similar things for sale at the toy shops. Sometimes the children buy these things and arrange them on a small table, {{in a corner of the}} room, for play, just as in Protestant countries they arrange a pulpit and chairs for a congregation, and so make believe have a meeting. Sometimes the children bring out their chapel and set it near the sidewalk, by the street, and then hold out a little plate to ask the passers by for contributions. There are almost always some people more good matured than wise, who will give them a sou or two; and thus they often made up quite a little purse of money.|$|R
5000|$|He wrote a Catechism and a work {{defending}} the Protestant view of Scripture against {{the work of}} the great Cardinal Bellarmine. He established the first known public school in Cambuslang as well as the Howison Bursary (1613) which, along with the The Trades House of Glasgow https://web.archive.org/web/20070204035324/http://www.tradeshouse.org.uk/about_the_trades_house.asp supported a poor student in the University of Glasgow. The Trades House had a (much damaged) portrait of him taken in 1609, though it was damaged beyond recognition by a fire, and he is still commemorated in the University as a benefactor. His Howison Trust maintained two poor men of the Parish in the Hospital (that is, Poor House of Hamilton) right up until the 20th Century. Two silver <b>communion</b> <b>cups</b> designed by Gilbert Kirkwood and assayed in Edinburgh in 1618 are still used in the Church, and are known as the Howison Cups, because of an inscription thought to refer to him. Howies Hill near the Parish Church in Cambuslang is most likely to be remembrance of him. The Presbyterian form of Church governance which he fought for was not firmly instituted until eighty years after his death (following the invasion of William of Orange. It is still the form of the Church of Scotland today and to many of its members John Howison is a hero. (In fact, most of what we know about him comes from historians who obviously hero worshiped him, though one did admit that there was “more force than charity” in some of his words.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Vaughnsville's {{most unusual}} {{claim to fame}} is the first {{location}} in the World to use individual <b>communion</b> <b>cups</b> for the Lord's Supper. Though contested. John G. Thomas—a physician and pastor of the Vaughnsville Congregational Church—designed a communion outfit after noticing “a communicant with a diseased mouth condition”. Thomas applied for a patent for his invention on August 2, 1893, in which he wrote that he “invented certain new and useful improvements in communion service” which would “provide an individual or separate cup {{for the use of}} each person at the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, commonly called the communion service…” (Serial No. 482,186). According to The Lima News, Thomas and his church elders first experimented with the individual cups “sometime during 1893” (January 16, 1955, p. 5B). The patent for his invention was granted on March 6, 1894, and marked the first time an individual cup service received letters patent in the United States (Patent No. 516,065). Thomas moved to Lima and started the Thomas Communion Service Company in 1893 and it was sold in 1972.For many years the Northern Ohio Railroad maintained a passenger and freight station in Vaughnsville, and later a telegraph outlet, later Northern Ohio Railroad was bought by the Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad, Trains #90/95 were known as the [...] "Delphos Bullet", it was a mixed use train of freight and passenger that ran the entire 165 mile run from Akron to Delphos. The last run of this trip was on July 20, 1951 and was Ohio's last mixed train. The tracks were abandoned soon after and removed completely in the 80's.|$|R
