25|$|The Lamp Cabin {{opened in}} 2009, {{and is a}} {{recreation}} of a typical design used in collieries to house safety lamps, a necessary piece of equipment for miners (although not being required in the Mahogony Drift Mine, due to it being gas free). The building is split into two main rooms - in one half {{the interior of the}} lamp cabin is recreated, with a collection of lamps on shelves, and the system of safety tokens used to track which miners were underground. Included in the display is a 1927 Hailwood and Ackroyd lamp <b>cleaning</b> <b>machine</b> sourced from Morrison Busty Colliery in Annfield Plain. In the second room is an educational display (i.e. not a period interior).|$|E
500|$|After Jolie {{had just}} {{given birth to}} twins, she spent time {{training}} before filming to get fit in order to perform {{almost all of the}} stunts herself. Bonaventura said, [...] "She is so prepared and so ready and gung-ho, she'll do any stunt. We had her jumping out of helicopters, shooting, jumping off of all sorts of things and infiltrating places that are impossible to infiltrate". Salt's fighting style was described as a mixture of Muay Thai, Shaolin Kung-Fu, & Jeet Kune Do, which was considered by the stunt team the most suitable for Jolie's physique, and Krav Maga, for its rawness and aggressiveness. Noyce wanted to film the scene where Salt hangs {{from the edge of the}} building in a studio with chroma key, but Jolie insisted on doing it herself in the actual location. On May 29 2009, filming was temporarily halted after Jolie suffered a minor head injury during filming an action scene. She was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure and released on the same day with no serious injuries, allowing filming to resume. Salt's escape after being captured in St. Bartholomew's originally involved her jumping off a building into a window <b>cleaning</b> <b>machine,</b> but budgetary constraints caused the scene to be changed into a car chase.|$|E

2500|$|Advanced Patent Technology {{was founded}} in 1968 by Jack Solomon and Alvin Snapper, {{entrepreneurs}} who held patents in fields including medicine, optics, and electronics. The company's stock was publicly offered the next year. Its first 12 years were spent in the development stage.

2500|$|It is {{not always}} {{necessary}} to replace the ballast if it is fouled, nor must all the ballast be removed {{if it is to}} be cleaned. Removing and cleaning the ballast from the shoulder is often sufficient, if shoulder ballast is removed to the correct depth. While this job was historically done by manual labour, this process is now, like many other railway maintenance tasks, a mechanised one, with a chain of specially-designed railroad cars handling the task. One wagon cuts the ballast and passes it via a conveyor belt to a <b>cleaning</b> <b>machine,</b> then the cleaning wagon washes the ballast, and deposits the dirt and ballast into other wagons for disposal and re-use, respectively. Such machines can clean up to [...] of ballast in an hour.|$|E

[...] The Malibu Legacy Park Project responds to critical issues: (1) bacteria reduction by stormwater treatment, (2) nutrient reduction in wastewater management, (3) restoration and development of riparian habitats, and (4) {{the development of an}} open space area for passive recreation and environmental education. In addition, the Project will be linked by a [...] "linear park" [...] to neighboring Surfrider Beach, Malibu Pier, Malibu Lagoon, and Malibu Bluffs Park.|$|E
