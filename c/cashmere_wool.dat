25|$|The {{construction}} of water works and aspects of water technology in India {{is described in}} Arabic and Persian works. During medieval times, the diffusion of Indian and Persian irrigation technologies gave rise to an advanced irrigation system which bought about economic growth and also helped {{in the growth of}} material culture.

25|$|Historically, Kashmir {{became known}} {{worldwide}} when <b>Cashmere</b> <b>wool</b> was exported to other regions and nations (exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the cashmere goat and increased competition from China). Kashmiris are well adept at knitting and making Pashmina shawls, silk carpets, rugs, kurtas, and pottery. Saffron, too, is grown in Kashmir. Efforts are on to export the naturally grown {{fruits and vegetables}} as organic foods mainly to the Middle East. Srinagar {{is known for its}} silver-work, papier-mâché, wood-carving, and the weaving of silk. The economy was badly damaged by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which, as of 8 October 2005, resulted in over 70,000 deaths in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir and around 1,500 deaths in Indian controlled Kashmir. The Indian-administered portion of Kashmir is believed to have potentially rich rocks containing hydrocarbon reserves.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the differences between}} two international test methods on the assessment of pilling and appearance change of worsted spun <b>cashmere</b> and superfine <b>wool</b> knitwear and their blends. Differences between the standard ICI Pill Box Method and the Random Tumble Method were found in both the significance and magnitude of resistance to pilling and appearance change {{and the amount of}} fabric mass loss of worsted spun cashmere and <b>cashmere</b> superfine <b>wool</b> blend knit fabrics. The ICI Pill Box Method differentiated to a greater extent the effects of wool type and blend ratio of <b>cashmere</b> and <b>wool</b> compared with the Random Tumble Method. Generally the addition of cashmere or low crimp superfine wool resulted in fabrics being more resistance to pilling and appearance change compared with fabrics made from high crimp superfine wool. This was associated with increased fabric mass loss when assessed by the ICI Pill Box Method but not with the Random Tumble Method.

Indigo, used as a dye, made its way to the Greeks and the Romans via various trade routes, and was valued as a luxury product. The <b>cashmere</b> <b>wool</b> fiber, also known as pashm or pashmina, was used in the handmade shawls of Kashmir.

25|$|Bhagwan Gopinath {{was born}} in a Kashmiri pandit family of Bhans, in a {{locality}} called Bhan Mohalla, in the city of Srinagar in Kashmir, on Friday 3 July 1898, which corresponds to Ashad, Shuklapaksh, Dvadashi (Ashada 19th, Vikrami 1955) per Hindu lunar calendar. His grandfather, Pandit Lachhman Joo Bhan was a wazir wazarat (deputy commissioner) of revenue department in the Dogra regime of the then-princely state of Kashmir. His father, Pandit Narayan Joo Bhan dealt in the business of <b>cashmere</b> <b>wool</b> and devoted much of his time to spiritual pursuits. He is known to have donated all his ancestral inheritance to his step-mother. Bhagwan Gopinath’s mother, Haar Maal, was the daughter of Pandit Prasad Joo Parimoo who was an initiated disciple of a local saint. His brother disciples used to call him Jada Bharata. Hindu scriptures like Yoga Vasistha were regularly taught and discussed in religious gatherings at their house. Prasad Joo had initiated his younger daughter, Zapaer Ded, into Japa Yoga and eventually in her fifties, she was recognised as a saint. On one occasion, while Pandit Prasad Joo Parimoo was meditating at the shrine of the deity of Mata Kheer Bhawani in Kashmir, he is said to have had a vision of the deity who expressed her desire to be born in his family as his daughter. Soon thereafter, Haar Maal was born who eventually got married and gave birth to Bhagwan Gopinath.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, sereval {{varieties}} of animal fibres including cashmere and Australian fine Merino wool have been analysed by Fourier transform infrared microscope and differential scanning calorimeter. The {{results showed that}} both Chinese and Australian cashmere fibres started absorbing heat at a relatively higher temperature but were thermally degraded quicker than other animal fibres tested. However, the mass changes (within the temperature range of 200 oC to 350 oC) and associated onset temperatures varied among fibre varieties. From the attenuated total reflectance spectra, the Chinese cashmere was clearly different from Australian <b>cashmere</b> and <b>wool</b> in a peak near 1040 cm- 1 wavelength for S-O stretching of cysteic acid residues. The Chinese cashmere presented a stronger absorption at 1019 cm- 1 wavelength, while Australian <b>cashmere</b> and <b>wool</b> peaked at 1079 cm- 1 wavelength and had a weaker absorption. Combined with thermal analysis, the normalised R-SO 3 - content of cysteic acid residues to the amide II peak of the protein backbone may have potential use in identifying Australian fine Merino <b>wool</b> from Chinese <b>cashmere.</b> <br /...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{focussed}} on three main areas. First, {{an evaluation of}} the physical attributes of cashmere tops available to commercial spinners; second, the influence of processing variables on the efficiency of producing cashmere tops from raw Australian cashmere; and third, the influence of design of <b>cashmere</b> ultrafine <b>wool</b> blends on the fibre curvature of tops. Testing the physical attributes of cashmere tops from traditional and new sources of supply, was followed by statistical analyses based on factors of origin, processor and other determinants. The analyses demonstrated important processor effects and also that cashmere from different origins shows commercially important variations in fibre attributes. It was possible to efficiently produce Australian cashmere tops with Hauteur, tenacity, extension, softness and residual guard hairs quality attributes equivalent to those observed in the best cashmere tops. The blending of <b>cashmere</b> with <b>wool</b> resulted in a reduction of the mean fibre curvature of the blend compared with the unblended wool. The present work demonstrated that the fibre curvature properties of blended low crimp ultrafine wool tops were closer to the properties of pure cashmere tops than were tops made from blended standard high crimp ultrafine wool. The attributes of textiles made from the relatively rare Australian low curvature cashmere could enhance the marketability of both Australian cashmere and low curvature wool. <br /...|$|R
