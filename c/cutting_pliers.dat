5000|$|Diagonal pliers (or wire cutters or {{diagonal}} <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers</b> or diagonal cutters or side <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers)</b> are pliers {{intended for}} the cutting of wire (they are generally not used to grab or turn anything). The plane defined by the cutting edges of the jaws intersects the joint rivet at an angle or [...] "on a diagonal", hence the name.|$|E

5000|$|Needle-nose pliers (also {{known as}} pointy-nose pliers, long-nose pliers, pinch-nose pliers or snipe-nose <b>pliers)</b> are both <b>cutting</b> and holding <b>pliers</b> used by artisans, {{jewellery}} designers, electricians, network engineers and other tradesmen to bend, re-position and snip wire. Their namesake long nose gives excellent control while {{the cutting edge}} near the pliers' joint provides [...] "one-tool" [...] convenience. Because of their long shape they are useful for reaching into small areas where cables or other materials have become stuck or unreachable with fingers or other means.|$|R
40|$|Optical {{correlator}} has wide {{applications in}} many different areas such as signs recognition(1), biophysics(2), or security(3). A new application referred to forensic science, using a system schematically shown in Fig. 1, is reported here. Almost every tool has its characteristic damages and manufacturing marks, a kind of 'signature'. These characteristics enable one to compare a test mark made with the tool with the toolmark found {{at the crime scene}} and connect it with the used tool. (4) In our research, the cut end of the wire (diameter = 1 mm) left by a burglar was matched with the probe impression made by suspected <b>pliers</b> <b>cutting</b> blades in lead (length = 24 mm). The image of toolmarks at the trial cut end of the wire and the series of images of 24 slightly overlapping segments of the probe impression were obtained by scanning elecron microscope (SEM) at the same low magnification (Fig. 2. (a) and (b)). Each striation pattern of wire cut toolmark was characterized by the sequence of parallel fringes, grey level (0 – 255), for each point averaged over 10 pixels; three files were extracted to account for possible missalingment of the cut end of the wire. The fringe pattern for pliers was extracted in the same way from the image file created by merging 24 successive images. The prepared files are shown in Fig. 3. To map the location of increased matching probability between the fringe patterns of the wire cut and the pliers impression, we performed numerical and optical correlations. Optical measurements are realized by using the correlator (Fig. 1) with a film transparency (for displaying input images), a liquid crystal display (for displaying phase-only filters), and a CCD camera (for detecting output correlations). The obtained results are normalized to emphasize the true correlation maximum (Figs. 4 and 5). Evidently, both correlation procedures give similar results...|$|R

50|$|Since lures and hooks feature razor sharp points, {{care must}} be taken not to hook oneself or others when casting, {{especially}} when performing two-handed full power casts that require a substantial safety zone behind the surfcaster.

50|$|This problem {{persists}} {{today in}} spite of the many different retention systems that have been engineered. Hubcaps generally use either clip-on retention, where some type of spring steel clip (or plastic clip in the case of plastic hubcaps) engages a groove in the wheel; or bolt-on retention, where a threaded fastener retains the hubcap, or a plastic washer attached to the lugnut itself holds the hubcap on. Honda and, to a lesser degree, Hyundai tend to use the latter system. Clip-on hubcaps tend to pop off suddenly when the wheel impacts a pothole or curbstone, while bolt-on hubcaps are more likely to vibrate loose over time, and tend to rattle and squeak. To prevent loss, many owners attach plastic wheel trims to the wheel itself using an electrical zip tie, which are sold in a silver colour for this very purpose. Enterprising manufacturers also sell a small kit consisting of spare zip ties, a pair of <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers</b> and latex gloves to allow a trim thus secured to be removed easily {{in the event of a}} puncture.|$|E

The data collection apparatus {{is used to}} collect the surface data of such marks produced by {{scissors and}} <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers,</b> and then get the profile curve that is vertical {{to the surface of}} striation marks. In application of fractal theory, the fractal dimension of such profile curve is then calculated, and further studies are made on its fractal characteristics. As an exploration on tool types and individual identification, this is aimed to provide a new theory and approach to examination identification of striation tool marks...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Orthodontic {{ligature}} <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers</b> are expensive. Methods of sterilization {{should be}} safe considering patients' health {{as well as}} lifetime of orthodontic pliers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the wear of orthodontic ligature <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers</b> after sterilizing with dry heat or steam autoclave. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, thirty ligature <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers</b> from 3 different factories (Dentarum-Germany, RMO and ETM-USA) were sterilized in either dry heat or steam autoclave. The amount of wear at the tip of each plier in both groups was measured with a stereomicroscope and digital photomicrography. Wear was defined as the difference of the initial length and the length after 10, 20, 30 cycles of sterilization measured by the distance from a reference line on the tip of the plier. Three way ANOVA was used to compare wear between the two sterilization groups. P< 0. 05 was considered as the limit of significance. Results: The amount of wear of the ligature cutting pliers' tip after 10, 20 and 30 cycles in dry heat sterilization was 1. 0 ± 0. 16, 0. 98 ± 0. 22 and 0. 94 ± 0. 31 mm respectively. These figures were 1. 16 ± 0. 15, 1. 16 ± 0. 13 and 1. 15 ± 0. 14 mm for steam heat sterilization. The higest wear was observed after 20 cycles of sterilization in autoclavce whereas the lowest was seen in dry heat sterilization after 30 cycles. The differences between the two studied groups were statistically significant (P< 0. 0001). In addition, increasing sterilization cycles decreased the rate of wear in both groups. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study routine autoclaving caused more damage and wear at the tip of the pliers than dry heat sterilization...|$|E
40|$|Cleaving {{crystals}} in {{a vacuum}} chamber is a simple method for obtaining atomically flat and clean surfaces for materials that have a preferential cleaving plane. Most in-situ cleavers use parallel cutting edges that are applied from two sides on the sample. We found in ambient experiments that diagonal <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers,</b> where the cleavage force is introduced in a single point instead of a line work very well also for hard materials. Here, we incorporate the diagonal cutting plier principle in a design compatible with ultra-high vacuum requirements. We show optical microscopy (mm scale) and atomic force microscopy (atomic scale) images of NiO(001) surfaces cleaved with this device.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the flexural strength of the stems of three maxillary expanders screws of Morelli, Forestadent and Dentaurum brands. METHODS: The sample consisted of nine expander screws (totalizing of 36 stems), three from each brand, all stainless steel and 12 mm of expansion capacity. The stems of the expander screws were cut with <b>cutting</b> <b>pliers</b> close to the weld region with screw body, then fixed in a universal testing machine Instron 4411 for tests of bending resistance of three points. The ultimate strength in kgF exerted by the machine to bend the stem of the 5 mm screw was recorded and the flexural strength was calculated using a mathematical formula. During the flexural strength test it was verified the modulus of elasticity of the stems by means of Bluehill 2 software. The flexural strength data were subjected to ANOVA with one criterion and Tukey's test, with significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: Forestadent screw brand showed the greatest bending strength, significantly higher than Dentaurum. Morelli showed the lowest resistance. CONCLUSION: The flexural strength of the screws varied according to the brand. Forestadent screw showed the greatest resistance and Morelli the lowest. All the three screws were found adequate for use in procedures for rapid maxillary expansion...|$|E
