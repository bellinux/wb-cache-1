5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned {{leading edge}} of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} to house steam condensers for the evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E

40|$|As {{a typical}} {{cross-cutting}} technology, cooling and refrigeration equipment {{is used for}} a variety of industrial applications. While cooling is often provided by electric compression <b>cooling</b> <b>systems,</b> thermal <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> powered by low-temperature waste heat could improve energy efficiency and promise a technical saving potential corresponding to 0. 5 % of the total electricity demand in the German industry. In this paper, we investigate the current and future cost-effectiveness of thermal <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> for industrial companies. Our focus is on single-stage, closed absorption and adsorption <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> with <b>cooling</b> powers between 40 and 100 kW, which use low-temperature waste heat at temperature levels between 70 °C and 85 °C. We analyse the current and future cost-effectiveness of these alternative <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> using annual <b>cooling</b> costs (annuities) and payback times. For a forecast until 2015, we apply the concept of experience curves, identifying learning ra tes of 14 % (absorption machines) and 17 % (adsorption machines) by an expert survey of the German market. The results indicate that thermal <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> are currently only cost-effective under optimistic assumptions (full-time operation, high electricity prices) when compared to electric compression <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> Nevertheless, the cost and efficiency improvements expected for this still young technology mean that thermal <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> could be more cost-effective in the future. However, depending on future electricity prices, a high number of operating hours is still crucial to achieve payback times substantially below 4 years which are usually required for energy efficiency measures to be widely adopted in the industry...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Rolls-Royce started {{planning}} its future aero-engine development programme and realised {{there was a}} need for an engine larger than their 21-litre (1,296cu in) Kestrel which was being used with great success in a number of 1930s aircraft. Consequently, work was started on a new -class design known as the PV-12, with PV standing for Private Venture, 12-cylinder, as the company received no government funding for work on the project. The PV-12 was first run on 15 October 1933 and first flew in a Hawker Hart biplane (serial number K3036) on 21 February 1935. The engine was originally designed to use the evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> then in vogue. This proved unreliable and when ethylene glycol from the U.S. became available, the engine was adapted to use a conventional liquid-cooling system. The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls-Royce where, as a Merlin testbed, it completed over 100 hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} programme, {{particularly}} during the Shuttle-Mir programme, Mir suffered from various systems failures. It had been designed for five years of use, but eventually flew for fifteen, and in the 1990s was showing its age, with constant computer crashes, loss of power, uncontrolled tumbles through space and leaking pipes. NASA astronaut John Blaha's account of the air quality on Mir—"very healthy, it's not dry, it's not humid. Nothing smells."—contradicts sharply the concerns about air quality on the space station that Jerry Linenger relates in his book about his time on the facility. Linenger says that due {{to the age of}} the space station, the <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> had developed tiny leaks too small and numerous to be repaired, that permitted the constant release of coolant, making it unpleasant to breathe the air. He says that it was especially noticeable after he had made a spacewalk and become used to the bottled air in his spacesuit. When he returned to the station and again began breathing the air inside Mir, he was deeply shocked by the intensity of the chemical smell and very worried about the possible negative health effects of breathing such heavily contaminated air.|$|E

5|$|When Britain began {{planning}} to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, {{it was decided}} to build a pair of air-cooled graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Windscale. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly graphite was chosen as a neutron moderator because beryllia was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns {{about the possibility of a}} catastrophic nuclear meltdown in the densely populated British Isles if the <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous Windscale fire in October 1957. They would be the last major air-cooled plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on Magnox and AGR designs used carbon dioxide instead.|$|E
