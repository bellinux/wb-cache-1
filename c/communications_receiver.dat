50|$|<b>Communications</b> <b>receivers</b> as an {{identifiable}} product type originated in 1933.The older generation of tube-based <b>communications</b> <b>receivers</b> are affectionately known as boatanchors for their large size and weight. Such receivers include the Collins R-390 and R-390A, the RCA AR-88, the Racal RA-17L and the Marconi Electra. However, even modern solid-state receivers {{can be very}} large and heavy, such as the Plessey PR2250, the Redifon R551 or the Rohde & Schwarz EK070/D2-80.|$|R
2500|$|The EA-18G can {{be fitted}} {{with up to}} five ALQ-99 jamming pods and will {{typically}} add two AIM-120 AMRAAM or AGM-88 HARM missiles. [...] The EA-18G will also use the INCANS Interference Cancellation system that will allow voice communication while jamming enemy communications, a capability not available on the EA-6B. In addition to the radar warning and jamming equipment, the Growler possesses a <b>communications</b> <b>receiver</b> and jamming system that will provide suppression and electronic attack against airborne communication threats.|$|E
2500|$|Boeing {{is looking}} into other {{potential}} upgrades; the ALQ-99 radar jamming pod may be replaced in the future, and the company {{is looking into}} adding weapons and replacing the satellite <b>communications</b> <b>receiver.</b> The Growler is the initial platform for the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) which uses Active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology to focus jamming power exactly where needed. The NGJ was to be implemented on the F-35. However, in May 2012, the U.S. Navy decided to focus NGJ integration on the EA-18G for an expected in-service date of 2020, and defer work for the F-35. [...] Boeing is also looking at exporting a Growler Lite configuration without the jamming pods for electronic awareness rather than electronic attack.|$|E
