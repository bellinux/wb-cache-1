5|$|On 6 October, {{a number}} of private interbank <b>credit</b> <b>facilities</b> to Icelandic banks were shut down. Prime Minister Geir Haarde {{addressed}} the nation in a speech that became infamous for its portentous closing words: 'God bless Iceland'. He announced a package of new regulatory measures which were {{to be put to}} the Althing, Iceland's parliament, immediately, with the cooperation of the opposition parties. These included the power of the FME to take over the running of Icelandic banks without nationalising them, and preferential treatment for depositors in the event that a bank had to be liquidated. In a separate measure, retail deposits in Icelandic branches of Icelandic banks were guaranteed in full. The emergency measures had been deemed unnecessary by the Icelandic government less than 24 hours earlier.|$|E

Studies are currently under way to adapt and develop greenhouse and organic production technology for local farms. Examples of well-received new produce varieties are: supersweet maize, heat tolerant lettuce, coloured sweet pepper, spaghetti squash, strawberry and white bitter cucumber.|$|E
25|$|The modest <b>credit</b> <b>facilities</b> of the IMF {{were clearly}} {{insufficient}} {{to deal with}} Western Europe's huge balance of payments deficits. The problem was further aggravated by the reaffirmation by the IMF Board of Governors in the provision in the Bretton Woods Articles of Agreement that the IMF could make loans only for current account deficits and not for capital and reconstruction purposes. Only the United States contribution of $570 million was actually available for IBRD lending. In addition, because the only available market for IBRD bonds was the conservative Wall Street banking market, the IBRD was forced to adopt a conservative lending policy, granting loans only when repayment was assured. Given these problems, by 1947 the IMF and the IBRD themselves were admitting {{that they could not}} deal with the international monetary system's economic problems.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the IMF negotiates {{conditions}} on lending and loans under their policy of conditionality, {{which was established}} in the 1950s. Low-income countries can borrow on concessional terms, which means there is a period of time with no interest rates, through the Extended <b>Credit</b> <b>Facility</b> (ECF), the Standby <b>Credit</b> <b>Facility</b> (SCF) and the Rapid <b>Credit</b> <b>Facility</b> (RCF). Nonconcessional loans, which include interest rates, are provided mainly through Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), and the Extended Fund Facility. The IMF provides emergency assistance via the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to members facing urgent balance-of-payments needs.|$|R

Serving as a strong advocate for its members against disadvantageous public policies is also part of the work of NASSI.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Emancipation reform of 1861, there were no <b>credit</b> <b>facilities</b> {{available}} to landowners. The State Bank of the Russian Empire (predecessor of the Central Bank of Russia) was founded in 1862 but did not deal in mortgages. A new law was passed in May 1872 which allowed the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Empire to approve new banks with less than 5 million rubles in capital. That greatly simplified approval procedures as new banks no longer needed approvals from the State Council or the Tsar. However, Finance Minister Mikhail Reytern was afraid that a rapid expansion of the banking network could cause banks to fail. He prohibited from establishing new banks in cities where one already existed and limited the number of banks to two per province. Therefore, entrepreneurs hurried to establish new banks in various regional centers. In total, eleven land banks were established in 1871–1873. Their initial combined equity was 13.5 million rubles.|$|E

Settlement was directed by a state corporation, the [...] "Libyan Colonization Society", which undertook land reclamation and the building of model villages and offered a grubstake and <b>credit</b> <b>facilities</b> to the settlers it had sponsored.|$|E
50|$|In July 2006, Leor sold {{approximately}} 3360 acre net in its {{holdings in}} the Amoruso Prospect to its joint-venture partner, EnCana, for $242.9 million. The transaction resulted in Leor and EnCana each having a 50% {{stake in the}} prospect. After the transaction Leor held a 23725 acre net position in the prospect. Leor used part of the proceeds to redeem its $30.0 million Senior Secured Note. In December 2006, Leor entered into a $150.0 million three-year senior secured, revolving <b>credit</b> <b>facility</b> with JPMorgan Chase Bank as lead agent. In March 2007, Leor and JPMorgan amended the <b>credit</b> <b>facility,</b> adding BNP Paribas as a lender. While to date {{there has been no}} draw-down of the facility, Leor currently has the ability to draw $50.0 million of the $150.0 million revolving <b>credit</b> <b>facility.</b> The new <b>credit</b> <b>facility</b> included provisions that allowed Leor, subject to certain restrictions and lender approval over its term, to increase the revolving credit commitment borrowing base.|$|R

2500|$|The company's {{cash flow}} had {{decreased}} by over $120 million annually during the Shapiro years. In October 2008, Six Flags was warned its stock value had fallen below the required minimums to remain {{listed on the}} New York Stock Exchange. With the financial crisis of 2007–08 weighing both on consumer spending {{and the ability to}} access <b>credit</b> <b>facilities,</b> Six Flags was believed to be unable to make a payment to preferred stockholders due in August 2009. Management saw the business as a sound one, noting that attendance across the company's parks increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007. Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said that the company's problem was the declining attendance and cash flow created by his new management initiatives [...] If not resolved, the company warned in its 2008 annual report that the situation might require a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, with Six Flags already retaining counsel should that occur. The company stated at the time that it expected business to continue as normal in the event of such a filing, although one analyst believed attendance at the company's parks would decrease by six percent, suggesting parents would be leery of letting their children ride a roller coaster operated by a bankrupt company. In April 2009, the New York Stock Exchange announced it would delist Six Flags' stock on April 20, a decision that the company did not intend to appeal. On June 1, 2009, Six Flags announced they would delay their $15million debt payment further using a 30-day grace period. Less than two weeks later, on June 13, the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but issued a statement that the parks would continue to operate normally while the company restructured. On August 21, 2009, Six Flags' Chapter 11 restructuring plan was announced in which lenders would control 92% of the company in exchange for cancelling $1.13billion in debt.|$|E
