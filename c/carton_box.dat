2500|$|On {{the basis}} of this prototype, some claim Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of telephones. In the beginning, he was {{inspired}} by the telegraph. Different from other pioneers of the telephone—such as Charles Bourseul, Philipp Reis, Innocenzo Manzetti, and others—he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph key (in scientific jargon, the [...] "make-and-break" [...] method). Instead, he looked for a [...] "continuous" [...] solution, meaning one that didn't interrupt the electric flux. In 1856, Meucci reportedly constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus {{in the shape of a}} horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium dichromate and a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was housed in a cylindrical <b>carton</b> <b>box.</b> He purportedly constructed it to connect his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his invalid wife.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s Khvostov {{developed}} his own technique - he used piles of <b>carton</b> <b>boxes</b> {{acting as a}} divisible canvas. His first series on <b>carton</b> <b>boxes</b> was exhibited in September 2000 in the Pushkinskaya 10 Art Centre. This project, named “Memorial of leaders”, included portraits of Leonid Brezhnev, Adolf Hitler, Vladimir Lenin, Marilyn Monroe, Peter the Great, Joseph Stalin, Ayatollah Khomeini, Jesus Christ, Mao Zedong and Ernesto Che Guevara with Vladimir Putin being the pivotal figure of the series.|$|R

30|$|As a {{practical}} case, {{the production of}} beverages at a leading European producer of fruit juice is considered. The beverages {{as well as other}} branches of the consumer goods industry face an increased number of package forms, customized package prints and labels, and a variety of flavours and compositions of ingredients. Caused by environmental regulations and the need for improved logistics efficiency, novel package forms have been developed. For instance, in the European Union plastic bottles represent the major package form for fruit juices and other types of refreshment drinks. At the same time, glass bottles become less important except for alcoholic drinks and some specific kinds of beverages. Another common package form is <b>carton</b> <b>boxes</b> made from foldable cardboard. However, <b>carton</b> <b>boxes</b> continue losing market share compared to plastic bottles. Both plastic bottles and <b>carton</b> <b>boxes</b> allow liquid food to be packaged and stored under ambient temperature conditions for up to a year.|$|R

During his collaboration with the Guelman Gallery Khvostov took part in the “Piterskiye” project at the “Art Moscow” fair in 2005 and got a grant from the Marat Guelman Contemporary Art Funding Agency. In a year spent in his Moscow studio the artist completed two projects: a grand-scale model of the Moscow Kremlin made of <b>carton</b> <b>boxes</b> and an artistic revision of the “Venus of Urbino” by Tiziano, also painted on the <b>carton</b> <b>boxes</b> and potentially divided into blocks. However, the exhibition in Marat Guelman’s Gallery wasn’t held and in 2006 Oleg came back to Saint Petersburg.|$|R
30|$|From {{the various}} package forms, {{the line for}} filling plastic bottles is {{considered}} as the one showing the highest filling speed and the most complex setup conditions.

I made a little altar out of a milk <b>carton</b> <b>box.</b> That night I was sanctified through and through. I came {{to the point of}} saying to God, [...] "If I am going to be a Christian, I want to be the best Christian I can. I don't want to play games. I don't want to go halfway. Here's my life. Translate my testimony of faith to integrity in life. I want my words spoken and deeds done to flow from what I believe and affirm." [...] From the depth of my heart, that night, and by the grace of God, I spoke a [...] "forever yes!" [...] to God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.|$|E
