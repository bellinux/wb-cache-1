5|$|On the ground, the Georgia Tech rushing {{attack was}} led by Tashard Choice. <b>Choice</b> <b>was</b> the leading rusher in the ACC, {{averaging}} over 100 yards per game. Against North Carolina State, Choice recorded 164 rushing yards on 34 carries, earning {{what was then a}} single-game career high in rushing yards. In the days before the ACC championship, <b>Choice</b> <b>was</b> named to the second-team All-ACC team, and was considered to be a threat on offense against Wake Forest.|$|E

40|$|<b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the central}} {{elements}} in the experience of free will, but it has not received a good account from either compatibilists or libertarians. This paper develops an account of choice based around three features: (i) <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> an action; (ii) <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> not determined by one's prior beliefs and desires; (iii) once the question of what to do has arisen, <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> typically both necessary and sufficient for moving to action. These features might appear to support a libertarian account, but they do not. Instead it is argued that all three features can be accommodated within a compatibilist account, where <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> needed because of agents' inabilities to arrive at judgements about what <b>is</b> best. <b>Choice</b> differs though from random picking: in choosing, agents frequently (though not always) deploy abilities that enable them to make good choices. In such cases, judgements about what is best will frequently follow the <b>choice.</b> Finally, <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> distinguished from agency and, {{on the basis of the}} distinction, the claim that <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> an action is made good...|$|R

She was nevertheless disillusioned with the pornographic industry and left it after three months.|$|E
5000|$|Deliberate choice (proairesis), [...] "seems to {{determine}} one's character more than one's actions do". Things {{done on the}} spur of the moment, and things done by animals and children can be willing, but driven by desire and spirit and not what we would normally call true <b>choice.</b> <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> rational, and according to the understanding of Aristotle, <b>choice</b> can <b>be</b> in opposition to desire. <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> also not wishing for things one does not believe can be achieved, such as immortality, but rather always concerning realistic aims. <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> also not simply to do with opinion, because our choices make us the type of person we are, and are not simply true or false. What distinguishes <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> that before a <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> made there is a rational deliberation or thinking things through.|$|R
40|$|<b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> a key {{theme in}} current {{government}} policy within the United Kingdom. Present {{as an important}} value for the delivery of public services, of particular interest here <b>is</b> <b>choice</b> {{at the end of}} life. By focusing on older people residing in care homes, a number of questions are raised about the implications of this aspiration. What does choice mean for older people who are societally marginalised and live in a care setting that sits, primarily, outside public provision? Aspects of <b>choice</b> <b>are</b> explored here with respect to when <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> offered, what care is provided and where this occurs. Both the context of care and the population to whom <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> to be offered shape the nature of <b>choice</b> as <b>is</b> outlined here...|$|R

5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{forms of the}} story, the woman's pig-like appearance {{was the result of}} witchcraft. Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of having her appear beautiful to him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and beautiful to others. When her husband told her that the <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, {{it follows that the}} <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> a correct one that leads to a satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E

40|$|The <b>choice</b> {{operator}} <b>is</b> {{essential for}} the description of action-based reactive systems. If the atomicity of actions is dropped (e. g. by action refinement), one has to decide when the <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> triggered. The standard approach is to trigger the choice when actions start. This thesis examine the alternative approach that the <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> triggered when actions terminate. This end-based <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> motivated and a process algebra, which contains an end-based choice and an action refinement operator, is established. Consistent semantics (operational, denotational, axiomatical) are given. Furthermore, {{the difference between the}} start-based and the end-based <b>choice</b> <b>are</b> examined, in particular with respect to equivalence notions. New equivalence are established, since the standard equivalences are not preserved by the end-based action refinement operator...|$|R

The visit then turned to scandal: Péladan issued a call for all Romanians to embrace Catholicism, and left the country on pain of being deported.|$|E
5|$|The casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic.

She's stuck in the hotel until the Doctor appears in a lift. Russell T Davies thought of this idea to pick for a potential Christmas Special for 2009 to give to Phil Ford to write. Phil decided to use some aliens in the plot he was given and a chase down Buckingham Palace. But Russell decided that the better <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> 'Christmas on Mars' which then became The Waters of Mars.|$|E

50|$|The {{fundamental}} difference between context-free grammars and parsing expression grammars is that the PEG's <b>choice</b> operator <b>is</b> ordered. If the first alternative succeeds, the second alternative is ignored. Thus ordered <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> not commutative, unlike unordered choice as in context-free grammars. Ordered <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> analogous to soft cut operators available in some logic programming languages.|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} is presented for making <b>choices</b> that <b>are</b> primarily constrained by aesthetic, as opposed to, pragmatic considerations. An {{example of the}} application of this {{framework is}} a computer system called "Ani", capable of making simple computer animation in response to high-level incomplete story descriptions. Aesthetic <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> presented as a parallel computation in which each choice point gathers together and evaluates suggestions.

5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> selected, {{there would be an}} option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured {{that there would be no}} possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E
5|$|Back in Salisbury, the Southern Rhodesian {{government}} was coming {{under pressure from}} Britain to put its armed forces under the purview of a regional command. Huggins decided in late October 1942 to join a unified Southern African Command headed by South Africa's Jan Smuts. This <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> motivated {{by a combination of}} strategic concerns and geopolitical manoeuvring. Apart from considering South Africa a more appropriate partner in geographical, logistical and cultural terms, Huggins feared that the alternative—joining the British East Africa Command—might detract from the autonomous nature of Southern Rhodesia's war effort, with possible constitutional implications. A shift in the deployment of the colony's troops duly occurred. For the rest of the war the majority of Rhodesian servicemen went into the field integrated into South African formations, prominently the 6th Armoured Division.|$|E

5|$|Ballard was {{selected}} in the first round, 11th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. The <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> seen as a surprise by draft observers, as he was projected to be a late first-round to second-round pick. Ballard himself professed the early selection to be unexpected, saying {{he was ready to}} be drafted between the 20th and 40th positions. Scouting reports listed him as a puck-rushing offensive defenseman with comparisons to Phil Housley. Before making his NHL debut, he was traded twice. He was initially dealt by Buffalo to the Colorado Avalanche on July 3, 2003, for Steven Reinprecht. The following year, he was traded again to the Phoenix Coyotes, along with defenseman Derek Morris, for forward Chris Gratton, defenseman Ossi Väänänen and a second-round selection in the 2005 draft.|$|E
5|$|D'Eyncourt {{probably}} avoided proposing any {{design with}} 16-inch guns {{when he saw}} the political situation. In meetings with Leão, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong as that of the Minas Geraes class, but a design with no less than fourteen 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> a larger number of guns.|$|E
5|$|Despite most {{games in}} the series taking place in {{different}} continuities, they do share certain elements. One of its defining traits is it being set in a contemporary urban environment, specifically modern-day Tokyo. Post-apocalyptic elements are a recurring feature in settings and narratives. This <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> originally made to set the game apart from other fantasy-based gaming franchises of the time, as modern day Tokyo was rarely seen in games as opposed to versions {{of it from the}} past. The Persona series takes place exclusively within this setting, spanning a single continuity and mostly focusing on the exploits of a group of young people.|$|E
