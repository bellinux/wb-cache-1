40|$|The coiled-coil is a {{very common}} protein {{structural}} motif, consisting {{of two or more}} alpha helices intertwined in a supercoil. In biological systems it is found in proteins which fulfil a number of roles, for example in structural proteins such as keratin, as well as a large number of transcription factors and other DNA binding proteins, where it functions as a dimerisation domain. This versatile motif has also been adapted for a number of applications including the production of responsive hydrogels; the construction of self-assembling fibres for tissue engineering applications; as a cross-linking agent in drug delivery applications, {{as well as in the}} creation of biosensor surfaces. In this study two different types of protein containing coiled-coil domains are examined. It is the aim of this work to increase the understanding of how behaviour of this motif at the molecular level relates to those at the macroscopic. The first set of proteins of interest in this thesis form pH-responsive hydrogel systems utilising a variant of the coiled-coil motif, the leucine zipper, as their cross-linking domain. These consist of two or more leucine zippers separated by random <b>coil</b> <b>spacer</b> sections. When the leucine zipper sequences dimerise, they cross-link the proteins forming a gel matrix. As charges within the leucine zippers alter, as the pH of their environment is altered, their relative stability changes causing them to associate or dissociate. This is reflected in a change in the physical characteristics of gels from visco-elastic solids to viscous liquids which is reversible. The bulk properties of these materials is well characterised, but relatively little information is known at the molecular level. Starting at the single molecule level and scaling up to the mesoscale, the behaviour of hydrogel-forming proteins has been probed using a range of techniques, particularly with respect to the interactions of the coiled-coil forming domains. Studies described in this thesis have concentrated on the change of physical characteristics of these proteins and their assemblies as pH was altered. We have thus been able to connect behaviour of these proteins at the molecular scale to bulk properties of solutions and materials formed from them. In the final experimental chapter a coiled-coil structure of more complex architecture is examined. This is formed of a ternary complex of three proteins which assemble into a two-stranded leucine zipper domain, designed as a cross-linking motif for nano-particle assemble. Force was used to probe the kinetic stability and mechanical strength of this assembly. With the increasing use of the coiled-coil motif as a cross-linking domain in the use of biomaterials it is increasingly important to be able to connect the behaviour of such materials to the behaviour of the coiled-coil motif at the molecular scale, to gain further insight into the mechanistics behind their behaviour.

40|$|The {{homogeneity}} {{of the magnetic}} field in the LHC dipoles strongly depends on the correct position of the superconducting cables: this {{is related to the}} quality of the dipole components, such as the dimension of the <b>coil</b> <b>spacers</b> (copper wedges), of the cable and of the collars. The performance in operational conditions is also affected by the magnetization of the cables. In this work, we analyse the measurements of these quantities during the production of the 1276 LHC dipoles, their trends, and the relation to the measured magnetic field. A novel mtehod to locate electrical shorts based on the analysis of magnetic measurements is also presented, and applications to 15 dipoles reascued during the production is given...|$|R

Suspension lifts also impact other factors, such as drive shaft length, steering geometry and brake lines. Legality is often an issue when installing suspension lifts, as many jurisdictions have varying laws on vehicle ride height and placement of lights and bumpers.|$|R

40|$|The 1 -m model {{program for}} the main LHC dipoles is now mainly {{focussed}} on double-aperture magnets. In the past years an intensive program based on single-aperture dipoles allowed to select the series-design features among several variants for the coil cross section, the material of the collars and of the <b>coil</b> end <b>spacers,</b> the <b>coil</b> pre-stress and the cable insulation. The recent double-aperture models are dedicated to the fine-tuning of the baseline design and the manufacture of the coil ends.

40|$|The <b>coil</b> end <b>spacers</b> play an {{important}} role in the performance of superconducting coils, as their shape and location determine the mechanical stability of the conductors in the coil ends (and hence the overall coil training performance) and the local field quality. The dipole end spacers are often of a size and a geometry difficult to be industrially series manufactured and measured. Efficiency of the production and related costs are a key issue to achieve the required production rate of the LHC main dipoles at an affordable price. For the latter reasons, a design approach integrating state-of-the-art CAD/CAM optimization techniques allowing to considerably decrease design and machining time was implemented. This paper gives examples and describes the design criteria, the computation methods, the machining and measuring procedures adopted to carry out the pre-series production...|$|R
40|$|In superconducting {{accelerator}} magnets the coils {{are usually}} pre-stressed {{in order to}} avoid conductor movements induced by electro-magnetic forces. In this paper we use a finite element mechanical model of the main LHC dipole to evaluate the coil deformations determined by the pre-stress and their impact on magnetic field quality. The model explains the origin of the offsets between the nominal multipole values and those measured at room temperature in prototype and pre-series dipole magnets. We also present an experiment carried out to analyse the impact on field quality and coil stresses of <b>coil</b> azimuthal <b>spacers</b> (pole shims). A 1 m long dipole collared coil has been re-assembled several times with pole shims of different thickness and the field components have been measured each time. Experimental data are compared to numerical computations based on the mechanical model. One finds that variations of shim thickness induce not only a change of the azimuthal coil length, but also a different pattern in coil deformations. A good agreement is found between measurements and simulations...|$|R
40|$|Field {{quality in}} superconducting magnets {{strongly}} {{depends on the}} geometry of the <b>coil.</b> Fiberglass <b>spacers</b> (shims) placed between the coil and the collars {{have been used to}} optimize magnetic and mechanical performances of superconducting magnets in large accelerators. A change in the shim thickness affects both the geometry of the coil and its state of compression (prestress) under operational conditions. In this paper we develop a coupled magnetomechanical model of the main Large Hadron Collider dipole. This model allows us to evaluate the prestress dependence on the shim thickness and the map of deformations of the coil and the collars. Results of the model are compared to experimental measurements carried out in a dedicated experiment, where a magnet model has been reassembled 5 times with different shims. A good agreement is found between simulations and experimental data both on the mechanical behavior and on the field quality. We show that this approach allows us to improve this agreement with respect to models previously used in the literature. We finally evaluate the range of tunability that will be provided by shims during the production of the Large Hadron Collider main dipoles. (24 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|The upgrade of the LHC {{collimation}} system includes additional collimators in the LHC lattice. The longitudinal {{space for}} the collimators {{can be obtained by}} replacing some LHC main dipoles with shorter but stronger dipoles compatible with the LHC lattice and the existing powering circuits, cryogenics, and beam vacuum. A joint development programme aiming at building a 5. 5 m long two-in-one aperture Nb_ 3 Sn dipole prototype suitable for installation in the LHC is being conducted by FNAL and CERN. As part of {{the first phase of the}} programme, 1 m and 2 m long single aperture models are being built and tested. Later on, the collared coils from these models will be assembled and tested in a two-in-one aperture configuration in both laboratories. A 2 m long practice model made of a single coil wound with Nb_ 3 Sn cable, MBHSM 101, was developed and constructed at CERN. It has been completed, and tested at both 4. 3 K and 1. 9 K. This practice model features collared coils based on removable pole concept, S 2 -glass cable insulation braided over a mica layer, and <b>coil</b> end <b>spacers</b> made of sintered stainless steel with springy legs.

40|$|The LHC main dipoles will be {{equipped}} with sextupole corrector magnets with a field strength of 1700 x 2 (T,m) and a magnetic length of 110 mm to correct sextupole field errors. Within the LHC magnet programme CERN has developed in collaboration with CAT a cosine-q type of design where much emphasis {{has been put on}} the cost reduction. The magnet features a two-layer racetrack <b>coil,</b> without end <b>spacers,</b> wound from a rectangular NbTi-wire. The two layers are wound simultaneously turning in opposite directions. The yoke is made of a scissor-type of lamination, which allows bringing the iron close to the coil for field enhancement.

40|$|Genetic {{engineering}} of protein-based polymers offers distinct {{advantages over}} conventional synthesis of polymers. Microorganisms can synthesize {{high molecular weight}} materials, in relatively large quantities, that are inherently stereoregular, monodisperse, and of controlled sequence. In addition, specific secondary and higher order structures are determined by this protein sequence. As a result, scientists can design polymers to have unique structural features found in natural protein materials and functional properties that are inherent in certain peptide sequences. ^ For this reason, genetic engineering principles were {{used to create a}} set of artificial genes that encode twelve macromolecules having both α-helical and disordered coil protein sequences with the last amino acid being cysteine (cys) or tryptophan (trp). Triblock copolymer sequences having coiled-coil protein ends, A or B, where A and B represent α-helical acidic and basic leucine zipper proteins, separated by a water soluble flexible <b>spacer</b> <b>coil</b> protein, C, where C represents ((AG) 3 PEG) n (n = 10 or 28), showed reversible physical gelation behavior. This behavior is believed to result from the aggregation of two or more helices that form physical crosslinks with the disordered coil domain retaining solvent and preventing precipitation of the chain. ^ Diffising wave spectroscopy was used to investigate the gelation behavior of AC 10 Acys in buffer when environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, and concentration were varied.
