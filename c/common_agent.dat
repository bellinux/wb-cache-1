5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the primary}} host of the Bayou virus (BAYV), the second-most <b>common</b> <b>agent</b> of {{hantavirus}} infections in the United States. About 16% of animals are infected and the virus is most prevalent in old, heavy males. The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in rice rat saliva and urine, and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta. Two related hantaviruses, Catacama virus and Playa de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively. An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats. Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States, {{have been found in}} marsh rice rats in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Another pathogenic bacterium, Bartonella, is known from Georgia marsh rice rats.|$|E

50|$|A. terreus {{infection}} {{can lead}} to superficial infections in humans. These affect the outside layer of the body. It is commonly isolated from onychomycosis which is infection of human skin and nails. The incidence of onychomycosis {{as a result of}} A. terreus (not the <b>common</b> <b>agent</b> dermatophyte) is increasing. This happens to be the most frequently reported superficial infection in clinics and hospitals. Another common superficial infection caused by A. terreus includes otomycosis (ear infection), which is mostly isolated from patients who had recent surgical operations.|$|E

50|$|Zinc {{phosphate}} (Zn3(PO4)2) is an {{inorganic chemical}} compound {{used as a}} corrosion resistant coating on metal surfaces either {{as part of an}} electroplating process or applied as a primer pigment (see also red lead). It has largely displaced toxic materials based on lead or chromium, and by 2006 it had become the most commonly used corrosion inhibitor. Zinc phosphate coats better on a crystalline structure than bare metal, so a seeding agent is often used as a pre-treatment. One <b>common</b> <b>agent</b> is sodium pyrophosphate.|$|E

50|$|Microascus brevicaulis is a {{microfungus}} in the Ascomycota. Most of {{the discussion}} of this fungus in the scientific and medical literature has referred to the fungus using the name of its asexual form, or anamorph, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. However, a sexual form (teleomorph) named Microascus brevicaulis was recently described. Under the current revision of International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants, as articulated in the Melbourne Code, it remains unclear which name this fungus will ultimately take. Until further clarification, Microascus brevicaulis is considered the most recent, accepted name. Microascus brevicaulis occurs world-wide as a saprotroph in soil, a <b>common</b> <b>agent</b> of biodeterioration, an irregular plant pathogen, and an occasional agent of human nail infection. Bartolomeo Gosio discovered in 1890 that under wet conditions M. brevicaulis produces significant amounts of trimethylarsine via biomethylation of inorganic pigments especially Paris green or Scheele's Green used in indoor wallpapers which is then released into the air.|$|E
25|$|Infections {{due to the}} {{immunosuppressant}} drugs used {{in people}} with kidney transplants most commonly occur in mucocutaneous areas (41%), the urinary tract (17%) and the respiratory tract (14%).

Of the viral illnesses, the most <b>common</b> <b>agents</b> are human cytomegalovirus (31.5%), herpes simplex (23.4%), and herpes zoster (23.4%). BK virus is now being increasingly recognised. Infection {{is the cause of}} death in about one third of people with renal transplants, and pneumonias account for 50% of the patient deaths from infection.|$|R

50|$|The Banner was {{an evening}} paper, which {{at one time}} {{published}} {{as many as five}} editions (first, second, market final, sports final, and sunset final), although these were later consolidated into three editions, and eventually, two. For many years it was in a superior financial condition to its competitors, and in fact, when the rival Tennessean went bankrupt and almost had to cease publication, the Banner assisted in its purchase by the Evans family, who saved it. The Tennessean and the Banner entered into what {{was one of the first}} joint operating agreements in the U.S. in 1937. Under this agreement, which became a common model for many other cities over the next half-century, the papers maintained editorial independence and remained separate as news-gathering organizations. However, they were printed on the same presses, distributed by a <b>common</b> <b>agent,</b> and had a consolidated classified advertising department. They were fierce competitors in the realm of news and ideas, but no longer business competitors in the truest sense.|$|E
50|$|Coxsackievirus B3 is a {{single-stranded}} RNA enterovirus and {{a member}} of the Picornavirdae family. Once the virus penetrates the host's systemic circulation via contaminated water or food, it can travel and infect the heart and cause myocarditis. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart, most commonly cause by viral infections. Amongst the viruses capable of causing myocarditis, CVB3 is a <b>common</b> <b>agent</b> identified in inducing cardiac damage. Internalization of the virus into myocytes occurs by binding to coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptors (CAR) located in tight junctions on cell membranes. Once inside the cytoplasm, the virus can use the host's ribosomal machinery to proliferate and replicate progenies for further infection. Extensive cardiac necrosis can occur by day three after infection as incubated viruses lyse myocytes, resulting in severe and rapid cardiac decompensation. With loss of cardiac cells increasing progressively, infected individual will experience abnormalities in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, as well as electrical conduction defects manifesting as cardiac dysrhythmias. As a result, ejection fraction decreases substantially. The cytolytic destruction of heart cells can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy if not treated appropriately.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} dyes {{can be used}} in tie-dyeing, {{including}} household, fiber reactive, acid, and vat dyes. Most early (1960s) tie-dyes were made with retail household dyes, particularly those made by Rit. In order to be effective on different fibers, these dyes are composed of several different dyes, and thus are less effective, and more likely to bleed and fade, than pure dyes designed for specific fibers. This is the basis for the famous 'pink socks' phenomenon that occurs when fabrics dyed with mixed dyes are washed with other garments. Most tie-dyes are now dyed with Procion MX fiber reactive dyes, a class of dyes effective on cellulose fibers such as cotton, hemp, rayon, and linen. This class of dyes reacts with fibers at alkaline (high) pH, forming a wash-fast, permanent bond. Soda ash (sodium carbonate) is the most <b>common</b> <b>agent</b> used to raise the pH and initiate the reaction, and is either added directly to the dye, or in a solution of water in which garments are soaked before dyeing. Procion dyes are relatively safe and simple to use, and are the same dyes used commercially to color cellulosic fabrics.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} <b>common</b> sales <b>agents</b> based on their precommitment role when sellers are better informed about the products than potential buyers. The author shows that an exclusive channel can create a cost, owing to the inability of exclusive sellers to commit themselves to sales impartiality. Independent noncooperative firms may use <b>common</b> <b>agents</b> as a precommitment to sales impartiality. The author demonstrates that common sales agency can arise as an equilibrium outcome in the absen ce of cost savings, marketing advantages, or the Bernheim-Whinston collusion effect. The analysis shows that common agency of this type can be welfare improving. ...|$|R
