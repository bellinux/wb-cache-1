The typical simplified loading patterns generally used for the experimental tests concern concentrated vertical loads at the <b>crown</b> <b>section</b> or at 1 / 4 of the span, but some numerical investigations evidenced that these configurations are not able to reproduce the actual behavior and the effectiveness of the reinforcement. So, a specific rig was designed to apply the horizontal load pattern. Solid brick masonry barrel vaults were considered (thickness 120 mm, arch span 4000 mm, arch rise/radius = 0. 75). Three quasi-static cyclic tests were performed: the first concerned an unreinforced vault, the second a vault reinforced with GFRM at the extrados and the third reinforced at the intrados surface with the same technique.

30|$|Nevertheless, {{the removal}} of poorly formed {{individual}} trees for biomass production, and removal of 64 % of the bole section of trees is likely to affect long-term availability of coarse wood material {{on the forest floor}} as observed in forests harvested for bioenergy supply for a period of over a decade in the United States of America (Briedis et al. 2011; Klockow et al. 2013). Under the current forest practice in Queensland, Australia, poorly formed individual trees not suitable for sawlog harvest, rotten heartwood or knotted or damaged large diameter sized sections of felled trees and the <b>crown</b> <b>section</b> deemed unsuitable for sawlog, provide necessary food and habitat for fauna species (Eyre et al. 2015) and fuelwood (West et al. 2008). Normally, when these poorly formed standing trees fall down they become part of the large coarse woody material on the forest floor (Eyre et al. 2015). Although the present code (DNRM 2014) only prescribes the retention of standing habitat trees, if an industry developed around the harvesting and use of poorly formed trees, the Code may need to be extended to provide guidelines for the retention of snags (standing dead trees) and coarse wood material on the forest floor for fauna habitat functions (Woldendorp and Keenan 2005).|$|E
40|$|Mooring {{systems of}} {{floating}} structures consist of long lengths of chain, rope or wire, {{or a combination}} of these elements. As part of a station-keeping system, the mooring lines have to keep the movements of the structure to a minimum. The mooring lines have to withstand the loads acting on the moored structure in addition to loads acting directly on the mooring components. If a mooring line fails, the floating structure can lose station and cause severe damage to structures and environment as well as economic losses and loss of lives. Awareness of corrosion, wear, fatigue and relevant loading conditions during design will improve the design and extend the service life of the structural components. The overall goal {{of this study is to}} find out how mooring chains work as structural components. The theory part of the report includes a study of offshore loading conditions, different types of mooring systems, causes of mooring line failure, failure detection of mooring lines and fatigue. However, there is a special focus on mooring chains. Offshore standards and recommended practices provide common chain link designs and minimum mechanical properties of links, but in order to study chain links as structural components, the stresses and strains are of importance. Normal stresses in chain links are calculated analytical using classic beam theory and curved beam theory. In addition, three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element models are applied for a more detailed investigation on the stress distribution in chain links. The presented analyses are limited to chains subjected to pure tension, although torsion and bending due to interlink friction may occur. Both stud links and studless links are analyzed in the computer program Abaqus 6. 12. Mooring components as chain links enter in operation with a residual stress field created by the required proof test. However, traditional design of mooring chains does not consider the presence of residual stresses [1 - 3]. This study shows that residual stresses play an important role. When residual stresses are added to the operational stresses, the resulting maximum tensile stress is 3. 65 and 3. 30 times the nominal stress for stud links and studless links respectively. The maximum tensile stress is located at the link surface at the <b>crown</b> <b>section.</b> Such tensile stress concentrations at the surface of a material are unfavorable due to fatigue crack propagation. Both whole links and worn links are modeled with Abaqus 6. 12, using solid elements. The worn links have a reduction of cross-sectional diameter of 2. 6 % to 13. 2 %. Wear will reduce the cross-sectional area and cause some sharp edges, but at the same time increase the contact area. The positive effects of wear seem to surpass the negative effects of wear when the wear is moderate. </p...|$|E

40|$|Biomass from {{forestry}} {{sector is}} able to provide {{an important contribution to}} meet the government’s targets for increasing bioenergy use. Traditionally it has been stem wood which is used as raw material for energy. For a deeper understanding of trees, knowledge is required not only of the stem wood, but also of the branches and tree tops. Research complex on Norway's industrially important tree species - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest residues (stem wood, stem bark, branches, top of trees) moisture content, basic density and effective heating value were analysed in 2 sampling plots, depending on site index quality in South Norway forest. The vertical dependence of bark proportion was observed. The pattern was similar for both site indexes, lower bark content in the bottom part of stem, slightly increasing approximately to 35 % of the tree height and so increasing towards the tree top. The vertical dependence of bark thickness of Scots pine trees showed an increasing trend towards the top. Bark was significantly thicker near the base than near the top. Bark proportion may be a relevant aspect for the utilization of Scots pine forest residues as potential biomass feedstock. Considerable variations in qualitative properties between stem wood, stem bark and branch wood of Scots pine along the stem were observed. The basic density of stem wood was in range 308. 2 - 418. 3 kg/m 3, of stem bark 265. 1 - 364. 2 kg/m 3 and of branch wood 400. 5 - 579. 2 kg/m 3. The basic density of stem wood was higher in the lower part of stem, vertically decreasing towards to tree top. Contrary, the basic density of stem bark decreased to 40 % height and then slightly increasing again towards the top. The axial dependence of basic density in stem bark was different than the one in stem wood, more regular. Branch density decreased moderately within the axial direction along the crown. Scots pine branch wood exanimated in this study was denser in the bottom part crown towards less denser branches positioned in the top <b>crown</b> <b>section.</b> More else a clear variation pattern was apparent in basic density variations along the branch. Density declined from the branch base outward first rapidly and then levelled. The highest basic density was found for the branch base. There was not found relationship between basic density of stem wood, stem bark, branch wood and site index quality of stands. The average moisture content of stem wood and stem bark harvested in early spring season increased axially from the base toward tree top, within significantly more pronounced variations on the tree base compare to tree top. Stem bark had relatively higher moisture content compare to stem wood. The moisture content in stem wood was in range 39. 9 - 90. 2 %, in stem bark 42. 8 - 94. 3 % and in branch wood 43. 5 - 62. 8 %. The effective calorific value of stem wood was in range 5. 09 - 5. 40 kWh/kg, of stem bark 5. 11 - 5. 51 kWh/kg and of branch wood 5. 16 - 5. 49 kWh/kg. The vertical dependence trend of effective calorific value for Scots pine stem wood was similar to that for stem bark. Regular decreasing pattern towards the top was observed. We observed significantly higher calorific value at level p< 0. 05 * in stem bark than in stem wood. Elevated effective calorific value of stem bark and branch wood make these materials a valuable industrial energy source for bioenergy in Norway...|$|E
