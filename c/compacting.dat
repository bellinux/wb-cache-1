5|$|Tapp is {{beginning}} to learn that these people all have a dark connection to him. He proceeds to {{the offices of the}} building and finds Oswald McGullicuty in the next Jigsaw trap. Jigsaw felt that Oswald was perverting his message, and so he was placed into a Folding Table Trap, which would snap his body in half if Tapp failed to save him. Tapp saves Oswald, but he is swiftly killed by a <b>compacting</b> metal slab before either have a chance to react.|$|E
5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and <b>compacting</b> the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like Phanerochaete cordylines, micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.|$|E

30|$|Firstly, we {{note that}} any finite subset of R is I-ward <b>compact,</b> the union of two I-ward <b>compact</b> subsets of R is I-ward <b>compact,</b> and the {{intersection}} of any I-ward <b>compact</b> subsets of R is I-ward <b>compact.</b> Furthermore, any subset of an I-ward <b>compact</b> set is I-ward <b>compact,</b> and any bounded subset of R is I-ward <b>compact.</b> Any <b>compact</b> subset of R is also I-ward <b>compact,</b> and the set N is not I-ward <b>compact.</b> We note that any slowly oscillating <b>compact</b> subset of R is I-ward <b>compact</b> (see [6] for the definition of slowly oscillating compactness). These observations suggest {{that we have the}} following result.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that each locally <b>compact</b> {{strongly}} sober topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> Hausdorff topology; just take the supremum of its topology with its dual topology. On the other hand, examples of <b>compact</b> topologies are known that do not have a finer <b>compact</b> Hausdorff topology. This led to the question (first explicitly formulated by D. E. Cameron) whether each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology with respect to which all <b>compact</b> sets are closed. (For the obvious reason these spaces are called maximal <b>compact</b> in the literature.) While this major problem remains open, we present several partial solutions to the question in our talk. For instance we show that each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology with respect to which convergent sequences have unique limits. In fact each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology with respect to which countable <b>compact</b> sets are closed. Furthermore we note that each <b>compact</b> sober T_ 1 -topology is contained in a maximal <b>compact</b> topology and that each sober <b>compact</b> T_ 1 -topology which is locally <b>compact</b> or sequential is the infimum of a family of maximal <b>compact</b> topologies...|$|R

For instance we show that each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology in which convergent sequences have unique limits. We also answer a question of D. E. Cameron by showing that each sequentially <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a maximal sequentially <b>compact</b> topology. We finally observe that each sober <b>compact</b> T_ 1 -topology is contained in a maximal <b>compact</b> topology and that each sober <b>compact</b> T_ 1 -topology which is locally <b>compact</b> or sequential is the infimum {{of a family of}} maximal <b>compact</b> topologies...|$|R

50|$|Every closed {{subgroup}} of a locally <b>compact</b> group is locally <b>compact.</b> (The closure condition is necessary {{as the group}} of rationals demonstrates.) Conversely, every locally <b>compact</b> {{subgroup of}} a Hausdorff group is closed.

We show summing operators are b-weakly <b>compact</b> and discuss relation between Dunford–Pettis and b-weakly <b>compact</b> operators. We give necessary conditions for b-weakly <b>compact</b> operators to be <b>compact</b> and give characterizations of KB-spaces {{in terms of}} b-weakly <b>compact</b> operators defined on them...|$|R
25|$|Jet 3.0 {{included}} many enhancements, {{including a new}} index structure that reduced storage size and the time that was taken to create indices that were highly duplicated, the removal of read locks on index pages, a new mechanism for page reuse, a new <b>compacting</b> method for which <b>compacting</b> the database resulted in the indices being stored in a clustered-index format, a new page allocation mechanism to improve Jet's read-ahead capabilities, improved delete operations that speeded processing, multithreading (three threads were used to perform read ahead, write behind, and cache maintenance), implicit transactions (users {{did not have to}} instruct the engine to start manually and commit transactions to the database), a new sort engine, long values (such as memos or binary data types) were stored in separate tables, and dynamic buffering (whereby Jet's cache was dynamically allocated at start up and had no limit and which changed from a first in, first out (FIFO) buffer replacement policy to a least recently used (LRU) buffer replacement policy). Jet 3.0 also allowed for database replication.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{residents of}} New Orleans {{settled on the}} high ground along the Mississippi River. Later developments eventually extended to nearby Lake Pontchartrain, built upon fill to bring them above the average lake level. Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake to downtown. After 1940, the state decided to close those waterways following {{the completion of a}} new Industrial Canal for waterborne commerce. Closure of the waterways resulted in a drastic lowering of the water table by the city's drainage system, causing some areas to settle by up to 8feet (2m) due to the <b>compacting</b> and desiccation of the underlying organic soils.|$|E
25|$|Tactics – Defensive {{positions}} are highly advantageous {{because of the}} ability to maintain warmth and protection, compared to attacking in extreme cold. Mobility and logistical support are often restricted by snow, requiring plowing or <b>compacting</b> it to accommodate wide-tracked vehicles or sleds. Infantry movement in deep snow requires skis or snowshoes to avoid exhaustion. Sound carries well over crusted snow, diminishing the element of surprise. Explosives are useful for excavating foxholes and larger shelters in frozen ground. Attacking field kitchens and encampments deprives the enemy of food and shelter. Rapid removal of the wounded from the battlefield is essential to their survival in the cold.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHaving in {{mind the}} {{generalization}} of Birkhoff's theorem on doubly stochastic matrices we define <b>compact</b> cellular algebras and <b>compact</b> permutation groups. Arising in this connection weakly <b>compact</b> graphs extend <b>compact</b> graphs introduced by G. Tinhofer. It is proved that <b>compact</b> algebras are exactly the centralizer algebras of <b>compact</b> groups. The technique developed enables us to get nontrivial examples of <b>compact</b> algebras and {{groups as well as}} completely identify <b>compact</b> Frobenius groups and the adjacency algebras of Johnson's and Hamming's schemes. In particular, Petersen's graph proves to be not <b>compact,</b> which answers a question by C. Godsil. Simple polynomial-time isomorphism tests for the classes of <b>compact</b> cellular algebras and weakly <b>compact</b> graphs are presented...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{investigate}} topological properties of a topological Brandt λ^ 0 -extension B^ 0 _λ(S) of a semitopological monoid S with zero.

We also describe a category whose objects are ingredients in the constructions of pseudocompact (resp., countably <b>compact,</b> sequentially <b>compact,</b> <b>compact)</b> topological Brandt λ^ 0 -extensions of pseudocompact (resp., countably <b>compact,</b> sequentially <b>compact,</b> <b>compact)</b> semitopological monoids with zeros...|$|R
25|$|Of all cleavage-stages, it is {{generally}} agreed that the optimal moment for biopsy is at the eight-cell stage. It is diagnostically safer than the PB biopsy and, unlike blastocyst biopsy, it allows for the diagnosis of the embryos before day 5. In this stage, the cells are still totipotent and the embryos are not yet <b>compacting.</b> Although {{it has been shown}} that up to a quarter of a human embryo can be removed without disrupting its development, it still remains to be studied whether the biopsy of one or two cells correlates with the ability of the embryo to further develop, implant and grow into a full term pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|While at {{the time}} {{computer}} implementation was not an issue, this method suffers from the difficulty sketched above to convert from Lehmer code to permutation efficiently. This can be remedied by using a different bijective correspondence: after using d'i to select an element among i remaining elements of the sequence (for decreasing values of i), rather than removing the element and <b>compacting</b> the sequence by shifting down further elements one place, one swaps the element with the final remaining element. Thus the elements remaining for selection form a consecutive range at each point in time, {{even though they may}} not occur in the same order {{as they did in the}} original sequence. The mapping from sequence of integers to permutations is somewhat complicated, but it can be seen to produce each permutation in exactly one way, by an immediate induction. When the selected element happens to be the final remaining element, the swap operation can be omitted. This does not occur sufficiently often to warrant testing for the condition, but the final element must be included among the candidates of the selection, to guarantee that all permutations can be generated.|$|E
25|$|The four-hour {{round trip}} to the summit and back via one of the shorter trails is {{considered}} moderately challenging for the average hiker but requires no technical skills during the late spring to early fall season. Wind and weather on the exposed, rocky summit is usually harsher than below, year round; winter storms and summer thunderstorms can be life-threatening. Winter snow and ice can linger on the trails well into May, making hiking hazardous or impossible without special equipment. The <b>compacting</b> of snow due to winter recreation on the more frequently used trails tends to lengthen {{the time it takes}} for the snow and ice to melt off. Stabilizers, crampons, ice axes, ski poles, and snowshoes may be helpful or necessary for winter and early spring ascents depending on ice and snow cover. Fall hiking generally requires warmer clothing, an awareness of weather conditions, and earlier ascent times. As there are few reliable water sources on the mountain and little shelter from the sun above , dehydration and heat stroke are potential hiking hazards. Poison ivy does not grow on Mount Monadnock, and venomous snakes do not inhabit it. The mountain and surrounding area are black bear habitat, although problem encounters with bears are rare.|$|E

25|$|Critics of New Urbanism {{have argued}} that its {{environmental}} aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility. The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities {{is not just about}} cars and too much driving - it is about the entire urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is {{less than half of the}} overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that land-use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of <b>compacting</b> urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.|$|E
