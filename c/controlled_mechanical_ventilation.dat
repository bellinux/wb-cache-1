40|$|OBJECTIVES: Diaphragm {{dysfunction}} develops during severe sepsis as {{a consequence}} of hemodynamic, metabolic, and intrinsic abnormalities. Similarly, 12 hours of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> also promotes diaphragm dysfunction. Importantly, patients with sepsis are often treated with mechanical ventilation for several days. It is unknown if <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> exacerbates sepsis-induced diaphragm dysfunction, and this forms the basis for these experiments. We investigate the effects of 12 -hour <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> on contractile function, fiber dimension, cytokine production, proteolysis, autophagy, and oxidative stress in the diaphragm of septic rats. DESIGN: Randomized controlled experiment. SETTING: Animal research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Adult male Wistar rats. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with a single intraperitoneal injection of either saline or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (5 mg/kg). After 12 hours, the saline-treated animals (<b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation)</b> and half of the septic animals (lipopolysaccharide + <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation)</b> were submitted to 12 hours of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> while the remaining septic animals (lipopolysaccharide) were breathing spontaneously for 12 hours. They were compared to a control group. All animals were studied 24 hours after saline or lipopolysaccharide administration. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after saline or lipopolysaccharide administration, diaphragm contractility was measured in vitro. We also measured diaphragm muscle fiber dimensions from stained cross sections, and inflammatory cytokines were determined by proteome array. Activities of calpain, caspase- 3, and proteasome, expression of 20 S-proteasome α subunits, E 2 conjugases, E 3 ligases, and autophagy were measured with immunoblotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Lipopolysaccharide and/or <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> independently decreased diaphragm contractility and fiber dimensions and increased diaphragm interleukin- 6 production, protein ubiquitination, expression of Atrogin- 1 and Murf- 1, calpain and caspase- 3 activities, autophagy, and protein oxidation. Compared with lipopolysaccharide alone, lipopolysaccharide + <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> worsened diaphragm contractile dysfunction, augmented diaphragm interleukin- 6 levels, autophagy, and protein oxidation, but exerted no exacerbating effects on diaphragm fiber dimensions, calpain, caspase- 3, or proteasome activation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: <b>Controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{results in}} diaphragmatic dysfunction, and {{oxidative}} stress {{has been shown}} to be an important contributor to ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction. We hypothesized that the administration of an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, would restore the redox balance in the diaphragm and prevent against the deleterious effects of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation.</b> DESIGN:: Randomized, controlled experiment. SETTINGS:: Basic science animal laboratory. SUBJECTS:: Male Wistar rats, 14 wks old. INTERVENTIONS:: Anesthetized rats were submitted for 24 hrs to either spontaneous breathing receiving 150 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine (SBNAC) or saline (SBSAL) or to <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> receiving 150 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine (MVNAC) or saline (MVSAL). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: After 24 hrs of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation,</b> diaphragmatic force production was significantly lower in MVSAL compared with all groups. Importantly, administration of N-acetylcysteine completely abolished this controlled mechanical ventilation-induced diaphragmatic contractile dysfunction. Diaphragmatic protein oxidation was significantly increased after 24 hrs of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> (+ 53 %, p <. 01) in MVSAL animals, whereas administration of N-acetylcysteine prevented this controlled mechanical ventilation-induced oxidative stress. Diaphragmatic 20 S proteasome activity was increased in MVSAL (+ 62 %, p <. 05). Further, compared with SBSAL, diaphragm caspase- 3 activity was significantly increased in MVSAL (+ 279 %, p <. 001), and N-acetylcysteine treatment provided partial protection against caspase- 3 activation (MVNAC = + 158. 5 %, p <. 01). Diaphragmatic calpain activity was significantly increased after <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> (+ 137 %, p <. 001) in MVSAL animals, but N-acetylcysteine treatment protected against this event. Finally, significant negative correlations existed between calpain activity and diaphragm force production (r from - 0. 56 to - 0. 49, p <. 05).

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} {{study was to examine}} the effect on cardiac performance of selective increases in airway pressure at specific points of the cardiac cycle using synchronized high-frequency jet ventilation (sync-HFJV) delivered concomitantly with each single heart beat compared with <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> in 20 hemodynamically stable, deeply sedated patients immediately after coronary artery bypass graft. Methods: Five 30 -min sequential ventilation periods were used interspersing <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> with sync-HFJV twice to control for time and sequencing effects. Sync-HFJV was applied using a driving pressure, which generated a tidal volume resulting in gas exchanges close to those obtained on <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> and associated with the maximal mixed venous oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic variables including cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation and vascular pressures were recorded at the end of each ventilation period. Results: The authors found that in 20 patients, hemodynamic changes induced by <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> and by sync-HFJV were similar. Cardiac index did not change (mean ± SD for controlled mechanical ventilation: 2. 6 ± 0. 7 1 · min - 1 · m - 2; for sync-HFJV: 2. 7 ± 0. 7 1 · min - 1 · m - 2; P value not significant). This observation persisted after stratification according to baseline left- ventricular contractility, as estimated by ejection fraction.

Patients submitted to mechanical ventilation often receive massive doses of corticosteroids that may cause further deterioration of diaphragm function. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the combination of 24 hours of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> with corticosteroid administration would exacerbate ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction. METHODS: Rats {{were randomly assigned to}} a group submitted to 24 hours of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> receiving an intramuscular injection of saline or 80 mg/kg methylprednisolone, a group submitted to 24 hours of spontaneous breathing receiving saline, or methylprednisolone and a control group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The diaphragm force-frequency curve was shifted downward in the mechanical ventilation group, but this deleterious effect was prevented when corticosteroids were administered. Diaphragm cross-sectional area of type I fibers was similarly decreased in both mechanical ventilation groups while atrophy of type IIx/b fibers was attenuated after corticosteroid administration. The mechanical ventilation-induced reduction in diaphragm MyoD and myogenin protein expression was attenuated after corticosteroids. Plasma cytokine levels were unchanged while diaphragm lipid hydroperoxides were similarly increased in both mechanical ventilation groups. Diaphragmatic calpain activity was significantly increased in the mechanical ventilation group, but calpain activation was abated with corticosteroid administration.

40|$|The {{pathophysiological}} {{mechanisms of}} {{weaning from mechanical ventilation}} {{are not fully}} known, but there is accumulating evidence that mechanical ventilation induces inspiratory muscle dysfunction. Recently, several animal models have provided potential mechanisms for mechanical ventilation-induced effects on muscle function. In patients, weaning difficulties are associated with inspiratory muscle weakness and reduced endurance capacity. Animal studies demonstrated that diaphragm force was already decreased after 12 h of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> and this worsened with time spent on the ventilator. Diaphragmatic myofibril damage observed after 3 -days <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> was inversely correlated with maximal diaphragmatic force. Downregulation of the diaphragm insulin-like growth factor-I and MyoD/myogenin messenger ribonucleic acid occurred after 24 h and diaphragmatic oxidative stress and increased protease activity after 18 h. In keeping with these findings, diaphragm fibre atrophy was shown after 12 h and reduced diaphragm mass was reported after 48 h of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation.</b> These animal studies show that early alterations in diaphragm function develop after short-term mechanical ventilation. These alterations may contribute to the difficulties in weaning from mechanical ventilation seen in patients.

40|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} is {{an essential}} life-saving intervention used in critically ill patients with respiratory failure {{in the intensive care}} unit. However, difficulties in discontinuing ventilator support frequently remain a serious and time-consuming problem. A variety of factors may contribute to weaning failure in patients, but respiratory muscle weakness due to ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction probably plays an important role. Several studies in animal models have consistently shown that mechanical ventilation leads to a rapid time-dependent decrease in force-generating capacity of the diaphragm. These negative effects appear early in the course of mechanical ventilation and are associated with several alterations including increased oxidative stress, increased proteolysis and decreased protein synthesis, leading to diaphragm atrophy. Similar results have been obtained in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients, where twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure {{has been shown to be}} reduced, and the duration of mechanical ventilation to be associated with a progressive and logarithmic decline in diaphragm force. Furthermore, prolonged mechanical ventilation in humans also resulted in diaphragmatic atrophy, with an increase in oxidative stress and proteolysis biomarkers. It is not yet known whether ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction is reversible, and if so, the time course for the diaphragm to recover its normal function has not yet been determined, although it may play an important role in weaning from the ventilator. Therefore, the first aim of this thesis was to investigate the time course of diaphragm function recovery following <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation.</b> On the other hand, in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation, diaphragm weakness may already be present due to underlying diseases or concomitant treatments. In this case, it is not known whether submission to mechanical ventilation would result in more severe diaphragm dysfunction. Therefore, in the second part of this thesis, the effects of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> were examined on weak diaphragms at the start of mechanical ventilation, with diaphragm weakness due to underlying diseases or comorbidities that are very common in ventilated patients in the intensive care unit. First, we examined whether <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> would have an additional negative effect on diaphragm function in rats with sepsis. The last aim of this thesis was to examine the combined effect of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> and hyperglycemia on the diaphragm. In healthy rats, 3 hours of diaphragm reloading by spontaneous breathing following 24 h of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> was sufficient to improve mechanical ventilation-induced diaphragm contractile dysfunction, but full recovery occurred after 4 - 7 h of reloading. This was associated with an increase in the type IIx/b diaphragm muscle fiber dimensions, increased markers of protein synthesis and improved intrinsic contractile properties of skinned diaphragm muscle fibers. In rats with sepsis, 12 h of <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> resulted in an exacerbation of diaphragm contractile dysfunction associated with an augmentation of diaphragmatic IL- 6 production, increased oxidative stress and increased autophagy. When <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> was applied to rats with hyperglycemia, diaphragm contractile dysfunction was exacerbated. This was not related to additional diaphragmatic atrophy nor to increased proteolysis by calpain and caspase- 3, or autophagy. The exact mechanism behind this additional negative effect on diaphragm dysfunction was not yet unraveled and needs further investigation. In conclusion, this doctoral thesis showed that ventilator-induced diaphragm contractile dysfunction recovers very quickly following the inititaion of spontaneous breathing, at least in healthy animals. Further, it also showed that diaphragm contractile dysfunction was worsened when <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> was applied to rats with diaphragm weakness due to sepsis or hyperglycemia. Therefore, this doctoral thesis indicates that intensive care unit-acquired diaphragm weakness may be enhanced when mechanical ventilation is applied in critically ill patients suffering from sepsis or hyperglycemia, and this may further compromise the poor outcomes of these patients. This suggests that diaphragm function recovery may also be compromised in these patients and that they will experience more problems in weaning under these circumstances. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{is vital}} for the {{treatment}} of patients in respiratory intensive care and can be life saving. However, the risks of regional pressure gradients and over-distension must be balanced with the need to maintain function. For these reasons <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> can benefit from the regional information provided by bedside imaging such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT). In this thesis we develop and test methods to retrieve clinically meaningful measures of lung function from EIT and examine the feasibility of closing the feedback loop to enable EIT-guided <b>control</b> of <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Working towards this goal we develop a reconstruction algorithm capable of providing fast absolute values of conductivity from EIT measurements. We couple the resulting conductivity time series to a compartmental ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of lung function in order to recover regional parameters of elastance and airway resistance. We then demonstrate how these parameters may be used to generate optimised pressure <b>controls</b> for <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> that expose the lungs to minimal gradients of pressure and are stable with respect to EIT measurement errors. The EIT reconstruction algorithm we develop is capable of producing low dimensional absolute values of conductivity in real time after a limited additional setup time. We show that this algorithm retains the ability to give fast feedback on regional lung changes. We also describe methods of improving computational efficiency for general Gauss-Newton type EIT algorithms. In order to couple reconstructed conductivity time series to our ODE model we describe and test the recovery of regional ventilation distributions through a process of regularised differentiation. We prove that the parameters of our ODE model are recoverable from these ventilation distributions apart from the degenerate case where all compartments have the same parameters. We then test this recovery process under varying levels of simulated EIT measurement and modelling errors. Finally we examine the ODE lung model using control theory. We prove that the ODE model is controllable {{for a wide range of}} parameter values and link controllability to observable ventilation patterns in the lungs. We demonstrate the generation and optimisation of pressure controls with minimal time gradients and provide a bound on the resulting magnitudes of these pressures. We then test the control generation process using ODE parameter values recovered through EIT simulations at varying levels of measurement noise.

30|$|Introduction Because gas exchanges under ECMO are {{partially}} <b>controlled</b> {{independently of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> (MV), opposite strategies {{can be considered}} from fully controlled MV to early spontaneous ventilation (SV). To limit {{the risks associated with}} fully controlled ventilation, we changed our MV strategy by choosing a mode facilitating SV: BiPAP-APRV. This study in severe patients compared two consecutive strategies with or without early SV under ECMO.|$|R
40|$|Effective milking center {{ventilation}} {{is needed}} to provide comfortable conditions for the operator and the cows alike. Likewise, proper ventilation can help to prevent premature deterioration of building materials and equipment. Milking center designers {{need to be aware}} of the need for proper ventilation and incorporate its design into the normal design process. Natural or <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> can be used to ventilate milking centers. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> has advantages over natural ventilation for this application. <b>Control</b> of <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> is more reliable and better suited to maintain a quality environment in most instances. A positive ventilation system is preferred for summer conditions and presented in this paper. To meet minimum ventilation requirements in the winter, a neutral system that is balanced between positive pressure heat transfer fans located in the mechanical room with cupola fans operating in the reverse direction seems to be working well in practice...|$|R
