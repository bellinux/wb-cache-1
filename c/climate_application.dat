40|$|Abstract: A cytogenetical {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on 8 species of amphipods from Iceland by using conventional staining, C-banding, {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with rDNA and telomeric repeat probes, and flow cytometry genome size evaluation. Previously reported data on chromosome number were confirmed and the karyotype formula was determined {{for the first time in}} 3 species. The tendency of amphipods to be endowed by high symmetric karyotypes was once again pointed out. Heterochromatin distribution on chromosomes was revealed by C-banding and DAPI staining after FISH treatment. Heterochromatic bands are mainly centromeric and their total extension is directly proportional to genome sizes. The genome size (GS) in Icelandic species was relatively higher in comparison with the GS of related species from temperate climate, as a probable pre-adaptation to cold <b>climate.</b> <b>Application</b> of FISH with a rDNA probe evidenced a great variability among species concerning the number of autosome pairs carrying the nucleolar organizer regions (from 1 to 5). A probe containing the ‘arthropod ’ type telomeric motif TTAGG was the only one to hybridize with the chromosomal termini in all the investigated amphipods.

Providing information about the monsoon onset for the past, present, and future has potential benefit for a country so vulnerable to changes in climate. But, when does the monsoon start?

Choosing a scientific definition {{is not such a}} simple exercise in Bangladesh. Different definitions lead to different monsoon onsets and thereby also monsoon lengths. If a <b>climate</b> <b>application</b> aims to provide information about the monsoon onset, then we need to understand how the people who might use this information perceive the monsoon onset.

In this study we carried out a structured questionnaire in six rural regions around Bangladesh and asked the local agriculturists how they defined the monsoon and when they thought it started.

One of the main duties of this tool is the management of a workflow involving long-term jobs and data management in a user-friendly way.

The disease causes significant losses to apple production in Sweden and many other countries with a temperate wet <b>climate.</b> <b>Application</b> of fungicides and good horticultural practices do not prevent canker damage in nurseries and orchards. Disease outbreaks damage and even completely destroy trees. To date, complete resistance to N. ditissima is not known in apple, but cultivars differ considerably in their level of partial resistance. To be able to conduct breeding for resistance to European canker, reliable plant tests are urgently needed. Differences in resistance to N. ditissima (colonization rate; CR) in apple cultivars were evaluated by wound inoculations with a standardized number of conidia on cut shoots from mature trees placed in a climate chamber and on potted trees in an unheated greenhouse. Infection percentage (Inf%) was assessed by 'natural' inoculations in leaf scars under high infection pressure in the field. All the experiments were carried out over 2 years. Lengths of lesions were measured at regular time intervals on five occasions for shoots and seven occasions for trees. Considerable differences in CR and Inf% were found among the cultivars. The relative levels of resistance obtained are consistent with previous reports for most cultivars. Assessment of CR (area under curve) and Inf% thus proved to be useful tools for evaluation of resistance to European canker.

40|$|Urban water scoping {{modelling}} {{packages are}} used as tools to inform decision makers of the sustainability of different water management options for a city. Previous scoping models have not taken sufficient account of natural systems in the urban environment and are often limited {{in terms of the}} range of indicators used to measure sustainability and the choice of water management options offered. A new modelling package, named City Water Balance, has been developed to address these limitations. It has the capability to assess the sustainability of a variety of water management options, including the sustainable urban drainage systems, in terms of water flow, water quality, whole life cost and life cycle energy for alternative scenarios of future urban land use, population and <b>climate.</b> <b>Application</b> of the modelling package to the City of Birmingham has demonstrated that the modelled components can describe adequately the existing system, giving confidence that it can be used for scoping strategic options for future water supply and wastewater management. The further application of the package to model alternative scenarios through to 2055 for Birmingham has also been undertaken to illustrate its application. The results from the different analyses have shown that medium scale rainwater harvesting and borehole abstraction are predicted to be more sustainable than the conventional centralised supply and that medium scale wastewater recycling would be more cost effective but less energy efficient. The most sustainable strategy was installation of water efficient appliances as there is the potential for large energy savings from reduced indoor usage and consequent water heating requirements.

The instrument, the Work Group Climate Assessment Tool (WCA), was applied in Brazil, Mozambique, and Guinea to assess the intermediate outcomes of a program to develop leadership for performance improvement. Data were collected from 305 individuals in 42 work groups, who completed a self-administered questionnaire. Methods The WCA was initially validated using Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient and exploratory factor analysis. This article {{presents the results of}} a second validation study to refine the initial analyses to account for nested data, to provide item-level psychometrics, and to establish construct validity. Analyses included eigenvalue decomposition analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and validity and reliability analyses. Results This study confirmed the validity and reliability of the WCA across work groups with different demographic characteristics (gender, education, management level, and geographical location). The study showed that there is agreement between the theoretical construct of work climate and the items in the WCA tool across different populations. The WCA captures a single perception of climate rather than individual sub-scales of clarity, support, and challenge. Conclusion The WCA is useful for comparing the climates of different work groups, tracking the changes in climate in a single work group over time, or examining differences among individuals' perceptions of their work group <b>climate.</b> <b>Application</b> of the WCA before and after a leadership development process can help work groups hold a discussion about current climate and select a target for improvement.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{understanding of}} how precipitation patterns control pesticide leaching from structured soils prone to macropore flow could lead to practical mitigation strategies that would help farmers minimize losses by optimizing application timings. A sensitivity analysis of the macropore flow model MACRO was therefore carried out to examine the influence of antecedent soil water content and precipitation patterns on pesticide leaching to drainage systems and groundwater. One thousand model runs were executed (20 four-year weather data series, 50 application dates per season) for both autumn and spring applications of a hypothetical moderately sorbed and quickly degraded herbicide for one of three national scenarios for pesticide risk assessment in Sweden (Näsbygård, a loamy moraine soil in Scania, southern Sweden). Rapid and direct transport of pesticides in macropores to drainage systems and shallow groundwater was predicted to occur rather infrequently in spring (in 4 of the 20 years) and even more rarely in autumn. For autumn applications, the soil water deficit at application (SWDtot) and medium-term precipitation (30 - 90 days after application) were the two most sensitive variables controlling pesticide leaching. For spring applications, total leaching was most closely linked to rainfall the following winter, while short-term precipitation (5 days after application) and the antecedent soil water deficit were {{the two most important}} predictors for maximum pesticide concentrations in drainflow. The potential for reducing leaching by restricting applications to periods of low risk was investigated. The results showed that avoiding applications on wet soil in autumn could potentially reduce total pesticide losses by a factor of two to three. Similarly, the risk of acute toxicological effects in surface waters following pesticide applications in spring could be reduced by a factor of 2 - 3 by avoiding application when 5 -day weather forecasts predict precipitation > 10 mm.
