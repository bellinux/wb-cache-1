5|$|In 1867 a {{commission}} {{was created to}} look into issues with the central courts, and the outcome were the Judicature Acts, under which all the central courts were made part of a single Supreme Court of Judicature, with the three central common law courts becoming {{three of the five}} divisions of the Supreme Court; this was not designed to be permanent, but rather to avoid having to retire or demote two of the three Chief Justices to allow a single head of the Supreme Court, as this would have violated the <b>constitutional</b> <b>principle</b> that senior justices were irremovable. By sheer chance Fitzroy Kelly and Alexander Cockburn, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Lord Chief Justice of England respectively both died in 1880, allowing the merger of the common law divisions of the Supreme Court into a single division, the Queen's Bench Division, under John Coleridge, who had been Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and became Lord Chief Justice of England, by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880. At this point, the Exchequer of Pleas formally ceased to exist.|$|E

The Constitutional Court has interpreted secularism as not permitting a person to wear religious symbols (such as headscarves or crosses) in government and public institutions, such as public schools and state universities. According to a 5 June 2008 ruling, parliament violated the <b>constitutional</b> <b>principle</b> of secularism when it passed amendments (supported by the AKP and the MHP) to lift the headscarf ban on university campuses.|$|E
25|$|In 1501, King Aleksander Jagiellończyk {{signed the}} Privilege of Mielnik, {{through which he}} gave the {{legislative}} initiative to the Senate of Poland.

Nevertheless, another milestone {{in the development of the}} nobles' democracy was achieved in 1505 with the establishment of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>principle</b> of nihil novi, or Nihil Novi nisi commune consensu ("Nothing new without the general consent"). This privilege vastly empowered the entire general sejm (of which the Senate was a part) instead of just the Senate; its crucial part was the statement that no law could be passed without the approval of the entire sejm.|$|E
25|$|The main {{opposition}} party CHP not only {{argues that the}} constitutional package includes unconstitutional reforms, but also that it was passed through procedural violations.

With this claim, the CHP alleges that the AKP is attempting to change one of Turkey's constitutional articles that cannot be amended. So in addition to a review of the package on procedural grounds, the CHP also demands a review of the content of the package. The CHP also demands a stay of the referendum results, bringing the total of CHP demands to three.|$|E

25|$|The Constitutional Court of Turkey was {{established}} on April 25, 1962, {{according to the}} provisions of the constitution of 1961. Prior to that date, absolute superiority of the parliament was adopted as a <b>constitutional</b> <b>principle,</b> with no judicial review. There existed no legal institution to review the constitutionality of laws passed by the parliament, and of acts and actions of governments. The social democratic opposition, intellectuals, and the military junta that came into power by military coup on May 27, 1960 supported limitation and control of the parliamentary power in the face of abuses of parliamentary majority by the Democratic Party governments (1950–60) under the premiership of Adnan Menderes. The Justice Party, a descendant of the Democratic Party; as well as Justice and Development Party have rejected the idea of judicial review, pushing for parliamentary superiority.|$|E
25|$|The <b>constitutional</b> <b>principle</b> is that {{a member}} of the Court Constitutional Court cannot be dismissed. Decisions to dismiss a Court members must be taken by the person or body (i.e. the President of the Republic or the National Assembly; in the latter case, by a {{majority}} vote {{of the total number of}} Deputies) having appointed the member in question. Where such a question has been raised, the Constitutional Court must consider the case in the member’s absence, and must issue a conclusion- on the termination of the member’s office by a majority of at least two thirds of the Court membership (i.e. 6 out of 9). Once the conclusion has been issued, the actual decision on the Constitutional Court member’s dismissal must be taken by the authority having appointed him or her (although in fact no member of the Constitutional Court has ever been dismissed since its inauguration). The independence of the members of the Constitutional Court is guaranteed by their submission to the Constitution and the Law on the Constitutional Court. It is prohibited to influence {{a member of the}} Constitutional Court, and anyone attempting to do so is liable to prosecution.|$|E
25|$|The first, {{beginning}} in the 1950s, was {{the inclusion of the}} Lieberman clause, named for Talmudic scholar and Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) professor Saul Lieberman, in the ketuba, requiring that a get be granted if a civil divorce is ever issued. Most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, although leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and that leaders of Orthodox Judaism's Rabbinical Council of America, and respected Orthodox rabbis, including Joseph B. Soloveitchik, supposedly recognized the clause as valid. Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>principle</b> of {{the separation of church and}} state, Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been explained to them as part of pre-marital counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil document, enforceable in a civilian court. However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own law committee, had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons.|$|E

25|$|President Klaus Iohannis is a {{supporter}} of the fight against corruption in Romania. Since coming to power in November 2014, has sent several messages of support to prosecutors investigating sensitive cases against politicians accused of corruption. Making one of its important position was in February 25, 2016 {{at the annual meeting of}} the National Anticorruption Directorate: “From year to year the work of the National Anticorruption Directorate has become more effective as the number of cases investigated and complexity, as well as final decisions on confiscation and recovery of property from crime. You are a model of functional institution and created a performance standard. Through the work and achievements, you've earned the appreciation of the Romanian citizens who want to live in a just society, in a country without corruption, the institutions, elect to represent them and those who perform public functions are actually serving the people. The results obtained by you in fighting corruption, appreciated and beyond Romania's borders are a guarantee that the process of strengthening democracy and the rule of law in Romania are on track. I am convinced that we will be increasingly more powerful in applying the <b>constitutional</b> <b>principle</b> that nobody is above the law and to align our established practice in countries with democracies that put the citizen at the center of any policy”, stated Klaus Iohannis.|$|E
25|$|By 1944, the {{position}} had changed. In Steele v Louisville & Nashville Railway Co, a Supreme Court majority held a labor union had a duty of fair representation {{and may not}} discriminate against members based on race under the Railway Labor Act of 1926 (or the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. Murphy J would have also based the duty on a right to equality in the Fifth Amendment. Subsequently, Johnson v Railway Express Agency admitted that the old Enforcement Act of 1870 provided a remedy against private parties. However, the Courts have not yet accepted a general right of equality, regardless of public or private power. Legislation will usually be found unconstitutional, under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment if discrimination is shown to be intentional, or if it irrationally discriminates against one group. For example, in Cleveland Board of Education v LaFleur the Supreme Court held {{by a majority of}} 5 to 2, that a school's requirement for women teachers to take mandatory maternity leave was unconstitutional, against the Due Process Clause, because it could not plausibly be shown that after child birth women could never perform a job. But while the US Supreme Court has failed, against dissent, to recognize a <b>constitutional</b> <b>principle</b> of equality, federal and state legislation contains the stronger rules. In principle, federal equality law always enables state law to create better rights and remedies for employees.|$|E
500|$|Bevin said he [...] "strongly disagreed" [...] {{with the}} Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v.

[...] He then attacked Conway, who refused to appeal the 2014 federal court opinion that Kentucky's defense of marriage amendment violated the federal constitution: [...] "Jack Conway's failure to do his job and defend our laws in Kentucky disqualifies him from being elected to the office of Governor." [...] Conway responded that he [...] "used the discretion given to me by statute to inform Gov. Beshear and the citizens of the Commonwealth that I would not waste the scarce resources of this office pursuing a costly appeal that would not be successful." [...] Bevin contended that Conway's decision cost Kentucky taxpayers $2.3 million, citing the cost of private attorneys that Beshear hired to defend the amendment in Conway's place.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{challenges}} some of {{the current}} limits to the grounds for judicial review of legislation accepted by most Canadian jurists. More specifically, it makes a common law-based argument in favour of the priority over legislation of principles which are implied from the Imperial Constitution Acts 1867 - 1982 and which originally derive from the English constitution – namely implied <b>constitutional</b> <b>principles.</b> The argument faces two main interrelated legal objections: Parliamentary sovereignty and the Framers’ intentions. The first objection is rebutted by arguing that Parliamentary sovereignty possesses an ability to change {{in a way that}} can incorporate substantive legal limitations. The most prevalent common law-based theories of change to Parliamentary sovereignty suggest that the courts can authoritatively determine if implied <b>constitutional</b> <b>principles</b> can check legislation. The second objection is rebutted by reference to the notion of progressive interpretation as conceived under Hartian and Dworkinian theories of law and adjudication. Under these theories, progressive interpretation is an aspect of the courts’ best overall interpretation of the constitution, which includes implied <b>constitutional</b> <b>principles.</b> Such progressive interpretation can result in these principles constraining legislative authority. Justification of the progressive interpretation of implied <b>constitutional</b> <b>principles</b> can be based on the rule of law from which derive a number of these principles. One plausible conception of the Canadian rule of law is that it rejects the view that implied <b>constitutional</b> <b>principles</b> can prevail when in conflict with legislation. However, the better conception is that, as an attempt to adapt implied <b>constitutional</b> <b>principles</b> to relevant changes in society and to protect their underlying values, the judiciary should interpret these principles as capable of checking legislation {{to the extent that they}} form part of the core content of the rule of law. Such a conception and an operation of implied <b>constitutional</b> <b>principles</b> can properly be explained by Hartian or Dworkinian common law-based progressive interpretation of these principles and by their relationship with legislative authority.

500|$|Executive power, {{according}} to ArticleV and ArticleVII, {{was in the}} hands of [...] "the king in his council", a cabinet of ministers called the Guardians of the Laws (or Guard of the Laws, Straż Praw). The ministries could not create or interpret the laws and all acts of the foreign ministry were provisional and subject to the Sejm's approval. The king presided over this council, which was composed of the Roman Catholic Primate of Polandwho was also president of the Education Commissionand five ministers appointed by the king: a minister of police, a minister of the seal (internal affairs), a minister of foreign affairs, a minister belli (of war), and a minister of treasury. Council members also includedwithout a votethe Crown Prince, the Marshal of the Sejm, and two secretaries. This royal council descended from similar councils that had functioned since King Henry's Articles (1573), and from the recent Permanent Council. Acts of the king required the countersignature of the respective minister. A minister was required to cosign a law if the king demanded it, unless that minister refused and all other ministers unanimously endorsed his objection, in which case the king could withdraw the law or press the issue by taking it before the parliament. The stipulation that the king, [...] "doing nothing of himself,... shall be answerable for nothing to the nation," [...] parallels the British <b>constitutional</b> <b>principle</b> that [...] "The king can do no wrong." [...] (In both countries, the respective minister was responsible for the king's acts.) The ministers were responsible to the Sejm, which could dismiss them by a vote of no confidence with a two-third majority in both houses. Ministers could be also held accountable by the Sejm court, and a simple majority vote was sufficient for the Sejm to demand that a minister face an impeachment trial. The king was the nation's commander-in-chief, commanding its armies; the institution of the hetman (high-ranking military official) was not mentioned. The king also had the right to grant pardon except in cases of treason. The decisions of the royal council were carried out by commissions, including the previously created Commission of National Education, and the new Commissions for Police, the Military and the Treasury, whose members were elected by the Sejm.|$|E

40|$|<b>Constitutional</b> <b>principles</b> are {{sometimes}} invoked in adjudication {{as a bridge}} to foreign law. This article argues that a cosmopolitan approach, such as that advocated by Jeremy Waldron through his ius gentium theory, is useful in accounting {{for the use of}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>principles</b> by courts insofar as the commonality of language and methodology surrounding the use of <b>constitutional</b> <b>principles</b> is connected to societal and institutional needs. The article argues that <b>constitutional</b> <b>principles</b> often serve as a connection to foreign law because the principles are applied as representations of a societal need for order and stability. At the same time, the article cautions that transnational judicial dialogue is impacted by compartmentalisation and divergence. Consequently, arguments for a ius gentium must be more cautious and nuanced. As a step in this direction, the article proposes two ideas for modifying the ius gentium theory: conceiving of the ius gentium as an emerging but not yet fully realised system and characterising the ius gentium as a convergence of methodology rather than substantive norms...|$|R
