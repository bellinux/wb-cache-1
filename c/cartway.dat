60|$|As {{nearly as}} I can now remember, our two {{artillery}} companies {{were between the}} breastwork and the rail fence on the eastern side, and {{a small number of}} men lined the <b>cartway</b> on the right of the redoubt. The Connecticut and the New Hampshire men were at the rail fence {{on the west side of}} the redoubt, and there were two or three companies drawn up on the main street at the base of our hill.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{construction}} of the railroad, the only access to Shimla was via a village <b>cartway.</b> The railway line was constructed by the Delhi-Ambala-Kalka Railway Company, with the project beginning in 1898 in the Siwalik Hills, being completed in 1903.|$|E
50|$|From {{the lower}} level, two large doors {{lead to the}} {{southern}} aligned railway tracks, and a tramway runs through {{the centre of the}} floor longitudinally. There is evidence of earlier service entry doors or <b>cartways</b> entering from the Terrace side.|$|R
50|$|The terraced {{housing that}} makes up the Whitmore Reans {{residential}} area was built alongside roads, <b>cartways</b> and tracks that radiated out from the town centre servicing fields that spread out towards Dunstall and Tettenhall. New Hampton Road (known then as Whitmore End Lane), Molineux Alley & what is now Staveley Road / Dunstall Road, as well as Waterloo Road (then called Wellington Road) were the routes through the fields that houses would be built alongside & between.|$|R
500|$|Travellers {{began to}} use the trails by the 1820s, with the {{heaviest}} use from the 1840s to the early 1870s, when they were superseded by railways. Until then, these <b>cartways</b> provided the most efficient means of transportation between the isolated Red River Colony and the outside world. They gave the Selkirk colonists and their neighbours, the [...] people, an outlet for their furs {{and a source of}} supplies other than the Hudson's Bay Company, which was unable to enforce its monopoly {{in the face of the}} competition that used the trails.|$|R
50|$|On the {{south-east}} wall, slightly northern than Saint Ambrose's church, {{was situated}} the main <b>cartway</b> door, whose entrance was probably made easier by a wooden claw, either fixed or moving, {{depending on the}} high relief that detached it from the ancient road.|$|E
50|$|Working in {{conjunction}} with the Free Libraries Committee (a library had also been promised to the residents of Balsall Heath as part of the arrangement which absorbed their district into Birmingham) the Baths Department soon located a site on Moseley Road close to the junction with Edward Road. A small <b>cartway</b> known as Midland Grove ran behind the site and the access this offered for the delivery of coal {{to the rear of the}} building was a key factor in the decision to choose this particular site.|$|E
50|$|The route soon {{reaches the}} {{community}} of South Brewster, becoming the main street on the far {{eastern side of the}} community. After the intersection with Brady <b>Cartway,</b> Route 137 turns west through Brewster, crossing the Cape Cod Rail Trail and the former South Brewster Railroad Station. A two-lane road through Brewster, the route enters an intersection with Route 124 (Harwich Road), which ends nearby. Continuing northwest, Route 137 enters an intersection with Route 6A (Main Street). The right-of-way ends at the junction, near Cape Cod Bay.|$|E
40|$|Much general {{research}} has been done on the early history of Knox County, Indiana, but little has been done on the history of road development in the county. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to contribute to original research about Knox County road development from 1840 to 1860. In the early years of Indiana's history, lines of travel were rivers, animal pathways, and Indian trails. Most of the early routes were in the southern part of the state which was one of the first areas inhabited by white settlers. The region around Vincennes was an important trade center and a central meeting place for a variety of Indian Groups with many pathways crossing there. As the population grew in southern Indiana, Knox County which encompassed a very large area, was divided into townships. Local governments, first the Court of Quarter Sessions, then the County Commissioners and Township Trustees had power over roadbuilding. Townships were divided into road districts and road supervisors were appointed/elected to maintain the roads within each district. Individuals requested private roads, <b>cartways,</b> township roads, county roads and changes and vacations of each. In Knox County, Indiana, most early routes were established to connect citizens with Vincennes, the county seat. However as settlers moved into the countryside, roads were needed to reach river crossings, mills, churches, railroads, and other sites. There were objections to proposed road, change and vacation petitions for a variety of reasons. Usually the objectors thought they would suffer property damage, or they wanted to cultivate parts of their land that were cut off by the roadways. Another concern was whether a road was of public use. This was an important issue because male citizens between the ages of 20 and 50 were required by state law to work the roads every year. They were assigned to a road district, and it was there that any additional road taxes could be worked off with labor on the roads. Knox County citizens followed the same state guidelines as all Hoosiers in regard to roadbuilding. There were no examples of roadbuilding that would make Knox County appear to be different than any other county, except perhaps in the local residents' zeal to maintain Vincennes as an important crossroads between Louisville and St. Louis and Chicago and points south.

50|$|Construction of the Warehouse {{commenced}} in 1900 but {{the drought}} in central Queensland gave builder Dennis Kelleher (who also built the Rockhampton Post Office in 1892) trouble in finding heavy timber {{required for the}} supporting posts. This delay inflated costs {{for the construction of}} the warehouse and by 1901 more than £7000 had been outlaid for the building. When completed in 1902 the warehouse included a <b>cartway</b> that ran through the building from East Street to Quay Lane and a system of winches and lifts used to shift goods to the upper floors of the warehouse.|$|E
50|$|High Town is {{dominated}} by two Church of England churches. St. Mary's Church, a church built in the classic style of the late 18th century, was designed by Thomas Telford; and is still used for worship. St. Leonard's was formerly collegiate, and Bridgnorth was a Royal Peculiar until 1856. It was subsequently largely rebuilt but is no longer used for regular worship. It has many community uses {{and is in the}} care of the Churches Conservation Trust.Bishop Percy's House on the <b>Cartway</b> was built in 1580 by Richard Forster and has been a Grade 1 listed building since 18 July 1949. It {{was one of the few}} properties of its type to survive the great fire of Bridgnorth in April 1646, and was the birthplace of Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore), author of ‘Reliques of Ancient English Poetry’.|$|E
40|$|Minnesotans {{have always}} taken {{pride in the}} vast rivers and lakes {{intricately}} woven throughout the state. This land-water mosaic has always been integral to state development. Yet regardless of how vital Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s lakes are considered to be, the law must keep apace with the dynamic and innovative society it serves. Today, the typical Minnesotan thinks in terms of driving to work, not rowing. The Daniel decision thus renders Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s <b>cartway</b> statute obsolete due to modern modes of transportation. In examining the Daniel decision, this case note begins with {{the historical development of}} Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s <b>cartway</b> legislation and an overview of the state power utilized in condemning cartways. A brief comparison is then made between statutory cartways and the typical common law easement by necessity. A description of the relevant facts and reasoning of the Daniel decision follows. This note contends that the Daniel court correctly limited its decision to one of statutory interpretation. The court properly interpreted the statute in consideration of the state transportation arena that existed in 1913. The <b>cartway</b> statute and its interpretation are then compared to current water access trends in both statutory and common law. This note concludes that Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s <b>cartway</b> statute, as interpreted by the Minnesota Supreme Court, finds itself antiquated and in need of amendment due to the transportation needs of today 2 ̆ 7 s society...|$|E
