40|$|Large scale, {{vertically}} aligned nanosheets of <b>zinc</b> <b>hydroxide</b> nitrate [Zn 5 (OH) 8 (NO 3) 2 · 2 H 2 O] were synthesized by {{electrochemical deposition}} in a methanol solution containing {{a small fraction}} of water. Structural analysis by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy reveal that the nanosheets are layered <b>zinc</b> <b>hydroxide</b> nitrate grown on top of a polycrystalline ZnO layer, forming a two layer structure. During the nanosheet growth, well defined current oscillations were observed at a constant voltage. It was determined that the current oscillations are associated with the layer-by-layer growth of the nanosheets.

40|$|International audienceThis Article {{presents}} the systematic experimental and theoretical {{investigation of the}} structural arrangements of dodecyl sulfate (DS) anions in the interlayer space of layered <b>zinc</b> <b>hydroxide</b> salts (LZH-DS) and {{of the structure of}} <b>zinc</b> <b>hydroxide</b> layers, with {{a detailed description of the}} zinc ions’ coordination environment. As-prepared, well-crystalline LZH-DS has a basal spacing of 31. 5 Å. After treatment with methanol at room temperature, <b>zinc</b> <b>hydroxide</b> layers shrank to form two new layered phases with basal spacings of 26. 4 and 24. 7 Å. The shrinking was accompanied by a decrease in the content of DS anions in the interlayer space, indicating a change in the alignment of the intercalated anions and a decrease in the charge density of the <b>zinc</b> <b>hydroxide</b> layers. The latter effect was assessed by the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of powder X-ray diffraction patterns, revealing the successive removal of Zn ion tetrahedra from the hydroxide layers, with the octahedrally coordinated Zn ions left unaffected. The interlayer space of all three phases was modeled by molecular dynamics, and the models were validated by the comparison of modeled and experimental powder XRD patterns and one-dimensional electron density maps. The arrangement of DS anions in the interlayer space of LZH-DS also depended on temperature. Remarkably, the basal spacing was considerably increased at 55 °C, which was explained by the formation of a second-staging heterostructure with the regular alternation of layers with two basal spacings, 31. 5 and 34. 2 Å. This is the first reported interstratification phenomenon in layered hydroxides intercalated with aliphatic molecules.
