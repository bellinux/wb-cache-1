50|$|Lead {{has been}} a popular roofing {{material}} for centuries, being used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, and <b>conductor</b> <b>heads.</b> Lead was best suited for low-pitched roofs, as steep roofs experienced creep. Lead roofs in regions with large temperature fluctuations, such as the mid-Atlantic states, experienced deterioration from constant expansion and contraction, called fatigue. Beginning in the 19th century, a roofing material called “terne” or “terneplate” was used, consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead-tin alloy. It is frequently confused with tinplate.|$|R
40|$|Electrical brain {{stimulation}} (EBS) is {{an appealing}} method to treat neurological disorders. To achieve optimal stimulation effects {{and a better}} understanding of the underlying brain mechanisms, neuroscientists have proposed computational modeling studies for a decade. Recently, multi-scale models that combine a volume <b>conductor</b> <b>head</b> model and multi-compartmental models of cortical neurons have been developed to predict stimulation effects on the macroscopic and microscopic levels more precisely. As the need for better computational models continues to increase, we overview here recent multi-scale modeling studies; we focused on approaches that coupled a simplified or high-resolution volume <b>conductor</b> <b>head</b> model and multi-compartmental models of cortical neurons, and constructed realistic fiber models using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Further implications for achieving better precision in estimating cellular responses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Realistic {{electrical}} {{brain activity}} mapping implies reconstructing and visualizing sources of electrical brain activity within the specific patient's head. This requires {{the assumption of}} a precise and realistic volume conductor model of the specific subject's head, i. e., a 3 -D representation of the head's electrical properties in terms of shape and electrical conductivities. Source reconstruction accuracy is influenced by errors committed in head modeling. Clinical images, MRI and CT, are used to identify the head structures {{to be included in}} the volume <b>conductor</b> <b>head</b> model. Modeling accuracy mainly relies on the correct image-based identification of head structures, characterized by different electrical conductivities, to be included as separate compartments in the model. This paper analyzes the imaging protocols used in clinical practice to define the most suitable procedures for identification of the various head structures necessary to build an accurate head model also in the presence of morphologic brain pathologies. Furthermore, tissues anisotropy is discussed and identified as well. With this work we have identified a protocol for the acquisition of multimodal patient's imaging data for realistic electrical brain activity mapping purposes, able to account for pathological conditions and for head tissues anisotropy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractReconstruction of the {{electrical}} sources of human EEG activity at high spatio-temporal accuracy {{is an important}} aim in neuroscience and neurological diagnostics. Over the last decades, numerous {{studies have demonstrated that}} realistic modeling of head anatomy improves the accuracy of source reconstruction of EEG signals. For example, including a cerebro-spinal fluid compartment and the anisotropy of white matter electrical conductivity were both shown to significantly reduce modeling errors. Here, we for the first time quantify the role of detailed reconstructions of the cerebral blood vessels in volume <b>conductor</b> <b>head</b> modeling for EEG. To study the role of the highly arborized cerebral blood vessels, we created a submillimeter head model based on ultra-high-field-strength (7 T) structural MRI datasets. Blood vessels (arteries and emissary/intraosseous veins) were segmented using Frangi multi-scale vesselness filtering. The final head model consisted of a geometry-adapted cubic mesh with over 17 × 106 nodes. We solved the forward model using a finite-element-method (FEM) transfer matrix approach, which allowed reducing computation times substantially and quantified the importance of the blood vessel compartment by computing forward and inverse errors resulting from ignoring the blood vessels. Our results show that ignoring emissary veins piercing the skull leads to focal localization errors of approx. 5 to 15 mm. Large errors (> 2 cm) were observed due to the carotid arteries and the dense arterial vasculature in areas such as in the insula or in the medial temporal lobe. Thus, in such predisposed areas, errors caused by neglecting blood vessels can reach similar magnitudes as those previously reported for neglecting white matter anisotropy, the CSF or the dura — structures which are generally considered important components of realistic EEG head models. Our findings thus imply that including a realistic blood vessel compartment in EEG head models will be helpful to improve the accuracy of EEG source analyses particularly when high accuracies in brain areas with dense vasculature are required...|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{views the}} choir {{conductor}} {{as the leader}} of a cooperative group, whose role is not simply to provide technical instruction, but also to motivate singers, provide feedback, express the pleasure of music. It argues that to achieve these goals every choir conductor pursues a specific plan of action in which his/her multimodal behaviour is aimed at fulfilling the goals in that plan. The paper proposes an annotation scheme for analyzing a <b>conductor’s</b> <b>head,</b> eyebrow, eye, mouth, trunk and hand actions in terms of their physical parameters, their literal and indirect meanings, and their goals within the conductor’s plan. The scheme allows to outline the body styles of different conductors, distinguishing them in terms of the goals pursued in their conduction. ...|$|R
