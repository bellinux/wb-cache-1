50|$|By {{exploiting}} the spatial {{information contained in}} the detector signal we can more accurately localize the γ-ray interaction than is possible by the geometry of the segments. A photoelectron or <b>Compton</b> <b>electron</b> generates electrons and holes which induce image charges of opposite signs on the detector electrodes when a signal is produced. The change of the image charge causes a flow of currents into {{or out of the}} electrodes. The induced charge is distributed over several electrodes for the large distance in a multi-segmented detector. For the closer distance an increase and decrease of induced charges of the electrodes continue until the primary charge finally reaches to its destination electrodes and neutralizes the image. To identify the detector sector where the interaction took place we have to observe the net charge on the charge-collecting electrode simply observing the polarity of the induced signal. This allows for distinguishing between interactions at small and large radii.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{theoretical}} approach to attosecond laser-assisted photo- and Compton ionization. Attosecond x-ray absorption and scattering are described by Ŝ^(1, 2) -matrices, which are coherent superpositions of "monochromatic" Ŝ^(1, 2) -matrices in a laser-modified Furry representation. Besides refining the existing {{theory of the}} soft x-ray photoelectron attosecond streak camera and spectral phase interferometry (ASC and ASPI), we formulate a theory of hard x-ray photoelectron and Compton ASC and ASPI. The resulting scheme has a simple structure and leads to closed-form expressions for ionization amplitudes. We investigate <b>Compton</b> <b>electron</b> interference in the separable Coulomb-Volkov continuum with both Coulomb and laser fields treated non-perturbatively. We find that at laser-field intensities below 10 ^ 13 Wcm^- 2 normalized Compton lines almost coincide with the lines obtained in the laser-free regime. At higher intensities, attosecond interferences survive integration over electron momenta, and feature prominently in the Compton lines themselves. We define a regime where the electron ground-state density can be measured with controllable accuracy in an attosecond time interval. The new theory provides a firm basis for extracting photo- and <b>Compton</b> <b>electron</b> phases and atomic and molecular wavefunctions from experimental data. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

In {{the first few}} tens of nanoseconds, about {{a tenth of a}} percent of the weapon yield appears as powerful gamma rays with energies of one to three mega-electron volts (MeV, a unit of energy). The gamma rays penetrate the atmosphere and collide with air molecules, depositing their energy to produce huge quantities of positive ions and recoil electrons (also known as <b>Compton</b> <b>electrons).</b> The impacts create MeV-energy <b>Compton</b> <b>electrons</b> that then accelerate and spiral along the Earth's magnetic field lines. The resulting transient electric fields and currents that arise generate electromagnetic emissions in the radio frequency range of 15 to 250 megahertz (MHz, or fifteen million to 250 million cycles per second). This high-altitude EMP occurs between 30 and 50 kilometers (18 and 31 miles) above the Earth's surface.The potential as an anti-satellite weapon became apparent in August 1958 during Hardtack Teak. The EMP observed at the Apia Observatory at Samoa was four times more powerful than any created by solar storms, while in July 1962 the Starfish Prime test damaged electronics in Honolulu and New Zealand (approximately 1,300 kilometers away), fused 300 street lights on Oahu (Hawaii), set off about 100 burglar alarms, and caused the failure of a microwave repeating station on Kauai, which cut off the sturdy telephone system from the other Hawaiian islands.
