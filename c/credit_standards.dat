In this context, there is a gain to {{granting}} credit {{for the purchase of}} the product and thus the establishment of captive finance company for expanding the sales by offering loans to consumers who need financing for purchase of durable good. This paper examines the optimal behavior of such a durable good seller and its captive finance company when the consumer loan market is segmented into captive and independent lending institutions under symmetric and imperfect information on borrower’s creditworthiness. The model presents that one critical difference for captive finance company will be its <b>credit</b> <b>standard.</b> Specifically, the model indicates that captive finance company will follow a more lenient <b>credit</b> <b>standard,</b> leading to the prediction that the likelihood of repayment of a captive loan is lower than that of a bank loan, other things equal. This prediction is tested using unique data sets drawn from a major credit bureau in the U. S. The analysis of credit bureau data shows that a captive automobile loan is less likely to be repaid than a bank automobile loan, which supports the theoretical prediction.

50|$|Many {{institutions}} lowered <b>credit</b> <b>standards</b> {{to continue}} feeding the global demand for mortgage securities, generating huge profits that their investors shared. They also shared the risk. When the bubbles developed, household debt levels rose sharply after the year 2000 globally. Households became dependent on {{being able to}} refinance their mortgages. Further, U.S. households often had adjustable rate mortgages, which had lower initial interest rates and payments that later rose. When global credit markets essentially stopped funding mortgage-related investments in the 2007-2008 period, U.S. homeowners were no longer able to refinance and defaulted in record numbers, leading to the collapse of securities backed by these mortgages that now pervaded the system.|$|E

40|$|Banks advance {{loans in}} the absence of precise {{knowledge}} in relation to the outcome of borrowers' projects. Consequently, uncertainty in relation to loan repayment emerges. Thus, banks introduce the 'credit standard' as insurance against loans, so that should borrowers' projects fail, borrowers have an alternative means of honouring their debt obligations. It is argued in this paper that in the competitive atmosphere under which this sector operates, {{it is not possible to}} secure the entire loan portfolio by introducing the <b>credit</b> <b>standard,</b> and in recent years this difficulty has been further exacerbated by financial liberalisation, which may have caused bank failures. ...|$|R
50|$|The Yamasee War of 1715-1717 broke out. This {{war started}} because of grave injustices {{carried out by}} Carolina traders against their Native American clients. For many years the traders had been {{systematically}} cheating the Indians in the fur trade by using bogus weights and measures, applying tough <b>credit</b> <b>standards,</b> severely indebting Native American suppliers, and taking Indian slaves for unpaid debts. Finally, the Yamasee turned on South Carolina and nearly destroyed the colony. Virginia's support and Cherokee warriors helped deflect the Yamasee attacks. After the surviving Yamasee were expelled, they migrated to the St. Augustine area and cultivated a new alliance with the Spanish. South Carolina was left weak and vulnerable with no military buffer along its southern fringes, and the war alienated the Creek tribes to the west.|$|E

5000|$|A {{study by}} analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland {{found that the}} average {{difference}} between subprime and prime mortgage interest rates (the [...] "subprime markup") declined significantly between 2001 and 2007. The quality of loans originated also worsened gradually during that period. The combination of declining risk premia and <b>credit</b> <b>standards</b> is common to boom and bust credit cycles. The authors also concluded that the decline in underwriting standards did not directly trigger the crisis, because the gradual changes in standards did not statistically account for the large difference in default rates for subprime mortgages issued between 2001-2005 (which had a 10% default rate within one year of origination) and 2006-2007 (which had a 20% rate). In other words, standards gradually declined but defaults suddenly jumped. Furthermore, the authors argued that the trend in worsening loan quality was harder to detect with rising housing prices, as more refinancing options were available, keeping the default rate lower.|$|E

40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{explanation}} for the substantial variation of <b>credit</b> <b>standards</b> and price competition among banks over the business cycle. As the economic outlook improves, the average default probabilities of borrowers decline. This affects the profitability of screening and causes bank screening intensity to display an inverse U-shape as a function of economic prospects. Low screening activity in expansions creates intense price competition among lenders and loans are extended to lower-quality borrowers. As the economic outlook worsens, price competition diminishes, and <b>credit</b> <b>standards</b> tighten significantly.

To answer this question, we rst develop a model of neighborhood choice with credit constraints.
