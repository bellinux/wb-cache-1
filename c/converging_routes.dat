US 201A and SR 8 then turn west, joining the <b>converging</b> <b>routes</b> {{to cross the}} river as a four-route concurrency. On {{the west side of}} the bridge lies the town of Anson, where US 201A and SR 8 split to the north off SR 43 and SR 148, which continue west concurrently. The highway turns north along the west bank of the river into the village of North Anson, intersecting the eastern end of SR 234 before meeting SR 16 just to the north. SR 16 joins US 201A and SR 8, proceeding north along the river out of town, and eventually passing into Solon. Nearing the riverbank once more, SR 16 splits to continue north along the river, while US 201A and SR 8 turn northeast to cross the river. Both routes terminate at US 201.|$|E
40|$|It is {{anticipated}} that controllers {{will continue to}} vector traffic for spacing {{in the near term}} where there are Required Navigation Performance (RNP) area navigation (RNAV) routes that merge prior to the final approach or on the final approach. Under moderate to heavy demand, this will negate many of the efficiency, throughput, and predictability benefits of keeping aircraft on the RNP RNAV routes. Given the current level of metering and aircraft equipage, existing decision support automation and avionics capabilities can be used to keep aircraft on the routes and maintain benefits. In an earlier paper, we presented a suite of tools and concepts that address the merging and spacing problems arising from structured RNAV and RNP routes in the terminal environment. This suite of tools and concepts is referred to as Spacing of Performancebased Arrivals on <b>Converging</b> <b>Routes</b> (SPACR). The initial set of tools and concepts addressed the nearterm merging and spacing problem, relying on existing cockpit and ground automation capabilities. In this paper, the tools and concepts are extended to the mid-term, requiring modest modifications of existing capabilities. SPACR includes applications of cockpit capabilities such as FMS Offsets and Required Time of Arrival (RTA) and ground automation functionalities such as the embedded ghosting function in the Automated Radar Termina...|$|E

40|$|Zwei konvergente Synthesewege via reduktiver Amidierung und 1, 3 -dipolarer Cycloaddition zu funktionalisierbaren Buildingblocks für die Festphasen-Glycopeptidsynthese (Fmoc/tBu-Strategie), basierenden auf einer Ethyl- 6 -desoxy- 6 -azido-thio-D-hexopyranoseeinheit und einem L-Asparaginsäurederivat, werden vorgestellt. Als Bindeglied wird im ersten Fall eine N-Glyco-Valeroylamidofunktion durch Reaktion eines saccharidischen Azids mit einem Pentafluorphenylaktivester in Gegenwart von Wasserstoff am Palladiumkontakt generiert. Im zweiten Fall wird das saccharidische Azid der 1, 3 -dipolaren Cycloaddition mit einem Propargylamidoasparaginat in Gegenwart von Kupfer(I) -Komplex unterworfen, was zu 1, 4 -disubstituierten 1, 2, 3 -Triazolen führt. Das Verhalten letztgenannter Reaktion an glycosidischen Edukten wird sowohl im inter- wie intramolekularen Reaktionsverlauf eingehend untersucht. Derart zugänglich gemacht sind eine Reihe von L-Asparaginatkonjugaten mit unterschiedlichen Hexopyranosiden der D-Gluco-, Thio-D-gluco-, N-D-Gluco-, N-D-Galakto-, N-D-Manno- und Thio-D-mannoserie beschrieben und charakterisiert. Weitere Funktionalisierbarkeit wird durch Glycosylierung der {{genannten}} Thioglycoside oder durch Reaktion an einem ungesättigten Aglykon erreicht. Two <b>converging</b> <b>routes</b> of synthesis towards functionalizable {{building blocks}} for the solid phase glycopeptide synthesis (Fmoc/tBu strategy) are described. The first means coupling of an ethyl- 6 -deoxy- 6 -azido-thio-D-hexopyranoside with a derivative of L-asparaginic acid (pentafluorophenyl active ester) by reductive amidation using hydrogen on palladium surface as reducing agent. This method actually yields N-glyco-valeroylamides. The second route describes building up a heterocycle as converging function, combining above mentioned sugar azide with a propargyl amidoasparaginate {{in the presence of}} a copper(I) species through 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition. Outcome of this high-yielding process are 1, 4 -disubstituted 1, 2, 3 -triazoles. The latter reaction utilizing glycosidic starting materials was investigated in detail for the intra- as well as intermolecular process. Thus a batch of conjugates of L-asparaginate with differing hexopyranosides of the D-gluco, thio-D-gluco, N-D-gluco, N-D-galacto, N-D-manno and thio-D-manno series is presented and fully characterized. Further functionalizability of the new building blocks is achieved through glycosylation of corresponding thioglycosides or through subsequent reaction of an unsaturated aglycon...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} several decades, {{advances}} in airborne and groundside technologies have allowed the Air Traffic Service Provider (ATSP) to give safer and more efficient service, reduce workload and frequency congestion, and help accommodate a critically escalating traffic volume. These new technologies have included advanced radar displays, and data and communication automation to name a few. In step with such advances, NASA Langley is developing a precision spacing concept designed to increase runway throughput by enabling the flight crews to manage their inter-arrival spacing from TRACON entry to the runway threshold. This concept is being developed as part of NASA s Distributed Air/Ground Traffic Management (DAG-TM) project under the Advanced Air Transportation Technologies Program. Precision spacing is enabled by Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), which provides air-to-air data exchange including position and velocity reports; real-time wind information and other necessary data. On the flight deck, a research prototype system called Airborne Merging and Spacing for Terminal Arrivals (AMSTAR) processes this information and provides speed guidance to the flight crew to achieve the desired inter-arrival spacing. AMSTAR is designed to support current ATC operations, provide operationally acceptable system-wide increases in approach spacing performance and increase runway throughput through system stability, predictability and precision spacing. This paper describes problems and costs associated with an imprecise arrival flow. It also discusses methods by which Air Traffic Controllers achieve and maintain an optimum interarrival interval, and explores means by which AMSTAR can assist in this pursuit. AMSTAR {{is an extension of}} NASA s previous work on in-trail spacing that was successfully demonstrated in a flight evaluation at Chicago O Hare International Airport in September 2002. In addition to providing for precision inter-arrival spacing, AMSTAR provides speed guidance for aircraft on <b>converging</b> <b>routes</b> to safely and smoothly merge onto a common approach. Much consideration has been given to working with operational conditions such as imperfect ADS-B data, wind prediction errors, changing winds, differing aircraft types and wake vortex separation requirements. A series of Monte Carlo simulations are planned for {{the spring and summer of}} 2004 at NASA Langley to further study the system behavior and performance under more operationally extreme and varying conditions. This will coincide with a human-in-the-loop study to investigate the flight crew interface, workload and acceptability...|$|E
40|$|Luminescent dye {{molecules}} {{capable of}} passive cell membrane transport {{may be used}} as molecular probes for example in cellular imaging. Ru(II) polypyridul complexes have been under extensive investigation for many years in supramolecular assemblies in applications ranging from sensors to photovoltaics. This is due to very their favourable photophysical and redox properties including; absorbance and emission in the visible region of the spectrum, large stokes shifts, long lifetimes, intense luminescence, good photostability and useful photosensitising properties for photodynamic therapy. Despite these properties, there has until very recently been very little examination of the potential of such complexes in cell imaging, which has mainly been due to the poor uptake of such complexes by the living cell. However, our group recently reported that polyarginine labelled ruthenium complexes were efficiently and rapidly transported across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm. Such chromophores provide unique opportunities for providing dynamic insigts into environment in living cells avoiding limitations associated with fixation. This thesis continues this work by reporting on the synthesis, purification, characterisation and optical properties of novel supramolecular bioconjugates comprised of one of two luminescent Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes bridged through an aliphatic linker to a range of synthetic peptides aimed towards transport and direction of these luminophores or derived from apoptotic proteins. In the former case, preliminary studies of their uptake, localisation and cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells is also presented. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and describes how metal complexes have been used previously in cellular imaging. It also describes how peptide conjugation can lead to targeted delivery for improved applications in medical diagnostics, photodynamic therapy, cellular imaging and pharmaceutical drug delivery. Chapter 2, describes the experimental methods used. In chapter 3, the synthesis, purification and characterisation of six novel dye conjugates to nuclear localising peptides is described. The influence of metal complex, bridge and peptide on the optical properties and on the uptake of these probes is described. The complexes exhibit long lived, intense, and oxygen sensitive luminescence which are relatively unchanged in the conjugates from the parent dies. Preliminary results on their application in cell imaging are also presented which demonstrate excellent nuclear permeability and nuclear localisation which depends on the hydrophobicity of the metal centre. Chapter 4 describes how the sequence of the BID protein, a pro apoptotic member of the BCL- 2 family, was prepared using solid phase peptide synthesis as a number of overlapping peptides. The objective was to identify a functional region of the protein. Two BID sequences were selected for conjugation to probes for localisation and function studies. Along with the BID sequences, another BCL- 2 family member was investigated. In Chapter 5 synthesis of an organic mimic molecule of BAD, a pro apoptotic member, was attempted. This involves a 14 step reaction, with 3 <b>converging</b> <b>routes.</b> The syntheis was ultimately unsuccessful but two of the final compounds were examined for photophysical and cytotoxicity. Chapter 6 describes the synthesis and characterisation of 2 peptide dye conjugates that are mitochondria targeting. The optical and cellular localisation properties these metal-ligand peptide complexes are described. ...|$|E

40|$|Approximation (&quot;meta&quot;) {{models have}} been used in coupled water {{resources}} optimization and simulation models to improve computational efficiency. In most instances, multiple simulation runs have been done before the optimization, which are then used to fit an approximate model that is used for the optimization. In this study, we propose a dynamic meta-modeling approach, in which artificial neural networks (ANN) is embedded into a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization framework to replace time-consuming flow and contaminant transport models. Data produced from early generations of the GA are sampled to train the ANN. We propose a dynamic learning approach that periodically resamples new solutions both to update the ANN and correct the GA’s <b>converging</b> <b>route.</b> This allows the meta model to adapt to the area in which the GA is searching and provide more accuracy. The results show that a proper sampling strategy can benefit both GA’s searching and ANN’s retraining. In our test case, more than 90 percent of the numerical model calls were saved with no loss in accuracy of the optimal solution...|$|R
