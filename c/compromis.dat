25|$|<b>Compromís</b> (1 seat) Valencian {{coalition}} that contains left, environmental and Valencian nationalist parties, defends the Catalan referendum of self-determination.|$|E
25|$|On 8 April 2014, the Spanish Congress {{rejected}} the Catalan parliament's request {{to give it}} the power to organize the self-determination referendum. The bill was voted down 299 (PP, PSOE, UPyD, UPN and Foro Asturias) to 47 (CiU, Izquierda Unida, PNV, BNG, Amaiur, ERC, <b>Compromís</b> and Geroa Bai), with one abstention (NC-CC).|$|E
2500|$|Equo is a Spanish {{green party}} that, through its {{integration}} into the Valencian Coalició <b>Compromís</b> ("Compromise Coalition" [...] in English), attained representation in the Congress of Deputies after the 2011 elections as the [...] "Compromís-Q". Equo advocates for a [...] "federal, secular, and republican state".|$|E
2500|$|On 26 April, <b>Compromís</b> made a 30-point {{offer for}} a left-wing {{government}} with PSOE, Podemos and IU. The PSOE accepted {{most of the}} points but turned down the offer for a coalition, suggesting instead a two-year cabinet headed by Sánchez and including independents. <b>Compromís</b> leader Mònica Oltra—one of the main promoters of a Valencian-style inspired coalition agreement—was reported replying to the PSOE counter-offer by saying that [...] "this is insulting", commenting on how the PSOE was trying to buy them into supporting a minority Sánchez cabinet [...] "having just 90 deputies" [...] and despite them offering [...] "a perfectly acceptable pact" [...] to [...] "all parties committed to change". C's ruled out [...] "getting [...] into last-hour trouble" [...] and showed opposition to both parties' moves, Rivera commenting on Compromís' proposals that [...] "three pages on governing Spain for four years between six different parties" [...] were [...] "not even worth looking at".|$|E
2500|$|Through Alberto Garzón's mediation, several {{meetings}} were agreed between PSOE, Podemos, <b>Compromís</b> and IU, starting on 22 February. In the meantime, concurrent with those talks, PSOE and C's secretly met {{to discuss a}} potential pact. The four-way meeting ended without agreement, with the four parties agreeing to meet {{the next day to}} renew negotiations. On the late night of 23 February, PSOE and C's reportedly struck a government deal, which they officially confirmed and signed the following day. Among the key measures contained within the agreement were: ...|$|E
2500|$|As a result, {{all three}} Podemos, IU and <b>Compromís</b> broke up {{negotiations}} with PSOE on 24 February. Podemos accused the PSOE of [...] "dishonesty", while IU leaders stated {{their opposition to}} a deal they perceived as [...] "regressive and contrary {{to the interests of}} the popular classes". Concurrently, Rajoy said that [...] "the pact between PSOE and C's is useless", noting the shortage of parliamentary support for the alliance and reiterating that the PP would vote against Sánchez's investiture. Both PP and Podemos postponed any resumption of negotiations with C's and PSOE, respectively, until—at least—after Sánchez's failed investiture.|$|E
2500|$|Both Podemos and C's {{expressed}} {{their intention to}} vote against any pact that included each other. Pablo Iglesias asked Sánchez to [...] "not seek impossible pacts with Podemos and Citizens", while Albert Rivera did {{not rule out the}} possibility of a PSOE–C's pact. PSOE and C's started negotiations, with the media pointing out that PSOE was interested in reaching an accord with C's {{in order to try to}} publicly hold Podemos responsible for the failure in forming an alternative government to Rajoy's. Rivera did not close the door to enter in a PSOE-led government, but conditioned it to seeking an approachment with the PP in order to obtain its abstention in Sánchez's investiture. The difficulty of a PSOE–C's a pact relied in the fact that it could only muster 130 votes, as well as because all three Podemos, <b>Compromís</b> and IU opposed the idea of a government accord between both parties.|$|E
2500|$|On its part, Podemos {{outlined}} a detailed government programme to PSOE on 15 February, {{which included a}} referendum being held in Catalonia. Sánchez criticized Iglesias for [...] "wanting to negotiate through press conferences", with the PSOE rejecting most of Podemos' document, including the referendum, proposals on deficit reduction, debt restructuring, an increase of public spending by 24,000 million euros a year, an increase in taxes, a constitutional reform through plebiscite, among others. On his part, Iglesias accused the PSOE of seeking a minority government and Podemos' obedience to it, demanding that Sánchez meet him {{to know what the}} PSOE wanted to negotiate. Pedro Sánchez answered by stating that he would only meet Pablo Iglesias [...] "to sign an accord". Both Iglesias and Mònica Oltra from <b>Compromís,</b> Podemos' ally, stated that [...] "if the PSOE wants to govern alone, they should openly say so. But Sánchez's government will be a plural one or won't be". On 18 February, Mariano Rajoy was recorded saying to David Cameron that he expected a fresh election to be held, noting that the most probable outcome of Pedro Sánchez's investiture on 2–4 March would be a failed vote.|$|E

50|$|In the 2015 Valencian {{parliamentary}} election, <b>Compromís</b> polled third {{overall after}} the People's Party (PP) and the Valencian Socialists (PSPV). <b>Compromís</b> got 456.823 votes (18.5% of the votes) and 19 of the 99 seats. The election results allowed {{a new government}} to be formed by <b>Compromís</b> and PSPV, with the parliamentary support of Podemos. After negotiations, Mònica Oltra from <b>Compromís</b> was elected as Vice president of Generalitat Valenciana and Ximo Puig from PSPV as President.|$|E

5000|$|In {{international}} law and diplomacy, a <b>compromis</b> (French for [...] "special agreement") is an agreement between two parties to submit a dispute to international arbitration for a binding resolution. A <b>compromis</b> is made after a dispute has already arisen, rather than before. (This {{is in contrast to}} provisions in existing treaties or protocols made before the dispute arose). The <b>compromis</b> identifies a neutral third party - the arbitrator or arbitral tribunal - or specifies the manner of appointment. The <b>compromis</b> often sets forth the precise question or questions to be decided; the arbitral rules of procedure; the seat of the tribunal; the languages {{to be used in the}} proceeding; the applicable law; and the payment of costs.|$|E

5000|$|On 31 October, the General Council of <b>Compromís</b> was held, with Initiative (IdPV) and Greens-Equo (VerdsEquo) favouring {{the pact}} and the Bloc and People of <b>Compromís</b> (Gent) against. IdPV and VerdsEquo {{presented}} a draft agreement in which Podemos accepted a large {{deal of the}} conditions imposed by <b>Compromís,</b> while the Bloc and Gent rejected it {{because it did not}} guarantee its own parliamentary group in the Congress, as well as because it was a pact with a party at the Spanish level. After four hours of debate, almost 70% of the Bloc's leadership supported holding another vote among its members on 3 November, deciding on the integration of his party on a platform of [...] "Valencian obedience", open to Podemos and other progressive forces, such as United Left (EUPV) or Republican Left of the Valencian Country (ERPV). This time, Enric Morera would vote and campaign for the 'Yes' option. Meanwhile, EUPV and ERPV complained about having not received any firm proposal to join a coalition, neither from <b>Compromís</b> nor Podemos. Finally, the Bloc's membership voted to support the pact between <b>Compromís</b> and Podemos: with a turnout of 42%, the result of the referendum was 75.6% in favor, conditioning the choice to EUPV joining Morera's project.|$|E

5000|$|Not all factions within <b>Compromís</b> felt {{comfortable}} with a possible deal with Podemos: the Valencian Nationalist Bloc, the largest party comprising <b>Compromís,</b> opposed the alliance in early July for considering it a [...] "sale of acronyms". Given the division of its membership on the issue, the Bloc held a non-binding telematic referendum on 5-12 August, asking its members if the conditions approved by the National Executive {{a few days before}} were enough to negotiate an agreement election with other progressive forces. Conditions were four: that the Bloc led the party lists—this condition, shared by the other partners of <b>Compromís,</b> was the one that made Podemos most uncomfortable—that <b>Compromís</b> acronym was [...] "pre-eminent"; that they were to have their own parliamentary group; and that a [...] "political Valencian agenda" [...] was to be incorporated. With a turnout of only 23%, two out of three voters said yes to negotiations. This resulted in a momentary unlocking of negotiations, a blow to his detractors and a nod to Mònica Oltra, whose accord with Podemos advanced [...] "very satisfactorily".|$|E

50|$|For the 2015 Spanish general election, <b>Compromís</b> {{formed a}} {{coalition}} with Podemos, called Compromís-Podem-És el moment. This new coalition {{was the second}} most popular political force in the Valencian Country, surpassing the PSPV. They received 671.071 votes, 25,09% of the total vote in the Valencian Country. During {{the process of creating}} parliamentary groups, Podemos deputies joined the group within other Podemos deputies from all around Spain, while <b>Compromís</b> joined the Mixed Group.|$|E

Given these statements, Podemos and <b>Compromís</b> offered EUPV to nominate the No. 4 on the list by Valencia, with its logo appearing on the ballot, but the Popular Unity assembly (in which EUPV was integrated) rejected by a majority. Because of the rejection, on 6 November—the legal deadline for coalitions to be announced—the Bloc's National Council reconvened to see if the agreement with Podemos went ahead without EUPV. As the results of the vote were known, <b>Compromís</b> and Podemos signed their electoral pact before a notary, which was finally supported by the Bloc with 52% of votes.|$|E
