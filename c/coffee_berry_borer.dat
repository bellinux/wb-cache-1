25|$|The 2-mm-long coffee borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei) is {{the most}} {{damaging}} insect pest to the world's coffee industry, destroying up to 50 {{percent or more of}} the <b>coffee</b> <b>berries</b> on plantations in most coffee-producing countries. The adult female beetle nibbles a single tiny hole in a <b>coffee</b> <b>berry</b> and lays 35 to 50 eggs. Inside, the offspring grow, mate, and then emerge from the commercially ruined berry to disperse, repeating the cycle. Pesticides are mostly ineffective because the beetle juveniles are protected inside the berry nurseries, but they are vulnerable to predation by birds when they emerge. When groves of trees are nearby, the American yellow warbler, rufous-capped warbler, and other insectivorous birds have been shown to reduce by 50 percent the number of <b>coffee</b> <b>berry</b> <b>borers</b> in Costa Rica coffee plantations.|$|R

40|$|Plant {{diversity}} {{may increase}} natural enemy populations because some plants can provide alternative food to natural enemies. Extrafloral nectar {{is such an}} alternative food and plants producing extrafloral nectar are known to suffer less from herbivory. Little {{is known about the}} effect of plants with extrafloral nectaries on herbivory of neighbouring plants. Here, we investigated whether extrafloral nectaries of an associated tree (Inga subnuda subsp. luschnathiana) can enhance natural pest control in coffee agroforestry systems. We assessed the effect of nectar availability from Inga trees on parasitism of coffee leaf miners (Leucoptera coffeella) and on damage caused by coffee leaf miners and <b>coffee</b> <b>berry</b> <b>borers</b> (Hypothenemus hampei). Most of the nectary visitors were either parasitoids or predators, with most predators being natural enemies of coffee pests. Coffee plants were sampled every metre along a transect of 10 - 15 m extending from each Inga tree. The distance of the coffee plants from the Inga trees did not significantly correlate with coffee leaf miner parasitism, proportion of mined leaves or with the proportion of bored <b>coffee</b> <b>berries.</b> We subsequently used abundance and species richness of those nectary visitors without known association with leaf miners and borers as indirect measures of nectar availability. Whereas species richness had no significant effect on natural pest control, leaf miner parasitism increased significantly with the abundance of nectary visitors (excluding natural enemies of the coffee pests), and the proportion of mined leaves decreased significantly with this abundance. The proportion of bored fruits decreased with increasing abundance of visitors, but this trend was not significant. Together, these results suggest that Inga trees provide alternative food to natural enemies of coffee pests, resulting in increased natural control. Thus, extrafloral nectaries of associated trees can enhance natural pest control in agroforestry systems...|$|R

40|$|Nurturing {{micro-organisms}} {{that already}} live on coffee bushes {{may be a}} more effective way of controlling <b>coffee</b> <b>berry</b> disease than using expensive fungicides.

Studies by the Coffee Research Foundation also indicated that the larger plantations actually suffered greater losses from <b>coffee</b> <b>berry</b> disease than did the small holdings. This led the foundation's plant pathologist Dr Dina Masaba, to look more closely at the micro-organisms and microflora that live on coffee bushes. Dr Masaba found that some of the microflora, mainly fungi, attack and control various pathogens including the fungus causing <b>coffee</b> <b>berry</b> disease. However spraying against the disease and against other pests also destroys these beneficial microflora. The next stage of the research will be to find ways of encouraging the beneficial microflora and to develop reduced spraying regimes that will avoid harming them and yet still keep other pests under control.

50|$|The high species {{diversity}} found in shaded polycultures allows for relatively complex food webs to form.

Biological control by birds acting as predators on the <b>Coffee</b> <b>Berry</b> <b>Borer</b> in Jamaica was calculated to be worth $75/hectare in 2005, averaging $1004/farm studied. This equals about 30% of the per capita gross national income for that time.

After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methods—the dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.|$|R
