40|$|A {{generalized}} multiconductor {{transmission line}} (MTL) model is developed for modeling of wide frequency transient response on busbars, cables and <b>core-type</b> <b>transformer</b> windings. Different {{from the traditional}} MTL model, the equations of the generalized MTL model are built in the cylindrical coordinate system beside rectangular coordinate system. Based on further discussion, {{it is found that}} generalized MTL model could be changed to MTL model where all lines have the same length as to the <b>core-type</b> <b>transformer</b> windings. Then, the optimized solution based on Time domain finite element method (TDFEM) is developed for the above MTL equations. It avoids numerical oscillation of the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The numerical results are in agreement with ones calculated by Bergeron's method and FDTD method.

It also {{presents the}} design methodology for the power inductor. The 3 -phase power inductor is similar in construction to a 3 -phase <b>core-type</b> <b>transformer</b> with the exception that it has only one winding per phase and each limb is provided with an air-gap, the length of which is decided upon by the inductance required...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to account for}} the influence of the tank walls in the topological transient model of a three-phase, three-limb <b>core-type</b> <b>transformer.</b> The influence of the trans- former tank walls as a distributed-parameter hysteretic element is reproduced by solving a diffusion equation that describes the penetration of the plane electromagnetic wave into the depth of the wall. The reliability of the model is validated by comparing its zero-sequence impedances to those measured on a 25 -MVA transformer, in the presence and absence of a tertiary stabilizing winding. An Electromagnetic Transients Program–Alternate Transients Program implementation of the model is outlined...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{reports on}} the results of recent {{research}} and development efforts to study and assess various impacts of ferroresonance phenomenon on operating performance of power transformers and to investigate ways to mitigate the effects of such phenomenon. Three-phase <b>core-type</b> <b>transformers</b> are used in the study. The results of the technical investigation and the associated ferroresonance experimental work performed showed that ferroresonance can cause dangerous overvoltages and overcurrents in three-phase <b>core-type</b> <b>transformers.</b> Sensitivity analysis results are also presented to determine the impact of various design and operating parameters on the resulting overvoltages and overcurrents caused by ferroresonance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{magnetic}} characteristics (the flux distributions, core losses, etc.) of threephase <b>core-type</b> <b>transformers</b> with double-layer. In the preceding report, only linear solutions have been given. In this paper, also non-linear solutions are discussed. Therefore, the flux waves of each magnetic path are distorted and contain various harmonics. When core losses are calculated, the hysteresis losses of minor loops are taken account. The results of analysis are {{compared with those of}} experiments. It is concluded that the principal cause for increasing core losses of this type core is the eddy current loss produced by harmonic fluxes. The flux distributions and the core losses depend on the shapes of the magnetization curve and the core-loss curve, that is, {{on the quality of the}} materials...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the {{procedure}} to analyse magnetic circuits {{and give the}} linear solutions on magnetic characteristics of the three-phase <b>core-type</b> <b>transformer</b> which is composed of the complicated magnetic paths. First, we explain the construction of cores investigated and normalize the sizes of a core. To analyse these magnetic circuits, we introduced the electrical eqcuivalent circuits and obtained the general fundamental equations for each core. Then, we drew the linear-numerical solutions using an electronic computer, and cleared {{the relationships between the}} sizes of a core and the amplitudes and phase angles of fluxes in magnetic paths. Related with the above facts, we investigate the influence of these sizes on the core loss using cores of various quality...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experience in transformer modeling based on open-circuit test data obtained {{for a wide}} range of terminal voltages on the low-voltage side and inrush current measurements on the high-voltage side carried out for different residual fluxes of a 300 -kVA transformer. The <b>core-Type</b> <b>transformer</b> model is based on a dynamic hysteresis model, which is employed individually in the legs and yokes. We start with the case where the core geometry and winding turns are known when fitting the model. The method proposed is then extended to the case where only the nameplate data and the measured no-load losses and currents are available. For this latter case, an optimization model fitting is developed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—For future DC {{electric}} power systems, high-power DC-DC converters {{will play a}} major role as they will substitute today’s bulky 50 / 60 Hz transformers. One key component within this DC-DC converters is the medium frequency transformer that provides the isolation level and the step up/down of the different voltage levels. As a consequence, an optimized design methodology that considers this high isolation requirements is needed. This paper presents a step-by-step design for medium frequency transformers with high isolation requirements. Each step in the design is carefully discussed and the required design considerations, such as flux density limits, isolation and thermal management, are explained in detail. The proposed design procedure is applied to a <b>core-type</b> <b>transformer</b> analyzing the outcome of the optimization process. I...|$|E

40|$|This two-part {{paper is}} {{intended}} to clarify definitions in dual transformer modeling that are vague, provide accurate modeling guidelines, clarify misconceptions about numerical instability, provide a unified dual model for {{a specific type of}} transformer, and introduce new paths of research to the power systems/electrical machinery community for low-frequency transients. Part I discussed the topology of duality-based models and some important issues, such as the most common approaches to derive dual models and their variety, the equivalence of negative inductance and mutual couplings to represent the leakage inductance of three-winding transformers, and the numerical oscillations caused by the use of nontopological models. This part of the paper discusses and compares white-, gray-, and black-box models. The paper also reviews hysteresis models (static and dynamic) and highlights the differences between the air-core inductance and saturation inductance. The available dual models for the representation of the transformer tank are then presented. A unified and accurate model of a three-phase <b>core-type</b> <b>transformer</b> adequate for all low-frequency transients is presented. Finally, concrete guidelines are presented for the appropriate selection of the model topology and parameters for different low-frequency transient studies...|$|E
40|$|Year after year, the {{electrical}} {{power to be}} consumed in the world becomes larger, and also power transformers must become larger in size and heavier in weight. In this paper, prospects for employment of deeply cooled Al conductors as transformer windings are considered. At liquid hydrogen temperature, 20 °K, Al exhibits a resistivity of 3 × 10 ^ Ωm, and it is about 1 / 1000 times of a normal Cu resistivity. For this subject some considerations are given by K. J. R. Wilkinson, but this paper makes examinations of it from a different standpoint. At the beginning, for a three-phase <b>core-type</b> <b>transformer</b> general expressions of its loss, weight, size, etc. are introduced in a simple case, and then using the obtained expressions, 190 MVA three-phase transformers with supercooled-Al windings are designed, to {{be compared with the}} conventional transformer. From this culculations it results {{that in the case of}} maximum flux density B_m to be equal to conventional value the supercooled-Al transformer is about 1 / 3. 5 times of a conventional one in loss and weight, and in the case of B_m to be decreased so that the transformer weight may be equal to conventional value the diminution of about 1 / 5. 3 times is obtained in loss...|$|E
