5|$|City gained {{their first}} honours {{by winning the}} Second Division in 1899; with it came {{promotion}} {{to the highest level}} in English football, the First Division.

5|$|His {{troubles}} {{adjusting to}} the new rules, and his athletic conditioning during June and July, prompted the team to sign Hank Gastraight for added pitching strength. He struck out just 61 batters in 283 for a 1.6 K/9, and his ERA increased from 3.03in 1892to 4.41.

5|$|On {{the seventh}} day after the person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word both for the funeral ale and the feast, since it {{involved}} a ritual drinking). The funeral ale {{was a way of}} socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully <b>claim</b> <b>their</b> inheritance. If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.|$|E
5|$|Published {{commentators}} on the Roseberys <b>claim</b> <b>their</b> {{marriage was}} happy, {{and there is}} no known evidence that Hannah was anything other than happy in her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing to be happy, was at times irritated and bored by Hannah, who was always keen to accommodate his every whim.|$|E
5|$|A total {{prize money}} pot of US$245,000 was {{available}} to athletes at the championships, with awards being given those placing from first to sixth in both the individual and team sections.

A further $50,000 was provided as in incentive for runners who improved upon the half marathon world record mark, but ultimately this award was not claimed at the 2010 championships.

5|$|After the riots, Bishop Kenrick {{ended his}} efforts to {{influence}} the public education system and began encouraging the creation of Catholic schools, with 17 being founded by 1860. The friars of the Church of St. Augustine sued the city of Philadelphia for not providing the church with adequate protection, claiming $80,000 in damages. The city argued that the friars could not <b>claim</b> <b>their</b> civil rights were violated, as the Order of St. Augustine was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city argued that the friars took a vow of poverty {{and could not be}} property owners. The Augustinians ended up proving the Order was incorporated in 1804 and was awarded $45,000. The church was rebuilt in 1848.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 World Cup, Wales {{reached the}} tournament semi-finals {{for the first}} time since 1987 where they lost 9–8 to France after a red card for captain Sam Warburton. The two teams met again in March 2012, where Wales needed a win to <b>claim</b> <b>their</b> third Six Nations Grand Slam in eight years, which they did with a 16–9 victory. This was {{followed}} immediately by an eight-match losing streak, which was eventually broken during the 2013 Six Nations, where Wales retained the Championship {{for the first time}} since 1979 wins. Wales reached the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Cup at the expense of hosts England, then lost 23–19 to South Africa.|$|E

The fledgling infiltrates the Giovanni mansion and finds the sarcophagus guarded by the Kuei-Jin, who <b>claim</b> <b>their</b> leader, Ming-Xiao, has formed an alliance with LaCroix. The locked sarcophagus is returned to LaCroix's tower and Beckett, a vampire historian, tells the fledgling that {{the only person who}} can open it has been abducted by Grunfeld to lure LaCroix.

5|$|Consistent {{performances}} in the County Championship helped Somerset remain challengers for the competition until {{the last few weeks}} of the season, but the batting-friendly pitch at their home ground, the County Ground, Taunton, meant that the county finished with too many draws to <b>claim</b> <b>their</b> first Championship title. Consistency was also key for Somerset's success in one-day cricket, where they remained unbeaten in the group stage of the Friends Provident Trophy, but were eliminated in the first knock-out round, and finished runners-up by one point in the NatWest Pro40. In the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset finished as losing finalists. This meant that they qualified for the Champions League Twenty20, where they progressed into the second group stage of the competition. They failed to win any matches in that phase of the competition, resulting in their elimination.|$|E

In the final three days later against Kashima Antlers, Benzema opened the score in the 9th minute, and also assisted Ronaldo's second goal, as Real Madrid won 4–2 in extra time after the regular time finished 2–2 to <b>claim</b> <b>their</b> second title. It was Benzema's tenth title with Real Madrid, and finished the competition as joint-second topscorer with two goals in two matches.|$|E
5|$|Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication. This {{involves}} smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm calls are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained {{by the lack of}} light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to <b>claim</b> <b>their</b> territory.|$|E

From {{the left side of}} the pitch, McManaman went past Green, then McAteer, before he got in front of Seagraves and scored with a shot into the Bolton goal. Bolton replied immediately. Liverpool defender Neil Ruddock's clearance was played back into the Liverpool penalty area by Guðni Bergsson who had replaced Green. Paatelainen headed the ball onto Thompson, whose shot went into the Liverpool goal. Bolton continued to pressure Liverpool in search of the equaliser but were unable to score and Liverpool won the match 2–1 to <b>claim</b> <b>their</b> fifth League Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 1993, Leslie Alexander {{purchased}} the Rockets for $85 million. In Tomjanovich's second full year as head coach, the Rockets began the 1993–94 season by tying an NBA record with start of 15–0. Led by Olajuwon, {{who was named}} the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, the Rockets won a franchise-record 58 games. The Rockets recovered from being two games down to the Phoenix Suns {{in the second round}} of the playoffs, to advance to the finals. Houston was once again down by three games to two to the New York Knicks, but they managed to win the last two games on their home court, and <b>claim</b> <b>their</b> first championship in franchise history. Olajuwon was awarded the Finals MVP, after averaging 27 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots a game.|$|E
5|$|Randall left {{no doubt}} about his sympathies when he {{assigned}} members to the committee, stacking it with Hayes's enemies from both parties.

The Pelton telegrams were in code, which the committee was able to decode; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches, but the committee was unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess.|$|E
