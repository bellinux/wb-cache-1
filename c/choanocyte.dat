40|$|Abstract. It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that multicellular animals (metazoans) constitute a monophy-letic unit, deriving from ancestral choanoflagellate-like protists {{that gave rise}} to simple choanocyte-bearing metazoans. However, a re-assessment of molecular and histological evi-dence on choanoflagellates, sponge <b>choanocytes,</b> and other metazoan cells reveals that the status of <b>choanocytes</b> as a fundamental cell type in metazoan evolution is unrealistic. Rather, cho-anocytes are specialized cells that develop from non-collared ciliated cells during sponge em-bryogenesis. Although <b>choanocytes</b> of adult sponges have no obvious homologue among meta-zoans, larval cells transdifferentiating into <b>choanocytes</b> at metamorphosis do have such homologues. The evidence reviewed here also indicates that sponge larvae are architecturally closer than adult sponges to the remaining metazoans. This may mean that the basic multicel-lular organismal architecture from which diploblasts evolved, that is, the putative planktonic archimetazoan, was more similar to a modern poriferan larva lacking <b>choanocytes</b> than to an adult sponge. Alternatively, it may mean that other metazoans evolved from a neotenous larva of ancient sponges. Indeed, the Porifera possess some features of intriguing evolutionary sig-nificance: (1) widespread occurrence of internal fertilization and a notable diversity of gastru...|$|R

50|$|This small purse sponge grows singly and is {{globular}} in shape, {{sometimes with}} a short stalk. It is up to eight centimetres long and may be grey, yellowish or white.

This makes the flow slower near the choanocytes and thus makes it easier for them to trap food particles. For example, in Leuconia, a small leuconoid sponge about 10 cm tall and 1 cm in diameter, water enters each of more than 80,000 intake canals at 6 cm per minute. However, because Leuconia has more than 2 million flagellated chambers whose combined diameter is much greater than that of the canals, water flow through chambers slows to 3.6 cm per hour, making it easy for choanocytes to capture food. All the water is expelled through a single osculum at about 8.5 cm per second, fast enough to carry waste products some distance away.|$|E

50|$|<b>Choanocytes</b> bear {{more than}} a passing {{resemblance}} to Choanoflagellates, and demonstrate key steps in the evolution of animals. Scientist Nicole King helped to establish the distinction. DNA sequencing indicates that multicellular choanoflagellates and poriferans are sister groups, both descended from the same eukaryotic clade. One can see modern choanoflagellates living in small colonies, illustrating the evolution of sponges by analogy. More complex animals, notably the cnidarians, possess cells whose structures are clearly derived from <b>choanocytes,</b> demonstrating their historical ties to phylum porifera.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aquiferous {{body plan}} of poriferans {{revolves}} around internal chambers comprised of choanocytes, a cell type structurally similar to choanoflagellates. These <b>choanocyte</b> chambers perform {{a range of}} physiological and developmental functions, including the capture of food and the generation of stem cells. Despite the increasing interest for choanocytes as sponge stem cells, there is limited knowledge {{on the development of}} <b>choanocyte</b> chambers. Using a combination of cell lineage tracing, antibody staining and EdU labeling, here we examine the development of choanocytes and the chambers they comprise during metamorphosis in the marine demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica. Results Lineage-tracing experiments show that larval epithelial cells transform into mesenchymal pluripotent stem cells, resembling archeocytes, within 24  h of initiating metamorphosis. By 36  h, some of these labeled archeocyte-like cells have differentiated into choanocytes that will form the first postlarval <b>choanocyte</b> chambers. Non-labeled cells also contribute to these primary <b>choanocyte</b> chambers, consistent with these chambers being a chimera of multiple transdifferentiated larval cell types and not the proliferation of a single <b>choanocyte</b> precursor. Moreover, cell proliferation assays demonstrate that, following the initial formation of <b>choanocyte</b> chambers, chambers grow at least partially by the proliferation of choanocytes within the chamber, although recruitment of individual cells into established chambers also appears to occur. EdU labeling of postlarvae and juveniles reveals that <b>choanocyte</b> chambers are the primary location of cell proliferation during metamorphosis. Conclusion Our results show that multiple larval cell lineages typically contribute to formation of individual <b>choanocyte</b> chambers at metamorphosis, contrary to previous reports in other species that show sponge <b>choanocyte</b> chambers form clonally. Choanocytes in postlarval and juvenile A. queenslandica chambers can also divide, with <b>choanocyte</b> chambers being the primary location of cell proliferation. Interestingly, the level of cell proliferation varies greatly between chambers and appears to be contingent on the size, location and developmental state of the chamber. Small chambers {{on the periphery of the}} body tend to possess more dividing cells. As choanocytes can also dedifferentiate into archeocyte-like cells, cell proliferation in chambers may not only contribute to chamber growth and self-renewal but also increase the number of pluripotent archeocytes...|$|E

40|$|The {{digestive}} {{capabilities of}} endocytizing cells of Ephydatia fluviatilis have been {{determined by the}} ultrastructural localization of acid phosphatase. Two distinct markers of endocytic activity were supplied to sponges grown in vitro: Latex beads and Escherichia coli.

The digestive capabilities of each cell type were confirmed by the alteration of the bacteria in phagolysosomes. This localization of lysosomal activity, coupled with the endocytosis of particles clearly revises the previously accepted idea that archaeocytes are the sole digesting cells, this function being also supported by the <b>choanocytes</b> and the pinacocytes.
