50|$|The LA 2 (ЛА-2) is a Carbine. The {{sample was}} {{designed}} by Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant A. I. Nesterovym in 1961 {{under the influence of}} plant competition for the AKM. The sample frame limited progress in its rearmost position of the <b>cutting</b> <b>insert</b> receiver. This allowed the elasticity of its walls to reduce the impact of hitting the moving parts in an extreme position on the tip-off weapon. Automatic mode shows improved shooting accuracy. Location of the return spring {{on the left side of}} the bolt allowed its height to be reduced along with the height of the arms in general. Shoe flies combine with the gas chamber, with a diopter sight fully posted on the cover of the receiver. A cleaning gas vent at the top of the gas chamber in the firing position is covered by a crane. Weight is reduced to 2.15 kg. Its prototype 1961 magazine capacity was 30 rounds with an effective range of 1,000 meters.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{stressed}} {{state of}} a non-worn cutting wedge in a machined titanium alloy (Ti[6]Al[2]Mo[2]Cr) is analyzed. The distribution of contact loads {{on the face}} of a cutting tool was obtained experimentally {{with the use of a}} 'split cutting tool'. Calculation of internal stresses in the indexable insert made from cemented carbide (WC 8 Co) was carried out with the help of ANSYS 14. 0 software. Investigations showed that a small thickness of the <b>cutting</b> <b>insert</b> leads to extremely high compressive stresses near the cutting edge, stresses that exceed the ultimate compressive strength of cemented carbide. The face and the base of the insert experience high tensile stresses, which approach the ultimate tensile strength of cemented carbide and increase a probability of <b>cutting</b> <b>insert</b> destruction. If the thickness of the <b>cutting</b> <b>insert</b> is bigger than 5 mm, compressive stresses near the cutting edge decrease, and tensile stresses on the face and base decrease to zero.

40|$|Analyzing wear {{mechanisms}} and developments of surface layers in WC/Co-cemented carbide <b>cutting</b> <b>inserts</b> {{is of great}} importance for metal-cutting manufacturing. By knowing relevant processes within the surface layers of cutting tools during machining the choice of machining parameters can be influenced to get less wear and high tool life of the cutting tool. Tool wear obviously influences tool life and surface integrity of the workpiece (residual stresses, surface quality, work hardening, etc.), so the choice of optimised process parameters is of great relevance. Vapour-deposited coatings on WC/Co-cemented carbide <b>cutting</b> <b>inserts</b> are known to improve machining performance and tool life, but the mechanisms behind these improvements are not fully understood.

This is due to abnormal grain growth in sample with CeO 2 additive that hinder the densification process and leads to higher porosity.

40|$|AbstractMachine {{tools are}} {{responsible}} for a relevant share of environmental impact related to production processes. This is due to their widespread use, the huge energy requirements during operations and the disposable materials {{involved in the process}} like scraps, <b>cutting</b> <b>inserts</b> and exhausted oil. This study presents a holistic analysis of the main contributions that {{are responsible for}} the environmental impact of the process {{and the use of the}} analysis's results to optimize the process setup for a specific case. The factors included in the analysis are: cutting parameters, lubrication strategy and <b>cutting</b> <b>inserts</b> substitution. Regarding the cutting parameters choice, the analysis of the tests carried out highlighted that the best solution is to use the most demanding process parameters in terms of material removal rate, using the tool strength as a constraint. The comparison of alternative lubrication strategies shows the advantage of using dry machining, to be replaced with MQL only when hard-to-cut materials must be machined. Finally, the approach developed to assess the environmental footprint associated to the <b>cutting</b> <b>inserts</b> allowed to define a new substitution rule. The obtained solution is consistent with the usual industrial practice to change the tool when the geometrical tolerances could not be meet anymore, this result is due mainly to the high environmental impact of the production phase of the insert...|$|R
