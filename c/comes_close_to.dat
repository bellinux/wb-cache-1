5|$|Having {{reached the}} floor of the Hudson Valley, NY23 assumes a southeast-trending route through the town of Cairo. It <b>comes</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the hamlet of Cairo, but {{bypasses}} it on a four-lane divided highway that takes it around the northern fringe of the community. As it runs around Cairo, the route connects to NY145 and briefly overlaps NY32, the major northsouth state route {{on the west side of}} the Hudson River. NY23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill, where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill, the county seat of Greene County. NY23 bypasses this community as well, connecting to U.S. Route9W (US9W) and NY385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show <b>comes</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> providing the complete daily news.|$|E

5|$|Kessler then invites Cole to {{join him}} for a final fight in the same {{location}} where the game began. Displaying similar, if not superior, powers to the latter, Kessler <b>comes</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> killing him, only to be foiled by Zeke. Mortally wounded by a massive energy discharge, Kessler uses his last bit of strength to transmit a message into Cole's brain. In a final twist, Kessler {{turns out to be}} Cole himself from an alternate timeline. While raising a family with Trish, Kessler failed to prevent the Beast, a malevolent entity, from conquering humanity. With his reign secure, the Beast then tracked down and killed Trish and her children. Sending himself back in time, Kessler seized control of the First Sons, using their resources to prepare his past self for the future to come. Cole denounces Kessler's memory, but recognizes that his actions have given his life a new purpose.|$|E
5|$|Within Wayne County, {{the area}} around NY21 becomes more {{developed}} as it enters the village of Palmyra, where the road is village-maintained from the southern village line to its junction with NY31 in the village's historic center. The route briefly overlaps NY31 along East Main Street before crossing both the Erie Canal and the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision on {{its way out of}} the village. From Palmyra to Williamson, the land surrounding NY21 is predominantly rural in nature. However, midway between the two locations, NY21 <b>comes</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the hamlet of Marion, which it bypasses to the west. In Williamson, NY21 passes through the town center at a junction with Ridge Road before ending at an intersection with NY104 in a more commercial section of the town.|$|E
5|$|Halley's {{orbital period}} has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its {{orbit around the}} Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, {{the point in the}} comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°). Due to the retrograde orbit, it {{has one of the highest}} velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56km/s (157,838mph or 254,016km/h). Because its orbit <b>comes</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.|$|E

In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization.|$|E

With several of Earth's cities abducted, Brainiac prepares to eradicate the planet. The alliance attempts to take on Brainiac's ship, but his shields are too strong and he seemingly kills Superman in the process. They concoct a plan to weaken Brainiac's shields by using Aquaman's trident as a conduit for {{the magic of the}} Rock of Eternity.|$|E
25|$|Sometime {{before he}} joins the Teen Titans, Superboy learns {{that he had}} been {{actually}} created from the DNA of both Superman and a human. Though he had believed that human to be Paul Westfield, after he joins the Teen Titans he learns that the human is actually Superman's archnemesis Lex Luthor. Moreover, as the clone Superboy was developing, he was brainwashed so that Luthor could have a sleeper agent among the superhero community. When Luthor unleashes Kon-El, Superboy <b>comes</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> destroying the Teen Titans, but he manages to free himself from Luthor's control before any tragedy occurs. Shortly thereafter, Kon-El sacrifices his life to save Earth in a battle with Superboy-Prime during the Infinite Crisis. After his death, statues are erected in his honor in Metropolis and Titans Tower. Though he coerced Superboy into serving his own purposes, Luthor continues to claim that he views Kon-El as his son.|$|E

In the film, Pym was an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. until his wife Janet van Dyne shrunk to the Quantum Realm during one of their missions and discovered that the organization was trying to replicate his Pym Particle formula. After quitting, he builds his own company Pym Technologies, but is ousted as CEO by his former protege Darren Cross and his estranged daughter Hope van Dyne. Although they still {{kept an eye on}} Cross of any suspicious activity, Cross <b>comes</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> perfecting Pym's formula and plans to sell the Yellowjacket suit, Pym manipulated former thief Scott Lang into stealing the suit and eventually instructing Scott to be the new Ant-Man to stop Cross. He refused to have Hope in danger despite his daughter's superior experience, afraid that he'd lose Hope like Janet. After discovering that Ant-Man had returned from the Quantum Realm following his fight with Yellowjacket, Pym believed that Wasp is still alive there. In the mid-credits scene, Pym presents an updated Wasp costume to Hope, deciding to give it to his daughter.|$|E

25|$|The Gipping Valley River Path {{moves to}} the west bank at the bridge. The next lock {{downstream}} is Creetings Lock, with Riverside Farmhouse standing on the east bank. It was built in 1798 and was originally a mill house. The original Bosmere mill was close by, but was demolished in the early twentieth century. A stream flowing west from Ashbocking through Coddenham joins the mill stream, and the Old River rejoins the main channel below that. Pipps Ford Lock came next, with Pipps Ford farmhouse, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries located to the east. The railway <b>comes</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the river, and the Gipping Valley River Path briefly leaves the river, to run alongside the railway, but rejoins the towpath at Baylham Mill. The mill, close to a sixteenth-century mill house, was built in nineteenth century, and has three storeys with an attic storey containing storage bins. The cast iron breastshot waterwheel drove three pairs of stones through wooden shafting. Two additional pairs could either be water-powered, or an oil engine could drive them. Most of the machinery is still in situ, making it the only complete water mill on the river. There is a red-brick humped backed bridge over the tail of the adjacent lock, which was repaired with gault brick in the nineteenth century.|$|E
