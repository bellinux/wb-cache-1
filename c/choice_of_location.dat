5|$|The call to open {{a college}} in West Texas began shortly after {{settlers}} arrived {{in the area in}} the 1880s. In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of Texas A to be in Abilene. However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered Governor James E. Ferguson had falsely reported the site committee's <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>location.</b> After new legislation passed in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor Pat Neff vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas {{went so far as to}} recommend West Texas secede from the state.|$|E
5|$|Barry Took, who had {{produced}} {{a series of}} ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about working men's clubs, was partially responsible for the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> for the exterior shots. The programme which drew the highest ratings of the series focused on Burnlee Working Men's Club, a club in the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show. Took's idea was passed to James Gilbert and Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood, who {{was at that time}} filming Comedy Playhouse. Gilbert and Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the setting for the pilot of Last of the Summer Wine.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} Gregory's main motivation was {{to increase the}} number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>location.</b> Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was the only part of the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the empty cenotaph, another new form of memorial, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, used the idea of burying one of the unidentified bodies from the war as a symbolic memorial {{to all of the}} lost soldiers. This idea had begun to emerge {{towards the end of the}} war, and was actively promoted by some British veterans' groups in 1919. Initially, however, it failed to gain traction with the government because of the success of the Whitehall Cenotaph, and a second memorial was felt to be unnecessary. Finally, in 1920, following lobbying by British cleric David Railton, Britain and France both decided to create a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, choosing an unknown body and creating a special memorial around it; the tombs were inaugurated on Armistice Day. The <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> for the French tomb proved controversial, however, and it was not finalised until the following year, when the body was laid to rest under the Arc de Triumph. The concept proved popular, and encouraged similar memorials in other countries.|$|E

25|$|The {{historian}} Carl Leban attributes Cao Cao's {{victory to}} one single strategic decision — the defender's <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>location.</b> Leban asserts that Cao Cao chose Guandu {{as the place}} to make his stand because of his superior understanding {{of the relation between}} topography, logistics, and tactics over Yuan Shao. It was the issue about logistics that prompted Cao Cao to abandon the defence at the Yellow River. By luring Yuan Shao far south into Guandu, Cao Cao had forcibly extended Yuan Shao's supply lines and was thus able to pounce on his logistical disadvantage to gain a decisive victory.|$|E
25|$|The Jacobites {{received}} several French shipments {{during the winter}} but the Royal Navy's blockade caused increasing shortages of both money and food. This meant that when Cumberland left Aberdeen on 8 April, Charles and his senior officers agreed a decisive battle was their best option. The <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> has been argued ever since but is unlikely to have changed the result. As well as superior numbers and equipment, Cumberland's troops were intensively drilled in countering the key Highlanders offensive tactic of using the speed and ferocity of their initial charge to break the enemy line. When successful, this resulted in rapid victories as at Prestonpans and Falkirk but if it failed, they could not hold their ground. With the Jacobite forces exhausted by an ill-advised night march, the Battle of Culloden on 16 April was over {{in less than an}} hour and ended in a decisive government victory.|$|E

25|$|Compiègne {{had been}} {{the site of the}} 1918 Armistice, which ended the First World War with a humiliating defeat for Germany; Hitler viewed the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> as a supreme moment of revenge for Germany over France. On 21 June 1940, Hitler visited the site to start the {{negotiations}} which took place in the very same railway carriage in which the 1918 Armistice was signed (it had just been removed from a museum building and placed on the precise spot where it was located in 1918). Hitler sat in the same chair in which Marshal Ferdinand Foch had sat when he faced the defeated German representatives. After listening to the reading of the preamble, Hitler left the carriage in a calculated gesture of disdain for the French delegates, and negotiations were turned over to Wilhelm Keitel, the Chief of Staff of OKW. The armistice was signed on the next day at 18:36 (French time), by General Keitel for Germany and Huntziger for France. The armistice and cease-fire went into effect, two days and six hours later, at 00:35 on 25 June, once the Franco-Italian Armistice had also been signed, at 18:35 on 24 June, near Rome.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October 1998, Oslo Airport, Gardermoen {{took over}} the role as the main airport serving Oslo and Eastern Norway from Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Several other locations, {{including}} Hurum, Hobøl and Ås, had been considered, all which were located closer to Oslo and the Oslofjord area. The <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> was controversial, in part because Gardermoen would be located further than Fornebu from among other things Østfold and Follo. In 1998, a report was made by SCC Trafikon which concluded that by building a civilian section at Rygge Air Station, {{it would be possible}} to generate 130,000 passengers per year, of which 40,000 would be charter travels. This was a higher passenger potential than Torp. Several regional airlines, such as Teddy Air, Air Stord and Coast Air, all stated that they could be interested in routes from Rygge, while Scandinavian Airlines, Braathens and Widerøe stated that they were not interested in flying from the airport. The idea was initially supported by local parliamentarians, Østfold County Council and the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise. The latter stated that the most important air routes were those to Gardermoen and Torp, while the Trafikon report recommended routes to Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim and Copenhagen.|$|E

The <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> was deliberate.

500|$|The {{production}} process was plagued with problems, and changes {{had to be}} made throughout filming.

These are the tools, and that's literally the style." [...] Faulks also commented that [...] "some people find it perplexing but I think {{the way that the}} book has been presented... is a clever way of showing that it is not my book, although, of course, it is my book." [...] A large part of Devil May Care is set in Persia (now Iran); it was an area Fleming had not previously dealt with in his Bond novels, describing it as [...] "full of thieves and crooks".

Between 1881 and 1885, Aldis bought a series of lots in the area on Peter Brooks' behalf, including a 70-by-200-foot (21 by 61 m) site on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn streets. The location was remote, yet attractive for several reasons. The construction of the Chicago Board of Trade Building in 1885 had made nearby LaSalle Street the city's prime financial district, driving up property values, and railroad companies were buying up land further south for new terminal buildings, creating further speculation in the southeastern end of the Loop. Brooks commissioned Burnham & Root to design a building for the site in 1884, and the project was announced in 1885, with a brief trade journal notice that the building would cost $850,000 ($ in [...] dollars). The Chicago building community had little faith in Brooks' <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>location.</b> Architect Edwin Renwick would say: ...|$|E
