However, oils from coals are characteristically paraffinic and can be considered to derive from a polymethylene (PM) component, so the PM content should provide {{an estimate of the}} paraffinic oil potential. A trend apparently representing lignin evolution has been identified on the Van Krevelen diagram which permits the relative proportions of carbon in lignin and PM to be determined for coals that approximate a mixture of these two components, such as the members of the New Zealand (NZ) <b>Coal</b> <b>Band.</b> On the basis of this compositional model, HI values can be calibrated to provide an alternative estimate of the paraffinic oil potential. A maximum in HI is generally reached in coals near the onset of oil generation, at Rank(S) 12 (R. ca. 0. 7 %), from which it is suggested that the PM contri¬bution can be obtained using the formula HIpm = 1. 15 HIma„- 172 for the suite of NZ coals examined. The onset of oil expulsion can be identified from a variety of geochemical measurements, and occurs in the Rank(S) range ca. 12. 0 — 14. 5 (Ro ca. 0. 7 - 1. 1 %) for coals with paraffinic oil potentials exceeding ca. 40 mg HC/g TOC. Data from Taranaki Basin coals correlate well with the theoretical relationship between BI/HIPM and HIpm, using bitumen index (BI = S 1 /TOC) values of 10 mg HC/g TOC at the start of oil generation (i. e. bitumen inherited from diagenesis) and 40 mg HC/g TOC at the onset of oil expulsion, suggesting the HIpm model is reasonably accurate for members of the NZ <b>Coal</b> <b>Band.</b> Kinetic modelling of paraffinic oil generation from vitrinite-rich coals may be best approximated by consideration of PM degradation alone...|$|E

The metamorphism developing tend is same with coal seam structural shape. It presents that the tectonic stress on hydrostatic pressure state can affect coal metamorphism process. It was predicted that the metamorphic type of Wangfenggang minefield is superposition from the effect of energy transformation from tectonic stress on hydrostatic pressure state and katogenic metamorphism, which is long term regional extrusion has promoted and controlled coal metamorphism.

40|$|Abstract: The {{existence}} of vanadyl (VO 2 +) -non-porphyrins (P) {{in a thin}} band (enriched with vanadium) of the Western (W.) Kentucky (KY) No. 9 coal seam was shown by electron spin resonance (ESR). The ESR analysis indicates that VO 2 +-non-P {{are associated with the}} coal organic insoluble fraction. ESR parameters show that VO 2 + ion is in an environment with approximately axial symmetry and chelated possibly by carboxylic/phenolic oxygen ligand donor atoms. These parameters are compared with those of VO 2 +-fulvic acid complexes and the model complexes with salicylic/phthalic a ids reported by others. It is concluded that the vanadylation ofW. KY No. 9 thin <b>coal</b> <b>band</b> occurred uring its diagenetic (peat-forming) stage in the Pennsylvanian swamp. The extraordinary V enrichment of the top 15 cm, relative to the lower parts of the W. KY No. 9 coalbed is interpreted by a high V concentration f the past swamp water attained through a sudden and exceptional external supply. The predominant source of the metal was probably volcanic ash on the land that was weathered/leached of its vanadium. The association of V/Cr (together with their enrichment {{in the top of the}} seam) and Ni implies that the volcanic ash was derived from basalts. Abundant organic (humic) materials (with the high V enrichment factor) and low rate of deposition were the primary factors responsible for the high vanadium content of the coal. From the chemistry of VO 2 +, FeS 2 and CrOH 2 + it is deduced that the oxidation potential Eh and pH of the ancient peat interstitial water were approximately- 0. 2 to- 0. 3 V and 5 - 6, respectively.

40|$|Instantaneous outbursts in {{underground}} {{coal mines}} {{have occurred in}} at least 16 countries, involving both methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The precise mechanisms of an instantaneous outburst are still unresolved but must consider the effects of stress, gas content and physico-mechanical properties of the coal. Other factors such as mining methods (e. g., development heading into the coal seam) and geological features (e. g., coal seam disruptions from faulting) can combine to exacerbate the problem. Prediction techniques continue to be unreliable and unexpected outburst incidents resulting in fatalities are a major concern for underground coal operations. Gas content thresholds of 9 m(3) /t for CH 4 and 6 m(3) /t for CO 2 {{are used in the}} Sydney Basin, to indicate outburst-prone conditions, but are reviewed on an individual mine basis and in mixed as situations. Data on the sorption behaviour of Bowen Basin coals from Australia have provided an explanation for the conflicting results obtained by coal face desorption indices used for outburst-proneness assessment. A key factor appears to be different desorption rates displayed by <b>banded</b> <b>coals,</b> which is supported by both laboratory and mine-site investigations. Dull <b>coal</b> <b>bands</b> with high fusinite and semifusinite contents tend to display rapid desorption from solid coal, for a given pressure drop. The opposite is true for bright <b>coal</b> <b>bands</b> with high vitrinite contents and dull <b>coal</b> <b>bands</b> with high inertodetrinite contents. Consequently, when face samples of dull, fusinite-or semifusinite-rich coal of small particle size are taken for desorption testing, much gas has already escaped and low readings result. The converse applies for samples taken from <b>coal</b> <b>bands</b> with high vitrinite and/or inertodetrinite contents. In terms of outburst potential, it is the bright, vitrinite-rich and the dull, inertodetrinite-rich sections of a coal seam that appear to be more outburst-prone. This is due to the ability of the solid coal to retain gas, even after pressure reduction, creating a gas content gradient across the coal face sufficient to initiate an outburst. Once the particle size of the coal is reduced, rapid gas desorption can then take place. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science...|$|R

30|$|Coal {{alteration}} usually {{occurs at}} high-temperature {{as reported by}} several authors (Golab and Carr 2004; Golab et al. 2007; Yao et al. 2011; Sarana and Kar 2011; Kus 2017). Sarana and Kar (2011) report that the <b>coal</b> <b>bands</b> affected by intrusives suffered through a temperature up 500  °C as was indicated {{on the basis of}} the presence of unaltered pyrite. Kus (2017) states that the oxidative and thermal alteration of coal is induced by a high-temperature regime at temperatures over 800  °C. However, besides high-temperature alteration, Stukalova and Rusinova (2007) consider also low-temperature alteration: at the contact of the Early Cretaceous coal with a diabase dike (coal-intrusive contact), the high-temperature alteration of coal organic mass took place, but farther away from the dike, the coal was altered by low-temperature hydrothermal metamorphism. The coal in direct contact with the dike had properties typical of anthracites: strong anisotropy and high random vitrinite reflectance values (Rr 3.8 %– 5.5 %), unlike the low thermally altered coal at a certain distance from the dikes (Rr 2.0 %– 2.5 %). Thus, the local high-temperature transformation of the coal organic mass at the dike contacts was followed by a relatively low-temperature hydrothermal metamorphism of the coal. Altered coal often contains carbonates (see Supplementary material, point 2).|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} relationship between cleat spacing, cleat height and <b>coal</b> <b>banding</b> texture for Queensland Permian age coals of different rank, four of which are presented here. Whereas relationships between cleat frequency and rank, and with coal type or grade, {{have been reported in}} the past, relationships between the spacing and height among the different kinds of cleats are not quantitatively established. For other layered sedimentary rocks, joint or fracture spacing relates directly to both bed thickness and rock strength. Coal is similar to other layers rocks. Four major classes of cleats were distinguished, which were separate data populations when cleat spacing was plotted against cleat height; master cleats, single vitrain layer cleats, multiple vitrain layer package cleats, and durain (dull coal) cleats. Understanding the relationship between cleat height and spacing for specific coals, and the specific kinds of cleats within those coals, will lead to more accurate predictions of cleat density and hence coal permeability. This can improve modelling and prediction of methane gas deliverability in coal seams. In the Australian Permian coals studied, narrowly spaced cleats exist at all ranks, but the distribution of cleat spacing with cleat height is what varies for specific cleat classes. Cleat spacing was found to be directly proportional to cleat height in most cases...|$|R

Its highlight is to scientifically characterize the shape of hydraulic fractures and quantitatively describe the reservoir permeability improvement after fracturing through “MULTX ” of grid conductivity with Tartan grid model, thereby determining key parameters for the reservoir simulation of fractured vertical wells and providing a scientific basis for establishing CBM development plan and forecasting ultimate recoverable reserves. ...|$|R

40|$|Milling is {{an energy}} {{intensive}} process {{and it is}} considered {{as one of the}} most energy inefficient processes. Electrical and mechanical shock loading can be used to develop a pre-treatment methodology to enhance energy efficiency of comminution and liberation of minerals. <b>Coal</b> and <b>Banded</b> Hematite Jasper (BHJ) Iron ores samples were taken for the study to know the effect of shock loading. These samples were exposed to 5 electric shocks of 300 kV using an electric shock loading device. A diaphragmless shock tube was used to produce 3 and 6 compressed air shocks of Mach number 2. 12 to treat the coal and Iron ore samples. Microscopic, comminution and liberation studies were carried out to compare the effectiveness of these approaches. It was found that electric shock loading can comminute the coal samples more effectively and increases the yield of carbon by 40 % at 1. 6 gm/cc density over the untreated coal samples. Mechanical shock loading showed improved milling performance for both the materials and 12. 90 % and 8. 1 % reduction in the D- 80 of the particles was observed during grinding for treated samples of coal and iron, respectively. Liberation of minerals in BHJ Iron ore was found unaffected due to low intensity of the mechanical shock waves and non conductivity of minerals. Compressed air based shock loading is easier to operate than electrical shock loading and it needs to be explored further to improve the energy efficacy of comminution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
