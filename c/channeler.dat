5|$|After Ernest died in 1971, Ruth succeeded him {{as their}} group's leader and primary <b>channeler.</b> She {{subsequently}} began publishing accounts of her experiences and revelations. In early 1974, she predicted that a space fleet of benevolent extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would land on Earth later that year, which led the Unarius Academy {{to purchase a}} property {{to serve as the}} landing site. After the extraterrestrials failed to appear, Norman said that trauma she had suffered in a past life had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Undaunted, she rented a building for Unarius' meetings and sought publicity for the movement, claiming to have united the Earth with an interplanetary confederation. She revised the Space Brothers' expected landing date several times, before finally settling on 2001. Her health declined in the late 1980s, prompting her students to try to heal her with rituals of past-life regression. Despite predicting that she would live to see the extraterrestrials land, Norman died in 1993. Unarius has continued to operate after her death, and formed a board of directors. Since the 2000s, leaders have concentrated on individual transformation leading to spiritual change in humankind.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{males have}} greater {{strength}} in the power than women, but multiple female channelers can combine their strength by forming 'circles', with one <b>channeler</b> controlling and directing the weaves. Circles consisting of only females are limited to thirteen members, while inclusion of male channelers allows the circle to grow to up to seventy-two members. Circles must always hold {{at least one more}} female than male, with a minimum of 1 man for every 12 women. As men tend to be much stronger in the power than women, the strongest circles consist of a near equal balance between the genders.|$|E
25|$|Flows and weaves {{are visible}} to fellow channelers but {{limited by the}} viewer's access to either saidin or saidar. This {{visibility}} allows channelers {{to learn how to}} construct specific weaves and access abilities merely by watching another <b>channeler</b> create the weave. While male and female channelers have access to many of the same abilities and end effects, the weaves and manner of their construction are often very different. The act of channeling saidin is apparently very different from saidar, whereas women describe surrendering themselves to the One Power and allowing it to flow through them, men insist that similar behavior would be suicidal. They describe channeling as a struggle for control that would result in their own destruction if they ever faltered.|$|E

[...] Soon, they find Brauner's <b>channeler,</b> a Dullahan. [...] Shortly after its defeat, one of the vampire sisters appears and disdains their efforts, saying their control is lessened in only a minor degree. [...] Later, when {{entering}} the second portrait, they find Brauner and the two twins; Brauner laughs {{at the notion of}} reviving Dracula, as he has failed too many times to control humanity, but concedes his power is too great to ignore. [...] Both sisters desire to kill the two humans, but Brauner sees Dracula's servant Death as a greater threat, as he could wrest control from him far more easily than them. [...] While exploring the castle, Charlotte and Jonathan encounter Death, who acts as if Dracula were already revived. [...] When informed Dracula is still dead, and that another vampire is controlling the castle, he scoffs at the idea of a hand other than Dracula's to rule Castlevania. [...] Yet, he is gravely disturbed when he sees the statements are true, and promptly leaves to seek a way to destroy Brauner and revive Dracula.|$|E
2500|$|Channelers can {{direct the}} Power toward a desired purpose by {{creating}} {{one or more}} [...] "flows" [...] of the One Power and constructing [...] "weaves" [...] of these flows. An individual flow can only consist {{of one of the}} Five Powers, but a weave can combine any number of flows from any of the five. Flows can be of varying sizes, with larger flows involving greater strength. Channelers, especially novices, are very careful to control the amount of the One Power they draw into their flows. Drawing too much can be fatal, or can [...] "burn out" [...] the <b>channeler,</b> severing their ability to access the One Power forever. Channelers can sense the power in others and feel when a <b>channeler</b> has [...] "embraced" [...] saidar or [...] "seized" [...] saidin, for female channelers, this is limited only to other women, whereas male channelers are able to 'feel' when a female <b>channeler</b> has embraced saidar, this is generally felt by a tingling sensation. It is also possible, for women, to sense the strength of a fellow channeler—defined as the potential amount of the One Power the <b>channeler</b> can draw and successfully weave unaided without burning out. Men are limited to sensing the amount of saidin currently drawn, but cannot tell if it's the channeler's maximum potential.|$|E
50|$|Unknown to most <b>channelers</b> is {{that the}} Oath Rod also has the {{facility}} to unbind, useful for those sisters who become members of the Black Ajah and swear new oaths to the Dark One. <b>Channelers</b> are also freed from the oaths when severed from the Power. The sisters who later hunt the Black Ajah (due to misunderstanding of Elaida's order) in the Tower, have used it to make the sisters they suspect are Black to re-swear the old oaths and swear allegiance to them.|$|R
25|$|In the Age of Legends (approximately three {{thousand}} {{years before the}} first book takes place), {{both male and female}} <b>channelers</b> were collectively known as Aes Sedai and used the One Power together to great effect. During the successful attempt to seal the bore in The Dark One's prison, the male half of the One Power (saidin) was corrupted by Shai'tan (aka the Dark Lord, the Dark One). Through continued exposure to this taint, male <b>channelers</b> go insane and ultimately die. The Breaking of the World, marking the end of the Age of Legends (a time of great upheaval and strife including physical disruption of the geography of the world) was instigated by male <b>channelers</b> driven mad by Shai'tan's curse. Since that time, strength in the Power has generally lessened, and knowledge of weaves and abilities—including the ability to create angreal and cuendillar—have been lost.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the books}} contain many {{characters}} who can channel, the ability is actually {{rare in the}} population as a whole. Among those who do have the ability, most must be taught. Without instruction, a person with the ability to channel could go his or her entire life without ever channeling at all, or without even knowing he or she even had the ability to begin with. Generally those on the main continent find out when a member of the series' only formally-organized group of <b>channelers,</b> the Aes Sedai, visit their town on a recruiting trip. Aes Sedai visitors also search for the few <b>channelers</b> who are born with [...] "the spark," [...] an innate gift that will inevitably lead them to touch the Source. If left untrained, these gifted <b>channelers</b> often die without ever gaining control over their innate ability; the Aes Sedai estimate the mortality rate at 75% or more.|$|R

50|$|This weave of Spirit {{is used to}} put {{a barrier}} between a <b>Channeler</b> and the One Power, so the subject is {{temporarily}} unable to Channel. If the Shield is tied off, {{it will be more}} durable and it can remain even when the person who wove it stops channelling. However, this does make it more rigid and therefore more vulnerable. There are many kinds of Shielding: some Shields that are tied up vanish naturally after a precise amount of time; Liandrin was Shielded by Moghedien with a knot so intricate to be eternal; Asmodean was Shielded by Lanfear with a temporary Shield that permitted him to Channel only a very small amount of Power. Usually a <b>Channeler,</b> if already Channeling, must be cut off from the Source by a stronger <b>Channeler.</b> If a <b>Channeler</b> is caught by surprise, and not Channeling the One Power, however, it is possible for another to Shield them. It is possible for a weaker <b>Channeler</b> to hold a Shield over a stronger, though if the Shielded is substantially stronger, they have a greater chance of breaking through the Shield.|$|E

Men on the other hand can only sense intuitively when another man is channeling (and roughly how much of the power they are wielding). Male <b>channelers</b> can sense a woman holding saidar as goose bumps on their skin; women have no innate method of sensing male channeling, though certain ter'angreal and weaves have been crafted which do the job for them.|$|R

A male a'dam, on the other hand, requires two women to safely handle and maintain the link to the man, though one would do for a short time, and the man will eventually be able to reverse the flow of control to some extent, causing the three to fight for dominance. Also a male can not be [...] "leashed" [...] using a female a'dam, for this will result in both being killed. A recently discovered weakness with the a'dam is that the use of one prevents the <b>channeler</b> from linking with other channelers. This is because the a'dam creates a forced link between the <b>channeler</b> and the one holding the a'dam, it is therefore not possible for a <b>channeler</b> {{to be part of a}} linked circle and be collared by an a'dam as it is not possible to be linked to more than one circle.|$|E

According to Rand's narration, trying to make a ward do too many things will generally make it malfunction instead.|$|E
50|$|<b>Channelers</b> are {{not born}} equal: some are {{stronger}} in the Power and can handle larger quantities {{of it than}} others. Men and women, furthermore, are different in many regards {{when it comes to}} the One Power, as covered below.|$|R
5000|$|The One Power is [...] "woven" [...] (or [...] "spun" [...] in the {{terminology}} of {{those from the}} Age of Legends) in [...] "flows" [...] or [...] "threads" [...] (or [...] "webs") consisting {{of one or more}} of five elements: Earth, Water, Air, Fire and Spirit. Men are generally stronger with Fire and Earth, while women are generally stronger with Air and Water; strength in Spirit is typically equal, and equally rare. Male <b>channelers,</b> in general, are capable of holding more of the Power than female ones. However, female <b>channelers,</b> in general, tend to be more skilled and deft with their flows and weavings than their male counterparts. Male <b>channelers</b> cannot link to form a [...] "circle" [...] of multiple <b>channelers</b> working together without a woman's aid; only women can initiate a circle, and although men can be brought into a circle they cannot be forced, while women can be forced to do so (through the use of an a'dam **an a'dam creates a link between two women, the one wearing the bracelet of the a'dam has total control over the channeling abilities of the woman wearing the necklace of the a'dam, however women linked by an a'dam cannot join a circle with other women), however there cannot be more men than women in a circle; on the other hand, no more than thirteen women may link without including any men, and once this total is reached a man must take control. These differences allow for rough parity between male and female channeling, and it is known that the greatest works of the Age of Legends (a golden age that ended some 3,000 years {{before the start of the}} novels) were performed by men and women channeling in cooperation.|$|R

Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole - The Bore - being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.|$|R
