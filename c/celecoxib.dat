25|$|Celebrex (<b>celecoxib)</b> for arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Any {{increased}} risk of renal and arrhythmia pathologies associated with the class of COX-2 inhibitors, e.g. <b>celecoxib</b> (Celebrex), valdecoxib (Bextra), parecoxib (Dynastat), lumiracoxib, and etoricoxib is not evident, although smaller studies had demonstrated such effects earlier {{with the use of}} <b>celecoxib,</b> valdecoxib and parecoxib.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies of}} other coxibs have also shown {{increase}} {{in the risk of}} cardiovascular events, while others have not. For instance, the Adenoma Prevention with <b>Celecoxib</b> study (APC) showed a dose-related increase in risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure when taking <b>celecoxib</b> compared to placebo; and the Successive <b>Celecoxib</b> Efficacy and Safety Study I (SUCCESS-I) showed increased risk of myocardial infarction when taking 100nbsp&mg twice a day of <b>celecoxib</b> compared to diclofenac and naproxen; but taking 200nbsp&mg twice a day had lower incidence of myocardial infarction compared to diclofenac and naproxen. Nussmeier et al. (2005) showed in a study increase in incidence of cardiovascular events when taking parecoxib and valdecoxib (compared to placebo) after coronary artery bypass surgery.|$|E
25|$|The bulky {{sulfonamide group}} in COX-2 inhibitors such as <b>celecoxib</b> and rofecoxib prevent the {{molecule}} {{from entering the}} COX-1 channel.|$|E
25|$|Diclofenac {{is similar}} in COX-2 {{selectivity}} to <b>celecoxib.</b> A review by FDA Medical Officer David Graham concluded diclofenac does {{increase the risk of}} myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Celecoxib</b> was {{the first}} {{specific}} inhibitor of COX-2 approved to treat patients with rheumatism and osteoarthritis. A study showed that the absorption rate, when given orally, is moderate, and peak plasma concentration occurs after about 2–4 hours. However, the extent of absorption is not well known. <b>Celecoxib</b> has the affinity to bind extensively to plasma proteins, especially to plasma albumin. It has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 455 +/- 166 L in humans and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases proportionally to increased oral doses, between 100 and 800mg. <b>Celecoxib</b> is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 isoenzyme to carboxylic acid and also by non-CYP-dependent glucuronidation to glucuronide metabolites. The metabolites are excreted in urine and feces, with {{a small proportion of}} unchanged drug (2%) in the urine. Its elimination half-life is about 11 hours (6–12 hours) in healthy individuals, but racial differences in drug disposition and pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly have been reported. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency appear to have 43% lower plasma concentration compared to healthy individuals, with a 47% increase in apparent clearance, and it can be expected that patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment have increased steady-state AUC.|$|E
25|$|On March 11, 2009, Scott S. Reuben, {{former chief}} of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass., {{revealed}} that data for 21 studies he had authored for {{the efficacy of the}} drug (along with others such as <b>celecoxib)</b> had been fabricated in order to augment the analgesic effects of the drugs. There is no evidence that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for the drug company Pfizer (which owns the intellectual property rights for marketing <b>celecoxib</b> in the United States). The retracted studies were not submitted to either the FDA or the European Union's regulatory agencies prior to the drug's approval. Drug manufacturer Merck had no comment on the disclosure.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamides {{are used}} to treat allergies and cough, as well as {{antifungal}} and antimalarial functions. The moiety is also present in other medications that are not antimicrobials, including thiazide diuretics (including hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone, and indapamide, among others), loop diuretics (including furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide), acetazolamide, sulfonylureas (including glipizide, glyburide, among others), and some COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., <b>celecoxib).</b>|$|E
25|$|The company {{develops}} {{and produces}} medicines and vaccines {{for a wide}} range of medical disciplines, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, diabetology/endocrinology, and neurology. Its products include the blockbuster drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), used to lower LDL blood cholesterol; Lyrica (pregabalin) for neuropathic pain/fibromyalgia; Diflucan (fluconazole), an oral antifungal medication; Zithromax (azithromycin), an antibiotic; Viagra (sildenafil) for erectile dysfunction; and Celebrex/Celebra (<b>celecoxib),</b> an anti-inflammatory drug.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} {{development}} of selective COX-2 inhibitors was the adverse gastrointestinal side-effects of NSAIDs. Soon after {{the discovery of the}} mechanism of action of NSAIDs, strong indications emerged for alternative forms of COX, but little supporting evidence was found. COX enzyme proved to be difficult to purify and was not sequenced until 1988. In 1991 the existence of the COX-2 enzyme was confirmed by being cloned by Dr. Dan Simmons at Brigham Young University. Before the confirmation of COX-2 existence, the Dupont company had developed a compound, DuP-697, that was potent in many anti-inflammatory assays but did not have the ulcerogenic effects of NSAIDs. Once the COX-2 enzyme was identified, Dup-697 became the building-block for synthesis of COX-2 inhibitors. <b>Celecoxib</b> and rofecoxib, the first COX-2 inhibitors to reach market, were based on DuP-697. It took less than eight years to develop and market the first COX-2 inhibitor, with Celebrex (<b>celecoxib)</b> launched in December 1998 and Vioxx (rofecoxib) launched in May 1999.|$|E
25|$|Others include Merck's etoricoxib (Arcoxia), Pfizer’s <b>celecoxib</b> (Celebrex) and valdecoxib (Bextra). Interestingly, at {{the time}} of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib with {{clinical}} evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen.|$|E
25|$|Another {{class of}} NSAIDs, COX-2 {{selective}} inhibitors (such as <b>celecoxib)</b> are equally effective {{when compared to}} nonselective NSAIDs, and have lower rates of adverse gastrointestinal effects, but higher rates of cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction. They are also more expensive than non-specific NSAIDs. Benefits and risks vary in individuals and need consideration when making treatment decisions. NSAIDS applied topically are effective for {{a small number of}} people.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Merck {{commenced}} the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx) study, {{a three-year}} trial {{with the primary}} aim of evaluating the efficacy of rofecoxib for the prophylaxis of colorectal polyps. <b>Celecoxib</b> had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib as well. An additional aim {{of the study was}} to further evaluate the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib.|$|E
25|$|NSAIDs reduce both {{pain and}} {{stiffness}} {{in those with}} RA but do not affect the underlying disease and appear to {{have no effect on}} people's long term disease course and thus are no longer first line agents. NSAIDs should be used with caution in those with gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or kidney problems. Use of methotrexate together with NSAIDS is safe, if adequate monitoring is done. COX-2 inhibitors, such as <b>celecoxib,</b> and NSAIDs are equally effective.|$|E
25|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, {{can cause}} flares of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} in approximately 25% of patients. These flares tend to occur within one week after starting regular use of the NSAID. In contrast, acetaminophen (paracetamol) and aspirin appear to be safe. <b>Celecoxib</b> (Celebrex), a cox-2 inhibitor, {{also appears to be}} safe, at least in short-term studies of patients in remission and on medication for their Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Pfizer {{merged with}} Pharmacia. The merger was again driven {{in part by}} the desire to acquire full rights to a product, this time Celebrex (<b>celecoxib),</b> the COX-2 {{selective}} inhibitor previously jointly marketed by Searle (acquired by Pharmacia) and Pfizer. In the ensuing years, Pfizer carried out a massive restructuring that resulted in numerous site closures and the loss of jobs including Terre Haute, Indiana; Holland, Michigan; Groton, Connecticut; Brooklyn, New York; Sandwich, UK; and Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major cause}} {{is the use}} of NSAIDs, such as {{ibuprofen}} and aspirin. The gastric mucosa protects itself from gastric acid with a layer of mucus, the secretion of which is stimulated by certain prostaglandins. NSAIDs block the function of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), which is essential for the production of these prostaglandins. COX-2 selective anti-inflammatories (such as <b>celecoxib</b> or the since withdrawn rofecoxib) preferentially inhibit COX-2, which is less essential in the gastric mucosa, and roughly halve the risk of NSAID-related gastric ulceration.|$|E
25|$|Several {{very large}} {{observational}} {{studies have also}} found elevated {{risk of heart attack}} from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005). Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of <b>celecoxib,</b> though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. (Graham, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Mesuximide {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, <b>celecoxib,</b> dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen is one {{of three}} drugs in an anti-angiogenetic {{protocol}} developed by Dr. Judah Folkman, a researcher at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that angiogenesis – the growth of new blood vessels – plays {{a significant role in the}} development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on angiogenesis inhibitors have been underway since 1992 using myriad different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of <b>celecoxib,</b> doxycycline, and tamoxifen – the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol. Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen's ER antagonist properties.|$|E
25|$|For optimal {{activity}} and selectivity of the coxibs, a 4-methylsulfonylphenyl attached to an unsaturated (usually) five-membered ring with a vicinal lipophilic group is required (rofecoxib). The SO2CH3 {{can be replaced}} by SO2NH2, wherein the lipophilic pocket is occupied by an optionally substituted phenyl ring or a bulky alkoxy substituent (<b>celecoxib).</b> Within the hydrophilic side-pocket of COX-2, the oxygen of the sulfonamide (or sulfone) group interacts with Hist90, Arg513, and Gln192 and forms hydrogen bonds. The substituted phenyl group {{at the top of}} the channel interacts with the side-chains of amino acid residues through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Tyr385 makes for some sterical restrictions of this side of the binding site so a small substituent of the phenyl group makes for better binding. Degrees of freedom are also important for the binding. The central ring of the coxibs decides the orientation of the aromatic rings and, therefore, the binding to COX enzyme even though it often has no electrostatic interactions with any of the amino acid residues. The high lipophilicity of the active site does require low polarity of the central scaffold of the coxibs.|$|E
25|$|DuP-697 was a building-block for {{synthesis}} of COX-2 inhibitors {{and served as}} the basic chemical model for the coxibs that are the only selective COX-2 inhibitors on the market today. DuP-697 is a diaryl heterocycle with cis-stilbene moiety. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies for diaryl heterocyclic compounds have indicated that a cis-stilbene moiety {{and changes in the}} para-position of one of the aryl rings {{play an important role in}} COX-2 selectivity. <b>Celecoxib</b> and parecoxib have a sulfonamide substituent (SO2NH2) in para-position on one of the aryl rings while etoricoxib and rofecoxib have a methylsulfone (SO2CH3). The oxidation state on the sulfur is important for selectivity; sulfones and sulfonamides are selective for COX-2 but sulfoxides and sulfides are not. The ring system that is fused in this stilbene system has been extensively manipulated to include every imaginable heterocyclic and carbocyclic skeleton of varying ring sizes. It is known that a SO2NHCOCH3 moiety as in parecoxib, which is a prodrug for valdecoxib, is 105– 106 more reactive acetylating agent of enzyme serine hydroxyl groups than simple amides. Due to the fact that varying kinetic mechanisms affect potency for COX-1 versus COX-2, relying Potency and selectivity in human whole blood is used by many groups and has been accepted as a standard assessment of COX-2 potency and selectivity.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation was studied by Li H. et al. (2008). They {{showed that in}} spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) non-selective NSAIDs and the coxibs produce oxidative stress, indicated by enhanced vascular superoxide(O2−) content and elevated peroxide in plasma, which is in tune with enhanced expression of NADPH oxidase, which was noticed with use of diclofenac and naproxen and, to a lesser degree, rofecoxib and <b>celecoxib.</b> Nitrite in plasma was also decreased suggesting a diminished synthesis of vascular nitric oxide (NO). This decrease in NO synthesis did not result from decreased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) because expression of eNOS mRNA was not reduced, and even upregulated for some products. The decrease in NO synthesis could, rather, be explained by loss of eNOS function. For eNOS to be normally functional, it needs to form a dimer and to have its cofactor BH4, {{which is one of}} the most potent naturally occurring reducing agents. BH4 is sensitive to oxidation by peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which is produced when NO reacts with O2−, so it has been hypothesized that depletion of BH4 can occur with excessive oxidative stress (that can be caused be NSAIDs) and, hence, be the cause of eNOS dysfunction. This dysfunction, which is referred to as eNOS uncoupling, causes the production of O2− by eNOS, thereby leading to more oxidative stress produced by eNOS. In a study, both the selective COX-2 inhibitors and the non-selective NSAIDs produced oxidative stress, with greater effects seen with non-selective NSAIDs use. This could fit with the hypothesis concerning the prostacyclin/thromboxane imbalance. That is, although the non-selective NSAIDs produce more oxidative stress, they prevent platelet aggregation, whereas the COX-2 inhibitors reduce prostacyclin production, and, hence, the cardiovascular risk for the non-selective NSAIDs is not higher than for the coxibs.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{mechanism}} of action responsible for ketorolac's anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic effects is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by competitive blocking of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Ketorolac is a non-selective COX inhibitor. [...] Ketorolac has been assessed to be a relatively higher risk NSAID when compared to aceclofenac, <b>celecoxib,</b> and ibuprofen.|$|E
2500|$|These {{drugs have}} been derived from NSAIDs. [...] The {{cyclooxygenase}} enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs was discovered {{to have at}} least 2 different versions: COX1 and COX2. [...] Research suggested most of the adverse effects of NSAIDs to be mediated by blocking the COX1 (constitutive) enzyme, with the analgesic effects being mediated by the COX2 (inducible) enzyme. [...] Thus, the COX2 inhibitors were developed to inhibit only the COX2 enzyme (traditional NSAIDs block both versions in general). [...] These drugs (such as rofecoxib, <b>celecoxib,</b> and etoricoxib) are equally effective analgesics when compared with NSAIDs, but cause less gastrointestinal hemorrhage in particular.|$|E
2500|$|Building {{on those}} results, {{scientists}} started focusing on selective COX-2 inhibitors. Enormous effort {{was spent on}} the development of NSAIDs between the 1960s and 1980 so there were numerous pharmacophores to test when COX-2 was discovered. Early efforts focused on modification on two lead compounds, DuP-697 and NS-398. These compounds differ greatly from NSAIDs that are arylalkonic acid analogs. Encouraged by the [...] "concept testing" [...] experiments with selective inhibitors, and armed with several solid leads and clear idea {{of the nature of the}} binding site, development of this field was rapid. In vitro recombinant enzyme assays provided powerful means for assessing COX selectivity and potency and led to the discovery and clinical development of the first rationally designed COX-2 selective inhibitor, <b>celecoxib.</b> Efforts have been made to convert NSAIDs into selective COX-2 inhibitors such as indometacin by lengthening of the alkylcarboxylic acid side-chain, but none have been marketed.|$|E
2500|$|Animal and lab {{studies suggest}} that Relenza (zanamivir), {{which is in the}} same class of drugs as Tamiflu, may also be {{effective}} against H5N1. In a study performed on mice in 2000, [...] "zanamivir was shown to be efficacious in treating avian influenza viruses H9N2, H6N1, and H5N1 transmissible to mammals". In addition, mice studies suggest the combination of zanamivir, <b>celecoxib</b> and mesalazine looks promising producing a 50% survival rate compared to no survival in the placebo arm. While no one knows if zanamivir will be useful or not on a yet to exist pandemic strain of H5N1, it might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as oseltamivir {{in the event of an}} H5N1 influenza pandemic. Neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir can currently be manufactured in quantities that would be meaningful once efficient human transmission starts. In September, 2006, a WHO scientist announced that studies had confirmed cases of H5N1 strains resistant to Tamiflu and Amantadine. Tamiflu-resistant strains have also appeared in the EU, which remain sensitive to Relenza.|$|E
2500|$|Studies on {{the binding}} {{mechanism}} of selective COX-2 inhibitors {{show that they}} have two reversible steps with both COX-1 and COX-2, but the selectivity for COX-2 is due to another step that is slow and irreversible and is seen only in the inhibition of COX-2, not COX-1. The irreversible step {{has been attributed to}} the presence of the sulfonamide (or sulfone) that fits into the side-pocket of COX-2. This has been studied using SC-58125 (an analogue of <b>celecoxib)</b> and mutated COX-2, wherein the valine 523 residue was replaced by isoleucine 523. The irreversible inhibition did not happen, but reversible inhibition was noticed. A model has been made to explain this three-step mechanism behind the inhibitory effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors. The first step accounts for the contact of the inhibitor with the gate of the hydrophobic channel (called the lobby region). The second step could account for the movement of the inhibitor from the lobby region to the active site of the COX enzyme. The last step probably represents repositioning of the inhibitor at the active site, which leads to strong interactions of the phenylsulfonamide or phenylsulfone group of the inhibitor and the amino acids of the side pocket. It is directly inhibition to postaglanding ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Celecoxib</b> is {{predominantly}} metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C9. Caution must be exercised with concomitant use of 2C9 inhibitors, such as fluconazole, which can greatly elevate <b>celecoxib</b> serum levels. If used concomitantly with lithium, <b>celecoxib</b> increases lithium plasma levels. If used concomitantly with warfarin, <b>celecoxib</b> {{may result in}} increased risk of bleeding complications. The drug may {{increase the risk of}} kidney failure with angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, such as lisinopril, and diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
50|$|Pfizer markets <b>celecoxib</b> {{under the}} brand name Celebrex, and it is {{available}} as oral capsules containing 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg of <b>celecoxib.</b>|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>celecoxib</b> {{to reduce}} the risk of {{colorectal}} cancer has been investigated, but neither <b>celecoxib</b> nor any other drug is indicated for this use. Small-scale clinical trials in very high-risk people (belonging to FAP families) showed <b>celecoxib</b> can prevent polyp growth. Hence, large-scale randomized clinical trials were undertaken. Results show a 33 to 45% polyp recurrence reduction in people treated with <b>celecoxib</b> each day. However, serious cardiovascular events were significantly more frequent in the celecoxib-treated groups. Aspirin shows a similar (and possibly larger) protective effect, has demonstrated cardioprotective effects and is significantly cheaper, but no head-to-head clinical trials have compared the two drugs.|$|E
5000|$|In another two-year {{follow-up}} study, {{there was}} no significant pain reduction or improved function when compared to either inactive placebo or <b>celecoxib</b> [...] Some of the researchers' ties to Pfizer (which makes <b>celecoxib)</b> have brought into question the validity of the study.|$|E
50|$|Arthritis drug <b>celecoxib</b> binds to CDH11.|$|E
50|$|Any {{increased}} risk of renal and arrhythmia pathologies associated with the class of COX-2 inhibitors, e.g. <b>celecoxib</b> (Celebrex), valdecoxib (Bextra), parecoxib (Dynastat), lumiracoxib, and etoricoxib is not evident, although smaller studies had demonstrated such effects earlier {{with the use of}} <b>celecoxib,</b> valdecoxib and parecoxib.|$|E
50|$|Certainly, the {{inhibition}} of COX-2 is paramount for the anti-inflammatory and analgesic function of <b>celecoxib.</b> However, whether {{inhibition of}} COX-2 {{also plays a}} dominant role in this drug's anticancer effects is unclear. For example, a recent study with malignant tumor cells showed <b>celecoxib</b> could inhibit the growth of these cells in vitro, but COX-2 played no role in this outcome; even more strikingly, the anticancer effects of <b>celecoxib</b> were also obtained {{with the use of}} cancer cell types that do not even contain COX-2.|$|E
50|$|<b>Celecoxib</b> {{has been}} found {{effective}} in one study.|$|E
