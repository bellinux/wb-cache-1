The <b>team</b> <b>continued</b> <b>work</b> separately <b>and</b> sporadically, making meager headway and disheartened by the project's obstacles. Upon return to the Netherlands from GDC, Nijman and Ismail, the co-founders of Vlambeer, began to plan a [...] "really large game", but ultimately decided that the idea was a diversion from the realities of finishing Ridiculous Fishing. In August 2012, after a road trip home across the United States from Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle to New York City, the team set a deadline to finish the game. The game was in a [...] "disjointed" [...] state, with good fishing mechanics, but poor shooting and menu navigation. They scrapped the store, interface, and endgame along with [...] "90 percent" [...] of their work, which revealed a specific direction {{for the rest of}} the game's development. Wohlwend, the artist, moved in with Gage, the developer, in New York City, working 14-hour days during the final weeks. The music was composed by Eirik Suhrke. The last parts of the game assembled smoothly, and Ismail submitted the game to the iOS App Store for approval from New York.|$|R
