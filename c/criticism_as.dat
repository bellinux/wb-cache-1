5|$|On Halloween 2011, Torres' costume {{prompted}} <b>criticism</b> <b>as</b> he and {{his wife}} donned blackface dressed up as a rapper Jay-Z and Beyoncé.|$|E
5|$|Asked by a {{journalist}} once, {{he said that}} his favourite city was London, and in another instance he said that Mohammed Ali Jinnah had asked him to join the Pakistan Army during the partition in 1947, and in his usual jovial style, commented that if he had joined the Pakistan Army, then India would have been defeated in the 1971 war. The latter remark attracted as much <b>criticism</b> <b>as</b> anything else in his career.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the film was extremely negative. The acting, story, and characters attracted the most <b>criticism</b> <b>as</b> well as the film's setting on a slow-moving cruise ship, which was much less thrilling than Speed setting on a fast-moving bus. The film was also a financial disappointment, earning $164 million worldwide against a budget of $110 million. It was nominated for eight Golden Raspberry Awards, and won the award for Worst Re-Make or Sequel.|$|E

25|$|This {{and other}} period <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> {{well as the}} {{prevalence}} of satirical prints have led some historians to believe that milliners were not respected and thought to be nothing less than prostitutes.|$|R
5|$|Critics have {{positively}} {{received some}} of the stories within the collection, analyzing Anarky as a unique force for political commentary and discussion within DC Comics' storytelling. However, the expansive growth of the character's unique abilities and characterization has also fueled <b>criticism</b> <b>as</b> having overpowered the character beyond suspension of disbelief.|$|E
5|$|In July {{the same}} year, Hareide {{received}} further <b>criticism</b> <b>as</b> {{the number of}} licenses to kill large carnivores allegedly was not only at a record high (12 brown bears, 10 grey wolves, 22 wolverines and 13 lynx), but also contradictory to the parliamentary policy on the matter. According to Hareide, the actions were {{in line with the}} parliamentary stance on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Larsen's {{exploration}} of race was informed {{by her own}} mixed racial heritage and the increasingly common practice of racial passing in the 1920s. Praised upon publication, the novel has since been celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction of race, gender and sexuality, and {{is the subject of}} considerable scholarly <b>criticism.</b> <b>As</b> one of only two novels that Larsen wrote, Passing has been significant in placing its author at the forefront of several literary canons.|$|E
50|$|However, {{these two}} metrics, {{developed}} in the last century, are facing increased challenges and <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> new types of light sources, particularly light emitting diodes (LEDs), become more prevalent in the market.|$|R
50|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} criticised by historians Carlo Ginzburg, Arnaldo Momigliano and Bruce Lincoln as being based on Dumézil's sympathies {{with the political}} right. Guy G. Stroumsa sees these <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> unfounded.|$|R

5|$|There {{was some}} <b>criticism,</b> <b>as</b> well as confusion, {{regarding}} {{the title of}} the film. Many reviewers, including James Rolfe, felt that it should have officially been titled Rocky VI, and that simply adding his last name to the end made it seem like it was a remake of the original film rather than a sequel.|$|E
5|$|Bikinis {{have become}} a major {{component}} of marketing various women's sports. It is an official uniform for beach volleyball and is widely worn in athletics and other sports. Sports bikinis have gained popularity since the 1990s. However, the trend has raised some <b>criticism</b> <b>as</b> an attempt to sell sex. Female swimmers do not normally wear bikinis in competitive swimming. The International Swimming Federation (FINA) voted to prohibit female swimmers from racing in bikinis in its meeting at Rome in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, Dixon {{became a}} {{judge on the}} seventh series of Strictly Come Dancing, {{replacing}} Arlene Phillips. The replacement of Phillips by Dixon attracted <b>criticism,</b> <b>as</b> some questioned the extent of Dixon's dancing knowledge. In 2010, Dixon returned for the eighth series of Strictly Come Dancing and released her third studio album, The Entertainer. In January 2012, shortly after completing the ninth series and her third year as a judge on Strictly Come Dancing, Dixon quit to become a judge on Britain's Got Talent. Her third studio album, Do It for Love, was released in 2015.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{their efforts}} were limited {{by a lack}} of {{resources}} and verifiable information. In these 17th-century playlists, the accuracy of the authorial attributions never rises above 50%. Later generations of scholars and commentators have been vocal in their <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> a result.|$|R
50|$|After the games, {{the boys}} {{talked about the}} games the class played as the {{proceeded}} towards Hae-yung's home. Meina grumbled once the boys entered their flat, for not assisting them in their packing. Hee-dong received further <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> he sat on their sofa and hugged on a soft toy.|$|R
50|$|Beatty {{was born}} in New Canaan, Connecticut. From 1924 until 1929 she {{attended}} the Boston Museum School. She trained as a sculptor. Frederick W. Allen was the daily instructor at that time with Charles Grafly coming up from Philadelphia twice a month to give <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> head of the Sculpture Department.|$|R
5|$|Regarding public housing, Tufaro {{called for}} renovations rather than {{demolishing}} vacant buildings, which drew <b>criticism,</b> <b>as</b> Housing Commissioner Daniel P. Henson III {{pointed out that}} renovating was more expensive than demolishing. O'Malley promised to enforce provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which require banks to invest in poor neighborhoods. Tufaro further proposed a plan for school vouchers and to drug test students, which drew opposition from the Baltimore Teachers Union and from O'Malley, who favored expanding pre-kindergarten and after-school programs, while making summer school mandatory. When discussing the problem of HIV/AIDS in Baltimore, which disproportionately affects African Americans, both O'Malley and Tufaro promised to continue the city's needle exchange program.|$|E
5|$|These moves {{were met}} with some <b>criticism,</b> <b>as</b> the {{preserved}} counties were created to sustain a stable and continuing layout, irrespective of interim local government reviews affecting principal areas. This led to some areas, such as the Aberconwy district, moving to a preserved county {{it had never been}} administered by in the past, and therefore these moves went generally unreported due to the preserved county's limited status. The Boundary Commission proceeded to retain the eight preserved counties, and modified their borders in 2003 to match with the incumbent principal area boundaries. The 2003 arrangement brings towns such as Llandudno, Conwy and Betws-y-Coed into the preserved county of Clwyd.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the world}} {{are a variety of}} enemies, {{including}} standard fantasy monsters such as imps and goblins, and animals such as bears and wolves. Enemies become stronger and weapons and armor more effective as the player levels up. This game mechanic of level-scaling was incorporated to maintain a constant and moderate aspect of difficulty. However, level-scaling combined with the leveling system has received <b>criticism,</b> <b>as</b> {{it has the potential to}} unbalance the game; characters with major skills that increase on an involuntary basis, such as athletics or armor, can find that they level too quickly, making the enemies proportionately harder than intended.|$|E
50|$|McLeod also {{offended}} some immigrant voters, {{who usually}} vote Liberal, by criticizing the Rae government's handling of Somali refugee claims. Her {{intent was to}} draw attention to criminal gangs that were forcing Somalis to move to Ontario and defraud the provincial welfare system. Several, however, interpreted her <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> being directed toward the entire community.|$|R
50|$|Digg, a large social news website, {{announced}} on Sep 9th, 2009 {{that it is}} rolling out its use of Cassandra and confirmed this on March 8, 2010. TechCrunch has since linked Cassandra to Digg v4 reliability criticisms and recent company struggles. Lead engineers at Digg later rebuked these <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> red herring and blamed a lack of load testing.|$|R
50|$|After 1977 Roderick {{taught at}} Baylor University, the University of Texas, Duke University and National University in Los Angeles. He was the {{recipient}} of the Oldright Fellowship at the University of Texas and served as associate editor to The Pawn Review and Current Perspectives in Social Theory. He served as editor of the Baylor Philosophy Journal and {{was a member of the}} Phi Sigma Tau National Honor Society of Philosophy.

5|$|By nightfall {{some of the}} {{remaining}} French ships had entered Donegal Bay with Canada, Melampus and Foudroyant still in pursuit. The two forces repeatedly passed {{one another in the}} dark, and Canada almost drove ashore. Back at the battle site, Warren had ordered Robust to tow Hoche into Lough Swilly—this order later came under <b>criticism,</b> <b>as</b> Robust was in a battered state herself and the storms of the previous week had not abated. When a gale struck the pair on 13 October, Hoche lost several masts and broke her tow, only being prevented from foundering by the combined efforts of the British prize crew and their French prisoners. Eventually, on 15 October, Doris appeared and took Hoche in tow, arriving in Lough Swilly without further incident a few days later. Meanwhile, Ethalion saw Bellone safely into port, and Magnanime and Amelia brought in Coquille and Embuscade respectively.|$|E
5|$|Cardus's {{approach}} to cricket writing was innovative, turning what {{had previously been}} largely a factual form into vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music <b>criticism</b> <b>as</b> his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by the older generation of critics, in particular Samuel Langford and Ernest Newman, but developed his own individual style of criticism—subjective, romantic and personal, {{in contrast to the}} objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus's opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal charm and gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir Donald Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Having been vocal in criticising Playford for sacrificing {{heritage}} to {{the march}} of development, Dunstan was prominent in protecting historic buildings from being bulldozed for high-rise office blocks. In 1972, the government intervened to purchase and thereby save Edmund Wright House on King William Street from being replaced with a skyscraper. In 1975, the Customs House at Semaphore was purchased to save it from demolition. His support of heritage preservation overlapped with his promotion of gourmet dining when his personal efforts helped to save the historic Ayers House on North Terrace, having it converted into a restaurant to avoid demolition. In contrast, there were also some controversial developments. Part of the rocky Hallett Cove on Gulf St Vincent in Adelaide's southern suburbs was developed for housing, as were vineyards in Morphettville, Tea Tree Gully, Modbury, and Reynella. This attracted <b>criticism,</b> <b>as</b> Dunstan was prominent in promoting South Australian viticulture and enotourism.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not believe}} a word of this stuff. His deep irrational love for England made him say these things....

But he wasn't going to accept foreign help in dissecting his mother....|$|R
25|$|The {{show was}} known for Olbermann's fast-paced rhetoric, {{historical}} and pop culture references, and liberal commentary. Olbermann melded news stories, both serious and light, with commentary, much of it critical of Republicans and conservative politics. The show has {{been the source of}} controversy due to these <b>criticisms,</b> <b>as</b> well as the host's ongoing commentary against Fox News and his feud with its leading primetime personality, Bill O'Reilly.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in normative frameworks for causal reasoning have inspired psychologists to model human causal inference using these normative frameworks. These models are, however, {{vulnerable to the}} same <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> connectionist and other probabilistic models. A proposed response to these criticisms {{is the notion of}} first-order causal rules, which are a simple generalization of dependencies in causal Bayes nets, adding universally quantified logical variables...|$|R
25|$|The cover art for Penguin UK's Modern Classics 50th Anniversary Edition of the book, {{published}} in September 2014, received <b>criticism</b> <b>as</b> being creepy, irrelevant, and age inappropriate.|$|E

50|$|The {{field of}} the medical tourism (referring to volunteers who travel {{overseas}} to deliver medical care) has recently attracted negative criticism {{when compared to the}} alternative notion of sustainable capacities, i.e., work done in the context of long-term, locally-run, and foreign-supported infrastructures. A preponderance of this criticism appears largely in scientific and peer-reviewed literature. Recently, media outlets with more general readerships have published such <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1991 interview, Newman {{described}} the <b>criticisms</b> <b>as</b> [...] "absurd" [...] {{and the product}} of jealousies on the left, and claimed {{that the majority of}} social therapy clients don't involve themselves in his political activities. In the Boston Globe in 1992, Fulani claimed [...] "the entire thing is a lie", and cited what she described as Political Research Associates ties to the Democratic Party.|$|R
