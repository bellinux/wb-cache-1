5|$|Janus and Epimetheus {{are called}} co-orbital moons. They are of roughly equal size, with Janus being {{slightly}} larger than Epimetheus. Janus and Epimetheus have orbits {{with only a few}} kilometers difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their gravitational interaction <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to swap orbits every four years.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} the Itcha Range is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Interior Plateau, casting a rain shadow over the Itcha Range.|$|E

5|$|Both Mulder and Joan follow Jeraldine to Hong Kong, where Mulder {{learns that}} she is a {{middleman}} selling government secrets. Mulder tracks down Jeraldine and handcuffs himself to her. Arriving at her office, Mulder finds Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) waiting inside, having been selling the contents of the digital tape. Krycek escapes through a window while Jeraldine is shot by a group of men coming down the hallway. Mulder unlocks the handcuffs and escapes. Meanwhile, Joan walks down the hall and encounters the men, creating a flash that <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> all to suffer from the radiation burns.|$|E
5|$|To {{termites}}, any {{breach of}} their tunnels or nests {{is a cause}} for alarm. When termites detect a potential breach, the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach. Additionally, an alarmed termite bumps into other termites which <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to be alarmed and to leave pheromone trails to the disturbed area, {{which is also a}} way to recruit extra workers.|$|E
5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E

While the Portuguese were attempting to unify the coast, the opposition from Arabs and the local people <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to fail.|$|R

5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|Adventure 2 has {{the health}} system found in many other Sonic games. The player {{collects}} rings scattered throughout the levels; being hit by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to drop them all, while being hit without rings <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar, which is slowly refilled by collecting rings. Dying with no lives results in a game over screen. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant them new abilities; for example, one allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of rings to reach distant platforms, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge attack powerfully enough to break certain containers. Chaos Drives {{can be used with}} the player's Chao (small, anthropomorphic animals).|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Saga duology's protagonists {{are silent}} Serph, {{leader of the}} Embryon and Sera, a woman who can commune with God. The other Embryon are the kind Argilla the hot-tempered Heat the light-hearted Cielo and the highly logical Gale. The main {{antagonist}} is Angel, who is Sera's intersexual biological parent. In Digital Devil Saga 2, two new main characters are introduced Roland, the alcoholic leader of the Lokapala resistance group and Madame Margot Cuvier, head of the Karma Society. All the main characters barring Cuvier become infected with the demon virus, a condition that <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to turn into demonic beings and lust after human flesh.|$|E

5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius torminosus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{and as such}} {{plays an}} important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees. It grows in association with birch (Betula) and hemlock (Tsuga) in mixed forests. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the red squirrel, and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding flies in the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families. Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by the mold Hypomyces lithuanicus, which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon-colored granular or velvety growth of mycelium on the surfaces of the gills and <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to be deformed.|$|E
5|$|Since clones cannot {{properly}} die, the Sakura and Syaoran clones are reconstructed by YÅ«ko, {{who wishes}} to compensate them for how their existences were used. She <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to be reborn as humans, who eventually meet and start living together. Sakura gives birth to the original Syaoran and they realize {{they are in their}} own past. They raise him until it is time for him to begin the events of the series, then they seal themselves in a glass tube in order to await the time when Fei-Wang will attempt to shatter reality. After breaking free from the tube, Sakura and Syaoran reverse Fei-Wang's damage to the dimension using the magic they inherited from the sorcerer Clow Reed during their reincarnation. They disappear after Fei-Wang is killed by Kurogane, leaving behind only a feather which the original Sakura and Syaoran absorb.|$|E

5|$|Swarming {{behaviour}} is {{a response}} to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.|$|E
5|$|The Scranton branch faces {{off against}} the {{corporate}} branch, commenting {{that they deserve}} to lose for deciding to close down Buffalo. The game is close, and Pam ends up injuring her ankle, although she wants to continue. Seeing an opportunity to remove Scranton's best player from the game, Charles insists that Pam take {{a seat on the}} grounds of her injury being a company liability. Determined to beat corporate, Jim takes Pam to a local hospital to get an X-ray while Dwight stalls the game to give them time to get back. When the doctor calls Jim into the room for an update, the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to be ecstatic, presumably that Pam is pregnant. Jim then calls Dwight to send in the substitute players.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Level Mountain is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Nahlin Plateau, casting a rain shadow over Level Mountain. Because the massif has a gently sloping and flat profile, it has subtle differences in climate, particularly at the low to upper-mid elevations. Hence a relatively homogeneous climate extends over Level Mountain, with only gradual temperatures and precipitation gradients occurring altitudinally. Therefore, large mammals do not have a wide diversity of local climates from which to choose.|$|E

5|$|The game offers three {{different}} skill levels. Level 1 is the easiest, as {{it uses a}} simplified room layout missing one of the castles {{and one of the}} mazes, and doesn't include the bat and one of the dragons. Level 2 is the full version of the game, with the various objects appearing in set positions {{at the start of the}} game. Level 3 is similar to Level 2, but the location of the objects is randomized to provide a more challenging game. In addition, the player can use the difficulty switches on the Atari 2600 to further control the game's difficulty by affecting the behavior of the dragons: one switch controls the dragons' bite speed, and one <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to flee when the player is wielding the sword.|$|E
5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to expand to their full extent.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{molecules}} attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation <b>causes</b> <b>them</b> to turn rancid. Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or sulfurous flavors, {{it is important}} to avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by smoking, salting or fermenting. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in aluminium foil or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation. Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and moisturizers to prevent rancidity.|$|E
