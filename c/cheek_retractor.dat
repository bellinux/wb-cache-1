40|$|Objective. This {{research}} used {{image analysis}} {{to evaluate the}} reproducibility of natural plaque accumulation and removal measured instrumentally. Background. High levels of plaque contribute to gingivitis that affects {{more than half of}} the U. S. adult population. Methods. After institutional review and informed consent, healthy adults were enrolled in a study to assess the between-visit consistency of plaque measurement for overnight and post-brush plaque. At Day 1, subjects with overnight (unbrushed) plaque swished with a fluorescein rinse and expectorated, <b>cheek</b> <b>retractors</b> were inserted, and a single digital image was collected under standardized lighting conditions. After routine hygiene with a regular anticavity dentifrice (CrestÂ® Cavity Protection) and standard manual toothbrush, disclosing and imaging were repeated. Approximately 1 -week later, the imaging-brushing-imaging sequence was repeated. Each digital image was analyzed blind to visit sequence to determine area (%) plaque coverage, and paired images were compared to assess between-visit correlation. Results. A total of 51 subjects had prebrush and postbrush plaque measurements at both visits, and all data were included in the analysis. Mean (SD) age was 37. 4 (15. 4) ranging from 18 - 71 years. Plaque coverage varied across visits, ranging from 2. 2 - 79. 2 % before brushing and 2. 5 - 42. 0 % after brushing. Both the prebrush (r= 0. 84) and postbrush (r= 0. 80) plaque areas were well-correlated. Conclusion. Use of image analysis demonstrates a high level of between-subject variability in natural plaque accumulation and removal, that is highly reproducible between-visits. Grants.

40|$|Characterizing the {{resistances}} to O 2 transport {{from the}} erythrocyte to the mitochondrion {{is important to}} understanding potential transport limitations. A mathematical model is developed to accurately determine the eects of erythrocyte spacing (hematocrit), velocity, and capillary radius on the mass transfer coe-cient. Parameters of the hamster <b>cheek</b> pouch <b>retractor</b> muscle {{are used in the}} calculations, since significant amounts of experimental physiological data and mathematical modeling are available for this muscle. Capillary hematocrit was found to have a large eect on the PO 2 distribution and the intracapillary mass transfer coecient per unit capillary area, kcap, increased by a factor of 3. 7 from the lowest (H 0 : 25) to the highest (H 0 : 55) capillary hematocrits considered. Erythrocyte velocity had a relatively minor eect, with only a 2. 7 % increase in the mass transfer coecient as the velocity was increased from 5 to 25 times the observed velocity in resting muscle. The capillary radius is varied by up to two standard deviations of the experimental measurements, resulting in variations in kcap that are < 15 % at the reference case. The mag-nitude of these changes increases with hematocrit. An equation to approximate the dependence of the mass transfer coecient on hematocrit is developed for use in simulations of O 2 transport from a capillar...|$|R
