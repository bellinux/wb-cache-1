In contrast with other theories {{of psychology and}} behavior, which assume that behavior {{is a function of}} perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT postulates that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions. In contrast with engineering control theory, the reference variable for each negative feedback control loop in a <b>control</b> <b>hierarchy</b> is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by an external agent changing the setpoint of the controller.

2500|$|A {{significant}} part of Haggard's ministry at New Life Church was based around an entrepreneurial leadership model, which is also covered in The Life-Giving Church. Haggard felt that young and upcoming leaders of the church would bog down in [...] "cumbersome systems" [...] in their churches and decide to take their talents elsewhere, resulting in the church losing its [...] "brightest and best future leaders". Rather than a top-down command and <b>control</b> <b>hierarchy</b> where Haggard made all the decisions and people fell in line, he instituted a free market concept that encouraged young leaders to debate the best ideas (even {{to the point of}} disagreeing with him) and pursue God-inspired dreams and visions in their own departments and beyond. In Haggard's book, Primary Purpose, he explains that the normal leadership style that governments and many corporations use is top down, while the servant leadership model he teaches is the opposite. In a visual representation, Haggard uses an upside down triangle to illustrate this concept. The leader is at the bottom and the people to be served are on top. This [...] "Philippians 2 Attitude" [...] comes from the scripture that states, [...] "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your interests, but also to the interests of others." [...] "I took a free-market approach to that and just wanted to empower people to minister whatever was in their hearts." [...] Some of the best-known results of this model are the Mill, the Desperation Band and Desperation interns, the Furnace and World Prayer Center, 24/7 leadership training and New Life Groups, a unique brand of free-market small groups as well as many others. As an example of his coaching of young leaders, John Bolin, in the book Confident Parents, Exceptional Teens that he co-wrote with Haggard, says [...] " [...] talked about communicating with people by improving my posture, poise, and delivery. He painstakingly coached me to stand up tall, to speak with confidence, to look people in the eye, and to articulate with concise clarity... he knew I wouldn't be effective... unless I understood the principle of communication and connection by presenting myself well".|$|E

40|$|Abstract – {{the goal}} of this work is to {{identify}} a framework for the integration of cyber command and control within the classical command and control infrastructure. The advent of cyber resources and military capabilities, as well as additional cyber information, requires that command and control infrastructures be updated to incorporate such cyber infrastructures. While much of these infrastructures will operate in isolation from the physical resources, there are needs for cross-over between the two disciplines. Such crossovers require far more flexibility than traditional command and <b>control</b> <b>hierarchies</b> allow. This paper discusses available cyber resources, typical goals of such resources, the reasoning behind such crossover activity, and a developed model for providing such a hierarchy...|$|R

50|$|Ultimately, the <b>control</b> <b>hierarchy</b> {{within the}} {{distribution}} center reflects the organizational structure of their human counterparts. The management staff (or the WMS) determines the workload {{to be accomplished}} for the day while the supervisory staff (WCS) oversees the real-time activities of the warehouse associates (equipment controllers) to complete the daily activities. Each warehouse associate is assigned a specific task based on their area of expertise (order selection - carousel/Pick To Light, transportation - conveyors, etc.). As each operator completes their individual assignment, the supervisor (WCS) assigns the next task based on the current workload. As orders are completed, the (WCS) supervisor reports back to (WMS) management {{the status of the}} orders along with any pertinent order information.|$|E
5000|$|This [...] "reorganization system" [...] is {{proposed}} {{to be part}} of the inherited structure of the organism.

They also had information about the running costs and availability of every power producing plant in England and Wales. They constantly anticipated demand, monitored and instructed power stations to increase, reduce or stop electricity production. They used what was known as the [...] "merit order", a ranking of each generator in power stations based upon how much they cost to produce electricity. The objective was to ensure that electricity production was achieved at the lowest possible cost.|$|E
50|$|William T. Powers (August 29, 1926 - May 24, 2013) was an {{independent}} scholar of experimental and theoretical psychology {{who developed the}} perceptual control theory (PCT) model of behavior as the control of perception. PCT demonstrates and explains how rather than controlling their behavioral outputs, living things vary their behavior as the means of controlling their sensory inputs (perceptions). Living control systems differ from those specified by Engineering control theory (a thermostat is a simple example), for which the reference value (setpoint) for control is specified outside the system by {{what is called the}} controller, whereas in living systems the reference variable for each control loop in a <b>control</b> <b>hierarchy</b> is generated within the system, usually as a function of error output from a higher-level system or systems. Powers and his students and colleagues in diverse fields have developed many demonstrations of negative feedback control, and computer models or simulations that replicate observed and measured behavior of living systems (human and animal, individuals and groups of individuals) with a very high degree of fidelity (0.95 or better), and corresponding control structures have been demonstrated neurophysiologically.|$|E
5000|$|Hierarchies of perceptual control {{have been}} {{simulated}} in computer models {{and have been}} shown to provide a close match to behavioral data. For example, Marken conducted an experiment comparing the behavior of a perceptual <b>control</b> <b>hierarchy</b> computer model with that of six healthy volunteers in three experiments. The participants were required to keep the distance between a left line and a centre line equal to that of the centre line and a right line. They were also instructed to keep both distances equal to 2 cm. They had 2 paddles in their hands, one controlling the left line and one controlling the middle line. To do this, they had to resist random disturbances applied to the positions of the lines. As the participants achieved control, they managed to nullify the expected effect of the disturbances by moving their paddles. The correlation between the behavior of subjects and the model in all the experiments approached [...]99. It is proposed that the organization of models of hierarchical control systems such as this informs us about the organization of the human subjects whose behavior it so closely reproduces.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of problem {{structure}} on the practical performance of optimal dynamic programming for decentralized decision problems. It is shown that restricting agent influence over problem dynamics can make the problem easier to solve. Experimental results establish that agent influence correlates with problem difficulty: as {{the gap between the}} influence of different agents grows, problems tend to become much easier to solve. The measure thus provides a general-purpose, automatic characterization of decentralized problems, identifying those for which optimal methods are more or less likely to work. Such a measure is also of possible use as a heuristic in the design of algorithms that create task decompositions and <b>control</b> <b>hierarchies</b> in order to simplify multiagent problems.
