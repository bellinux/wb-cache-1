50|$|Transfection of host cells (Haloarcula hispanica) by His2 DNA was {{demonstrated}} by Porter et al. (2008), who showed that infectious virus could be produced from viral DNA {{as long as}} the terminal proteins were not damaged by protease treatment. This is consistent with their likely role in DNA replication. It could then be shown that His2 DNA could transfect a wide variety of haloarchaeal species even though the cells were not susceptible to infection by His2 virus. In these experiments, transfected cells were plated along with cells of the host, Haloarcula hispanica, and virus produced by the transfectants was detected by infection of nearby cells of the susceptible host species. The experiments showed that the cytoplasms of many haloarchaea are able to replicate virus {{as long as the}} DNA (with terminal proteins) can enter.

Combining fluorescence microscopy, biochemical interaction studies and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we show that in live Yersinia enterocolitica bacteria these soluble proteins form complexes both at the injectisome and in the cytosol. Binding to the injectisome stabilizes these cytosolic complexes, whereas the free cytosolic complexes, which include the type III secretion ATPase, constitute a highly dynamic and adaptive network. The extracellular calcium concentration, which triggers activation of the T 3 SS, directly influences the cytosolic complexes, possibly through the essential component SctK/YscK, revealing a potential mechanism involved in the regulation of type III secretion...|$|R

50|$|Nonrandom X Inactivation {{leads to}} skewed X {{inactivation}}. Nonrandom X inactivation {{can be caused}} by chance or directed by genes. If the initial pool of cells in which X inactivation occurs is small, chance can cause skewing to occur in some individuals by causing a bigger proportion of the initial cell pool to inactivate one X chromosome. A reduction in the size of this initial cell pool would increase the likelihood of skewing occurring. This skewing can then be inherited by progeny cells, or increased by secondary selection. The X-chromosome controlling element (Xce) gene in mice has been found to influence genetically mediated skewing. It is unknown whether a similar gene plays a role in human X inactivation, although a 2008 study found that skewing in humans is mostly caused by secondary events rather than a genetic tendency.There is a much higher concordance rate in genetically identical (monozygotic) twins compared to non-identical (dizygotic) twins, which suggests a strong genetic input. A 10% difference in the skewing of genetically identical twins did exist however, so there are other contributing factors outside of genetics alone.It is difficult to identify primary nonrandom inactivation in humans, as early <b>cell</b> <b>selection</b> occurs in the embryo. Mutation and imprinting of the XIST gene, a part of the X inactivation centre, can result in skewing. This is rare in humans.|$|E

40|$|The Notch pathway plays a {{vital role}} in {{determining}} whether cells in the intestinal epithelium adopt a secretory or an absorptive phenotype. Cell fate specification is coordinated via Notch's interaction with the canonical Wnt pathway. Here, we propose a new mathematical model of the Notch and Wnt pathways, in which the Hes 1 promoter acts as a hub for pathway crosstalk. Computational simulations of the model can assist in understanding how healthy intestinal tissue is maintained, and predict the likely consequences of biochemical knockouts upon <b>cell</b> fate <b>selection</b> processes. Chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) is a powerful, generalised framework which assesses the capacity of our model for monostability or multistability, by analysing properties of the underlying network structure without recourse to specific parameter values or functional forms for reaction rates. CRNT highlights the role of beta-catenin in stabilising the Notch pathway and damping oscillations, demonstrating that Wnt-mediated actions on the Hes 1 promoter can induce dynamical transitions in the Notch system, from multistability to monostability. Time-dependent model simulations of cell pairs reveal the stabilising influence of Wnt upon the Notch pathway, in which beta-catenin- and Dsh-mediated action on the Hes 1 promoter are key in shaping the subcellular dynamics. Where Notch-mediated transcription of Hes 1 dominates, there is Notch oscillation and maintenance of fate flexibility; Wnt-mediated transcription of Hes 1 favours bistability akin to <b>cell</b> fate <b>selection.</b> <b>Cells</b> could therefore regulate the proportion of Wnt- and Notch-mediated control of the Hes 1 promoter to coordinate the timing of <b>cell</b> fate <b>selection</b> as they migrate through the intestinal epithelium and are subject to reduced Wnt stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Spare cells {{rewiring}} is {{a technique}} used to fix defects or deficiencies after the placement stage. It is traditionally done by manual work but becomes extremely hard nowadays. In this paper, we propose a spare <b>cells</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm consisting of two phases to optimize timing of the circuit by rewiring spare cells. In the first phase, we apply gate sizing and buffer insertion to all timing violated paths to fix timing violations. In the second phase we further fix timing violations by extracting timing critical parts and applies technology remapping to them. Experimental results based on five industrial benchmarks show that our algorithm can fix up to 99. 82 % of the total negative slack. The runtime is very short and linear to the gate count. The performance proves that our algorithm is efficient and effective. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{phenotype}} {{and development}} of T cells from transgenic mice expressing a T cell receptor with specificity for insulin presented by the MHC class Ib molecule Qa- 1 b was investigated. Peripheral T cells from the transgenic mice express CD 8 and, after activation, kill Qa- 1 b-positive lymphoid target cells {{in the presence of}} soluble insulin. Thymic selection requires expression of Qa- 1 b but not the dominant Qa- 1 -associated peptide, Qdm. In contrast to conventional T <b>cells,</b> <b>selection</b> is at least as efficient when the selecting ligand is expressed only on hematopoietic lineage cells as compared to expression on epithelial cells in the thymus.

Using this system we identified a set of stretch-responsive factors, which we referred to as TIPs (tension-induced/inhibited proteins). TIPs displayed signature motifs characteristic of nuclear receptor coregulators and chromatin remodeling enzymes. A genomic BLAST search suggested that the three TIPs identified were isoforms originated by alternative splicing from a single gene. Functional studies revealed that TIP- 1 and TIP- 3 {{were involved in the}} <b>cell’s</b> <b>selection</b> of the myogenic or the adipogenic pathway. TIP- 1, induced by stretch, promoted myogenesis, while TIP- 3, inhibited by stretch, stimulated adipogenesis.

This study, therefore, suggests a new developmental mechanism linking {{the presence or absence of}} tension with divergent differentiation pathways...|$|R
