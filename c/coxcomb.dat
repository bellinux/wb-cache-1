He {{appears to be}} {{the only one of the}} boy actors of 1600 to remain with the Blackfriars troupe when, in 1609, Philip Rosseter and Robert Keysar assumed control of the company. In this company, he {{performed}} in the theatre in Whitefriars and, frequently, at court, in plays such as Beaumont and Fletcher's The <b>Coxcomb.</b> From the latter years of this period come the first of his plays: A Woman is a Weathercock and The Honest Man's Fortune (the latter with Fletcher and Philip Massinger).|$|E
500|$|Also cockscomb (<b>coxcomb</b> {{and other}} sp. variants). A fleshy growth or crest {{on the top}} of the head of gallinaceous birds, such as turkeys, {{pheasants}} and domestic chickens. Its alternative name, cockscomb (or <b>coxcomb)</b> reflects that combs are generally larger on males than on females (a male gallinaceous bird is called a cock). Comb shape varies considerably depending on the breed or species of bird. The [...] "comb" [...] most often refers to chickens in which the most common shape is the [...] "single comb" [...] of a rooster from breeds such as the leghorn. Other common comb types are the [...] "rose comb" [...] of, e.g., the eponymous rosecomb; the [...] "pea comb" [...] of, e.g., the brahma and the araucana; and others.|$|E
500|$|At {{this time}} the London stage was in {{something}} of a slump after the glories of the early Restoration period. The King's and Duke's companies had merged into a monopoly, leaving actors in a weak negotiating position and much {{at the mercy of}} the dictatorial manager Christopher Rich. When the senior actors rebelled and established a cooperative company of their own in 1695, Cibber—"wisely", as the Biographical Dictionary of Actors puts it—stayed with the remnants of the old company, [...] "where the competition was less keen". After five years, he had still not seen significant success in his chosen profession, and there had been no heroic parts and no love scenes. However, the return of two-company rivalry created a sudden demand for new plays, and Cibber seized this opportunity to launch his career by writing a comedy with a big, flamboyant part for himself to play. He scored a double triumph: his comedy Love's Last Shift, or The Fool in Fashion (1696) was a great success, and his own uninhibited performance as the Frenchified fop Sir Novelty Fashion ("a <b>coxcomb</b> that loves to be the first in all foppery") delighted the audiences. His name was made, both as playwright and as comedian.|$|E

After his release from prison and the prosecutions over Fanny Hill, Cleland became a hired author. He attempted two more novels, Memoirs of a <b>Coxcomb</b> (1751), which contains a parody of Mary Wortley Montagu as [...] "Lady Bell Travers" [...] that was much discussed, and The Woman of Honour (1768), {{as well as a}} collection of romance tales in The Surprises of Love (1764).
