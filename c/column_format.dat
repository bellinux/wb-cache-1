500|$|The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (usually {{referred}} to as F) is a U.S. fantasy and science fiction magazine first published in 1949 by Fantasy House, a subsidiary of Lawrence Spivak's Mercury Press. [...] Editors Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas had approached Spivak in the mid-1940s about creating a fantasy companion to Spivak's existing mystery title, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. [...] The first issue was titled The Magazine of Fantasy, but the decision was quickly made to include science fiction as well as fantasy, and the title was changed correspondingly with the second issue. [...] F was quite different in presentation from the existing science fiction magazines of the day, {{most of which were}} in pulp format: it had no interior illustrations, no letter column, and text in a single <b>column</b> <b>format,</b> which in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley [...] "set F apart, giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine".|$|E

We use the variational approximation to show that columnar and point disorder have opposite effect on the position of the melting line as observed experimentally.

We will also extend our study to the more general Gauss-Bonnet braneworld with curvature correction terms on the brane and in the bulk, and derive the dynamical equation in a nonflat Universe.
