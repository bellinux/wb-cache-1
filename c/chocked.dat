40|$|S u m m a r y The paper {{presents}} a description and {{results of a}} flexibility study of a steel adjustable foundation <b>chock</b> (Vibracon ® SM). <b>Chocks</b> of this type are used in so-called rigid seatings (mountings) on foundations of heavy machinery and equipment, which require precise alignment and adjustment. They are an alternative to conventional (ordinary) metal <b>chocks</b> or new generation <b>chocks</b> – which are ready-cast with specifically for this purpose developed polymer composites. Experimental studies were conducted in laboratory conditions on an original new <b>chock.</b> The characteristics of deformation for this <b>chock</b> were determined in conditions close to the operation conditions of such <b>chocks.</b> The results show that in the investigated system there are significant deformations of a non-linear-elastic character. They allow one to better understand and explain many complex phenomena occurring in real structural connections with such type of <b>chocks.</b> They also constitute an experimental basis for appropriate modeling and analysis of strength and vibrations occurring in such systems...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{presented}} a new procedure of the seating of a combustion engines at the marine power plant with steel <b>chocks</b> cemented by a thixotropic polymer composition between the engine’s spot footing and the foundation ledge. A combustion engine is seated on foundation at the marine power plant by steel <b>chocks</b> or the <b>chocks</b> that are cast from polymer composition at the marine power plant. The arrangement, number and dimensions of foundation <b>chocks,</b> as well as arrangement, number and dimensions of the lateral and frontal stoppers that secure <b>chocks</b> work, are established by an engine manufacturer and are approved by Classification Society that supervises the vessel’s construction and operation. The author’s intention was to develop such <b>chocks</b> that combine the good resistance of steel <b>chocks</b> with the easiness of adjustment the bearing surfaces of polymer compositions <b>chocks.</b> Combination of these features was obtained for steel <b>chocks</b> which are glued by the relatively thin layers of polymer compositions between the engine spot footing and the foundation ledges. Such a method of making the <b>chocks</b> and seating with them the engines on foundation was claimed with the Patent RP No. 192120 on 24 th July 2000 for the Polish Naval Academy. In order to receive {{the approval of the}} Polish Register of Shipping to use new <b>chocks</b> at the marine power plants, the author carried out appropriate research, results of which are presented below.

60|$|Mark found Betts's {{deposit of}} decayed {{vegetable}} matter even {{larger and more}} accessible than he had hoped for. A hundred loads might be got without even using a wheelbarrow; and to all appearances there was enough of it to give a heavy dressing to many acres, possibly to the whole area of the crater. The first thing the young man did was to choose a suitable place, dig it well up, mixing a sufficiency of guano with it, agreeably to Betts's directions, and then to put {{in some of his}} asparagus roots. After this he scattered a quantity of the seed, raking the ground well after sowing. By the time this was done, Bob had both dingui and raft loaded, when they pulled the last back to the reef, towing the boat. In this manner our two mariners continued to work most of the time, for the next fortnight, making, daily, more or less trips to the 'loam-rock,' as they called the place where this precious deposit had been made; though they neglected none of their other necessary duties. As the distance was short, they could come and go many times in a day, transporting at each trip about as much of the loam as would make an ordinary American cart-load of manure. In the whole, by Mark's computation, they got across about fifty of these cargoes, {{in the course of their}} twelve days' work. The entire day, however, was on no occasion given up wholly to this pursuit. On the contrary, many little odd tasks wore completed, which were set by their necessities, or by fore thought and prudence. All the empty water-casks, for one thing, were rolled ashore, and filled at the largest pool; the frequency of the rains admonishing them of the wisdom of making a provision for the dry season. The Rancocus had a good deal of water still left in her, some of it being excellent Delaware river water, though she had filled up at Valparaiso, after passing the Horn. Mark counted the full casks, and allowing ten gallons a day for Bob and himself, a good deal more than could be wanted, there remained in the ship fresh water enough to last them two years. It is true, it was not such water as the palate often craved of a warm day; but they were accustomed to it, and it was sweet. By keeping it altogether between decks, the sun had no power on it, and it was even more palatable than might have been supposed. Mark occasionally longed for one good drink at some gushing spring that he remembered at home, it is true; and Bob was a little in the habit of extolling a particular well that, it would seem, his family were reputed to have used for several generations. Notwithstanding these little natural backslidings on this subject, our mariners might be thought well off on the score of water, having it in great abundance, and with no reasonable fear of ever losing it altogether. The casks taken ashore were filled for their preservation, as well as for convenience, an old sail being spread over them, after they were rolled together and <b>chocked.</b> As yet, no water was given to any of the stock, all the animals finding it in abundance, in the cavities of the lava.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of optimum <b>chock</b> (support) capacity is very crucial {{for a successful}} longwall mining. The {{selection of}} <b>chock</b> capacity depends on the site-specific geotechnical parameters, constraints and longwall panel geometry, which are generally not known in detail in priority. Hence, based {{on the field and}} laboratory data, various possible combinations should be analyzed to cater for the unforeseeable mining conditions. This paper discusses the use of numerical model for selecting an appropriate <b>chock</b> capacity based on the site-specific geological and geotechnical information and longwall panel geometry. The fracture mechanisms of immediate and main roofs are also discussed for various panel widths and support capacities. For the models considered, the <b>chock</b> convergence is predicted to increase by about 33 % due to the increase in face width from 100 to 260 m. Similarly, the massive roof strata are found to yield higher <b>chock</b> convergence compared to bedded strata...|$|R
