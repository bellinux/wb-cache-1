50|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>deepening</b> is a {{situation}} where the capital per worker is increasing in the economy. This is also referred to as increase in the capital intensity. <b>Capital</b> <b>deepening</b> is often measured by the rate of change in capital stock per labour hour. Overall, the economy will expand, and productivity per worker will increase. However, according to some economic models, such as the Solow model, economic expansion will not continue indefinitely through <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> alone. This is partly due to diminishing returns and wear & tear (depreciation). Investment is also required {{to increase the amount of}} capital available to each worker in the system and thus increase the ratio of capital to labour. In other economic models, for example, the AK model or some models in endogenous growth theory, <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> can lead to sustained economic growth even without technological progress. Traditionally, in development economics, <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> is seen as a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic development of a country.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{entrepreneurs}} {{transformed the}} economy from small, craft-organized factories located {{inside the city}} limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As <b>capital</b> <b>deepened</b> and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, {{the division of labor}} increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.|$|R

We characterize the optimal allocation of labor across the three activities. We prove that when technolgical shocks occur, equilibrium maintenance and adoption operate in opposite directions.

Whereas the dollar’s decline may be benign as in the 1980 s, we argue that the current conjuncture more closely parallels the early 1970 s, when the Bretton Woods system collapsed. Finally, we use our model to dispel some common misconceptions about what kinds of shifts are needed to help close the US current account imbalance. For example, faster growth abroad helps only if it is relatively concentrated in nontradable goods; faster productivity growth in foreign tradable goods will actually exacerbate the US adjustment problem. external imbalance; net foreign assets; real exchange rate; sustainability; US current account deficit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates, {{theoretically}} and empirically, {{the impact}} of financial (FL) and trade liberalisation (TL) on the rate of economic growth in Bangladesh using annual data from 1975 - 1995. This thesis also explores the determinants of unofficial market (UM) exchange rates in Bangladesh using quarterly data from 1976 q 2 - 1995 q 2. The literature survey in chapter two argues that both FL and TL raise the rate of economic growth. After reviewing financial and trade policies in Bangladesh in chapter three, a theoretical model has been developed and applied to Bangladesh in chapter four {{in order to examine}} the effect of FL on the rate of economic growth. This model incorporates per capita real income, investment in both physical and human <b>capital,</b> financial <b>deepening</b> and real interest rates. The theoretical and empirical models reveal that investment in human <b>capital,</b> financial <b>deepening</b> and interest rate liberalisation positively affect the rate of economic growth. However, {{the impact of}} interest rates is very low. The simultaneous impact of financial development and TL on the rate of economic growth in Bangladesh is also explored theoretically and empirically in chapter six. Results reveal that both FL and TL jointly raise the rate of economic growth. Finally, the determinants of UM exchange rates are identified in chapter eight in order to examine the causes of distortions in the foreign exchange markets and to explore the roles of both FL and TL policies in removing these distortions. It is observed that trade restrictions with overvalued exchange rates and an increase in money supply generate UMs for foreign exchange in Bangladesh...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{inquires}} {{into the}} efficiency of financial development policies in economies where the financial sector is based on oligopolistic commercial banking. In this case, interest rates on deposits may be set below the level required to achieve balance of payments equilibrium, so that banks are able to exact a risk free financial margin in their holdings of government bonds. Under such circumstances, banks lack incentives to place indirect debt in domestic security markets, {{as a means of}} providing long-term finance; and private <b>capital</b> market <b>deepening</b> is hindered.
