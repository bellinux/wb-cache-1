Paul is in the list and joke about his many wives stating: [...] "How many of Paul's five wives <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>name?</b> No points for current wife Rebecca, ten for naming Lynn, Gail, or Christina Alessi, and 1,400 points for remembering first wife, plumber Terry [...] Yes, Paul's been around the block." [...] They also branded him as the reason Neighbours, in their opinion was good viewing in the 2000s adding: [...] "It's his cackling soap villain role that we love to hate him for: his return in 2004, torching Lassiter's and befriending Dylan, marked the start of Neighbours getting awesome in the mid-noughties. Although it's probably {{safe to say that}} period was over by the time he suffered amnesia of everything after 1989." [...] He has also been branded as a [...] "legend character". Entertainment reporting website Last Broadcast praised Paul's development, stating: [...] "As the kind of shady character who'd do anything to make a fast buck, he even planned to bulldoze Ramsay Street {{to make way for a}} new supermarket development. And that's not all: fraud, blackmail, murder; there is no level to which Paul wouldn't have sunk. Yet, the infamous bad boy of Erinsborough, has, thankfully, turned over a new leaf." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this short}} note, we {{demonstrate}} how evolving technological tools can {{allow us to}} enhance our learning horizon (wherever learners ’ levels are) in mathematics. We will use examples to show Dynamic Geometry (DG) and its animation and numerical approximations can make mathematics accessible to more learners. In the meantime, problems can be made challenging when learners attempt to generalize the result by using a Computer Algebra System (CAS). Finally, we show some results valid in two dimensions can be extended to three dimensional ones too. 1. Mathematics contents can be made accessible and challenging The parametric graph of a curve is an important concept when learners expand {{their knowledge of the}} graph of a function. The example below is to ask when a circle is drawn, what could we get out of the parametric equations. Example 1. A circle is drawn (arbitrarily) using a Dynamic Geometry System, which we use ClassPad (see [1]) for demonstration. Then pick a point P=(x(t),y(t)) on the circle, where t is ranging from 0 to 2 π. What are the graphs of (t, x(t)) and (t, y(t)) respectively. We start with the following circle, which has center C = [- 1. 35,- 0. 225] and radius r= 1. 179248. Figure 1. We pick a point P=(x,y) and let it animate once on the circle and obtained the following screen shots: Figures 2 - 7. In the mean time, we collect the (t,x(t)) and (t,y(t)) respectively and we show the partial list as follows: Figure 8 [...] Finally, we drag the columns ‘Direction ’ (which is the angle t) and x back to the Figure 1, we see the following curve in addition to the circle. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>name</b> that curve? Figure 9. Similarly, we drag the columns ‘Direction ’ (which is the angle t) and y back to the Figure 1, we see the following curve in addition to the circle. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>name</b> that curve? Figure 10. Readers can link to a video clip which demonstrates the processes above (see [2]). The above exercise is to motivate students to explore the parametric equation of the form [x(t),y(t) ]=[a+r*cos(t),b+r*sin(t) ], where (a,b) is the center of the circle of radius r. Experienced learners know the above parametric equation represent a circle. However, when we pose the question reversely, the problem becomes more interesting...|$|E
40|$|Powerful {{methods for}} {{analyzing}} the travel of ideas {{are essential for}} understanding {{the process of learning}} classroom communities. In this chapter, we argue that a genetic perspective provides a useful methodological frame. We describe specific empirical techniques {{for the study of the}} travel of ideas, and illustrate our approach with findings from recent investigations of lessons on integers and fractions for fifth grade. We begin with a summary description of a classroom exchange in a classroom that supports inquiry-oriented mathematics instruction: Students in Ms. Jones’s classroom begin their math lesson by working on the problem: How many equivalent fractions <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>name</b> for Point A on the number line? After a brief class discussion of the range of answers, Ms. Jones sends students to small groups to explain their thinking and try to reach consensus on one solution. In one group, students argue about different ways of re-partitioning the number line to generate names of equivalent fractions. In another group, students share ways of multiplying the fraction by one (2 / 2, 3 / 3, etc.) to generate equivalent fractions. As Ms. Jones observes groups at work, she notices that some students ar...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{report that}} {{increasing the number}} of reasons people are asked to think of in support of some advocacy leads to less favorable judgments of the object being advocated. These judgments are thought to be process-based in that evaluations depend on the perceived ease with which reasons come to mind rather than substantive information related to the target object (i. e., content-based). The present research demonstrates the robustness of this interpretation by showing that judgment is moderated by factors thought to affect the perceived ease of processing decision relevant information other than the number of reasons people are asked to consider. The research also explores when judgments are likely to be process-based or content-based, and it examines the nature of respondents ’ thoughts attendant to each of these judgments.
