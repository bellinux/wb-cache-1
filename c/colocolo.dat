5|$|More {{than ten}} species of mammals have been {{observed}} in the park, several of them endangered, including the <b>colocolo,</b> the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the hog-nosed skunk and the Andean fox.|$|E

25|$|Among the mammals {{native to}} the region is the culpeo or Andean fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus)-in the region, is called red fox-, which {{is in danger of}} extinction. They share this region with 30 other species of mammals, {{including}} the puma (Felis concolor), classified as vulnerable; the <b>colocolo</b> (Oncifelis colocolo); the ferret (Mustela furax); and Geoffroy's cat (Oncifelis geoffroyi).|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>colocolo's</b> hunting and {{breeding}} habits. It is thought to prey mainly on small mammals and birds. Guinea pigs are thought to form a large part of its diet, along with viscachas and other rodents, and tinamous. Though some have suggested it is chiefly nocturnal, others suggest it is mainly diurnal.|$|R
500|$|The park {{is home to}} mammal species facing risk of {{extinction}} such as the neotropical otter, the mountain tapir, the spectacled bear, the mountain paca, the giant anteater, and a species of [...] wild cat (Leopardus <b>colocolo).</b> Bird species like the oilbird, the golden-headed quetzal, and the Andean cock-of-the-rock are also live within the park. A species of catfish (Astroblepus rosei) {{can be seen in}} the underground streams of the caves inside the park.|$|E
50|$|When the Pantanal and Pampas {{cats are}} treated as a {{separate}} species, the <b>colocolo</b> has two subspecies: L. c. <b>colocolo</b> and L. c. wolffsohni.|$|E
50|$|The <b>colocolo</b> (Leopardus <b>colocolo)</b> {{is a small}} spotted {{and striped}} cat native to the west Andean slope in central and {{northern}} Chile. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|As {{traditionally}} defined, the <b>colocolo</b> {{occurs in}} the widest range of habitats of any small South American felid. This, combined with distinct differences in pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements, {{was the basis for}} splitting the Pantanal cat and Pampas cat from the <b>colocolo.</b> Based on genetic divergence, the splits within the <b>colocolo</b> group are estimated to have occurred about 1.7 million years ago (Mya). This divergence was lower than that found within Geoffroy's cat (about 2 Mya) or the oncilla (about 3.7 Mya; this very high divergence -far higher than other species in the genus- has resulted in some suggesting more than one species is involved in the oncilla). Furthermore, the distribution pattern within the <b>colocolo</b> group based on genetics did not completely match that based on pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements, and supported some of the traditional subspecific division rather than species division. While the population in northern Chile has been placed in L. <b>colocolo</b> based on cranial measurements, genetics associate it with Pampas cats from Bolivia, and while the population in western Argentina has been placed in the Pampas cat based on pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements, genetics associate it with the <b>colocolo.</b> More recent genetic analysis also supports maintaining the Pantanal and Pampas cats as subspecies of the <b>colocolo.</b>|$|E
50|$|Endangered and {{threatened}} species include the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax flavicauda), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis), <b>colocolo</b> (Oncifelis <b>colocolo),</b> Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruviana) and cinchona (Cinchona sp.).|$|E
50|$|Juan Ignacio Molina follows Ercilla's {{account of}} <b>Colocolo</b> as the wise elder, in his The Geographical, Natural and Civil History of Chili, Vol. II, (1808). He claims <b>Colocolo</b> {{was killed in}} the 1558 Battle of Quiapo.|$|E
5000|$|The IUCN {{has only}} rated the [...] "combined" [...] species (including Pantanal and Pampas cats), {{in which case}} the <b>colocolo</b> is {{considered}} Near Threatened. Whether the <b>colocolo</b> will receive a higher rating if the Pantanal and Pampas cats are treated as separate species is unclear, but it may be Endangered, and its range is smaller than that of the kodkod, rated as Vulnerable by the IUCN. However, unlike the kodkod, the <b>colocolo</b> is not associated with the highly threatened temperate rainforests found in the region.|$|E

50|$|Externally, the <b>colocolo</b> {{differs from}} the Pantanal cat in its larger size, and pelage colour and pattern. Some Pampas cats are {{as large as the}} <b>colocolo,</b> and some {{subspecies}} of the Pampas cats have the same pelage colour and pattern as colocolos of the subspecies L. c. wolffsohni.|$|E

5000|$|Pampas cat (Leopardus <b>colocolo).</b> Most {{authorities}} recognise the Pampas cat as {{a single}} species, although some authorities recognise three species as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|It is preyed {{on by the}} Andean {{mountain}} cat (Leopardus jacobitus), the <b>colocolo</b> (Leopardus <b>colocolo),</b> and the culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) in high-altitude desert regions. The northern viscacha is more often found on larger, steeper portions of cliffs. This preference is probably driven by a need to avoid predators, as land-based carnivores are more easily evaded on a steep slope. It rarely ventures far from rocks, as these provide a means of escaping from both aerial and terrestrial predators.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 120 bird {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in the reserve.Leopardus <b>colocolo,</b> Galictis cuja, Conepatus chinga, Lycalopex culpaeus and Lycalopex griseus are mammal species {{that can be found}} here.|$|E
5000|$|Some mammals {{native to}} the reserve are: the llama, the alpaca, the vicuña, the guanaco, the taruca, the vizcacha, the puma, the Andean {{mountain}} cat, the <b>colocolo</b> and the Andean fox.|$|E
5000|$|The Colo Colo or <b>Colocolo</b> is an evil rat-like {{creature}} from Mapuche mythology. The marsupial monito {{del monte}} {{is sometimes called}} [...] "colocolo" [...] due to its similarity with the mythical beast.|$|E
50|$|The <b>colocolo</b> ranges {{throughout}} most of Argentina and Uruguay into the chaco and cerrado of Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil, and north through the Andes mountain chain through Ecuador and possibly marginally into southwestern Colombia.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most other}} small cats, the <b>colocolo</b> was {{formerly}} {{included in the}} genus Felis, but together with Geoffroy's cat and the kodkod, some have placed it in Oncifelisinstead. Today, all major authorities place it in Leopardus.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} some {{revision}} of this branch of Felidae in recent years. Leopardus was previously regarded as a subgenus of the genus Felis. The Pantanal and Pampas cats were previously considered subspecies of the <b>colocolo.</b>|$|E
50|$|There was a {{proposal}} to divide Pampas cat into three distinct species, based primarily on differences in pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements. Accordingly, three species were recognised in the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World: the <b>colocolo</b> (L. <b>colocolo),</b> the Pantanal cat (L. braccatus), and the Pampas cat (L. pajeros) with a more restricted definition. This split at species level was not supported by subsequent genetic work, although some geographical substructure was recognised, and some authorities continued to recognise the Pampas cat as a single species.In the recent revision of felid taxonomy by the Cat Specialist Group the Pampas cat is recognised as a single species with seven subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Among the mammals {{reported}} {{from the same}} area are: the <b>colocolo,</b> the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the hog-nosed skunk and the Andean fox.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>colocolo</b> is a small, but heavy-set cat, only 56 to 67 cm in body length, {{with a short}} 29 to 32 cm tail, and {{weighing}} around 3 kg on average. The two subspecies differ in their pelage colour and pattern: ...|$|E
5000|$|Pedro Mariño de Lobera listed <b>Colocolo</b> {{as one of}} the caciques {{that offered}} {{submission}} to Pedro de Valdivia after the Battle of Penco. [...] Jerónimo de Vivar in his Chronicle of the Kingdom of Chile (1558), describes <b>Colocolo</b> {{as one of the}} Mapuche leaders with 6,000 warriors and one of the competitors for Toqui of the whole Mapuche army following the Battle of Tucapel. Millarapue also a leader of 6,000 men, but old and not a candidate for the leadership, was the one who persuaded them to quit arguing among themselves and settle the matter with a contest of strength between them which resulted in the victory of Caupolicán who became Toqui.|$|E
50|$|The Pampas cat (Leopardus colocola), {{also known}} as the <b>colocolo</b> or Pantanal cat over parts of its range, is a small wild cat native to South America. It is named after the Pampas, but occurs in grassland, shrubland, and dry forest at {{elevations}} up to 5000 m.|$|E
50|$|More {{than ten}} species of mammals have been {{observed}} in the park, several of them endangered, including the <b>colocolo,</b> the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the hog-nosed skunk and the Andean fox.|$|E
50|$|The kodkod was {{formerly}} considered {{a member of}} the genus Oncifelis, which consisted of three small feline species native to South America. All of these species have been moved into the genus Leopardus. Along with the kodkod, the former members of Oncifelis were the <b>colocolo</b> and Geoffroy's cat.|$|E
50|$|The {{badge of}} the club {{represents}} the Mapuche chieftain <b>Colocolo</b> (recognized in its stadium's hall), who led the Arauco War against the Spanish empire in 1560s. On 19 April 1925, when the club was established, Luis Contreras — {{one of the players}} that founded the club alongside Arellano — defined the team's badge, in representation of the chief and the country's indigenous people. However, the legend of <b>Colocolo</b> says that he was Palín champion, sport practiced by the Mapuches on both sides competing for win a thick ball of cloth. But the existence of this Araucan figure has been questioned, such as said Diego Barros Arana in its monumental text called Historia General de Chile. Contrary to this, writer Jerónimo de Vivar in one of its works, confirms their existence.|$|E
