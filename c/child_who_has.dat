5|$|Undertale is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} created by American indie developer and composer Toby Fox. In the game, players control a human <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> {{fallen into the}} Underground, a large, secluded region underneath {{the surface of the}} Earth, separated by a magic barrier. The player meets various monsters during a quest to return to the surface, mainly through the combat system; the player navigates through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent, and can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of murdering them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Like other Pokémon games, Ruby and Sapphires {{gameplay}} is linear; {{the main}} events {{occur in a}} fixed order. The protagonist of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire is a <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> recently moved to a small town called Littleroot Town. At {{the beginning of the}} games, the player chooses either Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to protect Professor Birch, the regional Professor, from an attacking wild Pokémon. After defending the Professor, the player is taken to his lab and receives the chosen Pokémon as his or her starter Pokémon. His or her friend, the protagonist's rival, is also a Pokémon Trainer and occasionally battles the player. The games' two main goals are defeating the eight Gym Leaders, proving oneself worthy of challenging the Elite Four and Champion to become the new Champion and completing the Pokédex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 202 Pokémon (It is possible to obtain all 386 Pokémon, but this requires trading with Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{gives an}} insight in the consisentcy between <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been {{witnessing}} {{domestic violence and}} <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been maltreated in an other way. Analyses had been done based on data provided by the Tweede Nederlandse Prevalentiestudie naar Mishandeling van Kinderen en Jeugdigen (NPM- 2010). It appeared that more then half of the <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> witnessed domestic violence suffered from {{at least one other}} form of maltreatment. No differences were found in the nine characteristics that had been tested in their distributions for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> witnessed domestic violence compared with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> maltreated in another form. With this study is confirmed that witnessing domestic violence does not significantly deviates from other maltreatmentforms...|$|R

40|$|REVIEW QUESTION / OBJECTIVE The {{objective}} of this review is to identify and synthesize the best international qualitative evidence on healthcare users’ experiences of communication with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions. For {{the purposes of this}} review, “healthcare users” will be taken to include <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions and their families. The question to be addressed is: - What are healthcare users’ experiences of communicating with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions? INCLUSION CRITERIA - Types of participants: This review will consider all qualitative studies that focus on users of healthcare services for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions. These users are anticipated to include <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a life-limiting condition and their family members. In instances where children are not under the legal care of one or both parents, service users may also include other types of legal guardians. - Phenomena of interest: This review will consider experiences of communicating with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions. - Context: This review will consider studies relating to communication with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a life-limiting condition, irrespective of whether the healthcare service is based in a hospital, hospice, or community setting. There is no restriction on the country in which a study was conducted...|$|R

25|$|Piaget {{recognized}} that psychometric tests had its limitations, as {{children were not}} able to provide the researcher with their deepest thoughts and inner intellect. It was also difficult to know if the results of child examination reflected what children believed or if it is just a pretend situation.

25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} rehydrating {{a severely}} undernourished <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> diarrhea relatively slowly. The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called oral rehydration solution (ORS). The oral rehydration solution is both slightly sweet and slightly salty {{and the one}} recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium. Fluids by nasogastric tube may be use in {{those who do not}} drink. Intravenous fluids are recommended only in those who have significant dehydration due to their potential complications. These complications include congestive heart failure. Over time, ORS developed into ORT, or oral rehydration therapy, which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.|$|E

25|$|The Gyptians form an {{expedition}} to the Arctic with Lyra to rescue the children. Lyra recruits Iorek Byrnison, an armoured bear, and his human aeronaut friend, Lee Scoresby. She also learns that Lord Asriel has been exiled, guarded by the bears on Svalbard. Near Bolvangar, the Gobbler research station, Lyra discovers an abandoned <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been cut from his dæmon; the Gobblers are experimenting on children by severing the bond between human and dæmon. Lyra is captured and taken to Bolvangar, where she is reunited with Roger. Coulter tells Lyra that the intercision prevents the onset of troubling adult emotions. Lyra and the children are rescued by Scoresby, Iorek, the Gyptians, and Serafina Pekkala's flying witch clan. Lyra falls out of Scoresby's balloon and is taken by the panserbjørne to the castle of their usurping king, Iofur Raknison. She tricks Iofur into fighting Iorek, who arrives with the others to rescue Lyra. Iorek kills Iofur and takes his place as the rightful king.|$|E

A new volume began {{as part of}} the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, written by Charles Soule with art by Ron Garney with the first two issues {{released}} in December 2015. In this series, Matt returns to New York, where he now works as an Assistant District Attorney. He will have a redesigned costume and a new apprentice in Samuel Chung, an illegal immigrant who has been living in New York's Chinatown since he was a <b>child,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> taken up the codename Blindspot. When the Purple Children acquired a machine designed by their father to enhance his powers, after Matt had saved them from a mob, they used the machine to erase the world's knowledge of Matt's identity as Daredevil, Matt only allowing Foggy to know his secret identity afterwards, enabling him to be re-instated as a New York Attorney. Using his restored secret identity, Murdock is {{able to take advantage of}} a subsequent court case to establish a precedent for superheroes testifying in court without the need to expose their secret identities. Despite interference from the Kingpin, Murdock succeeds in the Supreme Court, and afterwards returns to his traditional red costume.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the use of Developmental Transformations (DvT) with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{suffered}} from physical abuse. Certain mindfulness practices, such as being present and attending to the sensations experienced within that moment, seem to be embedded within various DvT interventions and techniques. Nevertheless, mindfulness-based treatments do not include the concept of ‘play’, which is a key feature of DvT and can be very useful when working with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been physically abused. Play can help children explore personal material which may otherwise be difficult to discuss.

500|$|The {{political}} turmoil continued. John began to explore {{an alliance with}} the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued {{that he had been}} wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went to Paris, where he formed an alliance with Philip. He agreed to set aside his wife, Isabella of Gloucester, and marry Philip's sister, Alys, in exchange for Philip's support. Fighting broke out in England between forces loyal to Richard and those being gathered by John. John's military position was weak and he agreed to a truce; in early 1194 the king finally returned to England, and John's remaining forces surrendered. John retreated to Normandy, where Richard finally found him later that year. Richard declared that his younger brother – despite being 27 years old – was merely [...] "a <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> had evil counsellors" [...] and forgave him, but removed his lands with the exception of Ireland.|$|E

Methods: We used a questionnaire method for the parents of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> attended 'baby swimming' and for instructors Swimming Training. Results: It was proved that <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> attended 'baby swimming' were noticeably more successful in elementary swimming skills compared with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not attended baby swimming. However, the differences in mastering the basic swimming skills were only slightly better in the group of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> done baby swimming. Adaptation to water surroundings progressed in the same way for both groups of <b>children.</b> Nevertheless, <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> attended 'baby swimming' looked more confident in general.
