40|$|The {{prevalent}} use of <b>chloroacetanilide</b> <b>herbicides</b> {{has resulted}} in contamination of some ground and surface waters in the U. S. When natural attenuation is not sufficient, remediation may be required. Dithionite is a strong chemical reductant with potential use for remediating contaminated water, sediment, and soil. Used alone, dithionite rapidly dechlorinated <b>chloroacetanilide</b> <b>herbicides</b> in water. Treating aquifer sediment with dithionite reduces native Fe III, creating a redox barrier of FeII-bearing minerals and surface-bound FeII. Exposing alachlor to dithionite-reduced aquifer sediment in citrate-bicarbonate (C-B) buffer produced the thiosufate derivative of alachlor as the major product. Washing the reduced sediment (in C-B buffer) removed FeII and excess dithionite and no alachlor transformation was observed. Exposing alachlor to reduced sediment in K 2 CO 3 buffer produced dechlorinated alachlor as the major product. Dechlorination also occurred when washed, reduced sediment (in C-B buffer) was amended with FeII (pH = 8. 5) and continued as long as additional FeII was provided. Along with pesticide contamination, soil and water contaminated with munitions is also a serious problem. Major high explosive contaminants include RDX, HMX, and TNT. The transformation rates of all three explosives were a function of pH and they were rapidly degraded by buffered, reduced sediment. RDX transformation increased {{with the amount of}} reduced sediment or dithionite concentration. Exposing RDX to reduced, washed sediment (in C-B buffer) slowed transformation but the rate was increased by adding FeII. Permeable reactive barriers of zerovalent iron and dithionite-reduced sediment leave behind dissolved, structural, and adsorbed FeII. Aqueous FeII and its associated mineral precipitates degraded RDX, HMX, and TNT. Reaction rates increased with increasing FeII concentration and RDX degradation was greatest at pH 3 ̆e 6. 85. This pH is readily obtainable in aquifers. After adding FeII to alkaline aquifer sediment, RDX was degraded without adjusting pH. Considering that iron corrosion increases the pH of the surrounding pore water to 3 ̆e 9 and oxidation of FeII produces significant quantities of FeIII, the effect of FeIII on RDX transformation at alkaline pH was investigated. RDX was hydrolyzed at pH 10 under anaerobic conditions and was enhanced significantly when Fe III was present. The results of this research demonstrate that dithionite is a remediation option in natural environments where iron-bearing minerals are abundant and illustrate the important role of FeII and its freshly precipitated minerals in the degradation of contaminants. ...|$|E

All the transgenic Basmas lines showed significantly higher shoot and root elongation at 7. 5 mg/L alachlor, with line BAGST- 3 exhibiting the greatest tolerance. However, at 15 mg/L alachlor, growth was highly reduced in transgenic and wt plants. In Burley, only line BUGST- 2 has statistically significant greater mean of root and shoot length compared to wt under the two doses.

Results showed that propachlor underwent rapid dechlorination {{in the presence of}} dithionite. The reaction was of second-order kinetics and strongly influenced by pH and temperature. At pH 7. 0 and temperature 308 K, the rate constant of propachlor dechlorination was estimated at 123. 4 ± 0. 7 M - 1 h - 1. Within the pH range tested (3. 0 - 9. 5), higher pH promoted the ionization of dithionite, resulting in a more active nucleophilic reagent of S 2 O 42 - to enhance the propachlor transformation rate. Similarly, higher reaction temperature overcame the activation barrier of steric hindrance in propachlor structure and accelerated the excitation of dithionite, in which higher rate constants of propachlor reductive dechlorination were obtained.

40|$|A {{solid-phase}} microextraction (SPME) {{method has}} been developed for the determination of 3 <b>chloroacetanilide</b> <b>herbicides</b> in both fresh and seawater samples. The extracted sample was analyzed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS), and parameters affecting SPME operation including fibre type, sample pH, sample temperature, mixing speed and extraction time have been evaluated and optimized. The amount of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the salt content both affected SPME extraction efficiency, but {{the presence of other}} competitive extractants such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the matrix showed no insignificance interference. The limit of detection (LOD) for acetochlor, metolachlor and butachlor were 1. 2, 1. 6 and 2. 7 ng L- 1, respectively. The recoveries for the herbicides ranged from 79 to 102 %, and the linear dynamic range was from 10 to 1000 ng L- 1. The developed method has been used to monitor herbicides contaminations in coastal water samples collected around Laizhou bay and Jiaozhou bay in Shandong peninsula, China. The concentrations of acetochlor and metolachlor ranged from undetectable to 78. 5 ng L- 1 and undetectable to 35. 6 ng L- 1, respectively. Butachlor was not observed but in only one sample and the concentration is lower than the limit of quantification (LOQ). The concentrations of the three herbicides in this study are low compared to most of the other places reported. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In this work, the putative tolerance of transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing CsGSTU genes towards the <b>chloroacetanilide</b> <b>herbicide</b> alachlor was investigated. Our {{results show that the}} treatment with 0. 0075 mg cm- 3 of alachlor strongly affects the growth of both wild type and transformed tobacco seedlings with the sole exception of the transgenic lines overexpressing CsGSTU 2 isoform that are barely influenced by herbicide treatment. In order to correlate the in planta studies with enzyme properties, recombinant CsGSTs were in vitro expressed and tested for GST activity using alachlor as substrate. The recombinant GSTU 2 enzyme was twice more active than GSTU 1 in conjugating alachlor to GSH thus indicating that CsGSTU 2 might {{play a crucial role in}} the plant defense against the herbicide. Moreover, as a consequence of the infiltration with a bacterial suspension of the P. syringae pv. tabaci, transgenic tobacco plants but not wild type plants bestowed the capability to limit toxic metabolite diffusion through plant tissues as indicated by the absence of chlorotic halos formation. Consequently, the transgenic tobacco plants described in the present study might be utilized for phytoremediation of residual xenobiotics in the environment and might represent a model for engineering plants that resist to pathogen attack...|$|R
40|$|Herbicides are an {{invaluable}} tool for agricultural production scaling up. However, their continuous and intensive use {{has led to}} an increased incidence of herbicide resistant weeds and environmental pollution. Plant glutathione transferases (GSTs) are tightly connected with crop and weed herbicide tolerance capacitating their efficient metabolic detoxification, thus GSTs can be biotechnologically exploited towards addressing those issues. However, information on their effects at a “systems” level in response to herbicides is lacking. Here, we aimed to study the effects of the <b>chloroacetanilide</b> <b>herbicide</b> alachlor on the metabolome of wild-type and tobacco plants overexpressing the soybean tau class glutathione transferase GmGSTU 4. Alachlor-treated wild-type plants This system, naturally serving the detoxification of endogenous exhibited an abiotic stress-like response with increased abundance of compatible solutes, decrease in TCA cycle intermediates and decreased sugar and amino acid content. Transgenic plants responded distinctly, exhibiting an increased induction of abiotic stress responsive metabolites, accumulation of secondary metabolites and its precursors, and metabolic detoxification by-products compared to wild-type plants. These results suggest that the increased metabolic capacity of GmGSTU 4 overexpressing plants is accompanied by pleiotropic metabolic alterations, which could be the target for further manipulation in order to develop herbicide resistant crops, plants with increased phytoremediation potential, as well as efficient management of non-target site, GST induced, herbicide resistance in weeds. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDespite the {{implication}} of anaerobic soil communities in important functions related to C and N biogeochemical cycles, their responses to pesticides are rarely assessed. This study focused {{on the impact of}} alachlor, a <b>chloroacetanilide</b> <b>herbicide,</b> on two agricultural soils differing in their land use (fallow and corn-cultivated) in order to investigate the potential adaptation of anaerobic or facultative anaerobic soil microorganisms from fields with long history of herbicide use. The experiment was performed by developing slurries in anoxic conditions over 47 days. Changes in the community structure assessed through terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16 S rRNA genes clearly showed a shift in the bacterial community of the cultivated soil, whereas the modification of the microbial community of the fallow soil was delayed. In addition, the analysis of alachlor degradation capacities of the two anaerobic communities indicated that 99 % of alachlor was removed in anoxic slurries of cultivated soil. Both these results suggested the preexistence of microorganisms in the cultivated soil able to respond promptly to the pesticide exposure. The composition of the anaerobic active community determined by 16 S rRNA transcript analysis was mainly composed of strictly anaerobic Clostridia and the facultative anaerobe Bacilli classes. Some genera, described for their role in herbicide biodegradation were active in alachlor-treated slurries, whereas others were no longer detected. Finally, this study highlights, when triggered, the important diversity of the anaerobic community in soil. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|By {{characterization}} of the uptake of glutathione-S-conjugates, principally dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (DNP-GS), by vacuolar membrane vesicles, we demonstrate that a subset of energy-dependent transport processes in plants are not H+-coupled but instead are directly energized by MgATP. The most salient features of this transport pathway are: (a) its specific, obligate requirement for MgATP as energy source; (b) the necessity for hydrolysis of the [gamma]-phosphate of MgATP for uptake; (c) the insensitivity of uptake to uncouplers of the transtonoplast H+ gradient (carbonylcyanide 4 -trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, gramicidin-D, and NH 4 Cl); (d) its pronounced sensitivity to vanadate and partial inhibition by vinblastine and verapamil; (e) the lack of chemical modification of DNP-GS either during or after transport; (f) the capacity of S-conjugates of <b>chloroacetanilide</b> <b>herbicides,</b> such as metolachlor-GS, but not free herbicide, to inhibit uptake; and (g) the ability of vacuolar membrane vesicles purified from {{a broad range of}} plant species, including Arabidopsis, Beta, Vigna, and Zea, to mediate MgATP-dependent, H+-electrochemical potential difference-independent DNP-GS uptake. On the basis of these findings it is proposed that the transport of DNP-GS across the vacuolar membrane of plant cells is catalyzed by a glutathione-conjugate transporter that directly employs MgATP rather than the energy contained in the transtonoplast H+-electrochemical potential difference to drive uptake. The broad distribution of the vacuolar DNP-GS transporter and its inhibition by metolachlor-GS are consistent with the notion that it plays a general role in the vacuolar sequestration of glutathione-conjugable cytotoxic agents...|$|E

The acetanilide compounds 2 -chloro- 2 ', 6 '-diethylacetanilide (CDA) and 2 -hydroxy- 2 ', 6 '-diethylacetanilide (HDA) are environmental degradative products of alachlor. CDA, HDA and alachlor are ground and surface water contaminants; CDA and HDA are mutagenic in the Salmonella/microsome assay. There is a paucity of data on the environmental fate of CDA and HDA. ^ The development of two competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (cELISA) for the detection of CDA and HDA is reported. cELISA 3 is specific for CDA with a detection range of 0. 015 to 10 μg/ml.

40|$|Certain {{chemicals}} {{referred to}} as herbicide antidotes protect sorghum from injury by <b>chloroacetanilide</b> <b>herbicides</b> such as metolachlor. The effect of herbicide antidotes on the glutathione S-transferase isozyme complement of etiolated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L. ] Moench) shoots was examined. Elution profiles of glutathione S-transferase isozymes from untreated and antidote-treated seedlings were generated by fast protein liquid chromatography utilizing an anion exchange (Mono Q) column. In untreated seedlings, there were two glutathione S-transferase isozymes, a major isozyme which exhibited activity toward 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene and a minor isozyme which exhibited activity toward metolachlor. Treating sorghum seedlings with various antidotes (flurazole, oxabetrinil, CGA- 133205, naphthalic anhydride, dichlormid) resulted in the appearance of four to five additional glutathione S-transferase isozymes (de-pending on the particular antidote) which exhibited activity toward metolachlor as a substrate and little or no activity with 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene. Treating etiolated sorghum shoots with metolachlor was also found to induce at least four isozymes which exhibited activity toward the herbicide. An increase in glutathione S-transferase activity, measured with metolachlor as substrate, was detected within 4 h after treatment with 30 micromolar oxabetrinil, but 36 hours were required for maximum expression of activity. Addition of either the transcription inhibitor cordycepin or the translation inhibitor cycloheximide inhibited the appearance of glutathione S-transferase activity measured with metolachlor as substrate. The {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that antidotes confer protection against metolachlor injury in sorghum by inducing the de novo synthesis of glutathione S-transferase isozymes which catalyze the detoxification of the herbicide...|$|E

Freundlich isotherms revealed that sorption and desorption behaviour varied with each depth sampled. As soil depth increased, the extent and strength of sorption decreased, indicating that the potential for leaching was increased in the subsoils compared with the surface soil. Hysteresis was evident at each of the three depths sampled, although no significant correlations between soil properties and the hysteresis coefficients were evident. Desorption studies using soil fractions with diameters of > 2000, 250 - 2000, 53 - 250, 20 - 53, 2 - 20, 0 - 2 and 0 - 1 ?m separated from each of the three soil depths showed that differential desorption kinetics occurred and that the retention of acetochlor significantly correlated (R 2 = 0. 998) with organic matter content. A greater understanding of the influence of soil components on the overall sorption and desorption potential of surface and subsurface soils is required to allow accurate prediction of acetochlor retention in the soil.

Alachlor is a <b>chloroacetanilide</b> <b>herbicide,</b> used to control annual grasses and cer-tain broadleaf weeds in fields of corn, soybeans and peanuts. It inhibits protein synthesis in plant roots (Walker and Lawrence 1992). Bromacil belongs to Uracil family of herbi-cides used for brush control on non-cropland areas. It is especially useful against peren-nial grasses and used for selective weed control in pineapple and citrus crops (Redondo 1997).

40|$|Pesticides in soil {{are subject}} {{to a number of}} {{processes}} that result in transformation and biodegradation, sorption to and desorption from soil components, and diffusion and leaching. Pesticides leaching through a soil profile will be exposed to changing environmental conditions as different horizons with distinct physical, chemical and biological properties are encountered. The many ways in which soil properties influence pesticide retention and degradation need to be addressed to allow accurate predictions of environmental fate and the potential for groundwater pollution. Degradation and sorption processes were investigated in a long-term (100 days) study of the <b>chloroacetanilide</b> <b>herbicide,</b> acetochlor. Soil cores were collected from a clay soil profile and samples taken from 0 - 30 cm (surface), 1. 0 - 1. 3 m (mid) and 2. 7 - 3. 0 m (deep) and treated with acetochlor (2. 5, 1. 25, 0. 67 ?g acetochlor g - 1 dry wt soil, respectively). In sterile and non-sterile conditions, acetochlor concentration in the aqueous phase declined rapidly from the surface and subsoil layers, predominantly through nonextractable residue (NER) formation on soil surfaces, but also through biodegradation and biotic transformation. Abiotic transformation was also evident in the sterile soils. Several metabolites were produced, including acetochlor-ethane sulphonic acid and acetochlor-oxanilic acid. Transformation was principally microbial in origin, as shown by the differences between non-sterile and sterile soils. NER formation increased rapidly over the first 21 days in all soils and was mainly associated with the macroaggregate (> 2000 ?m diameter) size fractions. It is likely that acetochlor is incorporated into the macroaggregates through oxidative coupling, as humification of particulate organic matter progresses. The dissipation (ie total loss of acetochlor) half-life values were 9. 3 (surface), 12. 3 (mid) and 12. 6 days (deep) in the non-sterile soils, compared with 20. 9 [surface], 23. 5 [mid], and 24 days [deep] in the sterile soils, demonstrating the importance of microbially driven processes in the rapid dissipation of acetochlor in soil. © 2005 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
