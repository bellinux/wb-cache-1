5|$|At {{the time}} of its cancellation, two episodes of Better Off Ted had yet to be {{broadcast}} by ABC. The network announced on May 27, 2010, that it would air the two episodes back-to-back on June 17, 2010, <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 2010 NBA Finals not requiring a seventh game. Ultimately, however, a seventh game was needed, and thus ABC did not air the final two episodes of the series.|$|E

Only 66 Fireballs were completed by November 1945 as orders for 1,044 FR-1s were canceled on VJ Day.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E

5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2002, ABC aired Nancy Drew, {{starring}} Maggie Lawson {{and produced}} by Lawrence Bender. The movie {{was intended to}} be a pilot for a possible weekly series, which saw Nancy and her friends going off to college in a modern setting. Like the 1930s films, this pilot also took a more mature turn. The pilot aired as part of The Wonderful World of Disney series, with additional scripts being ordered and production <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> movie's reception. The series was passed at ABC, and UPN also passed following Lawson being cast on another series.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> price.|$|E

5|$|All of SR 198 {{was added}} to the state highway system in the three bond issues floated to pay for the {{construction}} of the system. The first bond issue, approved by the state's voters in 1910, included the road from Visalia west to Hanford, connecting the two county seats with the central northsouth highway (Route 4, now SR 99). As part of the 1916 bond issue, the route was extended west from Hanford through Coalinga to the coast trunk highway (Route 2, now US 101) near San Lucas, and assigned it the Route 10 designation. The third bond issue, passed in 1919, included a further extension east from Visalia to Sequoia National Park. The entire length of Route 10 was marked as Sign Route 198 in 1934, and this number was adopted legislatively in the 1964 renumbering. The portion east of Interstate 5 near Coalinga {{was added to}} the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959, and parts of it have been built as such. The construction of the freeway east of Visalia to Road 192 was approved in January 1961, with the remainder of the freeway unplanned at that time as <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> routing of SR 65. The projected cost in 1958 of the entire freeway east of Visalia was $13million ($ in today's dollars) and was scheduled to be completed by 1964. The freeway through Visalia was completed by 1965, with an expressway connecting it to US 99. Also completed was the expressway heading west out of Hanford, with part of it access-controlled west of Lemoore.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{relatively}} {{certain that}} the Persian fleet was sent out to block the exit from the Straits the evening before the battle. Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall, planning to catch the Allies as they fled. However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting Herodotus's version. There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the Persians simply blocked the exit to the Straits, and then entered the straits in daylight; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for battle during the night. Regardless of when they attempted it, {{it seems likely that}} the Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east-west alignment (blocking the exit), they came round to a north-south alignment (see diagram). The Persian fleet seems to have been formed into three ranks of ships (according to Aeschylus); with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo, the Ionian <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left flank and the other contingents in the centre.|$|E
5|$|The Friday the 13th films {{generally}} received negative reception {{from professional}} critics, {{in contrast to}} other slashers like Halloween. Critics disliked how the series favored high body counts over plot and character development and how each film was almost indistinguishable from the last. Nevertheless, the films were a financial success, prompting Paramount to release more sequels <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> box office appeal. When comparing Friday the 13th to the other top-grossing American slasher franchises—A Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, Halloween, the Hannibal Lecter series, Psycho, Saw, Scream, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—and adjusting for the 2011 inflation, Friday the 13th is the highest grossing horror franchise in the United States, with approximately $687.1 million. A Nightmare on Elm Street follows with $592.8 million, with the Hannibal Lecter film series closely behind with $588.7 million. Then comes Halloween with $557.5 million, Saw with $457.4 million, Scream with $442.9 million, Psycho with $376.3 million, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with $304.6 million, and the Child's Play film series rounding out the list with approximately $203 million. The financial success has extended to home release, with more than five million DVDs sold by 2005.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Edward Carr {{published}} {{a paper on}} potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant behaviors.

Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior.|$|E
