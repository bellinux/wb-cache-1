5|$|Davis, {{although}} {{eligible to}} play for Israel at the 2013 World Baseball Classic was unable {{to participate in the}} qualifying round due to being an active player for the Mets.

5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense a <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> a game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball {{high into the air}} to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> all players to gain a psychological advantage over their opponents for the Tests.|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} match more {{effectively}} {{of the two}} and scored what {{proved to be the}} winning goal in the latter minutes of the first half – Freddie Ljungberg's rebounded goal effort was converted by Robert Pirès. Midway through the second half, Southampton goalkeeper Antti Niemi was substituted, as he strained his calf muscle; he was replaced by Paul Jones. In stoppage time, striker James Beattie had his header cleared off the line by Ashley Cole, in what was the final <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> Southampton.|$|E

5|$|Both Internazionale and Celtic {{had been}} {{performing}} well domestically throughout the season. Only {{a few days}} before the final Internazionale had been on the verge of winning a historic treble but losses in their last two games knocked them out of the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and cost them the Scudetto. The European Cup was the last <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> them to redeem what had initially been such a promising season. Celtic came into the final having already won the First Division, the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup as well as the Glasgow Cup earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever they could get their hands on, at the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> salary and food.|$|E

5|$|Johnston was {{the left}} {{out for the}} next fixture, which was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team, with Johnston omitted. It was a <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> the Australian bowlers to gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrichthree of England's first four batsmenall playing. Australia won by an innings to give an indication of their strength.|$|E
5|$|Just after half-time, Leicester City {{had their}} strongest scoring chance, when Andy Lochhead {{received}} a headed knockdown from Allan Clarke, but Lochhead's shot went {{high above the}} goal. A dominant period by Manchester City then followed, which included a <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> Colin Bell from a free-kick. Len Glover was forced to move into defence with his team under pressure, but was injured shortly afterward {{and had to be}} substituted. Defender Malcolm Manley came on in his place.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is a {{favorite}} character {{of several of the}} original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes.

He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.|$|E

5|$|McLeod's {{most notable}} and {{controversial}} appearance {{came during the}} 2012 Summer Olympics in London. In the semi-final match against the United States on August 6, the referee ruled that McLeod had broken the six-second handling rule in the 76th minute, when Canada was leading 3–2. A free kick {{was given to the}} United States which resulted in a penalty being called on Canadian player Marie-Ève Nault after the ball struck her in the arm. The United States was given a penalty kick, which McLeod did not save. The United States ultimately won the game in overtime, eliminating Canada's <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Overdrive is the 19th studio album by pop punk trio Shonen Knife. It was {{released}} on April 14, 2014 in Europe, and on April 16, 2014 in Japan. According to band leader Naoko Yamano, because their album Free Time (2010) was heavily influenced by punk rock, and Pop Tune (2012) had explored a more pop-oriented sound, Overdrive was a <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> the band to explore a more hard rock sound. The album's lyrics cover {{a wide array of}} topics, from green tea, fortune cookies, and cats.|$|E
5|$|Several {{players from}} each team participated in all-star games {{following}} the Chick-fil-A Bowl. Virginia Tech's Kam Chancellor, Sergio Render and Stephan Virgil {{played in the}} 2010 East-West Shrine Game. Tennessee's Morgan Cox, Chris Scott and Dan Williams played in the Senior Bowl, while Jonathan Crompton and Vladimir Richard participated in the Texas vs The Nation game. These all-star games were a <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> graduating players to highlight their skills before the 2010 NFL Draft, {{which took place in}} April. A handful of players from each team were selected through the draft to play for National Football League teams.|$|E

5|$|Shiloh was the costliest {{battle in}} American history {{to that point}} and the {{staggering}} 23,746 total casualties stunned the nation. Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates, Grant was soon mired in controversy. The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties, and accused him of drunkenness during the battle, contrary to the accounts of officers and others {{with him at the}} time. However, Grant's victory at Shiloh ended any <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> the Confederates to prevail in the Mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West.|$|E
5|$|The Broncos' {{first drive}} {{of the second}} quarter was halted after a holding penalty and an {{incomplete}} pass denied BSU a <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> a first down. Boise was forced to kick the ball away once more. The Pirates' second drive of the quarter began at their 26–yard line. ECU needed just four plays to march 74yards down the field for a touchdown. On the drive, Chris Johnson rushed for 46yards and threw an 18–yard pass for a touchdown. After the touchdown and the extra point kick, ECU led 24–7.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand {{campaign}} was a <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> the younger players to establish {{themselves in the}} national team. Meckiff took 2/46 and 3/25 in his first-class debut for Australia, an innings win over Otago. He played in the first match against New Zealand, but after taking 0/41 in a drawn encounter, he was dropped for the second game.
