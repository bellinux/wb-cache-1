5000|$|While Walker {{stated that}} he shot Officer Roosevelt twice, later {{newspaper}} accounts stated that Roosevelt was hit by no fewer than nine [...]45-caliber bullets.

Roosevelt died in hospital a few hours after the shooting. Walker's abandoned car was found to contain bolt cutters, a loaded Thompson submachine gun, a bag of tools, sap, sash cord, bell wire, hacksaw blades, hand drill, electric drill, <b>crescent</b> <b>wrenches,</b> pry bar, extension cord, hammer, pliers, wire cutters, nitroglycerine, adhesive tape, a percussion-type dynamite blasting cap crimped to a white blasting fuse, and a primer cord attached to the percussion cap.
