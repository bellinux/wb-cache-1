5|$|The NTSB report {{showed that}} the plane had several {{instances}} of maintenance work related to <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> {{in the months leading}} up to the accident. The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem â€“ replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:00am CST, {{the crew}} {{received}} a go from ground flight controllers to ungrapple the robot arm from the docking module. Shortly after that, crew members raised the orbiter's <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> from 10.2 {{pounds per square}} inch to 14.7 psi. The cabin's pressure was lowered in the event that a problem during the mating process necessitated an emergency spacewalk.|$|E

5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure.</b> The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E
5|$|Diverse {{geographic}} destinations and cabin pressurisation alike on the Comet {{demanded the}} use of a high proportion of alloys, plastics, and other materials new to civil aviation across the aircraft in order to meet certification requirements. The Comet's high <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> and fast operating speeds were unprecedented in commercial aviation, making its fuselage design an experimental process. At its introduction, Comet airframes would be subjected to an intense, high-speed operating schedule which included simultaneous extreme heat from desert airfields and frosty cold from the kerosene-filled fuel tanks, still cold from cruising at high altitude.|$|E

The present study is done on a heterogeneous mixture of iso-octane and ethanol to deduct the spray penetration at various <b>cabin</b> <b>pressures</b> and temperatures and the simulation results have been presented in the work. WAVE model have been activated as the secondary break-up model for the atomization of droplets. The droplets are continuously tracked for its properties using the discrete phase model and are coupled with the continuous phase for energy and momentum. The vapourliquid equilibrium is established using the concentrations of the mixture and individual components with the help of user inputted C-code. The simulation result for a single component droplet of do-decane has been validated with the experimental results. A parametric study on the ideal multi-component mixture model has been done to show the variation in spray penetration length at temperatures 500, 700 and 900 k with varying <b>cabin</b> <b>pressures</b> of 1. 1, 3. 0 and 5. 0 Mpa.

40|$|The {{last thirty}} years have seen the Space Shuttle as the prime United States {{spacecraft}} for manned spaceflight missions. Many lessons have been learned about spacecraft design and operation throughout these years. Over the next few decades, a large increase of manned spaceflight in the commercial sector is expected. This {{will result in the}} exposure of commercial crews and passengers to many of the same risks crews of the Space Shuttle have encountered. One of the more dire situations that can be encountered is the loss of pressure in the habitable volume of the spacecraft during on orbit operations. This is referred to as a cabin leak. This paper seeks to establish a general cabin leak response philosophy with the intent of educating future spacecraft designers and operators. After establishing a relative definition for a cabin leak, the paper covers general descriptions of detection equipment, detection methods, and general operational methods for management of a cabin leak. Subsequently, all these items are addressed {{from the perspective of the}} Space Shuttle Program, as this will be of the most value to future spacecraft due to similar operating profiles. Emphasis here is placed upon why and how these methods and philosophies have evolved to meet the Space Shuttle s needs. This includes the core ideas of: considerations of maintaining higher <b>cabin</b> <b>pressures</b> vs. lower <b>cabin</b> <b>pressures,</b> the pros and cons of a system designed to feed the leak with gas from pressurized tanks vs. using pressure suits to protect against lower <b>cabin</b> <b>pressures,</b> timeline and consumables constraints, re-entry considerations with leaks of unknown origin, and the impact the International Space Station (ISS) has had to the standard Space Shuttle cabin leak response philosophy. This last item in itself includes: procedural management differences, hardware considerations, additional capabilities due to the presence of the ISS and its resource, and ISS docking/undocking considerations with a cabin leak occurring. The paper also offers a look at how different equipment configurations on future spacecraft impact the previously defined cabin leak operational philosophy and includes additional operational methods and considerations that result due to various configurations. The intent is to showcase these various considerations and highlight the variability they allow. The paper concludes with a selection of the author s personal observations from a spacecraft operator's point of view and recommendations with the goal of improving the design and operations of future spacecraft...|$|R

5|$|On {{the third}} and fourth days (September 1 and 2, 1983), work began with the Canadarm Remote Manipulator System and the payload test article, and {{communications}} testing through TDRS continued.

As a result, the crew had to be awakened early on September 1 {{in order to deal with}} the problem. A minor <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> leak on September 2 was traced to the waste management system, and quickly controlled.

50|$|De Havilland's {{pioneering}} Comet entered airline {{service in}} 1952. Initially {{it was a}} success, but it was grounded after several fatal crashes in 1953 and 1954. The cause of the Comet crashes {{had nothing to do}} with jet engines; it was a rapid metal fatigue failure in corners of the near-square windows brought on from cycling <b>cabin</b> <b>pressures</b> in flight to high altitudes and back. The understanding of metal fatigue that the Comet investigation produced would play a vital part in the good safety record of later types like the DC-8. In 1952 Douglas remained the most successful of the commercial aircraft manufacturers. They had almost 300 orders on hand for the piston-engined DC-6 and its successor, the DC-7, which had yet to fly. The Comet disasters, and the airlines' subsequent lack of interest in jets, seemed to show the wisdom of their staying with propeller-driven aircraft.|$|R
