5|$|On Election Day, Goldwater {{lost the}} {{election}} to Johnson by {{what was then the}} largest margin in history. Goldwater accumulated 52 electoral votes to Johnson's 486 and 39% of the popular vote (27,178,188) to Johnson's 61% (43,129,566). Goldwater carried six states: Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and his home state of Arizona. Goldwater's strong showing in the south is largely due to his support of the white southern view on civil rights: that states should be able to <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> laws without federal intervention.|$|E
5|$|Dougan succeeded Terry Neill – {{his future}} Northern Ireland manager – as {{chairman}} of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in 1970. He advocated the belief that players should <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> destiny and used his position as Chairman of the PFA to further players' rights. He oversaw the inaugural PFA awards in 1973–74, which included the PFA Players' Player of the Year, PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Team of the Year, and PFA Merit Award. He pushed for freedom of contract for players, and in 1978 accepted a compromise deal that allowed players to switch clubs {{at the end of their}} contracts, providing that the player's new club and old club could agree on a transfer fee, with a tribunal agreeing on a fee in cases where clubs could not agree.|$|E
5|$|In Madame Satan (1930), {{adultery}} {{is explicitly}} condoned {{and used as}} a sign for a wife {{that she needs to}} act in a more enticing way to maintain her husband's interest. In Secrets (1933), a husband admits to serial adultery, only this time he repents and the marriage is saved. The films took aim at what was already a damaged institution. During the Great Depression, relations between spouses often deteriorated due to financial strain, marriages lessened, and husbands abandoned their families in increased numbers. Marriage rates continually declined in the early 1930s, finally rising in 1934, the final year of the pre-Code era, and although divorce rates lowered, this is likely because desertion became a more common method of separation. Consequently, female characters, such as Ruth Chatterton's in Female, live promiscuous bachelorette lifestyles, and <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> financial destiny (Chatterton supervises an auto factory) without regret.|$|E

5|$|The {{visit to}} the US was the high point in Diệm's {{relations}} with his primary sponsor. The Americans began to place increasing pressure on Diệm to carry out democratic reforms and liberalize the political system, particularly during ambassadorship of Elbridge Durbrow. Diệm resisted the calls to broaden {{the base of his}} government and continued to rig elections. Meanwhile in the US, his support among the AFV also declined, in part due to his ongoing authoritarianism, and also because of his persistent complaints to them about negative media depictions of his regime; many Vietnamese leaders of various persuasions did not understand that western governments did not <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> media. Pressure also increased on Diệm at home, as the communists intensified their insurgency against him. In November 1960, discontent in his own army prompted a failed coup attempt by paratroopers. Although Diệm eventually organized for loyalists to put down the coup, he was angered by Durbrow's calls for him to try to negotiate a settlement, regarding the lack of support for his zero tolerance policy as a betrayal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, {{northern}} India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell {{again to the}} superior mobility and firepower {{of a new generation}} of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture. Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience. Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India. As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> affairs.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{psychiatric}} hospitals evolved from, and eventually replaced the older lunatic asylums.

25|$|The 21-article Declaration of Rights in the California Constitution (Article I: Sec.1 to Sec.-21) was {{broader than}} the U.S. Constitution's 10-article Bill of Rights.

The convention chose the boundaries for the state—unlike most other territories, whose boundaries were set by Congress (Article XII). Article IX encouraged statewide education and provided {{for a system}} of common schools partially funded {{by the state and}} provided {{for the establishment of a}} University (University of California). The California version outlawed slavery, except as punishment (Article I Sec. 18) and dueling (Article XI Sec.2) and gave women and wives the right to own and <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> property (Article XI Sec. 14).|$|E

25|$|The Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope {{expanded}} {{beyond the}} initial settlement and its borders were formally consolidated as the composite Dutch Cape Colony in 1778. At the time, the Dutch had subdued the indigenous Khoisan and San {{peoples in the}} Cape and seized their traditional territories. Dutch military expeditions further east were halted when they encountered the westward expansion of the Xhosa people. Hoping to avoid being drawn into a protracted dispute, the Dutch government and the Xhosa chieftains agreed to formally demarcate their respective areas of control and refrain from trespassing on each other's borders. However, the Dutch proved unable to <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> independently minded settlers, who disregarded the agreement and crossed into Xhosa territory, sparking one of Southern Africa's longest colonial conflicts: the Xhosa Wars.|$|E
25|$|According to Martin (1999), {{police work}} {{involves}} {{substantial amounts of}} emotional labor by officers, who must <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> facial and bodily displays of emotion {{in the presence of}} other officers and citizens. Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically masculine work that focuses on fighting crime, policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much anger, sympathy, or other emotion while dealing with danger on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work. While being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective interpersonal skills to gain citizen trust and compliance. Ultimately, the ability of police officers to effectively engage in emotional labor affects how other officers and citizens view them.|$|E
25|$|Wherever {{indigenous}} {{cultural identity}} is asserted, common societal issues and concerns {{arise from the}} indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of Indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues {{in dealing with the}} prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of Indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out {{by the fact that the}} lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the Sakha and Komi peoples (two of the northern indigenous peoples of Russia), who now <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian Inuit, who form a majority of the territory of Nunavut (created in 1999).

This rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practiced by the Meriam people.|$|E
