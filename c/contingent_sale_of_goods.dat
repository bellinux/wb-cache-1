Despite all the hallmarks of being a contract <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> the Supreme Court concluded that the agreement was not a contract <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> The implications behind the reasoning of the decision are examined...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{argues that}} it is {{essential}} to the success <b>of</b> the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> Convention that the current controversy regarding exclusions be resolved uniformly by all ratifying nations.

Part II identifies the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> Convention’s primary goal of uniformity and the arguments promoting implied exclusions. Part III examines the arguments favoring express exclusions. This Note concludes that a uniform resolution allowing only express exclusions would be most consistent with the overriding principles <b>of</b> the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> Convention...|$|R

40|$|In 1980, a Diplomatic Conference of sixty-two states {{unanimously}} {{approved the}} United Nations Convention on Contracts for International <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods.</b> This action concluded almost {{fifty years of}} effor to unify the law for the international <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and, in the process, superseded the frequently criticized 1964 Hague Convention on the Uniform Law for the International <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> (ULIS) and the Uniform Law on the Formation of Contracts for the International <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> (ULF). Since that time, 21 states, including the United States, have signed the 1980 Convention and 2 states have ratified it...|$|R
50|$|Most States have {{effected}} statutes {{relating to}} the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> such as the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> Act 1896, (Qld) which imply conditions and warranties in relation to fitness and merchantibility. However, in many instances such implied terms can be displaced by the contrary intention appearing in the contract between the parties. This has meant that, in practice, in many <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> contracts these provisions are displaced.|$|R
40|$|Delivery, {{formerly}} a general requirement in {{the transfer of}} ownership of corporeal moveables, is nowadays of much more limited application. Since the coming into force <b>of</b> the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> Act 1893 (now the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> Act 1979), transfer of ownership of corporeal moveables in the case <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> has been governed by the parties' intentions. Nonetheless, delivery still has {{a role in the}} law. It is still necessary in cases other than sale, and is also necessary {{for the creation of a}} real right of pledge. In addition, the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> Acts have preserved a minor role for delivery in <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods...</b>|$|R

40|$|The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> (CISG) is {{the prime}} legal {{instrument}} providing the substantive law as regards various important aspects <b>of</b> many international <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> transactions. The CISG has gained worldwide acceptance, it being estimated that approximately seventy to eighty percent <b>of</b> all international <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> transactions are governed by the CISG. Because of this importance, anything that affects or interacts with the CISG or {{has the potential to}} do so must also be taken into account by the parties to CISG-governed international <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> transactions. The Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements has that potential. This article examines whether there is an interaction or linkage between these two instruments and, if so, whether, based on what is known regarding the behaviour of parties to CISG-governed international <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> transactions, there is any reason to expect that the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements, if it comes into force and is widely adopted, will lead to a different forum selection by a large number of parties to CISG-governed international <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> transactions. ...|$|R
40|$|Commercial <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> {{transactions}} are remarkably diverse, {{ranging from the}} <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> precision, manufactured <b>goods,</b> where negotiations and post-delivery trials may be complex, to the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> commodities such as grain and oil, which take place in impersonal and expedited circumstances. The market background may be stable, as in the former case, or highly volatile, as in the latter case. This article concentrates on the differences between these two types <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> and assesses the suitability of two instruments for dealing with them. One instrument is the United Nations Convention on the International <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> 1980, which has been widely adopted by nations all round the world. The other is the United Kingdom <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> Act 1979, which is replicated in substance in the Hong Kong <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> Ordinance (Cap 26). English law plays a dominant role as the law applicable to commodity sales whose performance {{is in no way}} connected to England. Commodity traders have resisted the application of the United Nations Convention. Comparing the merits and limitations of the two instruments, the article concludes that the United Nations Convention may be better suited for the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> manufactured <b>goods</b> and the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> Act (with a well-established case law) for commodity sales...|$|R
