Notable architectural features include arches on its upper level, an intricate timber arcade {{with a mixture}} of eastern and western decorative motifs, and a Chinese moon gate (a circular gateway) on the building's second floor. Although few records exist concerning the moon gate's construction and usage, it is known to have made its appearance in the house in the 1960s and to have been designed and built by William Swaffield, a pre-World War II Comptroller of Government House and a professional furniture designer. It is constructed of <b>chengal,</b> teak and meranti wood. In the middle of the driveway in front of the house, there is a brick pit that was originally used by horse-drawn carriages.

50|$|If <b>Chengal</b> {{is used as}} a boat deck, it is {{extremely}} durable and requires very little maintenance. But it shrinks more than Teak and the deck will therefore develop more leaks and due to its hardness a <b>Chengal</b> deck will be relatively slippery, developing a marble like surface. <b>Chengal</b> decks should only be washed with salt water, and recaulked when needed. This cleans the deck, and prevents it from drying out and the wood from shrinking. The salt helps it absorb and retain moisture, and prevents any mildew and algal growth.|$|E

5000|$|On the Malay Peninsula <b>Chengal</b> {{has been}} used as the wood of choice for house and boatbuilding. It is {{sometimes}} referred to as the [...] "Malaysian Teak". Despite its extreme strength and hardness, <b>Chengal</b> is highly flexible before it is fully cured, making it the ideal wood for plank bending (boatbuilding). It is also highly resistant to rot, fungi and mildew. In addition, <b>Chengal</b> has a relatively low shrinkage ratio, (only inferior to Teak) which makes it excellent for applications where it undergoes periodic changes in moisture. <b>Chengal,</b> like Teak, has the unusual properties of being both an excellent structural timber for framing, planking, etc., {{while at the same time}} being easily worked and finished to a high degree. Due to the oily nature of the wood, care must be taken to properly prepare the wood before gluing.|$|E

50|$|Small pin-holes, {{caused by}} ambrosia beetles boring {{into the living}} trees, are a common and {{characteristic}} defect of <b>Chengal.</b> These small holes are often numerous, but although unsightly, they are only in exceptional cases sufficiently numerous to impair {{the strength of the}} timber. These ambrosia beetles die when the timber is seasoned and thus the damage is restricted almost entirely to that which occurs in the green timber. Big trees of <b>Chengal</b> are sometimes hollow at the centre and badly attacked by large borers, and occasional trees are seriously infected by a fungus (Fomes spp.), which initially gains entry through broken branches or other wounds and eventually reduces the timber to a dark pulpy condition. With the exception of pin holes, the timber of <b>chengal</b> is free from knots and other defects characteristic of sawn timber.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{versions}} for the etymological {{roots of the}} name Changi.

Its heavy timber is commonly used for buildings and furniture and noted for its strength and deep rich colour.

50|$|Beams and joist are {{horizontal}} {{structural members}} that distribute {{the dead and}} live load from the upper floors to the load-bearing walls. The beams and joist in Gedung Kuning are made out of timber {{because it was a}} readily available material back then. It is often made of <b>Chengal,</b> a hardwood that is resistant to the dead load transferred from the upper floors. It is an economical material as it could be sourced locally and has enough tensile strength to carry lateral loads. Main timber beams, which are key horizontal structural members, are parallel to Kandahar Street & Sultan Gate road and span between the walls. However, there are beams and joist that run in the perpendicular direction. Those beams are usually located in the outdoor spaces such as the fiveIfootway. This suggests that the direction of beams might indicate spaces that are outdoors and public, and spaces that are more private. The beams and joist rest on ledges where the wall diminish in thickness and act as a load-bearing surface. I-beams have been introduced into structures to replace rotten timber beams but in Gedung Kuning, it is used to support the current beams. Exposed IIbeams have to be encased in concrete for fire safety as well as aesthetics reasons (Fig. 3c). Reinforced concrete beams are used to support the upper storey of the five-footway.|$|E
40|$|Mixed pixel {{occurrence}} in remote sensing imagery is a {{main source of}} problems in classifying ground features, especially when dealing with complex ecosystems such as tropical rainforest areas due to its high diversity of tree species. Pure pixel composed of a single species is very rare in most remote sensing imagery even in some advent ultrafine spatial resolution.

40|$|Abstract: Most of the cross-arms of the 275 KV and 123 KV {{transmission}} lines in Malaysia and certain countries are using hard wood especially from <b>chengal</b> species. Due to natural weathering this wooden cross-arms is degraded and decayed. For safety reason {{there is a}} need for a simple, light, and accurate non-destructive decay detection. In this project the microwave reflection technique and ultrasonic method which is based on the transit time have been developed for in-situ measurement. In this study, we categorize the decay on the wood into three stages of decays namely severely decay, incipient decay and sound wood. In microwave method these stages can be related to the amount of water that can be absorbed by weathered wood and secondly on the wood density at particular moisture content especially at environmental moisture content. This method managed to detect inner decay up to 2 cm from the surface of the wood. In ultrasonic method, an investigation has been done to find suitable method of measurement, especially detection of decay under the metal block. Appling this detection system the transit times along l-l direction for sound wood, incipient wood, and cracked wood fall under the ranges of 100 µs to 200 µs, 200 µs to 500 µs, and above 500 µs respectively.
