[...] Quaverdale whistled,--a mode of {{receiving}} the overture which was not pleasing to Annesley. [...] "I don't suppose that anything so very super-human in the way of intellect is required." [...] Annesley had got a fellowship, whereas Quaverdale had done nothing at the university.|$|R

60|$|FRIDAY. Rose {{early and}} tried to sweep out the White House. Had little heart for it. The dust gathers in the corners. How did Roosevelt manage to keep it so clean? An idea!

[...] The first touch of womanly {{tenderness}} that I had heard from her trembled in her voice as she said the words; but no tears glistened in those large, wistfully attentive eyes of hers, which were still fixed on me. [...] "I have only been in London once before," [...] she went on, more and more rapidly, [...] "and I know nothing about that side of it, yonder. <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> fly, or a carriage of any kind? Is it too late? I don't know. If you could show me where to get a fly--and if you will only promise not to interfere with me, and to let me leave you, when and how I please--I have a friend in London who {{will be glad to}} receive me--I want nothing else--will you promise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sister Mollie was {{the grand}} {{repository}} of these; {{all the little}} Josephs came to her for advice and assistance. It was Mollie who for troubled small brothers and sisters did such sums in division as this: How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> ten-cent present for Emmy and a fifteen-cent one for Jimmy out of eighteen cents? Or, how can seven sticks of candy be divided among eight people so that each shall have one? It was Mollie who advised regarding the purchase of ribbon and crepe paper. It was Mollie who put the finishing touches {{to most of the}} little gifts. In short, all through December Mollie was weighed down under an avalanche of responsibility. It speaks volumes for her sagacity and skill that she never got things mixed up or made any such terrible mistake as letting one little Joseph find out what another was going to give him. [...] "Dead" [...] secrecy was the keystone of all plans and confidences.|$|E
6000|$|... "What I {{play you}} {{now is the}} {{laughing}} trio from my second act. It is a building number. It is sung by tenor, principal comedian, and soubrette. On the second refrain four girls will come out and two boys. The girls will dance with the two men, the boys with the soubrette. So! On the encore four more girls and two more boys. Third encore, solo-dance for specialty dancer, all on stage beating time by clapping their hands. On repeat, all sing refrain once more, and off. Last encore, the three principals and specialty dancer dance the dance with entire chorus. It is a great building number, you understand. It {{is enough to make}} the success of any musical play, but <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> hearing? No! If I ask managers to listen to my music, they are busy! If I beg them to give me a libretto to set, they laugh--ha! ha!" [...] Mr. Saltzburg gave a spirited and lifelike representation of a manager laughing ha-ha when begged to disgorge a libretto. [...] "Now I play it once more!" ...|$|E

'Why, it's {{work one}} does not get deadly sick of, {{as if there was}} no making one's self do it,' said Leonard, eagerly; 'it is work! and besides, here is {{sunshine}} and sea. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sight of that every day; and now and then <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> look into the bay, and Weymouth--looking like the old time.' That was his first sorrowful intonation; but the next had the freshness of his age, 'And there are thistles!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{has been}} left to me?" [...] I said despondingly and {{spreading}} out my hands. [...] "My pistol gone, and did I not give Runi the tinder-box, and the little box with a cock painted on it to you? I had no return--not even the blow-pipe.

60|$|The Snark {{has been}} a {{hospital}} for months, and I confess that we are getting used to it. At Meringe Lagoon, where we careened and cleaned the Snark's copper, {{there were times when}} only one man of us was able to go into the water, while the three white men on the plantation ashore were all down with fever. At the moment of writing this we are lost at sea somewhere northeast of Ysabel and trying vainly to find Lord Howe Island, which is an atoll that cannot be sighted unless one is on top of it. The chronometer has gone wrong. The sun does not shine anyway, nor <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> star observation at night, and we have had nothing but squalls and rain for days and days. The cook is gone. Nakata, who has been trying to be both cook and cabin boy, is down on his back with fever. Martin is just up from fever, and going down again. Charmian, whose fever has become periodical, is looking up in her date book to find when the next attack will be. Henry has begun to eat quinine in an expectant mood. And, since my attacks hit me with the suddenness of bludgeon-blows I do not know from moment to moment when I shall be brought down. By a mistake we gave our last flour away to some white men who did not have any flour. We don't know when we'll make land. Our Solomon sores are worse than ever, and more numerous. The corrosive sublimate was accidentally left ashore at Penduffryn; the peroxide of hydrogen is exhausted; and I am experimenting with boracic acid, lysol, and antiphlogystine. At any rate, if I fail in becoming a reputable M.D., it won't be from lack of practice.|$|E
