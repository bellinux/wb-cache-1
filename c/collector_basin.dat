50|$|Before {{passing through}} the condensers, noncontact cooling water at Northside Generating Station is treated {{intermittently}} with a biocide to prevent biological growth on the heat exchanger tubes. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and occasionally sodium bromide (NaBr) are used. Treatment occurs no more than 2 hours per day per operating unit. The St. Johns River Power Park taps into the discharge side of the Northside Generating Station condensers to obtain cooling tower makeup. The average surface water flow supplied to the Power Park heat rejection system is 50 Mgd (34400 gal per minute). Approximately 25% of this surface water evaporates into the atmosphere from the cooling towers. Cooling tower blowdown is routed back into Northside Generating Station's discharge <b>collector</b> <b>basin.</b> The daily average temperature of the cooling tower blowdown is limited to 96 F.|$|E
40|$|RSH Taman Sentosa Residence is an unpretentious {{residence}} type {{which is}} located at Ngargorejo Village, Boyolali Regency. Due to {{the condition of the}} area, which are short- separated to each house, limited land, a flat surface area, and the worried about the water pollution contamination if each of the the house build a septic-tank system, the developer of this residence will build a sewerage system for its domestic waste. The sewerage system applied an off-site system, means that the domestic waste will flow on a closed pipe network. Furthermore, for advanced treatment uses a sump well with pump, initial settled-basin, anaerobic filter basin, aerobic filter basin, and a <b>collector</b> <b>basin.</b> Hopefully, those advanced treatments can solve the environmental problem in the area of RSH Taman Sentosa Residence. On the conclusion with all the system and advanced treatments that applied can make a healty living residence, comfortable, have a good aesthetic value, and proper to be inhabited. keyword: RSH Taman Sentosa Residence, off-site system management, the advanced treatmen...|$|E
50|$|The square is {{paved with}} natural stone, bordered by plant boxes and benches facing 24 water jets in the centre which mirror the Maelbeek <b>collector</b> and storm <b>basin</b> below. Trees line {{the western side}} (not open to traffic) {{mirroring}} the axis starting {{at the entrance of}} Leopold Park {{across the street to the}} south. It is named after President Jean Rey and occupies a space between the Justus Lipsius building (headquarters of the Council of the European Union) and Leopold Park (next to the Espace Léopold of the European Parliament). It was inaugurated at the start of the Belgian EU Presidency on 26 June 2001.|$|R
40|$|All basin {{solar still}} in general use under the askew glass cover as {{condensation}} media toplace the condensate flows toward the lower sections with use gravitation. It is known thatwhen condensation occurs release considerable heat energy to environment. Solve thisproblem, {{in this research}} is to minimize the loss of substantial energy, utilizing the heat fromthe solar collector. Heat is supplied {{to the bottom of}} the heat absorber and heat exchanger. Research methods is experiment. In this research is examine both the prototype, that is basinsolar still with solar <b>collector</b> and <b>basin</b> solar still without solar collector. The measuredparameter is temperature button section heat absorber, outside heat absorber, buttonsection of glass cover, condensate water, environment, solar collector, heat exchanger andsoar radiation. In this result temperature average at button section heat absorber is 47, 03 oC for prototypewith solar collector and without solar collector is 45, 25 oC. Solar radiation average is 304, 11 W/m 2. Efficiency both prototype is 29, 45 % with solar collector and 19, 86 % without solarcollector. By comparing efficiency two prototype is concluded that the Solar Collector aspreheater water and additional heating of water under heat absorber 67. 45 % better than thatwithout using Solar Collector...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT BSB City Industrial Estate is an {{industrial}} area which activities and centrally {{located in the}} district Mijen Semarang city, industrial area contains manufacturing and warehousing industries. this area will be constructed wastewater distribution system planning and Wastewater Treatment Plants. Widely held at the industrial park with an area of ± 110 ha area for existing or for future development. The distance between one industry to another with regular road network large enough to transport passing, the contours {{of which are in}} the industrial area has a contour in the form of hills and down into the river, this allows gravity flow drainage system. Distribution system which was selected to be applied in the industrial BSB City is a conventional system, since BSB City industrial area has a large area of land with a greater load distribution, so that the required pipe diameter is relatively large with no dependence on the availability of clean water. In addressing pollution would happen then to system off site, which means that the distribution of industrial waste water through a closed pipeline (sewerage system). Furthermore, for industrial wastewater treatment plant used wells equipped with pumps <b>collector,</b> barscreen, equalization <b>basin,</b> primary clarifier, activated sludge basin, and sludge drying bed. It hopefully will be able to overcome the environmental problems in the industrial area BSB City, Mijen Semarang City. In addition, off-site system and its wastewater treatment plant is expected to create the industry's healthy and environmentally friendly Keyword : BSB City Industrial Estate, Mijen Semarang city, sewerage system, conventional system, wastewater distribution system planning, wastewater treatment plant...|$|R
