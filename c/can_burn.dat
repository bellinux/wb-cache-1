5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it <b>can</b> <b>burn</b> (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Sokka, Toph, and Suki hijack a Fire Nation airship, {{and use it}} {{to destroy}} Ozai's airship fleet, {{crippling}} his forces before they <b>can</b> <b>burn</b> down the Erath Kingdom. In Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus, led by Iroh, lays siege to the Fire Nation forces within the city, with the intention of re-conquering it {{in the name of the}} Earth Kingdom. Aang reappears and begins to duel the Phoenix King. When Aang refuses to kill Ozai despite given the opportunity, Ozai begins to gain an advantage in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after which one <b>can</b> <b>burn</b> the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve {{open pit mining}} and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are met by Phoebe Green, an {{investigator}} from London's Metropolitan Police and Mulder's former lover from Oxford University. Green explains that a serial arsonist is targeting the British aristocracy, burning his victims alive while leaving {{no trace of}} evidence. The only links between the crimes are the suspect's love letters to the victims' wives. His latest target is Sir Malcolm Marsden, who is visiting Cape Cod for protection after escaping an attack by the killer. Mulder and Scully visit a pyrotechnics expert who says that only rocket fuel <b>can</b> <b>burn</b> hot enough to destroy evidence of its origins.|$|E

5|$|Ash {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect pasture, plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin ash falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction of ash, amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall. The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soilâ€™s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon arable crops, such as fruit, vegetables and grain. Ash <b>can</b> <b>burn</b> plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading.|$|E
5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and <b>can</b> <b>burn</b> the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and <b>can</b> <b>burn</b> the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

25|$|Image Mastering API (IMAPI v2) enables DVD burning {{support for}} applications, in {{addition}} to CD burning. IMAPI v2 supports multiple optical drives, even recording to multiple drives simultaneously, unlike IMAPI in Windows XP which only supported recording with one optical drive at a time. In addition, multiple filesystems are supported. Applications using IMAPI v2 can create, and burn disc imagesâ€”it is extensible {{in the sense that}} developers can write their own specific media formats and create their own file systems for its programming interfaces. IMAPI v2 is implemented as a DLL rather than as a service {{as was the case in}} Windows XP, and is also scriptable using VBScript. IMAPI v2 is also available for Windows XP. With the Windows Feature Pack for Storage installed, IMAPI 2.0 supports Recordable Blu-ray Disc (BD-R) and Rewritable Blu-ray Disc (BD-RE) media as well.
