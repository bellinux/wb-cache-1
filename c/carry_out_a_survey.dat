5|$|The Mark II {{telescope}} once constructed {{was also}} used as an interferometer with the Lovell telescope. This has a baseline of 425 m (1,394ft) (meaning that it can synthesize a telescope with 425 m diameter), giving it a resolution of around 0.5 arcminutes. This telescope pair {{has been used to}} carry out survey work, and to determine the positions of faint radio objects. Also, one of the drivers behind the construction of the Mark III was to use it as an interferometer with the Mark I to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>survey</b> of radio sources.|$|E
5|$|With the {{prospect}} of the Chard Canal in particular damaging trade on the Parrett, four traders from Langport including Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot, who together operated a river freight business, commissioned the engineer Joseph Jones to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>survey</b> for the Parrett Navigation which was then put before Parliament. It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by culverts, siphons, and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.|$|E
5|$|By 1774, canal {{building}} {{was much better}} understood, and a new attempt was made. The plan was led by Dallaway's son William, who asked Thomas Dadford, Jr., the engineer on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and John Priddy, {{who had been the}} engineer on the Droitwich Canal during its construction, to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>survey.</b> The cost of a canal which avoided the river and hence the mills, was put at £16,750, and soon £20,000 had been raised. Deciding that they did not need a new Act of Parliament, since the powers of the 1730 Act were still valid, Yeoman, who had carried out the 1754 survey, was asked to survey the route again, and a route was selected, which would require 12 locks. Work started, with Samuel Jones as engineer, but he was replaced by Priddy within a month. A challenge to the legality of building a canal under the 1730 Act was mounted by landowners and millers in 1775. An injunction was obtained, and the Gloucestershire Assizes ruled that the Act did not cover the work. A new Act was obtained on 25 March 1776, authorising the raising of £20,000 and an extra £10,000 if required. Both sides commissioned the writing of poems to support their causes.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} this time that he worked with René Wetzel, a French {{geologist}} employed by IPC, and together they carried out many surveys together, including a series of ground-breaking expeditions to south-western Arabia (the Aden Protectorate and Dhofar) between 1947 and 1953. At the start of their first expedition, in November 1947, they met the explorer Wilfred Thesiger who was about the commence his second crossing of the Rub' al Khali (the Empty Quarter). The subsequent expedition to the Mahra country (today's Yemen) was hazardous. The rugged terrain ruled out motor transport and the survey party had to travel by camel and dhow. Tribal tensions delayed their progress in Al Ghaydah as Morton and the expedition doctor were briefly held prisoner. Morton and Wetzel, together with IPC liaison officer, Major Tony Altounyan, went on to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>survey</b> of Dhofar province, a province of the Sultan of Oman, Said bin Taimur.

25|$|The {{history of}} Risalpur airbase {{dates back to}} 1910 when an {{airstrip}} was developed there. During the First World War, the Royal Flying Corps established a base at Risalpur. In December 1915 RAF's newly raised No. 31 Squadron was stationed here, which was later used against troublesome tribesmen of the Tribal areas along the Afghan border. The squadron flew B.E.2c and Farman biplane in ground support missions. On 24 May 1919, Handley Page V/1500 flew its first mission to attack Kabul from the airfield. In 1925 the air fleet of base was tasked to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>survey</b> of the about four hundred square miles area of Ravi's old river bed for finding ancient sites. After First World War, the No. 11 Squadron of Royal Air Force equipped with Westland Wapiti was stationed at the base in 1928, that was also used in the operations in the tribal areas. The bombers of this squadron were used By 1940, Risalpur had become both a training and an operational base. During the Second World War, an operational training squadron was stationed at Risalpur, besides the base also conducted fighter conversion courses.|$|E

25|$|For {{a number}} of years after his 1994 release from prison, Chávez {{maintained}} a position against participation in elections, believing them a fixed game which merely legitimated the established order. This led to a split with his colleague Francisco Arias Cárdenas, who left the MBR-200. In the early years after his release, Chávez considered the possibility of another coup attempt, but with the prospects appearing slim, some advisers, notably Luis Miquilena, urged him to reconsider his scepticism of the elections, arguing that Chávez could potentially win so convincingly that the establishment {{would not be able to}} deny him victory. To find out whether this was the case, Chávez set up teams of psychologists, sociologists, university professors and students to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>survey.</b> With their support, grassroots members of the Bolivarian movement polled tens of thousands of people across the country. The results showed that 70% of respondents supported Chávez running for the presidency - and 57% said they would vote for him. Support for the electoral route was strengthened when Arias Cárdenas, as a candidate for Radical Cause, won the Governorship of Zulia State in the December 1995 regional elections. Despite this, the MBR-200 remained divided over electoral participation, and spent a year debating the issue in local, regional and national assemblies. A national congress on 19 April 1997 took from 9 am until 2 am the next day to reach a conclusion, ultimately deciding to launch Chávez' candidacy. Some members of the movement resigned in protest, holding too much at stake. In July 1997 Chávez registered the new Fifth Republic Movement with the National Electoral Council (the name had to be changed as Venezuelan law did not permit parties to use Simón Bolívar's name). The international media took little interest, citing opinion polls showing 8% support for Chávez.|$|E

500|$|The {{basis of}} the discussions between Venezuela and the United Kingdom lay in Britain's {{advocacy}} of a particular division of the territory deriving from a mid-nineteenth-century survey it commissioned. This survey originated with German naturalist Robert Schomburgk's four-year expedition for the Royal Geographical Society in 1835 to 1839, {{which resulted in a}} sketch of the territory with a line marking what he believed to be the western boundary claimed by the Dutch. As a result of this he was commissioned by the British government to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>survey</b> of Guiana's boundaries. The result was the [...] "Schomburgk Line", which he established partly following natural divisions and partly to distinguish territory of Spanish or Venezuelan occupation from that which had been occupied by the Dutch. The Line went well beyond the area of British occupation, and gave British Guiana control of the mouth of the Orinoco River. In 1844 Venezuela declared the Essequibo River the dividing line; a British offer the same year, to make major alterations to the Line and cede the mouth of the Orinoco and much associated territory, was ignored. No treaty between Britain and Venezuela was reached, and after an 1850 agreement not to encroach on disputed territory, the matter largely rested until 1876, when diplomatic exchanges resumed. Schomburgk's initial sketch, which had been published in 1840, was the only version of the [...] "Schomburgk Line" [...] published until 1886. This led to accusations by US President Grover Cleveland that the line had been extended [...] "in some mysterious way".|$|E

2500|$|In 1802, Thomas Telford was {{requested}} by the Lords of the Treasury to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>survey</b> of {{the interior of the}} Scottish Highlands. In his report, he highlighted the inadequacy of the old military roads to meet the requirements of the general population. [...] In particular, he noted the difficulties caused by the absence of bridges over some of the principal rivers. [...] As part of the improvements to the road system that were carried out in the following years, a bridge was built at Dunkeld, designed by Telford. [...] The original cost estimate was £15,000 with costs to be split between the Government and the landowner, the 4th Duke of Atholl. [...] However, costs spiralled up to around £40,000. [...] The Government refused to increase their financial contribution, so the Duke of Atholl had to finance the extra cost. As a result, tolls were placed on the completed bridge to recoup costs. The realigned road north out of Dunkeld would evolve eventually into the A9, and the bridge carried the bulk of the traffic into the Highlands until the new A9 by-pass was opened in 1977.|$|E

2500|$|An Act of 1791 {{authorised}} {{improvements to}} the drainage of the peat lands of King's Sedgemoor. The existing outfalls for the moor were inadequate. Cowhouse Clyse, near Andersea on the River Parrett, was too high to work well, and Bennett Clyse, a little further downstream, was not working at all. The five commissioners who were appointed under the act proposed a new drainage channel from the area to an existing sluice called Dunball Clyse, and asked William White, a surveyor from Wedmore near Wells, to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>survey.</b> White found a suitable route, {{but there were some}} misgivings, as the area is separated from the coast by a slightly higher ridge of clay, and the scheme involved cutting nearly [...] of drain to a depth of [...] through this ridge, in order to provide the necessary gradient for the water to flow. He was supported in this by John Billingsley, one of the commissioners who farmed near Sutton Mallet, but who had written a book on the agriculture of Somerset, and the drainage of the levels. He could see no alternative, and so the advice of the engineer William Jessop was sought. Jessop supported White and Billingsley in his assessment of the options, and so the route was adopted.|$|E
