50|$|Zeo, Inc., {{formerly}} Axon Labs, was {{a private}} company founded by Brown University students. Established December 29, 2003 in Providence, Rhode Island and later headquartered in Boston, MA, it developed a smart alarm clock with sleep monitor (e.g., REM). Sleep states {{could be used to}} sound a wake-up alarm only when the sleeper was in the light stages of sleep, likely to awake more refreshed. Details of sleep could be uploaded to the MyZeo Web site, where they were stored, with detailed historical charts of sleep patterns downloadable, and email suggestion on improving sleep could be sent. The state of sleep was detected by a headband, essentially comprising three long-lasting electrodes made of electrically conductive fabric and a wireless unit, that transmitted data to a Zeo bedside <b>clock</b> <b>unit</b> or Apple iPhone which displayed data and sounded the wake alarm.

40|$|Over {{the recent}} years, the demand {{imposed on the}} {{communication}} systems has increased steadily. The use of optical fiber systems, with their inherently high transmission capacity, using a single channel transmission offered relief to this demand for some time, but their capacity was rapidly exhausted. New optical techniques such as optical time domain multiplexing (OTDM) and optical wavelength domain multiplexing (WDM) were then used to maximize the exploitation of this high transmission capacity of the optical fibers. However, this ever-increasing demand will impose a migration from the nowadays commercially available 10 Gb/s systems to a higher line rate. This new step {{is believed to be}} a 40 Gb/s signal. Since, at present time, the equipment for this ultra-high bit rate is still unavailable, or extremely expensive where available, the performance of the 40 Gb/s is usually characterized at the receiver�s end by demultiplexing the 40 Gb/s to a 10 Gb/s and then making use of the relatively inexpensive 10 Gb/s bit error rate (BER) test-set. Whenever this technique is used, the extraction of a highly stable 10 GHz frequency signal from the 40 Gb/s line rate signal is essential, since this recovered signal is {{to be used as a}} clock signal to achieve the 40 Gb/s demultiplexing and to measure the quality of the 10 Gb/s demultiplexed signal. In this work, a 40 Gb/s clock recovery circuit is presented. That essential task of recovering the clock signal is accomplished by means of a phase locked loop (PLL) since they are very well suited for high-speed operation. In order to understand the behavior of the PLL this thesis goes through a theoretical study on that subject. The core part of this work consists of the design and implementation of that clock recovery unit. Limitations in the design are presented, namely, the International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication (ITU-T) Standardization Sector Recommendations this clock recovery should fulfill, some of which were extrapolated from lower bit rates since they have not been published yet. The clock recovery design had to face the problems arising from its future use in the re-circulating fiber loop set-up at DTU laboratory. The obtained results gathered from the successful operation of the clock recovery unit are presented, and some future work is also outlined. The obtained results are very encouraging. The recovered signal presented remarkable frequency accuracy, 9. 99999 GHz, with an approximately 70 dBc within 100 kHz frequency range. Stability in frequency and time was confirmed while gathering the data. The PLL based recovery <b>clock</b> <b>unit</b> was brought into lock injecting a 0 dBm optical input power into the photo detector. This optical power generated an approximately � 25 dBm electrical power into the actual clock recovery unit after the optical to electrical signal conversion. In addition, measurements demonstrated that the PLL could maintain a locked state down to a - 10 dBm optical power. This optical input power demonstrates a locked stated down to an outstanding value of approximately � 50 dBm electrical input power into the clock recovery unit...|$|E
30|$|Duty cycling: This is one {{mechanism}} {{widely used}} for energy-efficient MAC protocols in WSN. A MAC protocol that implements duty cycling uses appropriate sleep/wake-up mechanisms to conserve energy, and in [22], it is demonstrated that when sensor nodes {{remain in the}} sleep mode, they consume less energy than when in the idle mode. When {{there is no need}} for communication, the radio is put to sleep and, although applying duty cycling energy is conserved, it has some disadvantages. Putting sensors into sleep mode makes it difficult to the all network to function or at least certain part of it. As showed in [23], a few issues are needed to overcome such as deciding when to switch a device to low power mode or deciding “for how long should a device remain in the low power mode?” To solve these issues, efficient and flexible duty cycling techniques have been proposed. The S-MAC [24] and the T-MAC [25] protocols are examples of them. These protocols transmit a SYNC packet to notify neighbors about their schedule and to synchronize the clocks of all nodes in the network. The method only compensates for clock offset and does not consider clock drift [21]. Moreover, the knowledgement of traffic patterns can also help to take decisions about waking up. This method is known as adaptive duty cycling. S-MAC [24] is one of the major energy-efficient MAC protocols that efficiently exploits the idea of adaptive duty cycling. It uses a periodic sleep-wake-up mechanism in order to lower power consumption. If a node has no packet to receive, it can waste a large amount of energy by just listening to the channel. Consequently, a node can save a significant amount of energy if it simply goes to sleep mode by switching off its radios [22]. T-MAC is an improvement over S-MAC duty cycling. In the T-MAC, listening period ends when no event has occurred for a time threshold TA. Though it improves on S-MAC, T-MAC has the disadvantage that it can face an early sleeping problem where a node can go to sleep even though its neighbor may still have messages for it. Synchronization is also an issue in duty cycling MAC protocols. In [26], that synchronous MACs such as S-MAC have low energy consumption for sending packets but are complicated due to the need of synchronization is argued. Conversely, asynchronous MACs, for example WiseMAC [27], is very simple, but it spends much energy in finding the neighbor’s wake-up time. Moreover, synchronous methods can be characterized as one-way methods. Usually, the senders broadcast a reference message and receivers, upon the reception of the message, record the arrival time by their own clocks, and exchange this information among each other to compensate clock offset between them. In [21], a synchronous method is proposed in which clocks in the all network are not modified. Instead, the nodes are synchronized with their own clocks. Since the periodic broadcast event in the network is the same, although they have different measurement results for this period by their own <b>clock</b> <b>unit</b> independently, they are able to interact with each other at the same physical time. Without complicating the estimation process and without modifying the clock of a node, this synchronization method becomes simpler and more energy-efficient than the traditional synchronization one-way method.|$|E

40|$|Today’s routers need {{to perform}} packet {{classification}} at wire speed {{in order to}} provide critical services such as traffic billing, priority routing and blocking unwanted Internet traffic. With ever-increasing ruleset size and line speed, the task of implementing wire speed packet classification with reduced power consumption remains difficult. Software approaches are unable to classify packets at wire speed as line rates reach OC- 768, while state of the art hardware approaches such as TCAM still consume large amounts of power. This paper presents a low power architecture for a high speed packet classifier which can meet OC- 768 line rate. The architecture consists of an adaptive <b>clocking</b> <b>unit</b> which dynamically changes the clock speed of an energy efficient packet classifier to match fluctuations in traffic on a router line card.
