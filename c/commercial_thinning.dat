We analyzed soil strength, an indicator of soil compaction, prior to and following <b>commercial</b> <b>thins</b> (sawlog and biomass harvest) and mastication treatments in 24 - to 30 -year-old mixed-conifer plantations in the central Sierra Nevada. Soil strength in mature, untreated second-growth stands was also measured as a reference.

Most of the existing compaction came from the original regeneration harvest that established the plantations several decades earlier.

In mature forests, these stem decay fungi cause enormous annual wood volume loss of Alaska’s major tree species. Approximately one-third of the old-growth timber board foot volume in Southeast Alaska is defective, largely due to decay from this type of fungus. Conversely, {{there is very little}} decay in young-growth stands unless there is prevalent wounding from <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> activities, wind damage, or animal feeding.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 One {{traditional}} {{problem in}} forest management {{is to find}} the optimal stand level management regime. Four important silvicultural practices including precommercial thinning, <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning,</b> fertilization and regeneration harvest are considered jointly in this study. The partial analyses, i. e. considering some of the silvicultural practices, are also discussed. The inability to account for diameter acceleration in the two-dimensional dynamic programming technique is overcome by using a three-dimensional dynamic programming network with biometric relationships from DFIT. The continuous growth is fitted into a discrete dynamic programming network by using the "neighborhood" concept. The descriptors used are stand age, number of trees and basal area. The effect {{of the size of the}} state space of dynamic programming is discussed and a basal area interval between four to 20 square feet is suggested when the tree interval used is 15. <b>Commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> is considered every ten years and captures anticipated merchantable mortality. Precommercial thinning is considered at age ten. Different intensities of precommercial thinning can be considered jointly with other silvicultural practices. Three levels of fertilization, i. e. 400 pounds, 200 pounds and zero pounds of nitrogen per acre, are applied every ten years after <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning.</b> An extra dimension representing different levels of fertilization is eliminated by computations and using the neighborhood concept. The forward recursive relation of dynamic programming finds the best management regime for different rotations as the solution progresses. Precommercial thinning accelerates diameter growth and will affect later <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> entries. <b>Commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> lengthens rotation and fertilization increases site capacity and raises optimal stocking level. The solution technique developed also finds the optimal management for different initial stand conditions. Plantation is solved by assuming that it is equivalent to a stand precommercially thinned at age two. The impact of individual silvicultural practices and their interactive effects are derived. Under the revenue and cost assumptions used, it is found that fertilization has the highest economic impact, <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> is the second and precommercial thinning is the last, when silvicultural practices are considered individually. The highest total effect of two silvicultural practices is precommercial thinning and <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning.</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> and fertilization is the second and precommercial thinning and fertilization is the last. Precommercial thinning and <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> has the highest interactive effect, <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> and fertilization is the second and precommercial thinning and fertilization is the last which is negative. The interactive effect of precommercial thinning, <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> and fertilization is positive, that is to say, when these practices are applied together, the total effect is larger than the sum of individual effects. The techniques developed and discussed give practical answers to questions of stand level optimization with complex cost, revenue and growth model silvicultural interactions...|$|E
30|$|Many forest {{managers}} expect greater sawlog volume increment {{and shorter}} rotations after a stand has been precommercially thinned (Pothier 2002). It {{has been reported}} that the strategy of precommercial thinning depends on the aims of stand management, such as even spacing, high yield, or both quality and yield (Vuokila 1972; Ruha and Varmola 1997; Varmola and Salminen 2004). Ruha and Varmola (1997) stated that the intensity of precommercial thinning depends on the aim of the first <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning.</b> Our results confirmed that optimal thinning regimes vary with different forest bioenergy policies. In contrast to Ruha and Varmola (1997), in the present study the whole rotation was taken into account, not only the first <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning.</b> The positive effects of precommercial thinning on diameter and volume growth at the first <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> were reported for balsam fir by Pothier (2002), and for lodgepole pine by Johnstone (2005). However, they pointed out that {{there were no significant differences}} in merchantable volume at maturity (Pothier 2002) or, even after 20  years (Johnstone 2005). Meanwhile, Pothier (2002) found that the effect of precommercial thinning on rotation length depends on the management goals. This is supported by the results of the present study. With Policy II, the rotation length was somewhat shortened for dense stands.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the timing and {{intensity}} of precommercial thinning on the stand diameter develop-ment and wood production in Scots pine stands was addressed. A model was developed {{in order to assess}} the thinning response of the stand diameter development. The effect of precommercial and first <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> on the stand volume and the thinning removal at first <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> were also modelled. The models were developed to be applicable for forest manage-ment planning purposes. The results are based on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trials (13 experiments and 169 plots) located in Southern and Central Finland. Precommercial thinning considerably enhanced the diameter development. Precommercial thinning (at Hdom 3 m to 2000 trees per hectare) increased the mean diameter by 15 % at the first <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> stage (Hdom 14 m) compared to the unthinned stand (3000 trees ha– 1). Early and intensive precommercial thinning resulted in the strongest response in diameter develop-ment. Wide spacing also enhanced the diameter increment. In naturally regenerated stands the diameter development was ca 13 % slower than that in seeded stands. The total volume at the time of first <b>commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> was affected by the timing of thin-ning and the stand structure. The volume of merchantable thinning removal depended on the timing and intensity of precommercial and first commercial thinnings. Delaying the first com-mercial thinning from 12 meters (Hdom) to 16 meters increased the volume of thinning removal by ca. 70 %. The early and light precommercial thinning (Hdom 3 m, to density of 3000 trees per hectare) increased the thinning removal by 40 % compared to the late and intensive precom-mercial thinning (at 7 meters to the density of 2000 trees per hectare) ...|$|E

40|$|The Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) (Dendroctonus frontalis) is {{a native}} pest of pine trees in the Southeast US. It is the most {{significant}} pest of forests in the region (Fettig et al., 2007). The potential effect of silvicultural treatments on reducing damages from southern pine beetle depends on treatments and the assumed probability of damages in a region. This research evaluated the stand level benefits and costs of prevention treatments used to reduce damages from Southern Pine Beetles. For the 13 southern states, a broad set of treatments were applied to a set of representative stands to characterize the SPB Prevention Program impacts. The representative stands were used in a growth and yield model and were projected into the future under various conditions and treatments. The products from the growth and yield model were then used to estimate soil expectation value (SEV), which was adjusted to account for the risk associated with the probability of tree mortality from SPB (Martell, 1980). The probability of tree mortality from SPB was generated from United States Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data across the Southeast (Pye et al., 2008).

This chamber is connected to the existing scanning tunneling microscopy chamber via a gate valve, and both chambers can operate independently. Various instruments such as a mass spectrometer, quartz crystal microbalance, ion source, and sample manipulator were installed on the preparation chamber.

40|$|Abstract. Vanadium microalloyed steels {{with high}} yield {{strength}} (≈ 600 MPa), good toughness and ductility {{have been successfully}} produced in <b>commercial</b> <b>thin</b> slab casting plants employing direct rolling after casting. Because of the high solubility of VN and VC, most of the vanadium {{is likely to remain}} in solution during casting, equalisation and rolling. While some vanadium is precipitated in austenite as cuboids and pins the grain boundaries, a major fraction is available for dispersion strengthening of ferrite. Despite a coarse as-cast grain size, significant grain refinement can be achieved by repeated recrystallisation during hot rolling. Consequently, a fine and uniform ferrite grain structure is produced in the final strip. Increasing the V and N levels increases dispersion strengthening which occurs together with a finer ferrite grain size. The addition of titanium to a vanadium containing steel, decreases the yield strength due to the formation of V-Ti(N) particles in austenite during both casting and equalisation. These large particles reduced the amount of V and N available for subsequent precipitation of fine (~ 5 nm) V rich dispersion strengthening particles in ferrite...|$|R
