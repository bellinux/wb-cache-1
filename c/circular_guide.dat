5000|$|Production of Benjarong is {{a process}} known to only small {{communities}} of Thai artists which have passed down the knowledge from generation to generation. The artisan who makes Benjarong {{has to be very}} skillful and careful. The production process is needs a skilled labor. How the Benjarong is made and how the patterns are painted, are glamorous and all considered as the masterpieces. In the porcelain selection, only white porcelain (Bone China and Royal Porcelain) which had been fired at the proper temperature (1150-1280 degree Celsius) for many hours, are selected. White ware must not have any flaw. After we get all required white wares, cleaning is the next process. During this process, it is necessary to avoid oily surface from sweaty and dirty hand. In drawing process, we use hypodermic syringe or paint brush to draw line. The process begins with drawing the <b>circular</b> <b>guide</b> lines on the Thai porcelain on a turning wheel, which is manually controlled. While drawing on the design, the artist will keep the sample pattern in front of him so he can draw the pattern correctly. The initial pattern drawing is very crucial to how the design will turn out, so it will be done by the well-experienced artist (usually drawn by a master craftsman). This is the reason why the pattern is drawn in very fine lines on each Benjarong. In painting process, there are various colors of paint but basically we use five main colors (black, green, yellow, red and white). The specialized paint for Benjarong needs a skillful painter. The paint is made from mineral colors and must be well crushed and mixed with water in proper ratio. The crushing equipment is ceramic or equivalent material mortar. The paint should not be too thick or thin. If the paint is too thick, it will not be completely fired and the color will not be shown as expected. If the paint is too thin, the color will fade. Also, the paint must not overlap with any line of the other color. At the final stage of painting, the 18 karat gold might be added to the rims {{in order to make it}} look glamorous. The next step after painting is firing. Painted wares will be put in the kiln. The spaces between them are 0.5 - 1 cm unless you want the painted wares to touch each other and might get damaged to pattern that painted after firing. The temperature in the kiln is controlled between 800 to 1000◦C and takes about 10 hours firing time. The Benjarong must be put in the kiln five times. After finished firing, the Benjarong will be cooled down; then take it off from the kiln. Once the Benjarong has been fired, it can be seen as three dimensional bubble of paint on the surface, which is the reason why Benjarong is unique. At the end of production, there will a quality control. The slightest mistake in any process would ruin the design and fame of Benjarong. Any mistake is unacceptable. Benjarong supposed to be perfect in every respect. If the mistake is found, it will be sent back to the studio or might throw it away. In fact, this is very rare to happen because during each stage the artists take good care of each individual piece. (Blobiztar Company Limited) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the theory of spontaneous emission in the context of cavity QED and the guiding of atoms by laser light in confined geometries. We focus on three different geometrical shapes of waveguide, namely the parallel plate guide and two kinds of cylindrical waveguide: one with a rectangular cross section and another with a circular cross section. These waveguides are assumed to be characterised by two distinct properties. Firstly, all three types of guide have perfect conductor boundary conditions, which means that the guide walls are infinitely conducting and, consequently, lossless. Secondly, the guides are assumed to have subwavelength dimensions (less than the atom electric dipole transition wavelength #lambda#). The first consequence of this is that the spontaneous emission process is possible only via a few cavity modes. For each type of structure, we examine the confinement of electromagnetic fields within it and proceed to quantise these fields by following the standard procedure, incorporating the boundary conditions at the guide walls. This allows the position-dependent spontaneous emission rate to be evaluated for an electric dipole located at an arbitrary point within the guide. Asymptotic limits of the spontaneous emission rate are then derived which serve as useful checks of the calculations. For the rectangular guide, we are able to recover the results appropriate for the parallel-plate case when side a of the rectangular cross section becomes large, while side b is kept fixed. For the <b>circular</b> <b>guide,</b> we are able to recover the results appropriate for the free space case when the radius of the guide becomes large. The second part of the thesis deals with the theory of the motion of atoms in the spatially varying light fields inside the three different shapes of waveguide. In each structure we examine the forces that act on the atom and solve the equation of motion leading to the atom dynamics when an electric dipole within the guide is subject to an excited p-polarised cavity mode. The characteristics of the atomic motion in the guide {{in the presence of a}} cavity mode are then explored. We show that under these conditions the atom becomes subject to a transverse dipole potential and a dissipative force, both of which vary across the guide and are also functions of the atom velocity along the mode propagation direction. The dipole potential is responsible for the transverse trapping (and hence the channelling) of atoms at specific regions of the cross section, while the dissipative force controls the longitudinal motion of the channelled atoms. The conditions facilitating atom guiding are explored using typical parameters for sodium atoms in guides of subwavelength dimensions. The roles of the van der Waals and Casimir-Polder potentials on the atomic motion in waveguides is clarified theoretically in the context of the parallel-plate guide and we show that such potentials are effective only at relatively short distances from the guide walls. Finally, we show that atomic motion in a hollow <b>circular</b> <b>guide</b> is subject to a quantised torque arising from the orbital angular momentum effects associated with any excited waveguide mode of order l > 0. We find that an appropriately detuned atom immersed in such a mode may be trapped radially in a vibrational state and be made to exhibit novel rotational effects associated with the light torque, including a rotational frequency shift.

30|$|Since Stewart’s initial {{use of a}} 6 -DOF {{parallel}} manipulator as {{a flight}} simulator in 1965 [3], this approach has become standard. Over the past five decades, the Stewart parallel manipulator {{has been used to}} make significant contributions to aeronautical research [4 – 7]. Even so, there is still the disadvantage of the Stewart-type flight simulator in that its posture rotation range is less than 30 °. The limitation of the posture range of a Stewart parallel manipulator hinders its ability to serve as a flight simulator of a fighter-aircraft. The motion of a fighter-aircraft involves continuous 360 ° rolling frequently. In order to achieve continuous 360 ° rolling, Kim et al. [8] presented an innovative motion base as a flight simulator, based on a 6 -DOF parallel mechanism, called Eclipse-II. The Eclipse-II allows continuous 360 ° rotation in A, B, and C-axes as well as translational motions in X, Y, and Z-axes. However, the rotations of the Eclipse-II parallel manipulator are achieved by two <b>circular</b> <b>guide</b> rails, which severely affect the dynamical performance. As a matter of fact, in both the Stewart and Eclipse-II simulators, translational movements are nearly inoperative. Low-cost flight simulator with a reduced-DOF (less than six) platform was proposed by Pouliot and Gosselin [9], which revealed result comparable to those of a 6 -DOF Stewart platform. Subsequently, Shui et al. [10] proposed a more advanced and innovative reconfigurable spherical motion generator to enable continuous spherical motion of the flight simulator. The mechanism enables unlimited workspace with respect to 3 -DOF spherical motion with rapid, continuous, and precise motion capabilities. However, it is actuated by an electromagnetic motor with a highly complicated configuration that causes the volume of manipulator to be huge. So far, no parallel manipulator {{can be used as a}} flight simulator to accomplish a 360 ° continuous rotation in practice.|$|E

It also gives approximate solutions for transmission through a layer of viscous fluid when the boundaries of the guide are pressure-free and when they are rigid but not lubricated.

Conventional pillbox window designs are capable of transmitting peak rf powers up to about 30 MW, well below the desired level required {{for the use of}} a single window per tube. SLAC has developed a 75 MW TE{sub 01 } window [1] that uses a 'traveling wave' design to minimize fields at the window face. Irises match to the dielectric window impedance, resulting in a pure traveling wave in the ceramic and minimum fields on the window face. The use of the TE{sub 01 } mode also has zero electric field on the braze fillet. Unfortunately, in-band resonances prevented this window design from achieving the desired 75 MW power level.
