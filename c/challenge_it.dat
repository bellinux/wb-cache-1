5|$|In 2003, the IAU officially {{released}} a statement to define what constitutes an extrasolar planet and what constitutes an orbiting star. To date, it remains the only official decision reached by the IAU on this issue. The 2006 committee {{did not attempt to}} <b>challenge</b> <b>it,</b> or to incorporate it into their definition, claiming that the issue of defining a planet was already difficult to resolve without also considering extrasolar planets.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{demands a}} high level of {{physical}} activity. Like many other herding dog breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities. It will appreciate a walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and <b>challenge</b> <b>it,</b> and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.|$|E
5|$|As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of {{decreased}} {{involvement with}} his firm. The staff {{had begun to}} shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set {{to work on his}} last major project as active partner: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of high culture as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission {{in part because of the}} unique <b>challenge</b> <b>it</b> presented.|$|E

5|$|On June 30, 2012, the State Attorney {{brought a}} motion to remand Blythe in pre-trial detention, as he {{considered}} Blythe a flight risk. During a hearing conducted the same day, judge Petr Fassati of the Prague 8 District Court ruled that Blythe {{will be held on}} remand, with the possibility of a bail of CZK 4,000,000 (~ US$ 200,000), Blythe's alleged annual income; Blythe was held in Pankrác Prison. Bail was deposited in the court's bank account on mid-day of July 3, 2012. After this, the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to <b>challenge</b> <b>it</b> by filing a complaint. Due to public holidays it was not until July 9, 2012, that the State Attorney filed his complaint, which was to be dealt with by appellate court, the Prague Municipal Court.|$|E
5|$|The PHL {{lasted only}} two seasons. Over {{the next two}} decades, other leagues and clubs {{occasionally}} issued challenges, but none were accepted by the Cup's trustees. Since 1926, no non-NHL team has played for the Cup, leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL. In addition, with no major professional hockey league left to <b>challenge</b> <b>it,</b> the NHL began calling its league champions the world champions, notwithstanding {{the lack of any}} interleague championship. In doing so, the NHL copied a policy that had been adopted by the then still-fledgling National Football League from its start in 1920 (and which the National Basketball Association would also assert upon its founding in 1946).|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering <b>challenge.</b> <b>It</b> would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E

5|$|In 1777, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc {{introduced}} the Supremum Justitiæ Magistratum (Collegiate Tribunal of the Jury's Supreme Magistrate) {{in order to}} establish more separation of powers in judicial decisions. Giandonato Rogadeo, an eminent European jurist, was requested to come to Malta in 1781 by de Rohan to address issues related to common law. Rogadeo went on to author the Diritto Municipale, between the year of his arrival and 1784, a law book to be used for the Castellania. During his stay in Malta, he further observed that it was not the law which was just problematic but also the judges and advocates which were corrupt. His work was opposed by the advocates and judges, with Baron Gaetano Pisani and Judge Gio Nicoló Muscat anonymously publishing works in Rome in 1783 to <b>challenge</b> <b>it</b> and aiming to keep the status quo which had limited considerations. It became the primarily Maltese law of the Code de Rohan, a humane set of laws, which brought significant reformation to criminal law. The Code incorporated previous laws introduced from former Grand Masters with a more liberal approach. It also set standard regulations for advocates, with some flexibility. It was subsequently amended with the use of bandi. The Diritto Municipale was abolished in 1854, during the British period, and replaced by a more lenient Criminal Code.|$|E
5|$|While ashore {{during the}} peace Macnamara {{contrived}} to become {{embroiled in a}} duel. While walking his Newfoundland dog in Hyde Park on 6 April 1803 he had an altercation with Colonel Robert Montgomery, when their dogs began fighting. Harsh words were exchanged, and the two parties fought a duel that evening at Chalk Farm. Both men were wounded, the colonel mortally. Macnamara was arrested {{on a charge of}} manslaughter and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 22 April. Macnamara defended himself from the charge on the grounds that he had received an affront and that it was necessary for him to <b>challenge</b> <b>it</b> in order to maintain his position as a naval officer. He summoned many of his naval friends, among whom Viscounts Hood and Nelson, Lord Hotham, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Captains Martin, Towry, Lydiard, Moore and Waller; and General Churchill and Lord Minto, to testify in his defence. They supported his assertion that he was the 'reverse of quarrelsome' and the jury took ten minutes to acquit him.|$|E
