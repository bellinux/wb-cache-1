40|$|Purpose. To {{estimate}} {{influence of}} elastic deformations {{of the track}} cable arising at movement of cars, on effort in a hauling rope of the aerial ropeway. Methodology. The method of consecutive approaches was used for research influence of elastic deformations of a track cable on effort in a hauling rope. Thus, definition of a tension of a track cable was carried out with use of the technique based on principles of modular configuration, the essence of which consists in formation of mathematical model {{by a combination of}} blocks of the formulas describing balance of the track cable on supports. Findings. The research has shown that influence of elastic deformations of a track cable on effort in a hauling rope was insignificant (less than 1 %). That points to possibility not to consider change of the track cable length, caused by its elastic properties, when modeling loading of elements of system «drive – <b>traction</b> <b>rope</b> – tension device». Also it has been found that use of the tension device of a track cable increased influence of its elastic properties on loading of rope system elements. At the same time the elastic component of the track cable tension in the test flight does not depend on a car position in the adjacent span, but only determines by the parameters of the rope system. Originality. The possibility of excluding the changes of track cable length caused by its elastic properties, when modeling loading of elements of system «drive – <b>traction</b> <b>rope</b> – tension device» was proved. Practical value. The use of these techniques and the results will simplify the mathematical model of loading of elements of the cable system and the system «drive – <b>traction</b> <b>rope</b> – tension device» as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Bream pond {{aquaculture}} plays a {{very important}} role in China's aquaculture industry and is the main source of aquatic products. To regulate and control pond water quality and sediment, a movable solar pond aquaculture water quality regulation machine (SMWM) was designed and used. This machine is solar-powered and moves on water, and its primary components are a solar power supply device, a sediment lifting device, a mechanism for walking on the water's surface and a control system. The solar power supply device provides power for the machine, and the water walking mechanism drives the machine's motion on the water. The sediment lifting device orbits the main section of the machine and affects a large area of the pond. Tests of the machine's mechanical properties revealed that the minimum illumination necessary for the SMWM to function is 13, 000 Lx and that its stable speed on the water is 0. 02 - 0. 03 m/s. For an illumination of 13, 000 - 52, 500 Lx, the sediment lifting device runs at 0. 13 - 0. 35 m/s, and its water delivery capacity is 110 - 208 m(3) /h. The sediment lifting device is able to fold away, and the angle of the suction chamber can be adjusted, making the machine work well in ponds at different water depths from 0. 5 m to 2 m. The optimal distance from the sediment lifting device {{to the bottom of the}} pond is 10 - 15 cm. In addition, adjusting the length of the connecting rod and the direction of the <b>traction</b> <b>rope</b> allows the SMWM to work in a pond water area greater than 80 %. The analysis of water quality in Wuchang bream (Parabramis pekinensis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) culture ponds using the SMWM resulted in decreased NH 3 (+) -N and available phosphorus concentrations and increased TP concentrations. The TN content and the amount of available phosphorus in the sediment were reduced. In addition, the fish production showed that the SMWM enhanced the yields of Wuchang bream and silver carp by more than 30 % and 24 %, respectively. These results indicate that the SMWM may be suitable for Wuchang bream pond aquaculture in China and that it can be used in pond aquaculture for regulating and controlling water quality...|$|R

40|$|In practice, a {{continuum}} structure is usually designed to <b>carry</b> the <b>traction</b> {{applied to the}} boundary of the structure subject to prescribed displacements imposed on its boundary. The design domains of practical structures are often limited and significantly affect the final optimal design of the structures.

A level set based optimization algorithm is developed and implemented with several robust and efficient numerical techniques, which include the level set regularization algorithm, gradient projection algorithm, nonlinear velocity mapping algorithm and return mapping algorithm.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} on the strip road where longitudinal slopes were determined by the leveling method {{as well as individual}} distances of the strip road of uniform slope. Skidders were used for <b>carrying</b> out <b>traction</b> tests in downhill and uphill skidding of 9 different loads. Measurement of wheel loads, wheel torques and components of rope force was performed by tensiometric method and remote transferring of measurement signal. According to the results of research, by the increase of longitudinal slope, more tractive force is used for overcoming the terrain slope than for overcoming the traction resistance. In downhill skidding, the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) acts in the skidder travel direction and hence its value is higher than the traction resistance. Torque distribution depends on the skidder wheel vertical load. In uphill skidding, torques increase proportionally to the vertical component of rope forces and adhesive weight of the skidder. In downhill skidding, the skidder wheel torques are negative, because they are not used for achieving wheel tractive force and instead, the transmission of torque through the transmission system causes skidder’s braking performance. The skidder’s need for braking arises under influence of the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) that acts {{in the direction of the}} skidder travel and under its effect the traction resistances are overcome. It can be concluded that in case of downhill skidding we cannot speak of achieving real tractive force because the skidder pulls the load only by its weight, and the transmittion from engine to wheels is not used for achieving the tractive force...|$|R

40|$|The Borel Family From Neuchâtel to San Francisco : From {{shoemaker}} to banker Did {{you know}} that the Cable Car was owned by Swiss citizens? BACKTRACKING : PRIVATE FINANCING OF PUBLIC METROPOLITAN INFRASTRUCTURES Executive Summary: Did {{you know that}} one of San Francisco most famous fixtures, the Cable car, was owned by Swiss citizens? Through this detailed study of the Borel family, and its business and investment plans we will observe an example of private financing of public metropolitan infrastructures in the 19 th Century and see if it can teach us lessons for tomorrow’s needs? TOPICS Looking at today’s infrastructures, one does not always remember how much work contracting firms had to accomplish in order to produce our contemporary standard of urban comfort. What is to be said of yesterday’s planners or engineers and the credit they deserve? We often hear stories of local events brought to epic proportions, but who are the responsible players who really proved the feasibility of regional infrastructures? Who actually did support, sponsor or finance such achievements? The present study is a trial to propose a new view over such apparently hidden business phenomenons. This research shows us an inspiring case-study of local entrepreneurs who gather key success-factors. The author concentrates on the economic aspect of infrastructure financing to which modern metropolitan society owes its specific urban growth. Contemporary challenges such as job creation, globalisation, technology transfer and local economic development are all interconnected to metropolitan development. XIXTH CENTURY METROPOLITAN INFRASTRUCTURES FINANCING Le Temps, 30 th July 1998, D. Masmejan : «Alfred Borel, Auguste’s elder son, enters the finance world. He meets an extraordinary businessman fate. His understanding of the economic impact of the Californian Gold Rush allows him to seize the opportunity of the westward American expansionism. He sails to San Francisco in 1855 where he is the founder of the «Alfred Borel & Company», followed in 1856 by a Mortgage fund (the “Caisse Hypothécaire” bank). The same year sees the foundation of Credit Suisse in Zurich. Alfred Borel investment bank participates in very important infrastructure projects in California and elsewhere {{in the second half of}} the XIXth century. At first, its investment into the worldwide famous San Francisco Cable Car is marginal and then becomes overwhelming. Other investments include the “Los Angeles Railway Company” or the “United Railroad Company”, the San Francisco Waterworks, other banks and real estate. » DETAILED RESEARCH ALLOWING TO UNDERSTAND FINANCIAL DECISION MAKING The author reviews financial decision-making through personal correspondence and private accounting in some of those completely documented yearly archives. The «sixth Switzerland» well-connected to the Presbyterian «Huguenot International» cosmopolitan network leads us to detailed research and discoveries. The accounting of 1866 to 1884 goes through the 3 rd and 4 th San Francisco City real estate crises that the mortgage bankers Borel brothers had to endure. Alfred Borel faced the 2 nd Californian real estate crisis (which resulted from the first loss of public interest in gold mines in the years 1854 - 1858). Then he went back to Switzerland after the death of his father and uncles in order to reconstitute the Swiss end of the pipe connecting his bank’s investors to the Borel family network. He left duty of the day-to-day San Francisco business to his younger brother Antoine after having set up asset management rules. Together both brothers explored new ways of diversifying the investment of the funds they are managing and place them into infrastructures networks. Taking shares «upstream» into equipment industries (for instance the wire works delivering the precise <b>traction</b> <b>rope</b> of cable cars) or other real estate assets, allowed them to guarantee superior interests payments to European investors or creditors in comparison with other financial markets. This anticyclical economic strategy set up their financial success that occurred during the 5 th local economic recession, which coincides with the beginning of the big worldwide Victorian economic crisis (1880 - 1895). UNIQUE SPECIFICITY OF THIS RESEARCH This research process is rarely accomplished in engineering and architecture schools, construction and infrastructures institutes or research centers. The integrity of construction professionals precludes their questioning « where does the whole process originate from?». Builders ultimately considered themselves as «honest craftsmen» that have to dedicate their energy and resources to the proper technical execution of the clients wishes and orders. Customers duty is then to write the project’s specifications and thus to initiate its process. The author of this case-study demonstrates the feasibility of comparisons between similar structural change periods in the XIXth century and the years 1990 - 2000. Hence, a new theme of interdisciplinary studies for engineers could be implemented by promoting this systemic approach between urban infrastructure financiers, suppliers and users. Last but not least, the insider observations and outsider revelations which are featured in this work are seldom considered in an engineering historical approach. It is not often that an author with a contemporary outsider vision has access to family archives that entirely document bicentennial confidential banker correspondence...|$|R
40|$|Long moving {{vertical}} {{ropes and}} cables {{are used in}} various engineering systems. In particular, in high-rise structures traction drive elevators they are employed {{as a means of}} car and counterweight suspension and for compensation of tensile forces over the <b>traction</b> sheave. Also, <b>ropes</b> are applied in the elevator governor systems to activate the safety gear in order to bring the car and counterweight safely to rest in the event of emergency and failure of the normal stopping system. An adverse situation arises when the host structure is excited near its fundamental natural frequency and vibrates harmonically. This often results in a passage through resonance conditions in the rope system when the slowly varying natural frequencies of the ropes approach the frequency of the inertial load resulting from the building sway. The nature of such a loading is usually nondeterministic and it is necessary to apply stochastic models to analyze the dynamic responses of the ropes. In this paper a model to describe the lateral dynamic behaviour of a vertical moving rope is developed. The model takes into account the fact that the longitudinal elastic stretching of the ropes is coupled with their transverse motions which results in cubic nonlinear terms. The governing nonstationary nonlinear equations are then solved numerically to investigate the passage through resonance conditions arising during the elevator travel. Then, the methodology to account for the stochastic nature of the building sway is discussed and the differential equations governing the second-order statistical moments of the state vector are developed. The stochastic differential equations are treated numerically to predict the variance of the rope response...|$|R
