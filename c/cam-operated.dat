5000|$|The motor {{consists}} of a freely rotating rotor, surrounded {{by a number of}} electromagnets. The rotor is made of a light brass wheel, with a number of soft iron bars or [...] "attractors" [...] mounted around its rim and parallel to the axis.

50|$|Earlier diesel pumps used an in-line layout with {{a series}} of <b>cam-operated</b> {{injection}} cylinders in a line, rather like a miniature inline engine. The pistons have a constant stroke volume, and injection volume (i.e., throttling) is controlled by rotating the cylinders against a cut-off port that aligns with a helical slot in the cylinder. When all the cylinders are rotated at once, they simultaneously vary their injection volume to produce more or less power from the engine. Inline pumps still find favour on large multi-cylinder engines such as those on trucks, construction plant, static engines and agricultural vehicles.|$|E

Sickels even went to England, where he also obtained patents on his steering device, but having failed to sell his invention there either, he returned in 1867 to the U.S. In 1891 he patented a <b>cam-operated</b> actuating mechanism for steam poppet valves (relating back to his 1842 patent), superseding the complex mechanism he patented in 1845 and had re-issued with further documentation in 1860.|$|E
50|$|The bucket belt {{was driven}} by another small steam engine mounted {{on the left side}} of the firebox, near the top. The main shaft of this engine had {{adjustable}} cams which operated three steam cocks that supplied steam jets to the coal delivery orifices. From the central receiver, a cone-shaped tray directed the coal to the right, centre or left sides as required, while the <b>cam-operated</b> steam jets blew the coal into the firebox. When coal was only required at the back end of the firebox, the cams could be projected a short distance, thereby allowing steam jets of just sufficient power to project the coal to the required parts of the firebox.|$|E
50|$|Later Otto engines {{employed}} a small magneto {{directly on the}} engine. Rather than tripping a switch, the spark plug firing arm applies a quick rotation to the magneto rotor, which then snaps back under spring tension. This quick rotation of the magneto coil produces a very brief current flow that fires the spark plug and ignites the fuel. This design {{has the advantage of}} requiring no external battery, and is how modern portable gas engines operate, incorporating the magnet portion of the magneto into the flywheel. Modern portable engines excite the magneto with every flywheel rotation, and so use a <b>cam-operated</b> electric switch to prevent plug firing except for the power stroke of the engine (see wasted spark).|$|E
5000|$|In 1937 Roe, {{writing for}} the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, framed the {{importance}} of the Fay automatic lathe to the capabilities of machine tools by saying that, [...] "This machine does for the engine lathe what Spencer did for the old hand-operated turret lathe." [...] These machines took an entire class of turned work formerly requiring an operator to execute the series of movements necessary to shape a piece of metal (manual control) and allowed the same work to be done automatically. This step forward in automation lowered a manufacturer's unit expense per part by reducing labor costs. Today, numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools such as turning centers, turn-mills, and rotary transfer machines have largely supplanted <b>cam-operated</b> automatics.|$|E
5000|$|The Mk. 1 and Mk. 1A {{computer}} integrator discs {{required a}} particularly elaborate system to provide constant and precise drive speeds.

Although the speed oscillated slightly, the total inertia made it effectively a constant-speed motor. At each tick, contacts switched on motor power, then the motor opened the contacts again. It {{was in effect}} slow pulse-width modulation of motor power according to load. When running, the computer had a unique sound as motor power was switched on and off at each tick—dozens of gear meshes inside the cast-metal computer housing spread out the ticking into a [...] "chunk-chunk" [...] sound.|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{maturation}} of CNC, {{the implicit}} dichotomy of [...] "manual versus automatic" [...] still exists, but because CNC is so ubiquitous, the term [...] "automatic" [...] has {{lost some of}} its distinguishing power. All CNC machine tools are automatic, but (perhaps therefore) the usage of the machining industries does not routinely call them by that term. The term [...] "automatic", when it is used at all, still often refers implicitly to <b>cam-operated</b> machines. Thus a [...] "plain old" [...] 2-axis CNC lathe is not referred to as an [...] "automatic lathe" [...] (even though it is, literally speaking, automatic). However, within the machining subspecialty of Swiss-type CNC turning centers, the word [...] "automatic" [...] is often used freely for cam-op and CNC alike (for example, DMG Mori and Tsugami call their Swiss-type CNCs [...] "automatic lathes").|$|E
50|$|They {{produced}} {{a new model}} for the 1954 Dairy Show, which was marketed as the Electruk Rider 25 cwt model. The chassis was constructed out of box-section beams, with the batteries mounted on either side between the wheels. The motor was mounted in {{the centre of the}} vehicle, and drove the rear axle through double reduction gearing. A 16-cell Tudor battery was fitted as standard, and its 161 Amp-hour capacity gave a range of around 16 mi. Power for the motor was supplied by a mechanically operated controller, while the hydraulic brakes were manufactured by Lockhead, and the <b>cam-operated</b> steering gear by Bishop. One unusual feature was that the steering wheel was mounted vertically, but this enabled the cab to be relatively short, improving visibility for the driver. The model showcased included a full width dairy cabinet behind the cab, divided vertically by a shelf, and fitted with two windows on either side.|$|E
5000|$|Larger <b>cam-operated</b> {{automatic}} lathes were (and still are) usually called automatic chucking lathes, {{automatic lathes}}, automatic chuckers, automatics, or chuckers. The [...] "chucker" [...] {{part of the}} name {{comes from the fact}} that the workpieces are usually discrete blanks, held in a bin called a [...] "magazine", and each one takes a turn at being chucked (gripped by the machine for being worked on) and cut. (This is analogous to the way that each round of ammunition in the magazine of a semi-automatic pistol gets its turn at being chambered.) The blanks are either individual forgings or castings, or they are pre-sawed pieces of billet. However, some members of this family of machine tools turn bar work or work on centers (for example, the Fay automatic lathe). Regarding bar work of large diameter (for example, 150 mm or more), it is merely an academic point whether it is called [...] "screw machine work" [...] or just [...] "automatic work".|$|E
5000|$|Small- to {{medium-sized}} <b>cam-operated</b> {{automatic lathes}} were (and still are) usually called screw machines or automatic screw machines. These machines work on parts that (as a rough guide only) are usually less than 80 mm {{in diameter and}} less than 300 mm long. Screw machines almost invariably do bar work, which means that an entire length of bar stock (anywhere from 1 to 4 m in length) passes through the spindle and is gripped by the chuck (which is usually a collet chuck). As the part is being machined, {{the entire length of}} bar stock is turning with the spindle. When the part is done, it is [...] "parted off" [...] from the bar, the chuck un-clamps, the bar is fed forward, and the chuck then closes again, ready for the next cycle. The bar-feeding can happen by various means, including pulling-finger tools that grab the bar and pull or roller bar feed that pushes the bar from behind.|$|E
5000|$|The Victoria {{line was}} to be {{equipped}} for automatic operation, and the driver {{was replaced by a}} [...] "train operator", with responsibility for shutting the doors, and then pressing two buttons simultaneously to start the train, after which the train would move under automatic control until the next station was reached. However, a single controller to allow the trains to be driven manually in the depot or in emergency while in service was provided. This incorporated both traction control and braking. Door controls were provided in the cabs, and a facility to isolate either of the two units from the leading cab was also included. For the first time on tube stock, all control circuits were switched by <b>cam-operated</b> micro-switches. They were used on the traction and brake controller, the disconnecting units, the fault isolating switches, the door controls and other control equipment, and resulted in a significant reduction in the routine electrical inspection needing to be carried out.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{development}} and dissemination of CNC lathes, which themselves often have automated turrets, manual turret lathes began to lose their position {{as the key to}} mass production of turned parts. However, they did not become obsolete; the focus of their use simply shifted from the main turning operations of mass production, which are now usually done by CNCs, to small runs, for which they can still compete in unit cost with CNC use, and second operations, such as re-chucking a part turned out by a CNC {{in order to make a}} few simple cuts on the back. This transition in primary job description is reflected in the name [...] "second-operation lathe", which is often synonymous with [...] "manual turret lathe". Similarly, <b>cam-operated</b> screw machines and chuckers did not disappear; they simply shifted to a different niche. They still often compete with CNC machines in terms of unit cost per part produced, depending on the difference in overhead. A CNC lathe with hefty payments may translate to higher overall costs than a screw machine or chucker that is long since paid for.|$|E
5000|$|A related {{characteristic}} of <b>cam-operated</b> chuckers {{is that they}} are fading into history faster than most other non-CNC machine tool classes. This is because the few companies that have them tend to be forced to continually adapt to the latest state of the art (which today is all CNC) in order to compete and thus survive. Cam-op chuckers may end up in scrap yards more easily than other types of non-CNC machine tools. Unlike with [...] "Grandpa's South Bend lathe" [...] or [...] "Dad's old Bridgeport knee mill", virtually no one can afford to keep and use them for sentimental reasons alone. As has happened with most nondigital commercial typesetting machinery (such as old Linotype machines), it seems likely that within a few decades the only examples of these machines still extant will be a few museum pieces and a few obscure pockets of abandoned inventory. This is not because they are [...] "primitive" [...] by any means—in fact, they are mechanical marvels with ingenious design and high build quality. The change simply reflects the fact that CNC and CAD/CAM have become so advanced and flexible that {{it will be hard to}} compete with them.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was made to}} {{determine the influence of}} fuel quality, injection advance angle, injection valve-opening pressure, inlet-air pressure, compression ratio, and engine speed on the time lag of auto-ignition of a Diesel fuel oil in a single-cylinder compression-ignition engine as obtained from an analysis of indicator diagrams. Three <b>cam-operated</b> fuel-injection pumps, two pumps cams, and an automatic injection valve with two different nozzles were used. Ignition lag was considered to be the interval between the start of injection of the fuel as determined with a Stroborama and the start of effective combustion as determined from the indicator diagram, the latter being the point where 4. 0 x 10 (exp- 6) pound of fuel had been effectively burned. For this particular engine and fuel it was found that: (1) for a constant start and the same rate of fuel injection up the point of cut-off, a variation in fuel quantity from 1. 2 x 10 (exp- 4) to 4. 1 x 10 (exp- 4) pound per cycle has no appreciable effect on the ignition lag; (2) injection advance angle increases or decreases the lag according to whether density, temperature, or turbulence has the controlling influence; (3) increase in valve-opening pressure slightly increases the lag; and (4) increase of inlet-air pressure, compression ratio, and engine speed reduces the lag...|$|E
40|$|Before we {{talk about}} {{brushless}} motors in detail, let’s clear up a few points about terminology. The term “brushless ” has become accepted as referring to a particular variety of servo motor. Clearly a step motor is a brushless device, as is an AC induction motor (in fact, the step motor can {{form the basis of}} a brushless servo motor, often called a hybrid servo, which is discussed later). However, the socalled “brushless ” motor has been designed to have a similar performance to the DC brush servo without the limitations imposed by a mechanical commutator. Within the brushless category are two basic motor types: trapezoidal and sine wave motors. The trapezoidal motor is really a brushless DC servo, whereas the sine wave motor bears a close resemblance to the AC synchronous motor. To fully explain the difference between these motors, we must review the evolution of the brushless motor. Fig. 1. 35 Conventional DC brush motor Brushless Motor Operation To turn this motor into a brushless design, we must start by eliminating the windings on the rotor. This can be achieved by turning the motor inside out. In other words, we make the permanent magnet the rotating part and put the windings on the stator poles. We still need some means of reversing the current automatically – a <b>cam-operated</b> reversing switch could be made to do this job (Fig. 1. 36). Obviously such an arrangement with a mechanical switch is not very satisfactory, but the switching capability of non-contacting devices tends to be very limited. However, in a servo application, we will use an electronic amplifier or drive which {{can also be used to}} do the commutation in response to low-level signals from an optical or hall-effect sensor (see Fig. 1. 37). This component is referred to as the commutation encoder. So unlike the DC brush motor, the brushless version cannot be driven by simply connecting it to a source of direct current. The current in the external circuit must be reversed at defined rotor positions. Hence, the motor is actually being driven by an alternating current...|$|E
40|$|A reliable, {{accurate}} and portable rainfall simulator {{was needed for}} vegetative and erosion control research at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) for California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and California State University Sacramento. This simulator {{was designed to be}} easily set up and maintained as well as able to create a variety of rainfall regimes. The nozzle performance tests and lateral spacing tests were performed at Cal Poly’s Erosion Research Facility. This simulator was designed and constructed based upon the principles of the Norton Ladder Type Rainfall Simulator. This simulator is the standard for research involving simulated rainfall. Construction took place at Cal Poly’s farm shop. The rainfall simulator is a pressurized no zzle type simulator with a <b>cam-operated</b> oscillating boom. It emits uniform rainfall on a plot 1 m (3 ft) wide by 3. 56 m (12 ft) long. The nozzles at 47. 6 kPa (7 psi), Spraying Systems Company’s Floodjet 3 / 8 K SS 45, emitted an average drop size of 1. 7 mm (0. 07 in) and a range of drop sizes of less than 1 mm to 7 mm (0. 04 in to 0. 3 in), correlating well to storms less than 50 mm·hr- 1 (2 in ·hr- 1) as is common on California’s Central Coast. The structure of the simulator was built from aluminum, supporting the four-nozzle boom. The nozzles are spaced 99 cm (39 inches) apart. A box with an opening of 15 cm by 11 cm (6 by 4. 5 inches) was beneath each nozzle to create the proper spray angle, critical for lateral spray uniformity. An additional opening in the box is attached to a system which returns the unused water to the storage tank. Flow meters control the inflow of water from the storage tank, ensuring each nozzle has the same discharge rate, no matter the orientation of the simulator. A computerdriven motor and cam system controls the storm intensity. The number of oscillations per minute of the nozzle across the box opening determines the intensity. Design storms resemble a bell curve, typical of California storms. The support system is collapsible, easy to set up and maintain. The resulting simulator is economical (less than $ 7, 000 to construct), made with commercially available parts, easy to set-up and maintain and highly accurate...|$|E
