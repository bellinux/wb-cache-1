500|$|After the {{original}} Leyland Olympians in plain Airline blue, the later Scania OmniDekkas {{were replaced by}} new Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodied Volvo B9TLs in March 2010. The new vehicles included [...] "E-leather" [...] upholstery (a type of manmade <b>composition</b> <b>leather</b> made from recycled waste leather offcuts), power sockets, CCTV which enables passengers on the top deck to watch their luggage on the lower deck, LED lights and free wi-fi. The vehicles cost over £200,000 each, £30,000 more than standard vehicles, and carry a two-tone blue and red livery. The previous Scanias carried a livery of white and light/dark blue, with orange detailing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Composition</b> <b>leather</b> gives {{a uniform}} finish with minimal batch-to-batch variation. It has no natural defects that are {{associated}} with real leather made from leather hides (which will always bear the marks of its natural origin). While <b>composition</b> <b>leather</b> has uniformity benefits, it must be remembered that these benefits come at a cost, which is that composition is a manmade product and is not leather. <b>Composition</b> <b>leather</b> cannot be classified as leather.|$|E
50|$|<b>Composition</b> <b>leather</b> {{claims to}} enable a higher cutting yield than leather. This {{is because the}} {{material}} is man-made from leather fibres, produced in rolls 1.4 m wide and is not derived from leather hides, as in traditional leather. However, <b>composition</b> <b>leather</b> has stretch characteristics along its warp and weft which it inherits from its fabric substrate. Consequently, it stretches more in one orientation than the other. When orientation is considered, the yield of <b>composition</b> <b>leather</b> is comparable or worse than real leather.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012 {{he participated}} {{to the project}} [...] {{commissioned}} by Italian fashion house Fendi [...] 'Fatto a Mano' involved a collaboration between Fendi artisans and artists, such as Mersh, who were commissioned to reinterpret Fendi's traditional practices. Mersh created a machine that registered his heart rate and rhythmically punched small holes in leather strips. The final installation consisted in a colourful <b>composition</b> of <b>leather</b> strips woven onto a steel framework. This interactive performance-based installation was shown at Harrods during the 'London Design Festival' and then toured to the Salone Del Mobile (Milano) and the Venice Biennale (Venice).|$|R
40|$|Concentrations of Fe, Mn, Co, Cr, Zn and Cu were determinated using flame atomic {{absorption}} spectrometry in nine lichen species of the Sul-Mato-Grossense cerrado. The average metal ion concentrations varied in the following ranges: Fe, 248. 41 - 1568. 01; Mn, 98. 50 - 397. 33; Co, 10. 08 - 24. 81; Cr, 18. 24 - 44. 26; Zn, 14. 62 - 34. 79 and Cu, 3. 23 - 7. 57 mg kg- 1.

50|$|It must {{be remembered}} that <b>composition</b> <b>leather</b> is not genuine leather and cannot legally be marketed or {{suggested}} {{to be the same}} as leather. The method of manufacture of <b>composition</b> <b>leather</b> is similar to bicast leather and has similar problems with delamination and poor aesthetic qualities associated with plastic or synthetic leather. The unique properties of skin which are transmogrified into leather (breathability, strength, elasticity, retention, flexibility, softness, durability) are the result of the interwoven helix created by collagen fibres. These elongated fibrils give leather its unique characteristics and fundamental attributes. If you grind these fibres into a powder (as practiced in <b>composition</b> <b>leather)</b> you lose all of the natural characteristics and attributes of leather. It can be argued that <b>composition</b> <b>leather</b> whilst having some matter that originated in skin, does not exhibit any of the useful properties of leather that gives it its unique qualities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Composition</b> <b>leather</b> is {{increasingly}} being adopted {{as an alternative}} to traditional leather for footwear, leather goods (including document folders, bags and wallets), airline seating, taxi seating, car upholstery, marine upholstery, commercial upholstery and domestic upholstery.|$|E
50|$|Lower-quality {{materials}} {{may suffer}} flaking {{of the surface}} material {{in as little as}} a few years, while better varieties are considered very durable and retain their pattern and color even during commercial use. Because the <b>composition</b> of bonded <b>leathers</b> and related products varies considerably (and is sometimes a trade secret), {{it may be difficult to}} predict how a given product will perform over the course of time. There is a wide range in the longevity of bonded leathers and related products; some better-quality bonded leathers are claimed to be superior in durability over low-quality genuine leather.|$|R

50|$|<b>Composition</b> <b>leather</b> is {{made from}} {{recycled}} leather off-cuts, trimmings and shavings that would normally be sent by the leather industry to landfill. The type of leather specifically used {{in the manufacture of}} <b>composition</b> <b>leather</b> is called ‘wet blue’. This raw material, which is duck-egg blue in colour (hence the name), comes straight from tanning. The shavings are bonded to a fabric layer commonly using a process such a hydro-entanglement to force the leather dust into the fabric layer. The product is then finished, typically with a polyurethane based system to give a resemblance of leather. The amount of leather shavings within the final product typically constitute less than 50% of the product.|$|E

25|$|Polishing wheels {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of types to fulfil a wide range of needs. The most common {{materials}} used for polishing wheels are wood, leather, canvas, cotton cloth, plastic, felt, paper, sheepskin, impregnated rubber, canvas <b>composition,</b> and wool; <b>leather</b> and canvas are the most common. Wooden wheels have emery or other abrasives glued onto them and are used to polish flat surfaces and maintained good edges. There are many types of cloth wheels. Cloth wheels that are cemented together are very hard and used for rough work, whereas other cloth wheels that are sewn and glued together are not as aggressive. There are cloth wheels that are not glued or cemented, instead these are sewed and have metal side plates for support. Solid felt wheels are popular for fine finishes. Hard roughing wheels can be made by cementing together strawboard paper disks. Softer paper wheels are made from felt paper. Most wheels are run at approximately 7500 surface feet per minute (SFM), however muslin, felt and leather wheels are usually run at 4000 SFM.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the obtaining of {{value-added}} products from the dust resulted from chamois leather buffering, a solid waste that raises serious disposal problems, due to its physical state and complex chemical <b>composition.</b> Starting from <b>leather</b> waste, an alkaline hydrolysis was performed followed by the chemical modification of the polypeptyde hydrolysate by polycondensation with dispersions of copolymers of vinyl acetate with acrylic esters and reticulation with glutaraldehyde in order to improve its hydrophobicity. The resulted product can be used/was tested as an ingredient in leather finishing formulations, as binder or carrier agent. In this paper, new finishing mixtures were prepared using pigments and obtained polypeptide hydrolysates as a substitute for casein in pigment pastes. By this method, there were obtained two experimental variants of brown and black pigment pastes which were compared to the pigment pastes with casein binder. Natural grain Box bovine leather samples coated with such admixtures were subjected to physico-mechanical resistance tests, in accordance with the standardized methods. Specific tests carried on finished leather – tensile strength, tear resistance, resistance to grain cracking, dry and wet rubbing fastness, flexural fatigue strength test, etc – showed values of this characteristics comparable to those obtained with casein conventional finishing. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{concerned}} with the chemical composition of two varieties hog-plum Pulp collected from Mymensingh and Barishal and developed jelly and leather. Cabinet dryer, model OV- 165 (Gallen Kamp Company) was used for dehydration of two types of hog-plum pulp and leather. The fresh and dried hog-plum and hog-plum products were analyzed for their moisture, ash, vitamin-C, pH, total soluble solids and sucrose contents. The moisture content, ash, vitamin C, pH, total soluble solid (TS), reducing sugar and non-reducing sugar of Barishal hog-plum’s was 83. 84 % (wb), 0. 81 %, 33. 00 mg/ 100 g, 2. 62, 8. 5 %, 5. 02 % and 1. 6 % respectively; Mymensingh hog-plum’s was 86. 69 % (wb), 0. 78 %, 30. 90 mg/ 100 g, 2. 7, 6. 5 %, 4. 7 % and 1. 3 % respectively. The chemical composition of Mymensingh and Braishal hog-plum showed that Barishal hog-plum contained higher solid content, ash, Vitamin C than Mymensingh hog-plum. It was found that Barishal hog-plum had higher flesh (67. 59 %) than Mymensingh hog-plum (62. 60 %). The chemical <b>composition</b> of hog-plum <b>leather</b> was analyzed for moisture, Ash, Vitamin C, TS, Titrable acidity, total sugar and protein content. The ash and sugar content of developed leathers from Barishal and Mymensingh hog-plum was very similar but the vitamin C content for developed products was very low. It was also found developed products contained higher amount and sugar and protein. It {{was found that the}} chemical compositions of developed jelly were more or less similar to the fresh hog-plum; only the vitamin C was decreased significantly.
