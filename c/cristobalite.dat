5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, <b>cristobalite</b> and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E
5|$|Fumarolic {{activity}} affects {{surrounding rocks}} and pyroclastics. Carbonates, opal, and white covers of possibly aluminum sulfate and calcium sulfate have been formed. Gypsum formed from the sulfur {{of the volcano}} {{is found in the}} form of crystals in the upper valleys of Taftan. Sinter and hydrothermally altered rocks are found farther down. Minerals formed by alteration processes include alunite, calcite, <b>cristobalite,</b> illite, jarosite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, quartz, smectite, sulfur and tridymite. Some epithermal mineralizations have been identified around Taftan. Other secondary factors at Taftan include lahars.|$|E
5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed <b>cristobalite</b> and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
50|$|In 1907 the Cristóbal Women's Club {{was founded}} and fraternal orders for men, {{including}} Masonic and Elks lodges were active. Commissaries and clubhouses were built and very active. Construction {{of housing and}} facilities expanded northward. In 1913 the present-day Hotel Washington {{was built on the}} site of a former Panama Railroad building known as the Washington House. <b>Cristobalites</b> eventually had their own commissary, post office, police, fire and railroad stations, churches, yacht club, YMCA, VFW, American Legion, several fraternal lodges and a masonic temple.|$|R
40|$|The {{inhalation}} of silica crystalline polymorphs {{leads to}} the development of pulmonary nodules that vary in extent and in fibrotic content. In this study, a single protocol was used to test different silica samples (i. e., 2 non-crystalline samples: one vitreous silica, one diatomaceous earth, 4 crystalline samples: one pure a-quartz ground in a wet atmosphere, one of the same quartz heated until it becomes oc-cristobalite and 2 <b>cristobalites</b> obtained by heating diatomaceous earth). Wistar rats received a single intra-tracheal injection of alveolar dust and were followed over a period of 3 months. The results were exploited using macroscopic examination (wet lung weight), histological examination and biochemical dosing (hydroxyproline, lipid, and silica content). The results showed that vitreous silica, diatomaceous earth, wet-ground quartz and both types of <b>cristobalites</b> are responsible {{to a greater or lesser}} extent for the pulmonary reaction typical of exposure to silica (i. e., nodules); with different cellular and fibrotic surface areas for each sample. a-cristobalite (obtained from the wet-ground quartz heated to a very high temperature; 1, 300 °C) {{leads to the}} formation of only small foreign-body granulomas. All crystalline minerals tested caused alveolar lipoproteinosis. It was thus concluded that the crystalline structure plays a less important role than the surface state in the formation of silicotic nodules...|$|R
50|$|The mid-1950s saw the {{greatest}} transformation of Cristobal. This change saw a drastic population shift of <b>Cristobalites</b> to new areas in Margarita and Coco Solo, and the redefinition of territorial boundaries which reduced {{the extension of}} the Canal Zone on Manzanillo Island. These changes came about {{as a result of the}} construction of the town of Margarita, the 1955 bilateral treaty, and the US Navy's transfer of its Coco Solo Station to the Canal Zone government. Cristóbal's population in 1955 dropped to 562, and New Cristóbal's to 1,130.|$|R
25|$|Silicosis {{is due to}} {{deposition}} of fine respirable dust (less than 10 micrometers in diameter) containing crystalline silicon dioxide {{in the form of}} alpha-quartz, <b>cristobalite,</b> or tridymite.|$|E
25|$|Crystalline silica {{exists in}} 7 {{different}} forms (polymorphs), {{depending upon the}} temperature of formation. The main 3 polymorphs are quartz, <b>cristobalite,</b> and tridymite. Quartz {{is the second most}} common mineral in the world (next to feldspar).|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{a mineral}} may change its crystal {{structure}} {{as a consequence}} of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting. For example, quartz will change into a variety of its SiO2 polymorphs, such as tridymite and <b>cristobalite</b> at high temperatures, and coesite at high pressures.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe SNC meteorites, Shergotty, Zagami, Nakhla and Chassigny, {{have been}}studied by {{analytical}} transmission electron microscopy. New phases, characteristic ofstrong shock conditions, {{have been discovered}} in Shergotty, Zagami, Nakhla andChassigny : calcium-rich majorites in Shergottty, wadsleyite with anomalously elevatediron content in Chassigny and impact melts in Shergotty, Zagami and Nakhla. <b>Cristobalites</b> (α and β polymorphs) observed in Shergotty and Zagami may also berelated to shock and are interpreted as backtransformation products of post-stishovitesilica polymorphs. Strong shocks corresponding to pressure and temperature conditionscharacteristic of the Earth’s transition zone and lower mantle have occurred in thosemeteorites. Moreover, impact melts indicate high temperature conditions in localizedareas. On the other hand, no massive impact melting is observed in those meteorites,consistently with previous descriptions. These observations evidence highlyheterogeneous shock conditions at the scale of few micrometers in these meteorites. Strongly heterogeneous conditions such as those suggested by the present study mayhelp to interpret the preservation in martian meteorites of phases practically unaffectedby shock being very close to strongly shock-metamorphized minerals...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the phases}} of SiO 2 are alpha and beta <b>cristobalites,</b> {{which have a}} long and {{somewhat}} controversial history of proposed structural assignments and phase-transition mechanisms. Recently, Zhang and Scott found new indications that the higher-temperature beta phase has space group I- 42 d and, by assuming a group-subgroup relationship between phases, they argued that the lower-temperature alpha phase should have lower symmetry {{than that of the}} widely-accepted P 4 _ 12 _ 12 space group. With this motivation, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the energy, structure, and local stability of P 4 _ 12 _ 12 and I- 42 d structures. We also compute the frequencies of the zone-center phonon modes in both structures, as well as certain zone-boundary modes in the I- 42 d structure, and compare with experiment. We then argue that the various P 4 _ 12 _ 12 and I- 42 d enantiomorphs can be grouped into three clusters, each of which is identified with a three-dimensional manifold of structures of P 2 _ 12 _ 12 _ 1 symmetry in which the P 4 _ 12 _ 12 and I- 42 d appear as higher-symmetry special cases. We find that there are relatively high energy barriers between manifolds, but low barriers within a manifold. Exploring the energy landscape within one of these manifolds, we find a minimal-energy path connecting P 4 _ 12 _ 12 and I- 42 d structures with a surprisingly low barrier of ~ 5 meV per formula unit. Possible implications for the phase-transition mechanism are discussed. Comment: 15 pages, 9 figures and 7 tables.

40|$|The {{structures}} of 94 ternary aluminates are reinterpreted {{on the basis}} of the Zintl-Klemm concept and Pearson's generalized octet rule. In aluminates of highly electropositive metals such as alkali, alkaline-earth and rare-earth metals, the Al atoms form three-dimensional skeleta which can be interpreted as if the Al atoms were behaving as Zintl polyanions, adopting the structure of either main-group elements or Zintl polyanions showing the same connectivity. The O atoms are then located close to both the hypothetical two-electron bonds and the lone pairs, giving rise to a tetrahedral coordination. When more electronegative elements, such as W or Si, are present in the compound, the electron transfer towards the Al atoms does not take place. In this case, aluminium behaves as a base, transferring its electrons to the more electronegative atoms and the coordination sphere of aluminium becomes octahedral. In some compounds the Al atoms clearly show amphoteric character so that some Al atoms act as donors (bases) and hence are octahedrally coordinated, whereas others behave as acceptors (acids), adopting a tetrahedral coordination. From this it is concluded that the coordination sphere of aluminium is not a function of the ionic radius of the Al 3 + cations, but it depends on the nature of the other cations accompanying them in the structure. The networks formed by these aluminates are, in many instances, similar to those of the binary oxides of the main-group elements. For this reason, a systematic survey of these oxides is also reported. Compounds such as stuffed <b>cristobalites</b> and trydimites and also perovskites are examples of this new interpretation. Perovskites are then reinterpreted as a stuffed pseudo-TeO 3 structure. Other families of compounds such as silicates and phosphates are susceptible to a similar interpretation. This study provides additional examples of how cations recognize themselves in spite of being embedded in an oxygen matrix. [to be completed]Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|Amorphous silica {{consists}} of kieselgur (diatomite), from the skeletons of diatoms, and vitreous silica, produced by heating and then rapid cooling of crystalline silica. Amorphous silica is less toxic than crystalline, but not biologically inert, and diatomite, when heated, can convert to tridymite or <b>cristobalite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tridymite and <b>cristobalite</b> are {{high-temperature}} polymorphs of SiO2 {{that occur}} in high-silica volcanic rocks. Coesite is a denser polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites and in metamorphic rocks formed at pressures greater than those typical of the Earth's crust. Stishovite is a yet denser and higher-pressure polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites. Lechatelierite is an amorphous silica glass SiO2 which is formed by lightning strikes in quartz sand.|$|E
25|$|Tranquillityite forms thin stripes up to 15 by 65 micrometres in size in basaltic rocks, {{where it}} was {{produced}} at a late crystallization stage. It is associated with troilite, pyroxferroite, <b>cristobalite</b> and alkali feldspar. The mineral is nearly opaque and appears dark red-brown in thin crystals. The analyzed samples contains less than 10% impurities (Y, Al, Mn, Cr, Nb and other rare-earth element) and up to 0.01% (100 ppm) of uranium. Presence of significant amount of uranium allowed to estimate the age of tranquillityite and some associated minerals in Apollo 11 samples as 3710 million years using the uranium-lead dating technique.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{obsidian}} {{is usually}} dark in appearance, though the color {{varies depending on}} the presence of impurities. Iron and other transition elements may give the obsidian a dark brown to black color. Very few samples are nearly colorless. In some stones, the inclusion of small, white, radially clustered crystals of <b>cristobalite</b> in the black glass produce a blotchy or snowflake pattern (snowflake obsidian). Obsidian may contain patterns of gas bubbles remaining from the lava flow, aligned along layers created as the molten rock was flowing before being cooled. These bubbles can produce interesting effects such as a golden sheen (sheen obsidian). An iridescent, rainbow-like sheen (rainbow obsidian) is caused by inclusions of magnetite nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, smoky quartz, morion, amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and <b>cristobalite,</b> as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are <b>cristobalite,</b> anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{morphology}} and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. The tektites which have been found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on {{the basis of}} their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed reentry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10nbsp&cm in size and 24nbsp&kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, baddeleyite, chromite, rutile, corundum, <b>cristobalite</b> and coesite.|$|E
2500|$|The only stable form {{under normal}} {{conditions}} is alpha quartz, in which crystalline silicon dioxide is usually encountered. In nature, impurities in crystalline α-quartz can {{give rise to}} colors (see list). [...] The high-temperature minerals, <b>cristobalite</b> and tridymite, have both lower densities and indices of refraction than quartz. Since the composition is identical, {{the reason for the}} discrepancies must be in the increased spacing in the high-temperature minerals. As is common with many substances, the higher the temperature, the farther apart the atoms are, due to the increased vibration energy.|$|E
2500|$|Silicon {{disulfide}} (SiS2) {{is formed}} by burning silicon in gaseous sulfur at 100°C; sublimation {{of the resulting}} compound in nitrogen results in white, flexible long fibres reminiscent of asbestos with a structure similar to W-silica.

2500|$|Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, quartz (SiO2) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity.

The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been composed {{so much that it}} had changed from a silicate structure to that of rutile (TiO2). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is α-quartz. Its counterpart, β-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to α-quartz below 573°C at 1 bar). These two polymorphs differ by a [...] "kinking" [...] of bonds; this change in structure gives β-quartz greater symmetry than α-quartz, and they are thus also called high quartz (β) and low quartz (α).|$|E
