While much {{progress has been made in}} recent years, there is still much more to learn about the way that these applications work and more efficient materials are needed to make this a feasible source of renewable energy. Theoretical chemistry is a powerful tool which can provide insight into the processes involved and the properties of materials, allowing us to predict substances that might improve the efficiency of these devices. In this work, we explore how the delta self-consistent field method performs for the calculation of Stokes shifts for conjugated dyes. We also develop a new reaction path finding method which uses a combination of trigonometric functions and information about the initial and final states in the reaction to generate an approximate path. We show that this path finding method works well for several model systems including a seven atom Lennard-Jones cluster.

Among the frontier challenges in 18 F-radiochemistry are the interconnected goals of increasing synthetic efficiency and diversity {{in the construction of}} 18 F-labelled radiotracers. 18 F-Radioretrosynthetic strategies implemented to date are typically linear sequences of transformations designed with the aim of introducing the 18 F-label ideally in the last step or at least as late as possible. Here we report that convergent 18 F-radiochemistry allows for the rapid assembly of functionalised 18 F-radiotracers from readily accessible 18 F-labelled prosthetic groups. Using multicomponent reactions for proof of concept, Ugi- 4 CR, Passerini- 3 CR, Biginelli- 3 CR and Groebke- 3 CR were performed successfully using 18 F-benzaldehydes and these highly <b>convergent</b> <b>reactions</b> delivered, in high radiochemical yield (RCY), structurally complex 18 F-radiotracers with the label positioned on an aryl motif not responsive to direct nucleophilic fluorination.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} the {{asymmetric synthesis}} of both enantiomers of the fruiting body inducing phero-mone Stigmolone was achieved successfully using the SAMP/RAMP-method. Previously {{there was no}} synthesis known which involved a regioselective alpha-alkylation of unsymmetric dialkylhydrazones (R ≠ Me). After cleavage of the auxiliary, both Stigmolone enantiomers were synthesised with very good ee-values using a Cobalt-catalysed oxidative-reductive hydratation. For {{the first time the}} Co-catalysed reaction was applied to ketofunctionalised, enantiomerically pure and racemisation sensi-tive molecules using compressed air, which is a dramatic improvement of this reaction. The yield over five steps of (R) -Stigmolone (ee = 89 %) was 6 % (18 % based on recovered starting material) and the yield of (S) -Stigmolone (ee = 93 %) was 18 % (20 % based on recovered starting material). Without further modifications of the synthetic pathway the retrosynthesis of the cytokine modulator (–) -Cytoxazone also allows access to other cis- 4, 5 -disubstituted oxazolidin- 2 -ones. After the development of a general protecting group strategy, the literature known starting material synthesis was revised in terms of yield and costs. Through alpha-alkylation and 1, 2 -addition of p-anisyl lithium to SAMP-hydrazones, the hydrazines were achieved as diastereo- and enantiomerically pure compounds with good yields. Syntheses of 3 -SMP substituted cis-oxazolidin- 2 -ones were successfully achieved with very good yields using a TBAF-mediated cyclisation. The cleavage of the SMP group to cis-oxazolidin- 2 -ones failed until now in spite of different cleavage methods trials. The inositol-transferase-inhibitors Galbonolide A and B were chosen as attractive targets for total synthesis because of their high biological activity and exciting molecular architecture. The retrosynthetic concept shows high flexibility and access to all enantio- and diastereoisomers with the possibility of analogue syntheses. All retrosynthetic trials are based on the idea of selective and atomeconomic synthesis including avoidance of protecting groups, short synthetic pathways to key building blocks, and <b>convergent</b> <b>reaction</b> series. The successful reaction pathway included as key steps an enzymatic reduction, Takai-, Wittig-, Stille- and ditin-Stille-reaction, an Enders-alkylation and a 1, 2 -addition using directing groups. So far two of the four stereogenic centers and all double bonds were combined in a ten-membered building block of the 14 -membered ring structure of the Galbonolides without restriction in flexibility. Barium-mediated asymmetric allylation to ketons was achieved {{for the first time with}} addition of allyl chloride to enantiomeric keto esters.

40|$|Multicomponent {{reactions}} (MCRs) are <b>convergent</b> <b>reaction,</b> {{in which}} {{three or more}} substrates of variable complexity react to form a product, where basically {{all or most of}} atoms contribute to the newly formed product. The control of selectivity, for example chemo- and regioselectivities, is among the most important objectives in organic synthesis with special emphasis on six-membered functionalized heterocyclic frame work frequently available in a variety of antihypertensive and other drugs. For MCRs, the issue of selectivity is of particular significance due to the high probability of several potential parallel reaction pathways leading to different product classes. â€žh A piece of research findings presented in this dissertation refers to the development and standardization of dimedone annulated multi-component assembly process that has resulted into production of multi-functional six-membered aza- and oxa-heterocyclic compounds beside enaminones. â€žh This single-step multi-component assembly process offers a convenient route to generate structural diversity into heterocyclic frame work which may ensure interesting biological and pharmacological properties. â€žh Subsequently, these heterocyclic compounds and enaminones possessing interesting multi-functional motifs have been screened for different kinds of biological properties. As expected, majority of these compounds have exhibited interesting biological and pharmacological properties. â€žh Apparently, this synthetic protocol has been partially modified but otherwise derived from the well-known Hantzsch Condensation of four or three components (as the case may be) namely dimedone, appropriately substituted aromatic aldehyde, Â£]-keto ester and either a substituted 1, 3 -dicarbonyl system or ammonium acetate gives an easy excess to a diverse range of highly substituted six-membered aza- and/or oxa-heterocycles often known as polyhydroquinolines (PHQs) and xanthenes respectively. â€žh As regards optimization of experimental conditions for this protocol, choice of a suitable weak base or acid catalyst, appropriate protic solvent, mode of activation energy source such as heating or microwave irradiation beside adjustment of molar ration of dimedone to other partners remained the main players to control acceptable yields of the desired products. As far locally synthesized compounds, initially fifteen known PHQs derivatives besides five new compounds 2 (a-t) have been obtained and fully characterized using morpholine and I 2 /Al 2 O 3 as a binary catalytic system under microwave irradiation (table 2. 1). Furthermore, in order to further this synthetic scheme, compound 2 a was structurally modified to hydrophobic alkyl ethers 3 (a-c) through alkylation of phenolic component. â€žh Polyhydroacridines- 1, 8 -diones (PHAs) unit is frequently available in previously reported anti-malarial, antibacterial and anticancer drugs. The reported synthetic protocol for these compounds was further modified using solid-phase synthetic process (tables 2. 20 & 2. 22) that involved green chemistry. Unlike reported compounds, these compounds 4 (a-g) were tested for analgesic, anti-inflammatory and leishmanicidal activities but all remained inert to these assays. â€žh Substituted 1, 4 -dihydropyridine is an important class of anti-hypertensive drugs available in the market and several inconvenient methods of their synthesis are available in the literature. We have synthesized and carefully characterized these known compounds through a highly convenient and green protocol (table 2. 16). This procedure involves microwave irradiation with shortest possible reaction time beside good to excellent isolated yields. â€žh Inspired by isolation in minute quantity of structurally interesting intermediate trapped during the synthesis of xanthenes 7 (a-j) through a well-known Knoevenagel Condensation followed by Michael Addition reaction, it was extended to a series of such compounds 6 (a-l) after modification in experimental conditions. Later on, these compounds were subjected to various biological assays as highlighted in the following paragraph. â€žh This part of the dissertation demands special attention because the intermediates trapped in the afore-mention procedure were subjected to cyclodehydration that resulted into the formation of substituted xanthenes 7 (a-j) reported in table. 3. 9. This protocol involves use of moderate recyclable acid catalyst Amberlite IR- 120 H, acetonitrile as highly coordinating organic solvent under reflux conditions. This procedure has Â£]-Enaminones are interesting synthetic intermediates and have been widely employed in organic synthesis. In particular, they have been used as synthons {{of a wide variety of}} bioactive heterocycles, as well as pharmaceutical compounds having diverse biological potential. Due to their wide range of activity and importance, several methods have been developed but inherit procedural demerits. We have modified the reported protocol using PPA-SiO 2 as a catalyst under solvent free conditions and produced a series of functionalized Â£]-Enaminones 8 (a-k), (table 4. 3) by condensing dimedone with either substituted aromatic or aliphatic amines in variable isolated yields. Use of chiral aliphatic amines has resulted into a few novel chiral Â£]-Enaminones 8 (g-j). Their biological studies are in process but cannot be included in the thesis at this stage. â€žh Part-B of the dissertation involves screening of the locally synthesized substituted and poly-functionalized six-membered heterocyclic compounds. Among them, polyhydroquinoline derivatives 2 (a-p) were tested for anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic, analgesic, cytotoxicity, and muscles relaxant activities, besides Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) inhibition. Based on computational study, compounds 2 g (39. 19 Â¡Ã“ 0. 02), and 2 m (37. 42 Â¡Ã“ 0. 04) exhibited significant PTP 1 B activities while compounds 2 b, 2 f, 2 i, and 2 n remained inactive â€žh As regards analgesic activity of PHQ derivatives 2 (a-p) and 3 (a-c) and, variable effects were observed. For instance, among the tested compounds, 3 i, 3 h, 2 f and 2 e demonstrated the maximum analgesic activity. Similarly, the above series 2 (a-f) and 3 (a-c) of synthetic compounds were tested for anti-inflammatory activity by employing carrageenan induced paw edema model. Among the tested compounds 2 d, 3 b and 2 g exhibited significant anti-inflammatory. However, a moderate anti-inflammatory effect was observed with 3 c and 2 d, while rest of the compounds was devoid of anti-inflammatory potential. Surprisingly, none of these PHQs derivatives showed muscles relaxant, anti-epileptic and cytotoxicity activities. â€žh During the development and standardization of multi-component assembly process leading to the formation of six-membered heterocyclic compounds, an intermediate (4 a) possessing interesting structural features was isolated. Later on, a series of these precursors 4 (a-l) possessing variable substituents were synthesized and screened for cytotoxicity and leishmanicidal activities. Among the tested series 4 (a-l), compounds 4 (b-f) showed potent leishmanicidal activity against Leishmania major (DESTO) promastigotes, while the same series failed to reveal any cytotoxicity. â€žh Similarly, employing afore-mentioned one-step multi-component assembly process, another series 5 (a-j) of six-membered oxa-heterocyclic compounds was synthesized and screened for cytotoxicity and leishmanicidal activities Among them compounds 5 (b-f) exhibited potent leishmanicidal activity against Leishmania major (DESTO) promastigotes, while the same series did not show any cytotoxic effect...|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} describes {{efforts to}} develop a chemical synthesis of the marine natural product ineleganolide. Chapter 1 of the dissertation focuses on the biological origin of ineleganolide and the interrelationship between ineleganolide and other related norcembranoids natural products including those isolated from species of Sinularia soft corals. In addition to the biosynthesis of ineleganolide, our strategy for the chemical synthesis of the natural products is described. Our synthetic strategy is centered around three key transformations; 1) a diastereoselective Mukaiyama-Michael reaction to join together two complex chiral fragments; 2) an epimerization at the &# 945;-position of a lactone by an enolization/kinetic protonation sequence; 3) an intramolecular Mukaiyama-aldol-type cyclization, mediated by the thermal fragmentation of a &# 946;-alkoxy vinyl triflate to generate a highly electrophilic oxocarbenium ion. Chapter 2 of the dissertation describes the development of efficient diastereoselective syntheses of the two chiral coupling partners for the <b>convergent</b> Mukaiyama-Michael <b>reaction.</b> Chapter 3 of the dissertation discusses the successful coupling of the two fragments to provide an advanced intermediate toward ineleganolide. This intermediate contains all of the carbons in the natural product, and six out of nine of the stereogenic centers with correct configuration. The remainder of this chapter details our unsuccessful efforts to epimerize the C 12 stereogenic center of this intermediate by a lactone enolization and kinetic protonation sequence. In Chapter 4 a modified strategy toward ineleganolide is discussed. We will attempt to open the lactone ring to afford conformation flexibility, hopefully allowing he pivotal cyclization in our synthesis with a substrate that contains the incorrect configuration about the C 12 stereocenter. Through great efforts {{we are able to}} access substrates to evaluate the key cyclization; however, the instability of each of these substrates forced us to consider alternative methods for the cyclization reaction. Chapter 5 details our efforts to induce the key cyclization toward ineleganolide using an oxidative coupling of enolate equivalents. While we were able to selectively functionalize substrates for this reaction, the pivotal step was never successfully achieved. In the final half of Chapter 5 we observed an unexpected Reformatsky cyclization reaction of an advanced intermediate.

40|$|Aim: The {{development}} of small molecules through <b>convergent</b> multicomponent <b>reactions</b> (MCR) has been boosted {{during the last}} decade due to the ability to synthesize, virtually without any side-products, numerous small drug-like molecules with several degrees of structural diversity. (1) The association of positron emission tomography (PET) labeling techniques in line with the “one-pot” {{development of}} biologically active compounds {{has the potential to be}}come relevant not only for the evaluation and characterization of those MCR products through molecular imaging, but also to increase the library of radiotracers available. Therefore, since the [18 F]fluorination of arylboronic acid pinacol ester derivatives tolerates electron-poor and electro-rich arenes and various functional groups,(2) the main goal of this research work was to achieve the 18 F-radiolabeling of several different molecules synthesized through MCR. Materials and Methods: [18 F]Fluorination of boronic acid pinacol esters was first extensively optimized using a benzaldehyde derivative in relation to the ideal amount of Cu(II) catalyst and precursor to be used, as well as the reaction solvent. Radiochemical conversion (RCC) yields were assessed by TLC-SG. The optimized radiolabeling conditions were subsequently applied to several structurally different MCR scaffolds comprising biologically relevant pharmacophores (e. g. β-lactam, morpholine, tetrazole, oxazole) that were synthesized to specifically contain a boronic acid pinacol ester group. Results: Radiolabeling with fluorine- 18 was achieved with volumes (800 μl) and activities (≤ 2 GBq) compatible with most radiochemistry techniques and modules. In summary, an increase in the quantities of precursor or Cu(II) catalyst lead to higher conversion yields. An optimal amount of precursor (0. 06 mmol) and Cu(OTf) 2 (py) 4 (0. 04 mmol) was defined for further reactions, with DMA being a preferential solvent over DMF. RCC yields from 15 % to 76 %, depending on the scaffold, were reproducibly achieved. Interestingly, it was noticed that the structure of the scaffolds, beyond the arylboronic acid, exerts some influence in the final RCC, with electron-withdrawing groups in the para position apparently enhancing the radiolabeling yield. Conclusion: The developed method with high RCC and reproducibility has the potential to be applied in line with MCR and also has a possibility to be incorporated in a later stage of this convergent “one-pot” synthesis strategy. Further studies are currently ongoing to apply this radiolabeling concept to fluorine-containing approved drugs whose boronic acid pinacol ester precursors can be synthesized through MCR (e. g. atorvastatin) ...|$|R
40|$|Research Aim The {{primary purpose}} of this Saudi-based study is to {{identify}} the stigma surrounding mental health problems, {{as well as to}} identify the existing and latent views of mental health professionals holding a stigma towards people living with mental health problems in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It will focus on mental health experts involved in health care in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods A methodological strategy was devised, via the use of a mixed-method approach, which uses quantitative (phase 1) and qualitative (phase 2) data collection approaches and analytical techniques. In Phase 1 (50 participants), two tools were used to assess stigma; the Emotional Reaction on People with mental health problems Scale, and the Attitude Scale. In Phase 2 (5 participants), a one-hour focus group discussion was the method of data collection. The reliability of the two scales for Phase 1 evaluated by measuring internal consistency using SPSS. In Phase 2, Nvivo, version 10 was used for an analysis of the data. The group discussion was thematically analyzed. Principal Findings The findings confirm that many mental health care providers hold a professional stigma against those with mental health problems of varying degrees. And how the existence and extent of these views might impact on the services provided by mental health professionals and the recovery of people with mental health problems. Phase 1 findings indicate factors that lead to professional stigma, wherein ‘exclusion’, ‘rejection and caution’ and ‘risk and fear’ lead to high levels of professional stigma against people with mental health problems. Phase 2 findings, fit into four main themes influence the issue of professional stigma in mental health services: ‘experiences of professional stigma’; ‘causes of professional stigma’; ‘impact of professional stigma on mental health services’ and ‘recommended minimizing stigma’. The findings of the present study point to the significant <b>convergent</b> between emotional <b>reactions</b> with negative attitudes exhibited regarding people with mental health problems. It was also found that interactions with individuals with mental health concerns contributed to an increase in incidences of stigma by professional mental health staff. Also, {{it has been shown that}} insufficient knowledge and undesirable perceptions of people with mental health problems remain apparent, both in Saudi Arabian society and in the mental health profession. Conclusion It is necessary to focus on reducing professional stigma against people with mental health problems. This can be accomplished through appropriate practices, mental health training, education, and research, as well as professional and social awareness through the media in S. A.; publicize ethical guidelines for mental health care professionals; enhance the provision of mental health practitioners in mental health care services; enact legislation by the Ministry of Health in S.
