Two network segments are identified - the ground segment (GS) and the space segment (SS) - and are seen to be highly dependent on each other. The overall architecture must therefore be adapted to both of these segments, rather than each being optimized according to its own criteria. Terrestrial networks are grouped and called the terrestrial segment (TS). In the SS, of fundamental importance is the constellation altitude.

40|$|With {{the use of}} picocells to {{meet the}} {{increased}} demand of traffic density, the mobile communication networks need to comply with greater number of <b>call</b> <b>handover</b> requests than the normal cells. As the probability of handover requests is directly proportional to the mobile velocity, the handover response should be made dependent on mobile velocity to avoid unwanted call termination and early handover for high and low velocity vehicles respectively. Due to the dependency of handover performance to path loss exponent, a variable hysteresis scheme has already been proposed. As the handover performance is highly dependent on user velocity, if the hysteresis margin is made adaptive and varied dynamically in a complimentary manner with mobile velocity, the call termination as well as unnecessary handover may be minimized for high and low velocity mobiles respectively. In this work, a variable hysteresis margin based handover scheme is thus proposed and studied which takes care of both path loss exponent and mobile velocity. For different values of path loss exponent the positions of handover requests have been found out for different mobile velocities. Results show that handover delay decreases proportionately as user velocity increases, thus eliminating call termination or call quality degradation probability for high velocity mobiles and early handover for low velocity mobiles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The wide {{adoption}} of smart phones and other mobile {{devices such as}} smart tablets and e-readers has spurred rapid growth in wireless mobile communication. In order to meet user performance expectations and enhance user experiences, effectively monitoring and managing of the wireless mobile communication networks is imperative. It is remain {{one of the most}} effective ways of gaining insight into the status and performance of the network over the air interface across the user population experience. This paper, which was a part of a large study, seeks to empirically assess and anaylise the compromise between network performance and end-user satisfaction over UMTS radio interface in Nigeria. Some of the service quality-based network performance indicators investigated in the radio across the area of study are call block rate, call drop rate, call setup success rate, call success rate and <b>call</b> <b>handover</b> success rate. From the results, we observed that as the end user satisfaction rate decreases as each of the service quality-based network performance indicators decreases and verse versa. This implies that there is one-to-one relationship between the quality of service (QoS) being provided by the network operator and the end user satisfaction. Hence, proper care should be taken while formulating any long term policy for end user satisfaction...|$|E

It support the high speed data transfer, speech, web browsing, email, video telephony, multimedia and the audio streaming. These services are divided in to the classes depending upon the QoS requirements. With the development of these cellular networks, a major problem came up; it was the <b>call</b> <b>handover</b> from one cell to the other cell during an ongoing session without dropping the connection with the base station. A lot of techniques were developed and used to cope with this major issue. The user’s movement is a dynamic process considering its location. This means that the mobile users can change its way any time with any speed, so there should be a mechanism and a way that the network should be aware of this process. For this purpose different types of handovers techniques are used which include soft, hard and softer handovers. The thesis work is about the investigation of different handovers in the 3 G UMTS network which is the vital issue to the network to maintain the user’s connection during in the ongoing session with the user’s movement.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{doctoral}} dissertation {{is the study of}} tra#c management techniques in satellite systems. The study focuses on two kinds of systems, namely non-geostationary (non-GEO) satellite systems and High altitude platform (HAP) systems, which can play a pivotal and multifaceted role in future telecommunications networks. Tra#c management is of paramount importance, since bandwidth constitutes a resource at a premium in these systems. Initially, the problem of call admission control and <b>call</b> <b>handover</b> in non-GEO satellite systems is studied and ve new algorithms are proposed, which excel in e#ciently utilizing system resources. These algorithms exhibit very positive characteristics, outperforming other algorithms that have been proposed thus far. Moreover, an analytical model was devised that permits the performance assessment of certain algorithms, whose validity is corroborated by ample simulation experiments. Next, the issue of routing in non-GEO satellite systems is investigated. Routing in this type of systems constitutes a daunting challenge owing to variations in network topology. Two routing protocols are presented that introduce the concept of on-demand routing to this kind of systems. The positive characteristics of these protocols are revealed by means of comparison with the most well-known algorithms that have been proposed in the literature. The attention is then drawn towards HAP systems and speci cally to W-CDMA-based HAP systems. The capacity of this type of networks is estimated taking power control imperfections into account. Finally, a novel call admission control and handover technique is delineated and the results of its comparison {{with one of the most}} well-known techniques that have been proposed as yet are presented. ...|$|E

40|$|Provisioning of Quality of Service (QoS) is a {{key issue}} in any {{multi-media}} system. However, in wireless systems, supporting QoS requirements of different traffic types is more challenging due {{to the need to}} minimize two performance metrics - the probability of dropping a <b>handover</b> <b>call</b> and the probability of blocking a new call. Since QoS requirements are not as stringent for non-real-time traffic types, as opposed to real-time traffic, more calls can be accommodated by releasing some bandwidth from the already admitted non-real-time traffic calls.
