5000|$|Taffeta ( [...] ; archaically spelled taffety) is a crisp, smooth, plain {{woven fabric}} made from silk or <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayons.</b> The word is Persian in origin and means [...] "twisted woven". It is {{considered}} to be a [...] "high-end" [...] fabric, suitable for use in ball gowns, wedding dresses, and in interior decoration for curtains or wallcoverings. It is also widely used in the manufacture of corsets and corsetry: it yields a more starched-like type of cloth that holds its shape better than many other fabrics. An extremely thin, crisp type of taffeta is called paper taffeta.|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{economic}} success of <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon</b> (tenfold increase of annual production, sixfold increase of turnover, fivefold increase of manpower by 1912), the future {{belonged to the}} viscose process invented in England. In 1911, Glanzstoff acquired the viscose patent which advanced to production line status in Oberbruch. The original <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon</b> was completely withdrawn in 1916. During the First World War Oberbruch was the only Glanzstoff plant to continue production at a limited level despite declining demand {{and a lack of}} labour.|$|E
5000|$|The Swiss chemist Matthias Eduard Schweizer (1818-1860) {{discovered}} that cellulose dissolved in tetraaminecopper dihydroxide. Max Fremery and Johann Urban developed {{a method to}} produce carbon fibers for use in light bulbs in 1897. Production of <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon</b> for textiles started in 1899 in the Vereinigte Glanzstoff Fabriken AG in Oberbruch near Aachen. [...] Improvement by the J. P. Bemberg AG in 1904 made the artificial silk a product comparable to real silk.|$|E
50|$|It is {{produced}} by making cellulose a soluble compound by combining it with copper and ammonia. The solution of this material in caustic soda is passed through the spinneret and the cellulose is regenerated in the hardening baths that remove the copper and ammonia and neutralize the caustic soda. <b>Cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon</b> is usually made in fine filaments {{that are used in}} lightweight summer dresses and blouses, sometimes in combination with cotton to make textured fabrics with slubbed, uneven surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|By 1909-10 it {{was evident}} that the viscose process was superior, and VGF began to convert to viscose production.However, {{although}} <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon</b> was more expensive than viscose rayon, with Edmund Thiele's [...] "stretch-spinning" [...] process it was possible to make rayon with fine filaments of 1-1.5 denier.Cuprophan, a cellulose membrane based on the process, was being used in dialyzers after World War II (1939-45).As late as 2001 Asahi Chemical Industries of Nobeoka, Japan, was using the cuprammonium process to manufacture rayon.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1911 VGF {{began to}} invest in J. P. Bemberg, a cloth dying and {{finishing}} company that had been experimenting with {{a version of the}} cuprammonium process, and encouraged Bemberg to focus on producing yarns for which that process was suitable.Bemberg was using the [...] "stretch-spinning" [...] process invented by the chemist Edmund Thiele (1867-1927) to make <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon</b> with equally fine filaments to the artificial silk of Hilaire de Chardonnet (1839-1924),and with better physical properties. The VGF product was not competitive.Although Thiele had applied for a patent on his process, a German court ruled on 4 May 1907 that it had been anticipated by the [...] "Pauly" [...] patent.|$|E
5000|$|In 1892, the {{two were}} {{successful}} in producing filaments in substantial quantities by precipitating cellulose from solution in cuprammonium hydroxide (copper(II) oxide dissolved in aqueous ammonia/sodium hydroxide). At first, the <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon</b> was used as incandescent filament in light bulb production. An improved process refined the first rough and uneven filament to increase its strength and elasticity. This would enable the spinning of a material that compared to silk. In 1897, Fremery and Urban applied for a patent for their method. In {{the history of the}} textile industry, the so-called [...] "Pauly Patent" [...] is considered as the beginning of German rayon production. Although bulb production was discontinued in 1902, rayon production advanced on an industrial scale.|$|E
5000|$|The {{solubility}} of nitrocellulose {{in organic}} solvents such as ether and acetone {{was the basis}} for the first [...] "artificial silk" [...] by Georges Audemars in about 1855. Commercial production started in 1891, but the result was flammable and more expensive than cellulose acetate or <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon.</b> Because of this expense, production ceased early in the 1900s. Nitrocellulose was briefly known as [...] "mother-in-law silk". Frank Hastings Griffin invented the double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed artificial silk to rayon, rendering it usable in many industrial products such as tire cords and clothing. Nathan Rosenstein invented the [...] "spunize process" [...] by which he turned rayon from a hard fiber to a fabric. This allowed rayon to become a popular raw material in textiles.|$|E
50|$|The Bemberg {{technology}} was licensed to the American Bemberg Corp, founded in Elizabethton, Tennessee in 1925.American Bemberg began manufacturing <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon</b> at Elizabethton in October 1926.There were several small strikes {{at the plant}} in 1927 and 1928.In August 1928 the VGF subsidiary American Glanzstoff opened a viscose plant in the same town. The two plants had more than 3,000 workers {{by the end of}} 1928.Both suffered from labor problems throughout the 1930s, but production grew steadily.In 1933 the American Bemberg Corp. staged a fashion show in which the models wore fabrics woven from Bemberg yarns, or from these yarns combined with silk or other types of rayon.American Bemberg increased production during World War II, and made parachute cloth. Early in 1942 the Office of Alien Property (OAP) took control of the Elizabethton plants, but did not seize the assets due to the Dutch ownership of the AKU holding company.|$|E
40|$|For the {{majority}} of the last century, commercial routes to regenerated cellulosefibres have coped with the difficulties of making a good cellulose solution by using an easyto dissolve derivative (e. g. xanthane in the case of viscose rayon) or complex (e. g. <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon).</b> For the purposes of this paper, advanced cellulosic fibres aredefined as those made from a process involving direct dissolution of cellulose. The firstexamples of such fibres have now been generically designaed as lyocell fibres todistinguish them from rayons, and the first commercial lyocell fibre is Courtaulds’ Tencel...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{changes of}} monocytes due to {{dialysis}} membranes. The functional effects directly induced by dialysis membranes on peripheral monocytes were analyzed in a plasma-free model of simulated dialysis using Cuprophan, <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon,</b> polyacrylonitrile, polymethylmetacrilate and polysulphone membranes. A severe reduction of monocyte phagocytosis of IgG-coated erythrocytes {{was found by}} using Cuprophan and cuproammonium rayon. The cytofluorimetric analysis of several cell surface receptors, involved in the immune phagocytosis and recognizable by five quoted monoclonal antibodies, did not reveal any significant change. The defective phagocytosis of the IgG-coated erythrocytes by monocytes, due to the exposure to cellulose-derived membranes, was paralleled by an impaired interiorization of heat-aggregated human immunoglobulins, as analyzed by electron microscopy. The cell membrane binding of aggregated immunoglobulins {{was found to be}} unaffected. The defect was associated to a remarkably depressed generation of reactive oxygen species after Zymosan stimulation. Therefore, the defective immune phagocytosis induced by exposure of monocytes to cellulosic membranes was not due to a receptor rearrangement or an impaired binding of ingestible particles, but to a reduced internalization capacity probably related to an energy source exhaustion (as shown by the lack of response to stimuli able to induce oxidizing species production). These features are similar to those described in monocytes from acute systemic lupus erythematosus patients...|$|E
40|$|Report on {{the annual}} {{statistical}} {{survey of the}} Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy in 1996. BackgroundNearly 170, 000 patients were treated by maintenance renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Japan in 1996. The current status of Japanese patients on RRT might, in some way, be suggestive for patients on RRT in other countries. MethodsThe Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy conducts a questionnaire survey of virtually every dialysis facility in Japan {{at the end of}} each year. Here we present the results of our survey of patients undergoing RRT as of the end of 1996, as well as five-year trends (1992 – 1996) in some of the data. ResultsThe response rate was 99. 8 %. At the end of 1996, there were 167, 192 patients on maintenance RRT in Japan (1, 328 persons per million population). The numbers of patients on maintenance RRT continued to increase during the five-year period. The gross mortality rate for that period ranged from 9. 4 % to 9. 7 %. <b>Cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon</b> was the most commonly used material (24. 0 %) for dialyzer membranes, followed by cellulose triacetate (18. 7 %). Approximately 5. 0 % of hemodialysis (HD) patients had a prior history of surgical release of carpal tunnel. The longer the years on HD therapy, the greater the proportion of patients with a history of such an operation. The predialysis plasma β 2 -microglobulin concentration was highest in patients aged 30 to 45 years and declined slightly after the age of 45. There was no significant difference in the HbA 1 c level between continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and HD patients, both in whom diabetes was the disease causing renal failure. Moreover, among HD patients with diabetes, there was a clear tendency for the HbA 1 c level to be higher when the normalized protein catabolic rate was higher. ConclusionThis report summarizes the latest results of the survey on Japanese patients on RRT...|$|E
40|$|Bioreactivity and {{biocompatibility}} of a vitamin E-modified multi-layer hemodialysis filter. BackgroundThe {{present study}} was designed to test the biocompatibility of a new vitamin E-modified multi-layer membrane (CL-E filter), as well as its ability to protect against oxygen free radicals during hemodialysis (HD). MethodsWe investigated, both in vitro and in vivo, the bioreactivity of the filter with respect to the blood antioxidants and its ability to prevent lipoperoxidation. The effects on the leukocyte respiratory burst were also studied. <b>Cuprammonium</b> <b>rayon</b> was used as a comparison material (CL-S filter). ResultsThe in vitro results demonstrated that, under controlled conditions, CL-E is able to preserve blood antioxidants, and particularly vitamin E, from the spontaneous consumption observed in the incubation with CL-S filters and in control incubations. In accordance with this observation, the rate of the oxidative demolition of lipids either in plasma and red blood cells (RBC) or from rat brain homogenate decreased after the exposure to CL-E filters in comparison with the CL-S filter. Moreover, {{in the absence of any}} significant cytotoxic effects due to both the types of material studied, the production of oxygen free radicals and nitric oxide (NO) by leukocytes was higher after their in vitro exposure to CL-S, but was quite similar to that of the control leukocytes after exposure to CL-E. In vivo, a one-month treatment with the CL-E filter increased plasma vitamin E by 84. 3 % with respect to treatment with CL-S; this gain slightly decreased to 68. 9 % when CL-E treatment was prolonged to three months. In the RBC, vitamin E was found to have increased by 76. 7 % and 113. 4 % at one and three months, respectively. Plasma glutathione (GSH) levels determined at three months were significantly increased from 0. 10 ± 0. 02 to 0. 33 ± 0. 12 μmol/ml, while the erythrocyte GSH was only slightly increased. The leukocyte function estimated as responsiveness to soluble chemical stimuli in CL-S-treated patients was significantly improved both qualitatively and qantitatively after CL-E treatment. The presence of an increased number of mononuclear cells undergoing programmed cell death (apoptosis) in CL-S-treated patients (18. 8 ± 1. 7 % vs. a control value of 6. 5 ± 2. 3 %) as well as the apoptogenic effect of their plasma in vitro on U 937 cells was significantly corrected after CL-E treatment (mean decrease in apoptotic mononuclear cells at 24 hours of culture, 25. 5 % and 27. 1 % at 1 and 3 months, respectively). The anti-apoptogenic effect of CL-E treatment showed a close dependence on the increase in vitamin E in the blood cell compartment. ConclusionsThis study suggests that this vitamin E-modified membrane can be considered a highly biocompatible material, the antioxidant properties of which can exert a site-specific and timely scavenging function against oxygen free radicals in synergy with a hypostimulatory action on the PMN respiratory burst...|$|E
