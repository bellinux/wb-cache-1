Both were powered with an AC adapter and could be attached to any audio output source, with two separate inputs for the computer and an external CD player.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method for bonding a first film {{to a second}} film to form a sensor. The first and second films are piezoelectric films. A base section has a mating surface for holding the first film. A top section has a mating surface for holding the second film, the top section and base section being mateable {{together to form a}} cavity between the top section mating surface and the base section mating surface with the first film and the second film pressed together inside the cavity to bond the first film to the second film. An internal <b>connection</b> <b>port</b> forming mechanism forms an internal <b>connection</b> <b>port</b> between the first film and the second film when the base section and top section are mated together with the first film and the second film pressed together inside the cavity. Alternately, an internal connection tab forming mechanism can be used to form a sensor having an internal connection tab {{between the first and second}} film, instead of having an internal <b>connection</b> <b>port...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} design a nonlinear controller for a pneumatic cylinder system for which the <b>connection</b> <b>port</b> comprises a non-negligible restriction. The pressure chamber of this system is difficult to control because the servo valve and the <b>connection</b> <b>port</b> form a double restriction. This double restriction causes a singularity in the feedback linearization controller. To avoid this singularity, a modified feedback linearization controller is proposed. The Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach is then {{used to calculate the}} controller gains which ensure the stability of the tracking error and the non-singularity of the control law. Simulation results show good performance of the proposed controller...|$|E
