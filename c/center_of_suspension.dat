40|$|The purple {{bacterium}} Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE- 1 expresses multiple small high-potential redox proteins during pho-toautotrophic growth, {{including two}} high-potential iron-sulfur proteins (HiPIPs) (PioC and Rpal_ 4085) and a cytochrome c 2. We evaluated {{the role of}} these proteins in TIE- 1 through genetic, physiological, and biochemical analyses. Deleting the gene en-coding cytochrome c 2 resulted {{in a loss of}} photosynthetic ability by TIE- 1, indicating that this protein cannot be replaced by ei-ther HiPIP in cyclic electron flow. PioC was previously implicated in photoferrotrophy, an unusual form of photosynthesis in which reducing power is provided through ferrous iron oxidation. Using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron paramagnetic reso-nance (EPR) spectroscopy, and flash-induced spectrometry, we show that PioC has a midpoint potential of 450 mV, contains all the typical features of a HiPIP, and can reduce the reaction <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> membrane <b>suspensions</b> in a light-dependent manner at a much lower rate than cytochrome c 2. These data support the hypothesis that PioC linearly transfers electrons from iron, while cytochrome c 2 is required for cyclic electron flow. Rpal_ 4085, despite having spectroscopic characteristics and a reduction poten-tial similar to those of PioC, is unable to reduce the reaction center. Rpal_ 4085 is upregulated by the divalent metals Fe(II), Ni(II), and Co(II), suggesting that it might play a role in sensing or oxidizing metals in the periplasm. Taken together, our result...|$|R
