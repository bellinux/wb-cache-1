5|$|Like all lemurs, this genus {{is found}} {{only on the}} island of Madagascar off the southeastern coast of Africa. Confined to the island's {{seasonal}} eastern tropical rainforests, it is uncommon to rare throughout its range, which historically ran from the Masoala Peninsula in the northeast to the Mananara River in the south. Today, the black-and-white ruffed lemur has a much larger range than the red ruffed lemur, although it is very patchy, extending from slightly northwest of Maroantsetra, on Antongil Bay, in the north down the coast to the Mananara River near Vangaindrano in the south. Additionally, a <b>concentrated</b> <b>population</b> of black-and-white ruffed lemurs, of the subspecies Varecia variegata subcincta, can also be found on the island reserve of Nosy Mangabe in Antongil Bay. It is suspected that this population was introduced to the island in the 1930s. The red ruffed lemur, on the other hand, has a very restricted range on the Masoala Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|The entire delta region, {{backed by}} the steep rises of the forested highlands, {{is no more than}} three meters above sea level, and much of it is one meter or less. The area is subject to {{frequent}} flooding; at some places the high-water mark of floods is fourteen meters above the surrounding countryside. For centuries flood control has been {{an integral part of the}} delta's culture and economy. An extensive system of dikes and canals has been built to contain the Red River and to irrigate the rich rice-growing delta. Modeled on that of China's, this ancient system has sustained a highly <b>concentrated</b> <b>population</b> and has made double-cropping wet-rice cultivation possible throughout about half the region.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the latest}} census data from 2016 from Statistics Canada, the {{population}} of this area is 6,417,516. Population growth studies have projected the City of Toronto's population in 2031 to be 3,000,000 and the Greater Toronto Area's population to be 7,450,000, while the Ontario Ministry of Finance states it could reach 7.7million by 2025. Statistics Canada identified in 2001 that four major urban regions in Canada exhibited a cluster pattern of <b>concentrated</b> <b>population</b> growth among which included the Greater Golden Horseshoe Census Region, which includes all of the Greater Toronto Area (which includes Oshawa), {{as well as other}} Southern Ontario cities including Niagara, Hamilton, Guelph, Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo and Barrie.

25|$|Greater Los Angeles is the {{metropolitan}} area home to the most Filipino Americans, with the population numbering around 606,657; Los Angeles County alone accounts for over 374,285 Filipinos, {{the most of any}} single county in the United States. The Los Angeles region has the second largest <b>concentrated</b> <b>population</b> of Filipinos in the world, only surpassed by Manila. Greater Los Angeles is also home to the largest number of Filipino immigrants (16 percent of the total Filipino immigrant population of the United States), as of 2011. Filipinos are the second-largest group of Asian Americans in the region; however in 2010, Filipinos were the largest population of Asian Americans within the City of Los Angeles. In 2016, among those survey, Filipino Americans had the second largest proportion of college graduates, with 76.2% having at least a bachelor's degree.|$|E
25|$|The rural towns {{have evolved}} from {{a very large number}} of widely {{dispersed}} grain delivery points in 1900, through a period of expansion over the first thirty years of the 20th century, to a pattern of relatively <b>concentrated</b> <b>population</b> and businesses in an urban-based economy by 2000. Mechanization, especially the rapid replacement of horses by tractors after 1945, meant one family could operate a much larger farm, so some farmers bought out their neighbors, who then moved to town along with the surplus children. The rural economy diversified far beyond its exclusively agricultural base, with service employment in education and medicine important, as well as small-scale factories. Better highways, along with cell phones and internet coverage encouraged a concentration in fewer, larger centers, which drew customers and clients from a wide radius. Most rural communities declined continuously over the second half of the 20th century, but some grew in population, expanded their economic base, and experienced an increase in their market areas for a limited range of goods and services. These communities also became centers of employment for their own and surrounding (farm and nonfarm) population.|$|E
500|$|Austronesian {{seafarers}} {{are believed}} to have been the first humans to settle on the island, arriving between 100 and 500CE. In their outrigger canoes they carried food staples from home including rice, plantains, taro, and water yam. Sugarcane, ginger, sweet potatoes, pigs and chickens were also probably brought to Madagascar by these first settlers, along with coconut and banana. The first <b>concentrated</b> <b>population</b> of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island, although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast. [...] Upon arrival, early settlers practiced tavy (swidden, [...] "slash-and-burn" [...] agriculture) to clear the virgin coastal rainforests for the cultivation of crops. They also gathered honey, fruits, bird and crocodile eggs, mushrooms, edible seeds and roots, and brewed alcoholic beverages from honey and sugar cane juice.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{horses were}} brought from Mexico to Texas {{as early as}} 1542, a stable {{population}} did not exist until 1686, when Alonso de León's expedition arrived with 700 horses. From there, later groups brought up thousands more, deliberately leaving some horses and cattle {{to fend for themselves}} at various locations, while others strayed. By 1787, these animals had multiplied to the point that a roundup gathered nearly 8,000 [...] "free-roaming mustangs and cattle." [...] West-central Texas, between the Rio Grande River and Palo Duro Canyon, was said to have the most <b>concentrated</b> <b>population</b> of feral horses in the Americas. [...] Throughout the west, horses escaped human control and formed feral herds, and by the late 1700s, the largest numbers were found in what today are the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of {{the village}} cite its impact on local politics. Villagers are {{perceived}} as voting in a solid bloc. While {{this is not always}} the case, the highly <b>concentrated</b> <b>population</b> often does skew strongly toward one candidate or the other in local elections, making Kiryas Joel a heavily courted swing vote for whichever politician offers Kiryas Joel the most favorable environment for continued growth.

Now Kiryas Joel is seeking to annex [...] of land into their village and the new Monroe Town Board has had no comment on this issue.

2500|$|What {{is today}} called Olmec first {{appeared}} fully {{within the city}} of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, where distinctive Olmec features occurred around 1400BCE. The rise of civilization was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered alluvial soil, {{as well as by}} the transportation network provided by the Coatzacoalcos River basin. This environment may be compared to that of other ancient centers of civilization: the Nile, Indus, and Yellow River valleys, and Mesopotamia. This highly productive environment encouraged a densely <b>concentrated</b> <b>population,</b> which in turn triggered the rise of an elite class. [...] The elite class created the demand for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture. Many of these luxury artifacts were made from materials such as jade, obsidian, and magnetite, which came from distant locations and suggest that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Mesoamerica. The source of the most valued jade Motagua River valley in eastern Guatemala, and Olmec obsidian has been traced to sources in the Guatemala highlands, such as El Chayal and San Martín Jilotepeque, or in Puebla, distances ranging from 200 to 400km (120–250 miles) away, respectively.|$|E
