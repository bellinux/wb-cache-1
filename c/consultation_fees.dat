Methods: The study recruited 390 semi-urgent or non-urgent patients from a targeted convenience sample of three large EDs. Respondents were asked to rank eight scenarios structured to explore the relative importances of three key attributes - self-perceived illness severity, waiting time, and <b>consultation</b> <b>fee</b> - that may result in an ED visit. Results: Seventy-eight {{percent of the respondents}} would consider visiting a parallel clinic instead of the ED for semi-urgent and non-urgent conditions. The relative importances attached to illness severity, waiting time, and <b>consultation</b> <b>fee</b> were 47. 8 %, 33. 6 %, and 18. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: Aligned {{with the}} {{international}} call for universal coverage of affordable and quality health care, the government of Tajikistan is undertaking reforms of its health system aiming amongst others at reducing the out-of-pocket expenditures (OPE) of patients seeking care. Household surveys were conducted in 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2011 to explore the scale and determinants of OPE of users in four district of Tajikistan, where health care is legally free of charge at the primary level. Methods: Using the data from four cross-sectional household surveys conducted between 2005 and 2011, time trends in OPE for <b>consultation</b> <b>fees,</b> drugs and transport costs of adult users of family medicine services were analysed. To investigate differences along the economic status, an asset index was constructed using principal component analysis. Results: Adjusted for inflation, OPE for primary care have substantially increased in the period 2005 to 2011. While the proportion of patients reporting the payment of informal <b>consultation</b> <b>fees</b> to providers and their amount were constant over time, the proportion of patients reporting expenditures for drugs has increased, and the median amounts have doubled from 5. 3 US $ to 10. 7 US$. Thus, the expenditures on medicine represent the biggest financial burden for patients accessing a primary care facility.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study aims {{to assess}} the costs {{associated}} with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in a private tertiary care hospital in northern India. MethodsThis retrospective case-control study covered four types of HAIs: urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and surgical site infections. The “case” group comprised patients who had developed HAIs, whereas the “control” group had patients who had not acquired HAIs. The control group was matched with the case group on the criteria of age, diagnosis, and severity of illness. Drugs’ acquisition costs, hospital rental, <b>consultation</b> <b>fees,</b> investigation costs, and antimicrobial costs were computed for patients over a period of 1 year, and comparisons were made between both the arms of the study. The costs were also compared within the different HAIs. ResultsOf the four types of HAIs studied, the most commonly encountered infection was bloodstream infection (38 %). The pathogen most frequently responsible for causing HAIs was Acinetobacter baumanii. Patients aged between 60 and 69 years were found to be more susceptible to HAIs than the patients in other age groups. Furthermore, the most common diagnosis of patients who developed HAI was head injury followed by renal failure. Drugs’ acquisition costs, rent, <b>consultation</b> <b>fees,</b> investigation costs, and antimicrobial costs were significantly higher for cases than for controls (P< 0. 001). Drugs’ acquisition cost was the major contributor of the extra cost, and antimicrobial drugs constituted almost half of it. ConclusionsThis study has provided evidence that the cost of drugs is a major contributor to costs of HAIs in an Indian setting. Continuous surveillance and prophylaxis is recommended for reducing HAIs...|$|E

40|$|We study {{whether and}} how {{physicians}} respond to financial incentives, making use of detailed register data on the health-care services provided to patients by general practitioners (GPs) in Norway over a six-year period (2006 - 11). To identify GPs' treatment responses, we exploit that specialisation in general medicine entitles the GPs to a higher <b>consultation</b> <b>fee,</b> implying a change in total and relative fee payments. To control for demand and supply factors related to becoming a specialist, we estimate a GP fixed effect model focusing on a narrow time window around the date of specialist certification.

These {{findings are consistent with}} a theory model where (partly) profit-motivated GPs face excess demand and income effects are sufficiently small.

Three interesting generalized results that we find on the determinants of incidence and extent of bribe payment are: First, bribe givers and non-givers are different in terms of observed characteristics.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Democratic Republic of the Congo {{is today}} {{one of the}} poorest {{countries}} in the world; the health status of the population ranks among the worst in Sub-Saharan Africa. Public health services charge user fees and drug prices. Since 2008, north-eastern Congo is facing a guerrilla war. Malteser International is assisting with free health care for internally displaced persons as well as the general population. Before the incursion the health system was based on user fees. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the socio-economic conditions of the population and to assess their ability to contribute to health care. METHODOLOGY: Heads of 552 randomly selected households in 23 clusters in two health zones were interviewed using a standardised questionnaire. FINDINGS: The demographic description and socio-economic conditions of the study population were homogenous. Major source of income was agriculture (57 %); 47 % of the households earned less than US$ 5. 5 /week. Ninety-two percent of the interviewed households estimated that they would be able to contribute to <b>consultation</b> <b>fees</b> (maximum amount of US$ 0. 27) and 79 % to the drug prices (maximum amount of US$ 1. 10). Six percent opted for free consultations and 19 % for free drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Living conditions were very basic; the estimated income of the study population was low. Almost half of the population perceived their current living situation as fairly good/good. More than 90 % of the study population estimated to be able to contribute to <b>consultation</b> <b>fees</b> and 80 % to drug prices. As a result Malteser International suggested introducing flat-rates for health care services. Once the project ends, the population will have to pay again for their health service. One solution would be the introduction of a health care financing system with the goal to reach universal coverage to health care...|$|E

While average out-of-pocket payments were lower for refugees than the host community, they are a sizeable expense given the limited income and humanitarian assistance received by most refugee households. The concern with high out-of-pocket payments is expected to persist given current shortfalls in humanitarian assistance funding and gradual declines in financial resources of refugee households that occur over extended periods of displacement. Training for providers on rational prescribing behavior and use of generic medicines could be an effective and low cost approach to reducing out-of-pocket expenditures while maintaining quality of care.|$|E
