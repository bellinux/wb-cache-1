The principle of mutual cooperation and tabarru contract is a characteristic of Islamic insurance. The Opportunity to increase the role of Islamic insurance as an economic entity is done by utilizing various aspects of human resource readiness. Human Resource are required to have a comprehensive understanding of Islamic insurance {{in order to create}} compliance with Islamic principles for product and services offered. It can provide legal protection against the Takaful participants. Issues to be examined is how the readiness of the relevant regulatory certification and how Regulatory model certification appropriate human resources in order to develop Islamic insurance in Indonesia.                Methods - The method used is a normative juridical that through the efforts of an inventory of rules and descriptive analytical. To obtain the appropriate regulatory models, a legal comparison method is employed. Results - Based on the research results, the regulation of certification is required and should include the human resources, starting from a selling agent to the management as a decision maker. This regulation will push the entire human resources involved in the Islamic insurance industry to has the capacity and capability in providing services to the public, and to ensure and guarantee that the services offered comply with Islamic principles. Association of Islamic Insurance Indonesia was initiated concerning <b>certification</b> <b>provisions,</b> but has not been followed by a strong regulations readiness as a legal basis. Conclusion - Therefore we need a comprehensive regulation and it must be issued by Indonesian Financial Services Authority. </p...|$|E
40|$|Architectural {{engineering}} of {{embedded computer}} systems comprehensively affects both the development processes and {{the abilities of}} the systems. Rigorous and holistic verification of architectural engineering is consequently essential {{in the development of}} safety-critical and mission-critical embedded systems, such as computer systems within aviation, automotive, and railway transportation, where even minor architectural defects may cause substantial cost and devastating harm. The increasing complexity of embedded systems renders this challenge unmanageable without the support of automated methods of verification, to reduce the cost of labor and the risk of human error. The contribution of this thesis is an Architecture Quality Assurance Framework (AQAF) and a corresponding tool support, the Architecture Quality Assurance Tool (AQAT). AQAF provides a rigorous, holistic, and automated solution to the verification of critical embedded systems architectural engineering, from requirements analysis and design to implementation and maintenance. A rigorous and automated verification across the development process is achieved through the adaption and integration of formal methods to architectural engineering. The framework includes an architectural model checking technique for the detection of design faults, an architectural model-based test suite generation technique for the detection of implementation faults, and an architectural selective regression verification technique for an efficient detection of faults introduced by maintenance modifications. An integrated solution provides traceability and coherency between the verification processes and the different artifacts under analysis, which is essential for obtaining reliable results, for meeting <b>certification</b> <b>provisions,</b> and for performing impact analyses of maintenance modifications. The Architecture Quality Assurance Tool (AQAT) implements the theory of AQAF and enables an effortless adoption into industrial practices. Empirical results from an industrial study present a high fault detection rate at both the design level and the implementation level as well as an efficient selective regression verification process. Furthermore, the results of a scalability evaluation show that the solution is scalable to complex many-core embedded systems with multithreading...|$|E

40|$|The Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”) recognizes an employee’s {{right to}} take leave {{to care for a}} {{qualifying}} family member. In light of the Act’s remedial nature, the intended scope of the care provision is broad, but its definitional details are sparse. As a result of the attendant interpretive discretion afforded to courts, the Seventh Circuit announced its rejection of the requirement—first articulated by the Ninth Circuit—that care provided during travel be related to continuing medical treatment. A facial analysis of the resulting circuit split fails to appreciate the fundamental difference between the Seventh and Ninth Circuits’ considerations: the distinction between physical and psychological care. Whereas physical care is readily measurable, psychological care is less defined and, consequently, ripe to facilitate FMLA abuse. Efforts to combat this potential lead courts to impose judicially devised limitations on psychological care, but judicial discretion still infuses some uncertainty into proceedings. For employers, the best remedy lies in the FMLA’s optional <b>certification</b> <b>provision,</b> which requires medical validation of an employee’s need for leave. In requiring certification, employers should distinguish between physical and psychological care, maximize the FMLA’s informational requirements, and implement complete and consistent request and approval procedures...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{their many}} differences, Americans {{have long been}} bound by a shared sense of federal {{constitutional}} commonality. As this article demonstrates, however, federal constitutional rights do in fact often differ — even within individual states — {{as a result of}} state and lower federal court concurrent authority to interpret the Constitution and the lack of any requirement that they defer to one another’s positions. The article provides the first in-depth examination of intra-state, state-federal court conflicts on federal constitutional law and the problems that they create. Focusing on criminal procedure doctrine in particular, with its unique impact on individual liberty and privacy, the article highlights multiple instances in which state and lower federal courts disagree. As the article makes clear, creation of a “crazy quilt” of conflicting federal rights, which Justice Scalia has inveighed against more generally, generates an array of distinct and quite significant difficulties when localized. To date, however, the conflicts and their consequences have largely evaded the attention of commentators and, more importantly, often go unaddressed by the Supreme Court, which appears content to maintain its historically small plenary docket. In response, the article urges that Congress amend the federal <b>certification</b> <b>provision,</b> which since 1802 has allowed federal but not state courts to certify disputed questions to the Court for resolution. Allocating certification authority to state and federal courts alike will not only help ensure that the Court fulfills its role as arbiter of federal constitutional disputes.

40|$|On February 27, 2013, ten {{psychiatric}} {{patients were}} being involuntarily detained in hospital emergency departments located in Pierce County under Washington State’s Involuntary Treatment Act (ITA). Despite {{the name of}} the law that authorized their detainment, these individuals were not receiving any psychiatric treatment during their confinement. Nor were they there {{as the result of a}} criminal conviction. The only thing these ten detainees were guilty of was being mentally ill. Under what is now considered to have been a misinterpretation of the ITA, counties across Washington had for years been confining mentally ill patients in hospitals not certified to provide psychiatric treatment. When this practice was finally challenged in Detention of D. W. v. Department of Social 2 ̆ 6 Health Services, it was predictably outlawed. The Washington Supreme Court’s decision in D. W. stems from a challenge to Washington’s practice of “psychiatric boarding,” a term of art for the involuntary confinement of mentally ill patients to hospitals not authorized to provide psychiatric treatment by using “single-bed certifications” under the ITA. Single-bed certifications are temporary permits that allow a patient detained under the ITA to be housed in a facility not certified to provide psychiatric treatment for a limited period of time. The primary motivation behind this practice is to limit overcrowding in certified psychiatric hospitals. A combination of drastic budget cuts in the area of mental health treatment and a lack of legislative attention given to the reality that psychiatric treatment centers are grossly underfunded and overcrowded has culminated in a mental healthcare crisis. Although the rampant abuse of the ITA’s single-bed <b>certification</b> <b>provision</b> was a necessary evil in the fight against overcrowding in certified treatment centers in recent years, this option is no longer legal under D. W. Therefore, the state is now left with hundreds of patients who would normally be eligible for detention under the ITA and nowhere to legally house them. Given that patients eligible for involuntary detention are typically those who pose a danger to either themselves or others, this problem is concerning both for the patients in need of treatment and for the public they inevitably interact with. This problem is only getting worse, and the Washington State legislature must dedicate additional funds and facilities to the housing and treatment of psychiatric patients if this new crisis is to be averted. To address these new and complex issues, this Comment proposes both a short-term and long-term solution to the systemic complications brought about by the D. W. decision. In the short term, this Comment proposes amending Washington’s ITA to permit the temporary psychiatric boarding of mentally ill patients if they would otherwise be released despite posing a danger to themselves or others. A bill proposing an amendment similar to the one proposed in this Comment was passed by the Washington State legislature and signed by Governor Jay Inslee on May 14, 2015, and took effect in July 2015. Second, this Comment proposes a long-term restoration of mental health funding to pre- 2009 levels. The recent increase in the use of single-bed certifications is correlated with a drop in mental health funding. This downward trend in mental health funding must be reversed if we are to truly resolve Washington’s mental health crisis once and for all...|$|R

40|$|Networks are {{integral}} parts of modern safety-critical systems and <b>certification</b> demands the <b>provision</b> of guarantees for data transmissions. Deterministic Network Calculus (DNC) can compute a worst-case bound on a data flow's end-to-end delay. Accuracy of DNC results has been improved steadily, resulting in two DNC branches: the classical algebraic analysis {{and the more}} recent optimization-based analysis. The optimization-based branch provides a theoretical solution for tight bounds. Its computational cost grows, however, (possibly super-) exponentially with the network size. Consequently, a heuristic optimization formulation trading accuracy against computational costs was proposed. In this paper, we challenge optimization-based DNC with a new algebraic DNC algorithm. We show that: (i) no current optimization formulation scales well with the network size and (ii) algebraic DNC can be considerably improved in both aspects, accuracy and computational cost. To that end, we contribute a novel DNC algorithm that transfers the optimization's search for best attainable delay bounds to algebraic DNC. It achieves {{a high degree of}} accuracy and our novel efficiency improvements reduce the cost of the analysis dramatically. In extensive numerical experiments, we observe that our delay bounds deviate from the optimization-based ones by only 1. 142 % on average while computation times simultaneously decrease by several orders of magnitude.

40|$|Abstract. Safety-critical {{systems are}} often subject to {{certification}} {{as a way}} to ensure that the safety risks associated with their use are suffi-ciently mitigated. A key requirement of <b>certification</b> is the <b>provision</b> of evidence that a system complies with the applicable standards. The way this is typically organized is to have a generic standard that sets forth the general evidence requirements across different industry sectors, and then to have a derived standard that specializes the generic standard accord-ing to the needs of a specific industry sector. To demonstrate standards compliance, one therefore needs to precisely specify how the evidence requirements of a sector-specific standard map onto those of the generic parent standard. Unfortunately, little research has been done to date on capturing the relationship between generic and sector-specific standards and a large fraction of the issues arising during certification can be traced to poorly-stated or implicit relationships between a generic standard and its sector-specific interpretation. In this paper, we propose an approach based on UML profiles to systematically capture how the evidence re-quirements of a generic standard are specialized in a particular domain. To demonstrate our approach, we apply it for tailoring IEC 61508 – one of the most established standards for functional safety – to the Petroleum industry...|$|R
40|$|In East Africa, Uganda {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{producers}} of organic pineapples for export. These pineapples are mainly produced in central Uganda and have to meet stringent quality standards before they can be allowed on international markets. These quality standards may put considerable strain on farmers and may not be wholly representative of their quality interpretation. The aim of this paper is therefore, to determine the Ugandan organic pineapple farmers’ quality perception, the activities they carry out in order to attain that quality and challenges (production, postharvest & marketing) faced on the same. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were carried out among 28 organic pineapple farmers in Kayunga district, central Uganda. Findings suggest that quality of organic pineapples is mainly perceived in terms of product attributes particularly appearance followed by food security <b>provision.</b> <b>Certification</b> plays a minor role in what farmers describe as organic quality. High production input costs (labour and coffee husks) coupled with a stagnant premium are some of the major challenges faced by farmers in attaining organic quality.

It is recommended that the National Organic Agricultural Movement of Uganda (NOGAMU) works with all relevant stakeholders to have the farmer premium price raised and an official organic policy enacted...|$|R

40|$|Since the EURO V {{standards}} for heavy-duty engines, the European emissions legislation requires {{to verify the}} conformity of heavy-duty engines with the applicable emissions <b>certification</b> standards: these <b>provisions</b> are identified as “In Service Conformity” (ISC). It was considered impractical and expensive to adopt an ISC scheme for heavy-duty vehicles requiring the removal of engines from vehicles to test pollutant emissions against legislative limits. Therefore, it was proposed to develop a protocol for in-service conformity checking of heavy-duty vehicles based {{on the use of}} Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS). As a result, ISC testing based on PEMS was introduced in the EURO V and the EURO VI standards. The corresponding administrative and technical provisions were formulated in the European Regulations 582 / 2011 and 64 / 2012. The above route was followed for non-road engines as well: preliminary research activities studied and confirmed the possibility to apply the methods developed for heavy-duty engines with minor modifications. The basis for the introduction of ISC provisions based on the PEMS approach into the European NRMM type-approval legislation has been established in several texts. The NRMM PEMS Pilot Program was launched to facilitate the introduction into the European NRMM emissions legislation of use of PEMS as a tool for ISC. This had to be achieved by improving the technical procedures (e. g. available from the heavy-duty scheme) and increasing the awareness of the different stakeholders about PEMS as a new regulatory tool.

40|$|Most Australian {{state governments}} are {{embarking on a}} second stage of neo-liberal {{planning}} system change. Extensive deregulation of state planning systems has occurred over the last 17 years. Much of {{the first stage of}} neo-liberal change concentrated on reducing the number of prohibited uses in planning instruments and increasing the number of uses subject to permit. This often resulted in increased complexity, cost and size of planning instruments, and increased contestability. Development and community groups have expressed frustration at these results in some states. Second stage changes now emphasise the importance of reducing the number of uses and developments requiring permits, allowing these &# 039;as-of-right&# 039;, and reducing the differences between zone types. This approach is strongly influenced by the Development Assessment Forum Leading Practice Model endorsed by State and Territory planning ministers in 2005, now being progressively implemented, and by other national and state bodies such as the Productivity Commission. This model emphasises the use of state standardised planning <b>provisions,</b> <b>certification</b> of compliance according to codes, reducing or eliminating third-party rights and the exclusion of elected officials through the professional determination of applications. This paper analyses these trends in planning governance concentrating on planning systems in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{outstanding}} examples of carbon neutral, zero carbon {{and other forms}} of low carbon cities, districts and urban development around the world, which have demonstrated the vast potential for carbon abatement within the built environment. However, these concepts and approaches have not yet become mainstream. Furthermore, how each city or development defines its carbon claim, including how emissions are calculated and goals are achieved (for example, if offsets are used) varies considerably. This makes comparisons difficult, claims less meaningful and replication challenging. It also leads to concern around false carbon claims and ‘greenwashing’. Although carbon certification is now widely adopted as a voluntary carbon market instrument for a variety of sectors, it has not yet been applied to urban development. This research therefore examines the implications of certifying carbon reductions within this sector. A framework is proposed, which includes a standardised approach to quantifying emissions at the precinct-scale and five core elements that would need to be considered when certifying urban development. It is argued that certification can help to acknowledge and reward progressive developers, increase the credibility of carbon claims within the built environment and help to provide benchmarks and baselines for the sector. Certification could also become a mechanism by which a variety of incentives can be offered to developers to encourage greater uptake of low carbon design. It is expected that a combination of factors – a standard approach to quantifying emissions, carbon <b>certification</b> and the <b>provision</b> of incentives – can help to mainstream this type of development, which will be essential in addressing many global challenges such as climate change and resource depletion...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: "The Class of 1989 " is a {{longitudinal}} study of 1722 people who were awarded an MD degree by a Canadian university in 1989. This paper reports {{on the details of}} their post-MD training up to spring 1996. METHODS: Several medical professional and educational associations in Canada and the United States provided year-by-year information on field and location of post-MD training, certification achieved, whether in practice and location of practice through to spring 1996. Information from all sources was linked to a list of 1989 medical school graduates. RESULTS: Of the 1722 graduates 57 (3. 3 %) never entered post-MD training in Canada; 147 (8. 5 %) did 1 or more years of training in the United States. A total of 222 graduates (12. 9 %) took a break of at least 1 year from training, and 301 (17. 5 %) changed their choice of field or specialty after starting training. Substantial numbers took 1 or more years longer to complete training than would be expected based on the prescribed length of the training program chosen. The field or specialty choices of the cohort produced a generalist:specialist ratio of 58 : 42. The final numbers in several fields depended heavily on trainees changing their initial career choice. INTERPRETATION: The data point out widely differing and often very long lead times from start to completion of training. Since 1993, changes to licensure requirements have reduced opportunities for recent graduating cohorts to delay final career choices, take a break in training, prolong training or change initial career choices. Rigidities in the post- 1993 training environment point to the emergence of a number of serious problems, such as dissatisfaction and high anxiety levels among residents, licensing authorities being faced with people who have not completed a training program to <b>certification,</b> and insufficient <b>provision</b> of positions for post-MD training because of underestimates of the time needed to complete training programs.

Why are disabled drivers entitled to disabled parking spots? What is the procedure for an individual with a disability to receive special disability registration license plates? What {{is the role of}} the Medical Advisory Board in reviewing the ability of disabled drivers to get behind the wheel? What, if any, obligation or responsibility does a physician treating a disabled driver have to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles of the patient 2 ̆ 7 s condition or to third parties injured by a disabled driver? Does the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (2 ̆ 2 ADA 2 ̆ 2), a landmark civil rights act protecting an individual with a physical or mental impairment, require the removal of architectural barriers to create designated accessible parking spaces at places of public accommodation? Does the ADA require that restaurants, grocery stores, law offices, and laundromats provide designated parking for individuals with disabilities? Empirical data provided in this article is submitted to serve as a backdrop for elaboration and comparison. Fifty places of public accommodation were surveyed to identify and determine compliance with the provision of accessible parking spaces for disabled drivers in a variety of locations in Maryland. A review of a variety of state motor vehicle statutes are compared and analyzed, ranging from the enumerated covered disabilities, the physician <b>certification</b> process, the <b>provision</b> of placards and disability plates, parking space requirements fees, parking privileges, and enforcement provisions. This article will discuss and analyze various court decisions concerning reasonable accommodations for drivers with disabilities. It will provide insight and understanding of the impact of the ADA and the direction courts are heading as they confront this challenging and important area of the law. Finally, this article will offer recommendations regarding accessible parking and Medical Advisory for the disabled driver...|$|R
