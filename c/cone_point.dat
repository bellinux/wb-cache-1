25|$|Calixarenes are characterised by a {{three-dimensional}} basket, cup or bucket shape. In calixarenes the internal volume is around 10 cubic angstroms. Calixarenes are characterised {{by a wide}} upper rim and a narrow lower rim and a central annulus. With phenol as a starting material the 4 hydroxyl groups are intrannular on the lower rim. In a resorcinarene 8 hydroxyl groups are placed extraannular on the upper ring. Calixarenes exist in different chemical conformations because rotation around the methylene bridge is not difficult. In calixarene 4 up-down conformations exist: <b>cone</b> (<b>point</b> group C2v,C4v), partial cone Cs, 1,2 alternate C2h and 1,3 alternate D2d. The 4 hydroxyl groups interact by hydrogen bonding and stabilize the cone conformation. This conformation is in dynamic equilibrium with the other conformations. Conformations can be locked in place with proper substituents replacing the hydroxyl groups which increase the rotational barrier. Alternatively placing a bulky substituent on the upper rim also locks a conformation. The calixarene based on p-tert-butyl phenol is also a cone. Calixarenes are structurally related to the pillararenes.|$|E

Ondřej Honzl E-mail Address: honzl@karlin. mff. cuni. cz Department: Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics Supervisor: Prof. RNDr. Jan Rataj, CSc. E-mail Address: rataj@karlin. mff. cuni. cz Department: Mathematical Institute, Charles University Abstract: Our {{thesis is}} focused on certain {{geometric}} properties of Brownian motion paths. Firstly, it deals with <b>cone</b> <b>points</b> of Brownian motion in the plane and we show some connections between <b>cone</b> <b>points</b> and critical points of Brownian motion. The motivation {{of the study of}} critical points is provided by a pleasant behavior of the distance function outside of the set of these points. We prove the theorem on a non-existence of π+ <b>cone</b> <b>points</b> on fixed line. This statement leads us to the conjecture that there are only countably many critical points of the Brownian motion path in the plane. Next, the thesis discusses an asymptotic behavior of the surface area of r-neigh- bourhood of Brownian motion, which is called Wiener sausage. Using the proper- ties of a Kneser function, we prove the claim about the relation of the Minkowski content and S-content. As the consequence, we obtain a limit behavior of the surface area of the Wiener sausage almost surely in dimension d ≥ 3. Finally, [...] ...|$|R

Decals can be attached on top of other surface styles to produce a variety of rendering effects, such as labels on objects, graffiti on walls, partially reflective surfaces, masked transparencies, and more. State of the art shaders are used to render surfaces and other effects. A surface style is defined by up to four layers of shaders, which produce color, reflections, transparency, and bump effects.
