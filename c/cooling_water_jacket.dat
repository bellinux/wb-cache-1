50|$|In {{laboratory}} distillation, reflux, and rotary evaporators, {{several types}} of condensers are commonly used. The Liebig condenser is simply a straight tube within a <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> and is the simplest (and relatively least expensive) form of condenser. The Graham condenser is a spiral tube within a water jacket, and the Allihn condenser has a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube, each increasing the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense. Being more complex shapes to manufacture, these latter types are also more expensive to purchase. These three types of condensers are laboratory glassware items since they are typically made of glass. Commercially available condensers usually are fitted with ground glass joints and come in standard lengths of 100, 200, and 400 mm. Air-cooled condensers are unjacketed, while water-cooled condensers contain a jacket for the water.|$|E

In this paper the flow in the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> of the six-cylinder four stroke water-cooled diesel engine was studied with the commercial software of STAR CCM+. Results of the simulation reveals that velocity has little effect on the flow field distribution. Dead zone in engine cylinder head appeared far away from the inlet of the flow. But it could be avoided or improved effectively by arranging the inlet and outlet at opposite side of the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> Further study suggests that a good flow field distribution can be achieved near the entrance if one inlet was put at {{the same side of the}} outlet and the other the opposite side, while the wall was impacted fierce due to the strong turbulence and eddy existed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to ascertain the condition of braze joints and cooling water hardware from an accelerator section after prolonged use. Metallographic analysis was used to examine critical sites on an accelerator section that had been in use for more than 30 years.

The cavity cylinder stack showed no internal operational damage however the internal surface was highly oxidized. The internal surface of the cooling water tubing was uniformly corroding at a rate of about 1 mil per year and showed no evidence of pitting.

40|$|Prasad, Ajay K. Advani, Suresh G. Metal {{hydrides}} {{can store}} hydrogen at high volumetric efficiencies. As {{the process of}} charging hydrogen into a metal powder to form its hydride is exothermic, the heat released must be removed quickly to maintain a rapid charging rate. An effective heat removal method is to incorporate a heat exchanger such as a heat pipe within the metal hydride bed. In this paper, we describe a two-dimensional axi-symmetric study to predict the transient heat and mass transfer in a cylindrical metal hydride tank embedded {{with one or more}} heat pipes. Results from a parametric study of hydrogen storage efficiency are presented as a function of storage tank size, water jacket temperature and its convective heat transfer coefficient, and heat pipe radius and its convective heat transfer coefficient. The effect of enhancing the thermal conductivity of the metal hydride by adding aluminum foam is also investigated. The study reveals that the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> temperature and the heat pipe's heat transfer coefficient are most influential in determining the heat removal rate. The addition of aluminum foam reduces the filling time as expected. For larger tanks, more than one heat pipe is necessary for rapid charging. It was found that using more heat pipes of smaller radii is better than using fewer heat pipes with larger radii. The optimal distribution of multiple heat pipes was also determined and it is shown that their relative position within the tank scales with the tank size.

With the increase of water spraying flux, the gas temperature and the evaporation rate of water droplets tend to decrease.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this Master Thesis project {{is the development of}} a new methodology to perform Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) conjugate heat transfer simulations for internal combustion engines, at the Fluid and Combustion Simulations Department (NMGD) at Scania CV AB, Södertalje, Sweden. This new method allows to overcome the drawbacks identified in the former methodology, providing the ability to use the more advanced polyhedral mesh type to generate good quality grids in complex geometries like <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jackets,</b> and integrating all the different components of the engine cylinder in one unique multi-material mesh. In the method developed, these advantages can be used while optimizing the process to perform the simulations, and obtaining improved accuracy in the temperature field of engine components surrounding the <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> when compared to the experimental data from Scania CV AB tests rigs. The present work exposes the limitations encountered within the former methodology and presents a theoretical background to explain the physics involved, describing the computational tools and procedures to solve these complex fluid and thermal problems in a practical and cost-effective way, by the use of CFD. A mesh sensitivity analysis performed during this study reveals that a mesh with low y+ values, close to 1 in the <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket,</b> is needed to obtain an accurate temperature distribution along the cylinder head, as well as to accurately identify boiling regions in the coolant domain. Another advantage of the proposed methodology is that it provides new capabilities like the implementation of thermal contact resistance in periodical contact regions of the engine components, improving the accuracy of the results in terms of temperature profiles of parts like valves, seats and guides. The results from this project are satisfactory, providing a reliable new methodology for multi-material thermal simulations, improving the efficiency of the work to be performed in the NMGD department, with a better use of the available engineering and computational resources, simplifying all the stages of multi-material projects, from the geometry preparation and meshing, to the post-processing tasks...|$|R
