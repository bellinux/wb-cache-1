50|$|<b>Cat</b> <b>Eye</b> Syndrome / Schmid Fraccaro Syndrome is a {{condition}} caused by a partial trisomy or tetrasomy in chromosome 22.

The term [...] "cat eye" [...] syndrome was coined because of the particular appearance of the vertical colobomas in the eyes of some patients. However, over half of the CES patients in the literature do not present with this trait. There is no significant reduction in life expectancy in patients who are not afflicted with one of CES' life-threatening abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|Translucent {{yellowish}} chatoyant chrysoberyl {{is called}} cymophane or cat's eye. Cymophane has its derivation {{also from the}} Greek words meaning 'wave' and 'appearance', {{in reference to the}} haziness that visually distorts what would normally be viewed as a well defined surface of a cabochon. This effect may be combined with a <b>cat</b> <b>eye</b> effect. In this variety, microscopic tubelike cavities or needle-like inclusions of rutile occur in an orientation parallel to the c-axis, producing a chatoyant effect visible as a single ray of light passing across the crystal. This effect is best seen in gemstones cut in cabochon form perpendicular to the c-axis. The color in yellow chrysoberyl is due to Fe3+ impurities.|$|E
