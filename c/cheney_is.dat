500|$|Spokane {{lies in the}} Northern Rockies {{ecoregion}} {{near the}} eastern edge of the basaltic Channeled Scablands steppe, a plain that then eventually rises sharply to the east towards the rugged, timbered Rocky Mountain foothills, the Selkirk Mountains.

The highest peak in Spokane County is Mount Spokane, at an elevation of , located on the eastern side of the Selkirk Mountains. The most prominent water feature in the area is the Spokane River, a [...] tributary of the Columbia River, originating from Lake Coeur d'Alene in northern Idaho. The river flows west across the Washington state line through downtown Spokane, meeting Latah Creek, then turns to the northwest, where it is joined by the Little Spokane River on its way to the Columbia River, north of Davenport. The Channeled Scablands and many of the area's numerous large lakes, such as Lake Coeur d'Alene and Lake Pend Oreille, were formed by the Missoula Floods after the ice-dammed Glacial Lake Missoula ruptured at the end of the last ice age.

50|$|The 2007 Bagram Airfield {{bombing was}} a suicide attack that killed up to 23 people and injured 20 more, {{at a time when}} Dick Cheney, then Vice-President of the United States, was visiting Afghanistan.
