5|$|Project X was not {{intended}} to be the title of the film, but it was kept to <b>capitalize</b> on interest generated by the rumored secrecy surrounding the project. Adding to the secrecy, producers decided to not send full scripts to any prospective cast member, instead providing only watermarked individual pages.|$|E
5|$|A limited {{operation}} {{was supported by}} Egyptian armed forces Chief of Staff Saad El Shazly. He argued that Israel has two fatal weaknesses. The first of which is inability to sustain high human casualties due to limited available manpower. The second is inability to sustain a prolonged war for it mobilizes around 18% of the Jewish population. A prolonged limited defensive war can best <b>capitalize</b> both weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|As the war ended, the Holt {{company was}} left with huge surplus {{inventories}} of heavy-duty tractors ill-suited for the agricultural market, which had been dominated during the war by the Holt Company's primary competitor, C.L.Best. The company decided to focus instead on heavy construction equipment and sought to <b>capitalize</b> on {{the passage of the}} Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. Laden with debt and needing more capital to switch its product line, the company struggled to move forward.|$|E

50|$|Personal pronouns are not {{normally}} <b>capitalized,</b> except in particular cases. In English the first-person subject pronoun I is always <b>capitalized,</b> {{and in some}} Christian texts the personal pronouns referring to Jesus or God are <b>capitalized</b> (He, Thou, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Though {{normally}} not <b>capitalized</b> in English, {{the term}} Schadenfreude is sometimes <b>capitalized</b> following the German convention for nouns.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of Kaloyan's death, Strez was in the capital Tarnovo, perhaps seeking to <b>capitalize</b> on his ancestral rights to the Bulgarian crown. However, Boril {{proved to be the}} more ambitious candidate. Boril persecuted the other {{candidates}} for the throne, and Alexius Slav, along with Ivan Asen's sons Ivan Asen II had to leave Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{have felt}} the game {{was an attempt to}} <b>capitalize</b> on then-recent, {{extensive}} news coverage of the Gulf War, which had focused on the use of advanced, impersonal weapons (such as aircraft and guided missiles) to destroy enemy weapons and installations. Some commentators considered the game's subject matter in bad taste, with one magazine reporting an incident of veterans burning copies of the game.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{dominated}} in {{the first}} quarter of the game. Virginia Tech received the opening kickoff, but failed to <b>capitalize</b> on its opening drive thanks to a personal foul penalty that forced the Hokies to punt. On its first possession, Georgia moved into scoring position courtesy of a 26-yard run by Kregg Lumpkin. Failing to advance the ball further, Georgia sent in kicker Brandon Coutu who kicked a 39-yard field goal to give Georgia the early lead, 3–0.|$|E
50|$|The V-forms are <b>capitalized</b> only {{in actual}} letters (or e-mails), where the T-forms ty and wy are also <b>capitalized.</b>|$|R

50|$|Words {{or phrases}} derived from proper names are {{generally}} <b>capitalized,</b> {{even when they}} are not themselves proper names. For example, Londoner is <b>capitalized</b> because it derives from the proper name London, but it is not itself a proper name (it can be limited: the Londoner, some Londoners). Similarly, African, Africanize, and Africanism are not proper names, but are <b>capitalized</b> because Africa is a proper name. Adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and derived common nouns that are <b>capitalized</b> (Swiss in Swiss cheese; Anglicize; Calvinistically; Petrarchism) are sometimes loosely called proper adjectives (and so on), but not in mainstream linguistics. Which of these items are <b>capitalized</b> may be merely conventional. Abrahamic, Buddhist, Hollywoodize, Freudianism, and Reagonomics are capitalized; quixotic, bowdlerize, mesmerism, and pasteurization are not; aeolian, and alpinism may be <b>capitalized</b> or not.|$|R
5|$|During {{the second}} day of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 2, 1863) Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee {{attempted}} to <b>capitalize</b> on his first day's success. He launched the Army of Northern Virginia in multiple attacks on the flanks of the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. The assaults were unsuccessful, and resulted in heavy casualties for both sides.|$|E
5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was drawn}} to a {{diversity}} of interests throughout his life, from business to politics. After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms. He also lost large sums of borrowed money in the publishing trade, attempting to <b>capitalize</b> on cheap editions of classical works. By 1828 he owed his mother 50,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1895 gubernatorial election, Kentucky elected its first-ever Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Bradley {{was able}} to <b>capitalize</b> both on {{divisions}} within the Democratic Party {{over the issue of}} Free Silver and on the presence of a strong third-party candidate, Populist Thomas S. Pettit, to secure victory in the general election by just under 9,000 votes. This election marked the beginning of nearly thirty years of true, two-party competition in Kentucky politics.|$|E
50|$|This is {{different}} from camelCase in which the first letter can be lowercase or <b>capitalized</b> and each subsequent concatenated word is <b>capitalized.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Father Divine and his {{followers}} <b>capitalized</b> pronouns referring to him, much like [...] "LORD" [...] translated from the tetragrammaton is <b>capitalized</b> in the English Bible.|$|R
5000|$|The pronoun He, with a universally <b>capitalized</b> H, {{is often}} used to refer to the Supreme Being, or in Christian contexts, to Jesus Christ; [...] "It", with a <b>capitalized</b> I, is also used when {{speaking}} of the Supreme Being's nature or Godhead, or in Christian contexts, to refer to the Logos; <b>capitalized</b> [...] "He" [...] and [...] "It" [...] have both been used to refer to the Holy Spirit. In Catholic Christian circles, the Blessed Sacrament is also referred to with the <b>capitalized</b> pronoun [...] "It".|$|R
5|$|Other {{accomplishments of}} Willis's {{administration}} included eliminating tolls on {{twelve of the}} state's thirteen major bridges and expanding programs for dependent children and the elderly. Construction of five state tuberculosis hospitalsat London, Madisonville, Paris, Ashland, and Glasgowwas initiated and nearly 80 percent completed {{by the end of}} his term. Republicans were unable to <b>capitalize</b> on Willis's accomplishments as governor, however. In the 1947 gubernatorial election, the party fragmented over their choice of gubernatorial nominee, and Democrat Earle C. Clements was elected governor.|$|E
5|$|Slipknot's 2005 {{lawsuit against}} Burger King {{said the company}} created the {{advertising}}-based band Coq Roq to <b>capitalize</b> on Slipknot's image. Burger King responded with a countersuit, saying many other bands, such as Mr. Bungle, Mushroomhead, Mudvayne, Kiss, Insane Clown Posse, and Gwar have used masks {{as part of their}} images. After negotiations, the advertising campaign and lawsuit were withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Dyrholm both {{attempted}} to <b>capitalize</b> on the party's election win, proclaiming that Albertans wanted change {{and that each}} of them would lead the Wildrose Alliance to {{a victory in the}} next general election. The party experienced a considerable growth heading into the leadership election, announcing it had 11,670 members at the beginning of October, compared to 1,800 in June. Smith was elected the new leader at the convention held in Edmonton on October 17.|$|E
5000|$|Names {{by which}} gods are known are <b>capitalized,</b> {{including}} God, Athena, and Vishnu. The word god {{is generally not}} <b>capitalized</b> if {{it is used to}} refer to the generic idea of a deity, nor is it <b>capitalized</b> when it refers to multiple gods, e.g. Roman gods. There may be some confusion because Judaism, Christianity, and Islam rarely refer to deity by a specific name, but simply as God (see Writing divine names). Other names for the God of these three Abrahamic faiths, such as Elohim, Yahweh, and Lord, are also <b>capitalized.</b>|$|R
40|$|Most {{explanations}} of stock market booms and busts {{are based on}} contrasting the underlying ‘fundamental’ logic of the economy with the exogenous, non-economic factors that presumably distort it. Our paper offers a radically different model, examining the stock market not from the mechanical viewpoint of a distorted economy, but from the dialectical perspective of <b>capitalized</b> power. The model demonstrates that (1) the valuation of equities represents <b>capitalized</b> power; (2) <b>capitalized</b> power is dialectically intertwined with systemic fear; and (3) systemic fear and <b>capitalized</b> power are mediated through strategic sabotage. This triangular model, we posit, can offer a basis for examining the asymptotes, or limits, of <b>capitalized</b> power {{and the ways in}} which these asymptotes relate to the historical and ongoing transformation of the capitalist mode of power...|$|R
50|$|The {{first letter}} of a signal should be <b>capitalized</b> when it begins a {{citation}} sentence. If {{it is in}} a citation clause or sentence, it should not be <b>capitalized.</b>|$|R
5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} {{found themselves in}} a difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that to <b>capitalize</b> on the success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E
5|$|The {{first film}} of its genre to be {{produced}} in the Indies, Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman was made to <b>capitalize</b> on the popularity of Wijnhamer and Hollywood characters such as Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto. Released in April 1941 to popular acclaim, it had a mixed critical reception; the reviewer Saeroen suggested that its success was entirely because of its star's renown. A sequel to this film, which is possibly lost, Pah Wongso Tersangka, was released later that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of an}} organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the {{scientific name}} of an organism, it is proper to <b>capitalize</b> the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remaining}} part {{of such a}} name, {{following the}} particle, is always <b>capitalized</b> if it is set off with a space as a separate word, or if the particle was not <b>capitalized.</b> It is normally <b>capitalized</b> if the particle is Mc, M, or O. In other cases (including Mac), there is no set rule (both Macintyre and MacIntyre are seen, for example).|$|R
5000|$|In {{languages}} {{that use}} alphabetic scripts and that distinguish lower and upper case, {{there is usually}} an association between proper names and capitalization. (A prominent exception is German, in which all nouns are <b>capitalized.)</b> For proper names, as for several other kinds of words and phrases, the details are complex, and vary sharply from language to language. For example, expressions for {{days of the week}} and months of the year are <b>capitalized</b> in English, but not in Spanish, French, Swedish, or Finnish, though they may be understood as proper names in all of these. Languages differ in whether most elements of multiword proper names are <b>capitalized</b> (American English has House of Representatives, in which lexical words are <b>capitalized)</b> or only the initial element (as in Slovenian Državni zbor, [...] "National Assembly"). In Czech, multiword settlement names are <b>capitalized</b> throughout, but non-settlement names are only <b>capitalized</b> in the initial element, though with many exceptions.|$|R
5000|$|Capitalization of {{the word}} as an {{adjective}} also varies. Some guides specify that the word should be <b>capitalized</b> as a noun but not <b>capitalized</b> as an adjective, e.g., [...] "internet resources".|$|R
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks on}} the slopes of seamounts are heavily populated by suspension feeders, particularly corals, which <b>capitalize</b> on the strong currents around the seamount to supply them with food. This is in sharp contrast with the typical deep-sea habitat, where deposit-feeding animals rely on food they get off the ground. In tropical zones extensive coral growth results in the formation of coral atolls late in the seamount's life.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} quarter in {{possession}} of the ball in Tennessee territory, attempting to <b>capitalize</b> upon a drive begun in the third quarter. Tennessee's defense, however, allowed only one yard {{on the first two}} plays of the quarter, and Tech placekicker Waldron returned to the field to convert a 46-yard field goal, extending Virginia Tech's lead to 27-14 with 13:33 left in the game.|$|E
5|$|After Blake's funeral, Manhattan {{is accused}} on {{national}} television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the U.S. government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars. As Manhattan {{is one of the}} United States' greatest military powers, his departure throws humanity into political turmoil, with the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan to <b>capitalize</b> on the perceived American weakness. Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt, and Rorschach himself is framed for murdering Moloch, a former supervillain, and imprisoned.|$|E
5000|$|In titles, {{only the}} first letter of the first word is <b>capitalized,</b> {{the rest of the}} title using {{sentence}} capitalization (with all its rules: proper names are <b>capitalized</b> as usual, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|Species {{names are}} printed in italics {{and have the}} first letter of the first word <b>capitalized.</b> Other words are not <b>capitalized</b> unless they are proper nouns, or parts of proper nouns.|$|R
25|$|The term may be <b>capitalized</b> when {{referring}} to an identity or community, {{rather than as an}} objective fact describing a person's desires, in a construction similar to the <b>capitalized</b> use of Deaf.|$|R
