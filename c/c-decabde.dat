40|$|The {{commercial}} polybrominated {{diphenyl ether}} (PBDE) flame retardant mixture <b>c-decaBDE</b> is now being considered for listing on the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. The aim of our study was to review the literature regarding the use and detection of BDE- 209, {{a major component of}} <b>c-decaBDE,</b> in consumer products and provide a best estimate of goods that are likely to contain BDE- 209 in Australia. This review {{is part of a larger}} study, which will include quantitative testing of items to assess for BDE- 209. The findings of this desktop review will be used to determine which items should be prioritized for quantitative testing. We identified that electronics, particularly televisions, computers, small household appliances and power boards, were the items that were most likely to contain BDE- 209 in Australia. Further testing of these items should include items of various ages. Several other items were identified as high priority for future testing, including transport vehicles, building materials and textiles in non-domestic settings. The findings from this study will aid in the development of appropriate policies, should listing of <b>c-decaBDE</b> on the Stockholm Convention and Australia 2 Ì† 7 s ratification of that listing proceed...|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{have been}} widely used as flame retardants in a number of applications. Three commercial PBDE mixtures have been produced and used in the United States and elsewhere: commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether (c-pentaBDE), commercial octabromodiphenyl ether (c-octaBDE), and commercial decabromodiphenyl ether (<b>c-decaBDE).</b> Although manufacture and import of c-pentaBDE and c-octaBDE were phased out in 2004, PBDE congeners associated with those mixtures continue to be found in humans and the environment. Some reports indicate that levels are continuing to increase. Imported articles treated with c-pentaBDE and c-octaBDE could be a source of human and environmental exposure to these PBDE congeners. <b>c-DecaBDE</b> is still manufactured and used in the United States. Data suggest that debromination, physical or metabolic removal of bromine atoms, may convert decaBDE to more toxic PBDE congeners, contributing further to the potential risk from exposure to these congeners. EPA is concerned that some of the component congeners are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic and intends to initiate a number of actions to limit the exposure and release of PBDE congeners and/or articles to which they have been added. These actions are to: (1) Initiat...|$|E
