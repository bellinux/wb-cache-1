25|$|El Paso was {{the largest}} city in the United States without a PBS {{television}} station within the city limits until 1978. El Paso viewers had to watch channel 22, KRWG, from Las Cruces until 1978. In fact, the city had only three English-speaking channels and two Spanish-language channels (channel 2 and channel 5) from Juarez, and cable TV subscribers in the 1970s and 1980s could receive four Los Angeles independent channels: KTLA, KHJ, KTTV and KCOP as well as Spanish-language stations KMEX of Los Angeles and KWEX of San Antonio usually sharing the same cable <b>channel</b> <b>slot.</b> Over time, as more television stations signed on, more cable channels were added and those stations added network affiliations, the L.A. and San Antonio stations would disappear from the lineup. The last to be removed was KTLA {{in the fall of}} 2006 {{as a consequence of the}} WB-UPN merger into The CW, when KVIA-TV launched a digital subchannel with the network's programming.|$|E
50|$|The channel was {{launched}} in 1993 as News 12 Weather. The service originally aired each morning in place of Bravo and E!, as all three services had shared a <b>channel</b> <b>slot</b> on Cablevision's Long Island systems due to limited channel capacity at the provider's headends. Following the launch of Cablevision's Optimum TV digital cable service in 1996, News 12 Weather gained a full-time dedicated <b>channel</b> <b>slot</b> on the provider's systems.|$|E
50|$|On 16 March 2007, {{the channel}} finally closed and {{was removed from}} the Sky EPG. On Freeview, the <b>channel</b> <b>slot</b> was {{replaced}} by ITV2+1.|$|E

50|$|As of August 15, WGBA and WACY's <b>channel</b> <b>slots</b> on Time Warner Cable {{have been}} {{replaced}} with a simulcast of GSN, with Starz Kids & Family airing on the <b>channel</b> 994 subchannel <b>slot</b> usually carrying MeTV.

The design scheme and its parameters of support and loading conditions are given, the simulation results are shown. Designing a ‘reinforcing’ support system suitable to be installed into the <b>channel</b> <b>slots</b> formed in the surrounding rock mass and developing a process to construct this support are the prime considerations in tunnels driven using the new mining technology.

50|$|One such {{example was}} Home Sports Entertainment, which shared time with QVC (owned {{at the time}} by Comcast; and now, ironically, owned by former Prime parent Liberty Media) on some cable providers, mainly in Texas. QVC usually {{transmitted}} from about 3:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on a given day, with the regional Prime outlet taking over the <b>channel</b> <b>slot</b> after a brief sign-on/ID sequence and a rundown of the day's schedule (normally superimposed over a decorative sports-related background, such as a basketball court). Some providers that carried it as a premium channel (in {{a manner similar to}} the short-lived Sports Time in the 1980s) scrambled the HSE feed upon its sign-on over the designated <b>channel</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E
50|$|On January 1, 2004, {{the company}} that owned the MOOV HD <b>channel</b> <b>slot</b> {{launched}} a new channel, LAB HD.

50|$|Brookfield-based Shorewest Realtors created Shorewest TV in October 2005, as an {{offshoot}} of earlier local cable shopping channels that often featured their listings {{along with those of}} other agencies, as digital cable and video on demand became commonplace and allowed Shorewest the ability to buy their own <b>channel</b> <b>slot</b> on Time Warner Cable.|$|E

5000|$|During a {{transition}} process that completed October 31, 2015, WTVC's second digital channel simulcast WDSI.

[...] The programming on This TV {{which had been}} on WTVC-DT2 moved to WDSI's main signal, with Comet launching on WDSI-DT2; the MyNetworkTV subchannel was moved to WFLI-DT2, with the MeTV signal which had been carried on that slot moved to WFLI-DT3. Cable, satellite, and EPB viewers saw no change in any <b>channel</b> <b>slots,</b> as WTVC-DT2 took over the former <b>channel</b> <b>slots</b> for WDSI's main signal.|$|R

5000|$|This subchannel's history {{began on}} January 1, 2006, when KYTX assumed the UPN {{affiliation}} for the Tyler-Longview market from KCEB (which KYTX owners, London Broadcasting, purchased in 2009) and low-power outlets KTPN-LP and KLPN-LP (KCEB became a WB affiliate, while KTPN and KLPN reverted to being independent stations); the subchannel was branded as [...] "UPN 18", {{in reference to}} its Suddenlink cable <b>channel</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The poor {{reception}} {{was reflected}} in the show's ratings, the show bringing in 3.7 million, a 16% viewing share, six percent and 1.3 million viewers lower than The Street.

50|$|After KSQA {{signed on}} in September 2011, WIBW-TV began {{experiencing}} signal issues on Cox Communications channel 12, {{due to the}} over-the-air signal of KSQA (which broadcasts on channel 12 over-the-air) due to electromagnetic interference with the analog frequency on WIBW's cable slot. On June 13, 2012, KSQA, LLC {{filed a complaint with}} the FCC to invoke a must-carry request for Cox to carry it on channel 12, which would have displaced WIBW to a newly assigned <b>channel</b> <b>slot.</b> Although KSQA, LLC had its request denied by the FCC on the basis its cable placement should be determined by its PSIP channel (KSQA was mapped as virtual channel 22) and Cox previously informed that it preferred not to move WIBW-TV off its existing <b>channel</b> <b>slot</b> to replace it with KSQA, Cox eventually moved WIBW-TV to channel 13 on March 14, 2013, after the FCC granted a waiver by KSQA to move its PSIP channel to virtual channel 12, with that station being placed on WIBW's former cable slot on channel 12.|$|E
