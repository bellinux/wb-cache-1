40|$|Although {{object-oriented}} {{paradigm is}} becoming a more realistic approach {{to the development of}} largescale software systems, the existing object-oriented notations and methodologies do not fully support the development of distributed object systems. In this paper, we integrate Meta-Object Protocol (MOP) into a de facto standard object-oriented modeling language UML together to build a software architecture for distributed object systems. We propose a high-level extension of <b>conventional</b> <b>MOPs,</b> called diMOP which helps to develop distributed object systems by realizing a reflective architecture. To incorporate diMOP with UML, we introduce two new specification languages: Class Diagram Supporting diMOP (CDSM) and Dynamically Configurable Object-oriented Statemachine (DCOS), which are proposed to replace the class diagram and the state diagram of UML. The two specification languages support to specify dynamic configuration behaviors as well as to incorporate the diMOP. This paper gives a met [...] ...|$|E

These systems indicate the presence of organic matter that may host harmful microorganisms on a variety of surfaces. In addition to detecting contaminants, ATP systems also provide “proof of service” that an area has been effectively and thoroughly cleaned. According to scientific studies using ATP technology, spray-and-vac systems have been proven to remove more contaminants and disease-causing germs and bacteria on surfaces when compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>mop,</b> bucket, and cloth style cleaning. Additionally, tests show that spray-and-vac systems do not spread contaminants from surface to surface, as can happen when using conventional cleaning methods.|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the incidence of}} pseudotumours after large head metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty (THA) with that after <b>conventional</b> metal-on-polyethylene (<b>MoP)</b> THA and assessed the predisposing factors to pseudotumour formation. From a previous randomised controlled trial which compared large head (38 mm to 60 mm) cementless MoM THA with conventional head (28 mm) cementless MoP THA, 93 patients (96 THAs: 41 MoM (21 males, 20 females, mean age of 64 years, standard deviation (SD) 4) and 55 MoP (25 males, 30 females, mean age of 65 years, SD 5) were recruited after a mean follow-up of 50 months (36 to 64). The incidence of pseudotumours, measured using a standardised CT protocol was 22 (53. 7 %) after MoM THA and 12 (21. 8 %) after MoP THA. Women with a MoM THA {{were more likely to}} develop a pseudotumour than those with a MoP THA (15 vs 7, odds ratio (OR) = 13. 4, p = 5 microgram/L) were only associated with pseudotumours in women with a MoM THA. There was no difference in mean Oxford and Harris hip scores between patients with a pseudotumour and those without. Contrary to popular belief, pseudotumours occur frequently around MoP THAs. Women with a MoM THA and an elevated cobalt level are at greatest risk. In this study, pseudotumours had no effect on the functional outcome after either large head MoM or <b>conventional</b> <b>MoP</b> THA...|$|R
40|$|Background After the {{introduction}} of the Metasul system by Weber in 1988, total hip arthroplasty (THA) with metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings became increasingly popular in the 1990 s. MoM bearings aimed to reduce the problem of aseptic loosening associated with polyethylene wear particles from conventional polyethylene cups. The following introduction of hip resurfacing added positive factors as bone sparing and large caliber heads, reducing the risk of dislocations. After almost two decades of increasing use of MoM prostheses, reports of implant failure and adverse reactions to metal became numerous. Starting in 2009, a dramatic decrease in the use of MoM bearings has been seen. Patients and methods Paper I was an experimental in vitro study measuring the amount of metal worn off from a MoM prosthesis with a 28 -mm diameter head, using a hip simulator. Papers II-IV were all based on a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial including 85 patients allocated into two groups. One group was operated with a MoM prosthesis while the other group received a similar prosthesis with a <b>conventional</b> metal-on-polyethylene (<b>MoP)</b> bearing. All components were cemented and 28 -mm heads were used. Clinical outcome and serum metal ion concentrations were evaluated at short-term (three, six, 12 and 24 months, paper II), medium-term (7 years, paper III) and long-term (16 years, paper IV) follow-up. Overall longterm survival of the implants was estimated after a mean of 16 years (paper IV). Results A so-called run-in phase with higher initial wear from MoM implants was seen in the joint simulator testing within the equivalent of the first year of use. As expected, patients with MoM bearings showed higher cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) ion concentrations compared to patients in the MoP group at all time-points from 3 months to 16 years postoperatively. The percentage of circulating HLA DR+ CD 8 + T-cells was higher in the MoM compared to MoP group (10. 6 vs. 6. 7 %; p = 0. 03) and was positively correlated to systemic concentrations of Co and Cr. At the last follow-up 16 years after the index surgery, radiographic result and clinical performance was similar in both groups (Harris hip score: MoM= 91, MoP= 95, p= 0. 28) and no difference between groups was seen regarding implant survival (MoM: 93 % [95 % CI: 83 - 100 %]; MoP: 95 % [95 % CI: 87 - 100 %], p= 0. 99). Conclusions This thesis evaluated a 28 -mm head THA, comparing a MoM bearing with a <b>conventional</b> <b>MoP</b> articulation. Both articulations performed equally well in regard to long-term implant survival and clinical outcome. Due to the absence of clinical superiority of the MoM bearing and concerns about biological effects of the MoM articulation, the use of MoP articulations is recommended...|$|R
