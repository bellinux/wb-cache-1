50|$|<b>Cut-to-length</b> logging is {{the process}} of felling, delimbing, bucking, and sorting (pulpwood, sawlog, etc.) at the stump area, leaving limbs and tops in the forest. Harvesters fell the tree, delimb, and buck it, and place the {{resulting}} logs in bunks to be brought to the landing by a skidder or forwarder. This method is routinely available for trees up to 900 mm in diameter. Harvesters are employed effectively in level to moderately steep terrain. Harvesters are highly computerized to optimize cutting length, control harvesting area by GPS, and utilize price lists for each specific log to archive most economical results during harvesting.|$|E
50|$|Denmark and Norway allow 25.25 m trucks (Denmark from 2008, and Norway from 2008 on {{selected}} routes). In Sweden the allowed length has been 24 m since 1967. Before that, the maximum length was unlimited; the only limitations were on axle load. What stopped Sweden from adopting {{the same rules}} {{as the rest of}} Europe, when securing road safety, was the national importance of a competitive forestry industry. Finland, with the same road safety issues and equally important forestry industry, followed suit. The change made trucks able to carry three stacks of <b>cut-to-length</b> logs instead of two, as it would be in a short combination. They have one on stack together with a crane on the 6×4 truck, and two additional stacks on a four axle trailer. The allowed gross weight in both countries is up to 60 tonnes depending on the distance between the first and last axle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} and deployment of harvesting systems aims to provide physically feasible, economically viable, and environmentally sound solutions. The paper aims to investigate one impact of environmental soundness- {{the effects of}} four harvesting systems on the frequency and the characteristics of residual tree damages. The following harvesting systems were surveyed: (i) a <b>cut-to-length</b> wheeled harvester-forwarder system, (ii) a <b>cut-to-length</b> tracked harvester-forwarder system (iii) a <b>cut-to-length</b> harvester-cable yarder system, and (iv) a whole-tree chainsaw-cable yarder-processor system working in Norway spruce stands. After finishing the harvesting operations, a field survey was done to collect data of all residual trees (species, DBH, height) and of tree wounds (size class, location and intensity of damage). The CTL wheeled harvester-forwarder system showed the lowest damage percentage, followed by the CTL tracked harvester-forwarder system, the CTL harvester-cable yarder system and the WT chainsaw-cable yarder processor system. Currently {{the description of the}} character of tree damages is confined to the two CTL harvester-forwarder systems, whereas no mentionable differences were found. 1...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cut-to-length</b> {{harvesting}} systems {{offer an}} alternative to conventional mechanical systems for thinning mixedwood stands. We evaluated {{the performance of a}} single-grip harvester and forwarder in a poplar-dominated mixedwood stand in Southern Ontario to quantify the ef-fect of tree size and tree form on harvester productivity and harvesting cost, and to assess the damage caused by the harvesting operation to advance regeneration and re-sidual trees. A single-tree selection silvicultural system was used. Individual trees were assigned a form index based on their visual estimates of limb size and stem form. The <b>cut-to-length</b> harvester produced 23. 1 m 3 per produc-tive machine hour (PMH). Forwarder productivity was 17. 2 m 3 /PMH. The results indicate a significant and positive relationship between harvester productivity and tree size (dbh) and tree form. Tree size (dbh) has the greatest influ-ence on the unit cost of harvesting. At an average 27 cm dbh and extraction distance of 200 m, the stump-to-land-ing cost was approximately 10 US$/m 3. As tree size in-creased, the unit cost of wood produced decreased. Dam-age to residual trees and advance regeneration was mini-mal. The results suggest that single-grip <b>cut-to-length</b> harvesting systems can be effective in managing poplar-dominated mixedwood stands...|$|E
40|$|Need for {{timber and}} energy wood {{harvesting}} machinery in the Leningrad region has been assessed {{in this report}} as the region {{is one of the}} key customers for wood harvesting machinery in Russia. Actual cut has been about 8 million m³ in the recent years and may not increase in the future due to challenges in implementation of the new Forest Code and increasing custom duties for round wood export. Recent and coming development of forestry practices in the region includes fast implementation of <b>cut-to-length</b> harvesting, transfer of technology, introduction of commercial thinnings and energy wood harvesting. The forest machine fleet in the Leningrad region is about 750 machines for traditional technology and about 120 - 150 machines for <b>cut-to-length</b> technology. Domestic machinery fleet is very old, and approximately 80 % of the machines are utilised over normative assigned lifetime. Domestic forest machinery manufacturing has dropped both in quantity and models, and thus imported <b>cut-to-length</b> machinery is replacing domestic tree-length machinery. Results indicate that the need for <b>cut-to-length</b> machinery is 20 - 30 harvesters, forwarders and short-wood trucks per year and could increase to 30 - 40 machines each in the near future. Maximum need for the machinery in the Leningrad region could be 50 - 60 harvesters, forwarders and short-wood trucks per year if allowable cut and thinnings would be realised in full scale. Need for energy wood harvesting machinery is about 4 biomass forwarders, 10 mobile chippers and wood chip trucks per year and could be 6 and 15 - 20 machines per year in the near future, respectively. Maximum need could be 30 - 40 biomass forwarders, mobile chippers and wood chip trucks per year if energy wood would be collected after fully realised allowable cut and thinnings. Currently only one third of the forest leasers in the Leningrad region have enough forest resources and could be users of Nordic <b>cut-to-length</b> technology based on actual cut. These 41 enterprises would need 270 machines, of which 90 harvesters, 100 forwarders and 80 short-wood trucks. Thirty seven companies in energy wood harvesting would need about 50 biomass forwarders and chippers and about 60 wood chip trucks. Ten biggest enterprises would need half of the total fleet. Sixty percents of the forest leasers in the Leningrad region have enough forest resources and could be users of Nordic <b>cut-to-length</b> technology if allowable cut would be utilised completely and if also thinnings would be done in full scale. These about 70 enterprises would need 500 - 770 machines, of which 160 - 260 harvesters, 190 - 280 forwarders and 150 - 230 short-wood trucks. In energy wood harvesting 56 - 70 companies would need 100 - 150 biomass forwarders and chippers and 110 - 180 wood chip trucks.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{in this paper}} a two echelon timber procurement {{system in which the}} first echelon consists of multiple harvesting blocks and the second echelon consists of multiple mills (e. g., sawmills), both distributed geographically. Demand is put forward by mills in the form of volumes of logs of specific length and species. Due to the impact of log handling and sorting on <b>cut-to-length</b> harvester and forwarder productivity [Gingras, J. -F., Favreau, J., 2002. Incidence du triage sur la productivité des systèmes par bois tronçonnés. Avantage 3], the harvesting cost per unit volume increases as the number of product variety harvested per block increases. The overall product allocation problem is a large scale mixed integer programming problem with the objective of minimizing combined harvesting and aggregated transportation costs, under demand satisfaction constraints. A heuristic is first introduced then, an algorithm based on the branch-and-price approach is proposed for larger scale problems. Experimentations compare solutions found with the heuristic with the corresponding optimal solutions obtained with both Cplex (using the branch-and-bound approach) and the branch-and-price approach. Results demonstrate the good performance level of the heuristic approach for small scale problems, and of the branch-and-price approach for large scale problems.

40|$|Time {{equations}} {{are derived}} for felling with chainsaw, skidding with cable wheeled skidder, loading with grapple hydraulic loader and trucking of logs within a <b>cut-to-length</b> harvesting method. The continuous time study method {{was applied to}} collect data for felling, skidding, loading and a transportation model. Multiple regression analysis via SPSS software was applied to develop the time models. Felling time {{was found to be}} highly dependent on diameter at breast height. Skidding distance, winching distance, slope of the trail and piece volume were significant variables for the skidding time prediction model. The loading time model was developed considering piece volume. Transportation distance and load volume were used as independent variables in modeling the transportation time. The net production of felling was estimated at 12 trees/h (56. 65 m 3 /h). The net production rates for skidding, loading and traveling averaged 18. 51, 41. 90 and 3. 32 m 3 /h respectively. The total cost of harvesting from stand to mill was estimated 19. 70 €/m 3. The skidding phase was the most expensive component of the <b>cut-to-length</b> method. The bucking and delimbing components were less costly than the other logging phases. The results of this study can be used for harvesting planning and productivity optimization...|$|E

40|$|Aim of study: The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to compare the effects of different types of forestry machine chassis on the compaction of the top layers of soil and to define the soil moisture content level, at which machine traffic results in maximum compaction. Area of study: Measurements were conducted in eight forest stands located in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The soil types in the stands subjected to the study were luvisols, stagnosols, cambisols, and rendzinas. Material and Methods: The measurements were focused on tracked and wheeled (equipped with low pressure tyres) <b>cut-to-length</b> machines, and skidders equipped with wide and standard tyres. The bulk density of soil was determined from soil samples extracted from the ruts, the centre of the skid trail, and the undisturbed stand. To determine soil moisture content, at which the soil is the most susceptible to compaction, the Proctor standard test was employed. Main results: The moisture content for maximal compaction fluctuated from 12 % to 34. 06 %. Wheeled machines compacted the soil to 1. 24 – 1. 36 g. cm - 3 (30. 3 – 35. 4 % compaction) in dried state. Bulk density of soil in stands where tracked machine operated was lower, ranging from 1. 02 to 1. 06 g. cm - 3 (25. 3 % compaction). Research highlights: All wheeled machines caused the same amount of soil compaction in the ruts, despite differences in tyres, machine weight, etc. Maximum compaction caused by forestry machines occurred at minimal moisture contents, easily achievable in European climatic conditions.    Keywords: soil compaction; bulk density; soil moisture content limits; <b>cut-to-length</b> machines; skidders. </p...|$|E
