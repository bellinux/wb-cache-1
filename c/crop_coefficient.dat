50|$|Crop {{coefficients}} are {{properties of}} plants used in predicting evapotranspiration (ET). The most basic <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Kc, {{is simply the}} ratio of ET observed for the crop studied over that observed for the well calibrated reference crop under the same conditions.|$|E
50|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} {{is usually}} measured indirectly, from other climatic factors, but {{also depends on}} the surface type, such as free water (for lakes and oceans), the soil type for bare soil, and the vegetation. Often a value for the potential evapotranspiration is calculated at a nearby climate station on a reference surface, conventionally short grass. This value is called the reference evapotranspiration, and {{can be converted to}} a potential evapotranspiration by multiplying with a surface coefficient. In agriculture, this is called a <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The difference between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation is used in irrigation scheduling.|$|E
50|$|The most {{general and}} widely used {{equation}} for calculating reference ET is the Penman equation. The Penman-Monteith variation is {{recommended by the}} Food and Agriculture Organization and the American Society of Civil Engineers. The simpler Blaney-Criddle equation was popular in the Western United States for many years {{but it is not}} as accurate in regions with higher humidities. Other solutions used includes Makkink, which is simple but must be calibrated to a specific location, and Hargreaves. To convert the reference evapotranspiration to actual crop evapotranspiration, a <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> and a stress coefficient must be used. Crop coefficients referred to in many hydrological models are themselves during periods for which the model is used. This is because crops are seasonal, perennial plants mature over multiple seasons, and stress responses can significantly depend upon many aspects of plant condition.|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of crop water use {{is critical for}} accurate irrigation scheduling and water licenses. However, the direct measurement of crop water use is too expensive and time consuming to be performed under all possible conditions, which necessitates the use of water use models. The FAO- 56 procedure is a simple, convenient and reproducible method, but as canopy cover and height vary greatly among different orchards, <b>crop</b> <b>coefficients</b> may not be readily transferrable from one orchard to another. Allen and Pereira (2009) therefore incorporated a procedure into the FAO- 56 approach which estimates <b>crop</b> <b>coefficients</b> based on a physical description of the vegetation and an adjustment for relative crop stomatal control over transpiration. Transpiration <b>crop</b> <b>coefficients</b> derived using this procedure and fixed values for citrus, did not provide good estimates of water use in three citrus orchards.

40|$|<b>Crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Kc) -based {{estimation}} of crop evapotranspiration {{is one of}} the most commonly used methods for irrigation water management. However, uncertainties of the generalized dual <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Kc) method of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 can contribute to crop evapotranspiration estimates that are substantially different from actual crop evapotranspiration.

Therefore, the possibility of directly estimating the <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> from satellite reflectance of a crop was investigated. The Kc data used in developing the relationship with NDVI were derived from back-calculations of the FAO- 56 dual crop coefficients procedure using field data obtained during 2007 from representative US cropping systems in the High Plains from AmeriFlux sites.

The three methods differ in the calculation of the basal <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Kcb) and the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation (fc). The first approach strictly follows the FAO- 56 procedure, with Kcb given in the FAO- 56 tables and fc calculated from Kcb (No- Calibration method). The second method uses local Kcb and fc values estimated from field measurements (Local-Calibration method) and the last approach uses a remotely-sensed vegetation index to estimate Kcb and fc (NDVI-Calibration method). The analysis was performed on three fields using actual (AET) measured by Eddy Correlation systems. It was shown that the Local-Calibration approach gave best results. Accurate estimates of Kcb and fc were necessary for FAO- 56 ‘‘dual'' <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> application. The locally derived Kcb for winter wheat taken at initial, mid-season, and maturity crop growth were 0. 15, 0. 90 and 0. 23, respectively.

40|$|Crop water {{requirements}} are commonly estimated with the FAO- 56 methodology {{based upon a}} two-step approach: first a reference evapotranspiration (ET 0) is calculated from weather variables with the Penman–Monteith equation, then ET 0 is multiplied by a tabulated crop-specific coefficient (K c) to determine the water requirement (ET c) of a given crop under standard conditions. This method has been challenged {{to the benefit of}} a one-step approach, where crop evapotranspiration is directly calculated from a Penman–Monteith equation, its surface resistance replacing the <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Whereas the transformation of the two-step approach into a one-step approach has been well documented when a single <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> (K c) is used, the case of dual crop coefficients (K cb for the crop and K e for the soil) has not been treated yet. The present paper examines this specific case. Using a full two-layer model as a reference, it is shown that the FAO- 56 dual <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> approach can be translated into a one-step approach based upon a modified combination equation. This equation has the basic form of the Penman–Monteith equation but its surface resistance is calculated as the parallel sum of a foliage resistance (replacing K cb) and a soil surface resistance (replacing K e). We also show that the foliage resistance, which depends on leaf stomatal resistance and leaf area, can be inferred from the basal <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> (K cb) in a way similar to the Matt–Shuttleworth method...|$|E
40|$|The FAO- 56 {{procedure}} for estimating the <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> Kc {{as a function}} of fraction of ground cover and crop height has been formalized in this study using a density coefficient Kd. The density coefficient is multiplied by a basal Kc representing full cover conditions, Kcb full, to produce a basal <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> that represents actual conditions of ET and vegetation coverage when the soil surface is dry. Kcb full is estimated primarily {{as a function of}} crop height. Kcb full can be adjusted for tree crops by multiplying by a reduction factor (Fr) estimated using a mean leaf stomatal resistance term. The estimate for basal <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Kcb, is further modified for tree crops if some type of ground-cover exists understory or between trees. The single (mean) <b>crop</b> <b>coefficient</b> is similarly estimated and is adjusted using a Ksoil coefficient that represents background evaporation from wet soil. The Kc estimation procedure was applied to the development periods for seven vegetable crops grown in California. The average root mean square error between estimated and measured Kc was 0. 13. The Kc estimation procedure was also used to estimate Kc during midseason periods of horticultural crops (trees and vines) reported in the literature. Values for mean leaf stomatal resistance and the Fr reduction factor were derived that explain the literature Kc values and that provide a consistent means to estimate Kc over a broad range of fraction of ground cove...|$|E
50|$|Various {{forms of}} <b>crop</b> <b>coefficients</b> (Kc) account for {{differences}} between specific vegetation modeled and a reference evapotranspiration (RET or ET0) standard. Stress coefficients (Ks) account for reductions in ET due to environmental stress (e.g. soil saturation reduces root-zone O2, low soil moisture induces wilt, air pollution effects, and salinity). Models of native vegetation cannot assume crop management to avoid recurring stress.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was developed in}} Fortaleza, CE (latitude 3 degrees 43 `S, longitude of 38 degrees 32 `W and altitude of 19. 5 m). It aimed to determine the Evapotranspiration and the <b>crop</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the different stadiums of seedless watermelon (Citrullus lanatus, Schrad), using the water balance method in drainage lysimeter. The experimental unit consisted of four located drainage lysimeter {{in an area of}} 600 m(2). The culture Evapotranspiration (ETc) was determined by the method of the water balance, in a volume of soil control with depth of 0. 45 m, whose humidity was monitored by tensiometers. The reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) was estimated by the method of the class A pan. The <b>crop</b> <b>coefficients</b> were obtained from the rate between ETc and ETo in the different stages. The ETc presented growing values from the vegetative stage to the fruiting stage, dropping straight away in the mature stage. The maximum value of kc was observed in the fruiting stage...|$|R
40|$|Jatropha and Pongamia are a {{potential}} source of biodiesel and grow {{in a wide range}} of agroclimatic zones and soil conditions. Data and knowledge available on water requirement of Jatropha and Pongamia are very scarce. <b>Crop</b> <b>coefficients</b> are important parameters used for assessing water requirement and irrigation scheduling. In the present study, <b>crop</b> <b>coefficients</b> of Jatropha and Pongamia were estimated using water balance approach. Temporal data on soil moisture at different depths in block plantations of Jatropha and Pongamia at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) farm, Patancheru in India, were collected at 15 days interval between 2007 and 2010. Measured soil moisture data were analyzed using one-dimensional water balance model. Results showed that annual water requirement of Jatropha is 750 mm and of Pongamia is about 950 mm in semi-arid tropics. <b>Crop</b> <b>coefficients</b> of Jatropha ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 95 and of Pongamia from 0. 30 to 1. 10 depending on plant growth stage in different months. ICRISAT received 820 mm of rainfall in a normal year (data between 2001 and 2010) during the monsoon, of which 52 % (430 mm) contributed to evapotranspiration (ET), 34 % (280 mm) was stored in soil, and 14 % (110 mm) was lost through surface runoff. Stored soil moisture during monsoon season was subsequently utilized by the Jatropha and 270 mm converted into ET during nonmonsoonal period. Pongamia utilized stored soil moisture more effectively than Jatropha as it could remove water from deeper soil layers even at high levels of soil moisture suction...|$|R
