40|$|For {{accurate}} {{determination of}} thickness-profile in vessel quantification, {{it is important}} to find appropriate vessel crosssections. To obtain vessel <b>cross-sections,</b> a centerline-based approach has been widely used, but it has several inherent problems causing improper <b>cross-sections.</b> First, this approach cannot define <b>cross-sections</b> in a unique way. Second, <b>cross-sections</b> are sensitive to the degree of smoothness of a detected vessel centerline. Third, a small variation in a centerline causes a considerable change in the resultant <b>cross-sections</b> and this phenomenon brings about improper crosssections in the abnormal vessel of asymmetric structure. Finally, wrong <b>cross-sections</b> may be detected due to the intersection with the other <b>cross-sections</b> in a region of high curvature. In this paper, instead of a centerline, we propose and adopt a complementary geodesic distance field. Then, we detect a sequence of equidistant lines by using the proposed distance field. Finally, we determine <b>cross-sections</b> by refining the obtained equidistant lines. Due to the prospective properties of the proposed distance field, we can alleviate all of the conventional problems and obtain the <b>cross-sections</b> more proper for vessel quantification. Through the intensive simulation using various 2 -D synthesized images, we prove that the proposed method provides non-intersecting <b>cross-sections</b> which are insensitive to local variation of geometrical shapes in abnormal vessels...|$|R
5|$|Because of its asymmetry, the {{reaction}} between 249Cf and 50Ti was predicted {{to be the}} most favorable practical reaction for synthesizing unbinilium, although it is also somewhat cold, and is further away from the neutron shell closure at N = 184 {{than any of the other}} three reactions attempted. No unbinilium atoms were identified, implying a limiting <b>cross-section</b> of 200fb. Jens Volker Kratz predicted the actual maximum <b>cross-section</b> for producing unbinilium by any of these reactions to be around 0.1fb; in comparison, the world record for the smallest cross section of a successful reaction was 30fb for {{the reaction}} 209Bi(70Zn,n)278Nh, and Kratz predicted a maximum <b>cross-section</b> of 20fb for producing the neighbouring ununennium. If these predictions are accurate, then synthesizing ununennium would be at the limits of current technology, and synthesizing unbinilium would require new methods.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the measurements of normalized, absolute differential <b>cross-sections</b> for electron-impact vibrational transition in CO.
