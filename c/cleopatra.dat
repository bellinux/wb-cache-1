5|$|Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of <b>Cleopatra)</b> is based loosely on Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and <b>Cleopatra,</b> {{in which the}} Queen of Egypt travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an {{alliance}} with the Roman general Mark Antony. While superficially similar to The Coral Finder, <b>Cleopatra</b> is {{more closely related to}} the style of Regnault, with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures are out of proportion to each other and the ship, while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting. As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture.|$|E
5|$|In 1821 Etty's The Arrival of <b>Cleopatra</b> in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of <b>Cleopatra)</b> was a {{critical}} success. The painting featured nude figures, and over the following years Etty painted further nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. All {{but one of the}} 15 paintings Etty exhibited in the 1820s included at least one nude figure.|$|E
5|$|In 1821 the Royal Academy {{accepted}} and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of <b>Cleopatra</b> in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of <b>Cleopatra),</b> which depicted {{a large number}} of nude figures. <b>Cleopatra</b> was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of <b>Cleopatra,</b> over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Leigh and Laurence Olivier {{performed}} {{two plays}} about <b>Cleopatra,</b> William Shakespeare's Antony and <b>Cleopatra</b> and George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and <b>Cleopatra,</b> alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a {{season at the}} Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.|$|E

5|$|In the Augustan History, Zenobia {{is said to}} {{have been}} a {{descendant}} of <b>Cleopatra</b> and claimed descent from the Ptolemies. According to the Souda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, after the Palmyrene conquest of Egypt, the Greek sophist Callinicus of Petra wrote a ten-volume history of Alexandria dedicated to <b>Cleopatra.</b> According to modern scholars, by <b>Cleopatra</b> Callinicus meant Zenobia. Apart from legend, there is no evidence in Egyptian coinage or papyri of a contemporary conflation of Zenobia with Cleopatra; it may have been invented by Zenobia's enemies to discredit her. Zenobia's alleged claim of a connection to <b>Cleopatra</b> seems to have been politically motivated, since it would have given her a connection with Egypt and made her a legitimate successor to the Ptolemies' throne. A relationship between Zenobia and the Ptolemies is unlikely, and attempts by classical sources to trace the queen's ancestry to the Ptolemies through the Seleucids are apocryphal.|$|E

5|$|The Triumph of <b>Cleopatra</b> {{illustrates}} {{a scene from}} Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and <b>Cleopatra,</b> in which <b>Cleopatra,</b> Queen of Egypt, travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a magnificently decorated ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general Mark Antony. An intentionally cramped and crowded composition, it shows a huge {{group of people in}} various states of undress, gathering on the bank to watch the ship's arrival. Although not universally admired in the press, the painting was an immediate success, making Etty famous almost overnight. Buoyed by its reception, Etty devoted much of the next decade to creating further history paintings containing nude figures, becoming renowned for his combination of nudity and moral messages.|$|E

5|$|When Philip {{returned}} to Pella, {{he fell in}} love with and married <b>Cleopatra</b> Eurydice, the niece of his general Attalus. The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of <b>Cleopatra</b> Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian. During the wedding banquet, a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.|$|E

5|$|Man and Superman, {{completed}} in 1902, {{was a success}} both at the Royal Court in 1905 and in Robert Loraine's New York production in the same year. Among the other Shaw works presented by Vedrenne and Granville-Barker were Major Barbara (1905), depicting the contrasting morality of arms manufacturers and the Salvation Army; The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), a mostly serious piece about professional ethics; and Caesar and <b>Cleopatra,</b> Shaw's counterblast to Shakespeare's Antony and <b>Cleopatra,</b> seen in New York in 1906 and in London the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{criticism}} {{did little}} to dissuade Etty from attempting to reproduce the success of <b>Cleopatra,</b> and he concentrated on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including <b>Cleopatra),</b> and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages.|$|E

5|$|After his {{election}} by the League of Corinth as their commander-in-chief (strategos autokrator) of a forthcoming campaign {{to invade the}} Achaemenid Empire, Philip II sought to shore up further Macedonian support by marrying <b>Cleopatra</b> Eurydice, niece of general Attalus. Yet talk of providing new potential heirs infuriated Philip II's son Alexander (already {{a veteran of the}} Battle of Chaeronea) and his mother Olympias, who fled together to Epirus before Alexander was recalled to Pella. Further tensions arose when Philip II offered his son Arrhidaeus's hand in marriage to Ada of Caria, daughter of Pixodarus, the Persian satrap of Caria. When Alexander intervened and proposed to marry Ada instead, Philip cancelled the wedding arrangements altogether and exiled Alexander's advisors Ptolemy, Nearchus, and Harpalus. To reconcile with Olympias, Philip II had their daughter <b>Cleopatra</b> marry Olympias' brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) Alexander I of Epirus, yet Philip II was assassinated by his bodyguard Pausanias of Orestis during their wedding feast and succeeded by Alexander.|$|E
