40|$|AbstractBackgroundEndoscopy is a {{vital part}} of medical {{diagnostic}} processes. There are different kinds of flexible endoscopes used in medicine. They differ between manufacturers and even between models from the same manufacturer. However, all flexible endoscopes have the same basic components. Infections related to flexible endoscopic procedures are caused by either endogenous flora or exogenous microbes. The first major challenge of reprocessing is infection control, most episodes of infection can be traced to procedural errors in cleaning and disinfecting, the second major challenge is to protect personnel and patients from the exposure to liquid biocides used for disinfection. Because the endoscopic accessories have complex nature, attention and adherence to a validated protocol is critical for reprocessing endoscopic accessories. Bioburden is defined as the number of bacteria living on a surface that has not been sterilized. The term is most often used in the context of bioburden testing, also known as microbial limit testing, which is performed on pharmaceutical products and medical products for quality control purposes. Flexible endoscopes, by virtue of the types of body cavities they enter, acquire high levels of microbial contamination (bioburden) during each use. Aim of the workTo detect the average bioburden values on different parts of flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes after clinical use and cleaning in order to assess the efficiency of different cleaning processes used in the endoscopy unit. MethodsThe current study included a total of 120 endoscopes randomly selected from Medical Research Institute (MRI) hospital 60 (50 %) of which were from Surgical Department endoscopy unit, and 60 (50 %) of which were from Internal Medicine Department endoscopy unit. The endoscopes were divided as (40) endoscopes after use (40) endoscopes after manual cleaning, and (40) endoscopes after high level disinfection. All samples were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and for Candida species, the number of colonies were determined as colony forming units (cfu) /ml. ResultsMicroorganisms isolated immediately after use were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides, whereas after manual cleaning the isolated strains were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, and E. coli. The average Bioburden on endoscopy before <b>cleaning</b> <b>ranged</b> from 6 × 104 to 3. 7 × 108 cfu per device (mean cfu per device 1. 4 × 107), whereas after manual <b>cleaning</b> <b>ranged</b> from 2. 1 × 102 to 3. 5 × 103 cfu per device (mean cfu per device 4. 9 × 102) and no colonies were found after sterilization. Manual cleaning resulted in a mean of 4. 46 log 10 reduction in viable colony count and high level disinfection (HLD) resulted in a reduction of CFU to zero. ConclusionsHLD is superior to manual cleaning in the process of endoscopic disinfection. RecommendationsMicrobiological screening should be undertaken for all the Endoscopy Unit personnel responsible for cleaning or if there is a clinical suspicion of cross-infection related to endoscopy. All health-care personnel in an endoscopy unit in standard infection control should be trained to reprocess endoscopes.

Most frequent clients of Elacatinus include damselfish, Pomacentridae and grunts, Haemulidae and planktivores. Rather than seeking their client actively, they remain close to their cleaning station and seldom move more than a meter laterally. They do, however, dance in zig-zag swimming pattern to attract clients. Hosts come to the cleaning sites and pose to show their intent to receive service. Such poses are usually directed at the cleaning station rather than the individual gobies. However, not all the potential clients, or those who pose, are attended by cleaners.

40|$|The {{methods for}} {{pretreatment}} of steel surfaces used {{up to now}} were, with some exceptions, based on DIN 55 928. This standard defines the mechanical rust-removal method 'St' and the blast cleaning rust-removal method 'Sa'. These methods present an essential cost factor. On top of this there are problems of environmental burdening at the work site and the discharge of blast waste, which will raise the cost further in the future. Up to now, the traditional coating materials were adjusted to the standard mentioned above, so only surfaces pre-treated according to it were accepted by the producers of these coatings. Attempts to use other methods failed {{because of the lack}} of surface preparation standards. The customers or users (shipyards and shipping companies) as well as producers and manufacturers of corrosion-preventing materials could not accept non DIN-defined surfaces, because the DIN describes only dry methods.

Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the physical welfare of dogs in CB facilities and their environment in Indiana. This study specifically aimed 1) to characterize dog foot health in CB facilities {{as a function of}} the length of time dogs were housed on a given flooring substrate, 2) to characterize visual dog body cleanliness and visual kennel cleanliness {{as a function of the}} flooring substrate, 3) to determine the efficacy of kennel cleaning procedures and 4) to characterize the dog dental and ear health in CB facilities. ^ With these aims in mind, physical examinations assessing foot, hock and elbow health; periodontal disease (PD) and ear health were performed on 118 dogs at five CB facilities in Odon, Indiana. Indoor flooring types were diamond-shaped coated expanded metal, polypropylene, or concrete. Dogs also had access to concrete outdoor runs and play yards containing natural surfaces. Time housed at the facility and body condition (BCS) were likely to influence foot health. Therefore, additional data collected included length of time housed at the facility and BCS. To characterize kennel and dog body cleanliness, visual cleanliness scores (scale 1 - 5; 1 = clean) were recorded for both. To determine fecal contamination, kennel floors were swabbed after routine cleaning using electrostatic dry cloths, and later cultured for E. coli. Breed size and age likely influenced PD, so data was collected for both. PD (scale of 0 - 4; 0 =normal), ear erythema as well as ear debris and excess hair (scale 1 - 4; 1 = normal) were also visually scored. Because of high variation between facilities and breeds, descriptive statistics were used for analysis and results were stratified by facility. ^ Most foot health problems observed were minor (e. g. matted foot hair n= 50, or minor footpad fissures (cracks) n= 6). Severe foot health conditions such as cutaneous lesions (n= 6) or cysts (n= 2) were rare. There was not a tendency to see increased foot health problems with increased time the dogs were housed at their respective facilities. BCS was ideal for most dogs assessed (3 =ideal; mean BCS= 3. 2). The most common elbow or hock health problem was alopecia (n= 16). Both dogs and kennels were clean, as mean kennel and dog cleanliness scores were 1. 2 and 1. 0, respectively (1 =clean). The percentage of individual kennels that were culture-positive for E. coli after routine <b>cleaning</b> <b>ranged</b> from 7 % to 31 % among facilities. Twenty-nine dogs showed evidence of PD after visual examination, which was more common in smaller sized dogs. Findings also showed that nine dogs examined had ear erythema. Additionally, 28 dogs examined had excess ear debris and 23 dogs had excess hair, which was more common in long haired breeds. ^ Results suggested that the flooring types assessed were not inherently detrimental to dog foot health, but management practices (e. g. access to multiple surfaces) likely had a large effect. Dogs and kennels were visually clean, indicating that current management procedures (e. g. grooming or cleaning regimen) were effective for maintenance of unsoiled conditions. The range in fecal contamination suggested that the cleaning products and protocols impacted fecal contamination to different degrees regardless of flooring type. Long hair breeds may need more ear care, while smaller sized dogs may require increased dental care. The preventive care likely contributed to the majority of dogs having low dental and ear health concerns. It is also possible that the visual scales missed signs of PD. Future studies should aim to understand the impacts of management on dog health and dog and kennel cleanliness by investigating in locations outside of southern Indiana. Future research should also assess different flooring substrates as a function of dog breed and size using larger sample sizes. ...|$|R

Additional desalination water was recovered from RO brine using the vibratory shear-enhanced processing (VSEPÂ®; New Logic, Inc.). SSF removed 90 % of the turbidity in raw CAP water. SSF decreased {{total organic carbon}} by almost 20 %. After {{a little more than}} a year of continuous operation, performance of the RO system declined noticeably, as indicated by a rapid decrease in membrane permeation coefficient and an increase in salt flux. Foulant scrapings contained both clay material and large amounts of unidentified organics. Alternative hypotheses regarding major sources of membrane foulants are discussed in this study. Water lost as brine was reduced from 20 % to 2 - 4 % via post-RO VSEP treatment. Estimated costs were compared to those of a no-VSEP option in which disposal of the entire RO brine flow was required. The total annualized cost of brine treatment was fairly insensitive to recovery during VSEP treatment in the range 80 - 90 %, and the period of VSEP operation between <b>cleanings</b> in the <b>range</b> 25 - 40 hrs.

The flow behaviour generated by a stationary horizontal water jet impinging on a vertical target surface (Perspex, glass or polypropylene) was investigated. The work was studied experimentally and numerically (modelling). The jets were generated by nozzles {{similar to those used}} in industrial <b>cleaning,</b> with diameters <b>ranging</b> from 2 to 4 mm. The jet velocity varied from 1. 89 to 12. 2 m s- 1 for flow rates between 0. 48 and 4 L min- 1. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to give detailed information about surface velocity distributions. Existing models for the impingement region gave reasonable predictions of the flow pattern. However, marked disagreement was found between the velocity field derived from these models and the velocities measured by PIV. The Nusselt thin film assumption, generally used when the flow is laminar and uniform, was found to be inaccurate as the flow is wavy and unsteady. The modelling of the draining film zone was {{based on the work of}} Mertens et al. (2005). This model was found to predict a negative film thickness due to the use of a quartic function for the height distribution. PIV measurements revealed that Mertens et al. ’s assumption of a uniform velocity across the entire cross-section at a given vertical location was inaccurate. The draining film zone possesses a flat central region where the velocity is uniform, whereas the outer region, called the rope, is characterized by a relatively large thickness and a non-uniform velocity profile. Waves were also detected on the surface of the falling film, which led to interrogate the validity of the Nusselt falling film assumption used by Mertens et al. (2005) to derive the model. An alternative boundary condition based on capillary force alone was proposed for Mertens et al. ’s model and this gave a good prediction of the narrowing pattern as well as the velocity field. The results highlighted the importance of the receding contact angle...|$|R

The <b>ranges</b> of frequency and ultrasonic power studied were 40 – 132 kHz and 100 – 500 W respectively. Three solvents were tested to compare the cleaning efficiency and parts damage (low boiling point solvent: acetone and high boiling point solvent: N- Methyl Pyrolidone (NMP) around 200 °C and mixture of acetone 30 % and NMP 70 %). The best cleaning condition obtained from the experiments are 40 kHz with 5 min followed by 58 kHz 5 min followed by 132 kHz with 4 min followed by 58 / 132 kHz with 4 min. The removal efficiency (85 %) is high for multiple frequencies with shorter cleaning time of each frequency compared to single frequency (70 %) with longer cleaning time of same frequency (58 kHz). The surface damage induced by Ultrasonics at the contact area is almost 0 for the best cleaning condition irrespective of the solvent used (∼ 0. 01 % for acetone). As the power level increases, damage of parts also increases. The cavitation intensity is higher for higher power level. Therefore, the parts undergo more vibration and leads to more parts damage. The parts damage is more for acetone as compared to NMP. The result also indicates that the removal efficiency is high for Co-solvent (acetone +NMP) comapred to acetone or NMP alone. The AlTiC surface profile of the burned parts can be measured by using Atomic Force Microscope technique (AFM). The result indicates that the surface roughness value (Ra) obtained from AFM analysis for good and burned slider was 2. 294 nm and 8. 288 nm respectively. The Ra value was almost 4 times higher for burned slider. The defects/contamination on the AlTiC surface can be detected by using Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) analysi...|$|R
5000|$|The {{patented}} process uses sponge rubber balls which are {{injected into the}} cooling water flow (1) before it enters into the condenser. The diameter of the cleaning balls is only slightly bigger than the nominal diameter of the condenser tubing. Due to their elasticity they generate a contact pressure on {{their way through the}} condenser tubes by which fouling is removed from the inner tube walls. At the condenser outlet a strainer (2) is installed in the connecting pipe which separates the balls from the water flow and feeds them into a DN 80 pipe. From there the balls are pumped back to their starting point by a 4 kW impeller pump via a DN 80 pipe. To inject the balls into the cycle, a pressure vessel with detachable cover is installed downstream of the pump. This so-called collector (3b) is equipped with a screen and a [...] At open flap, the balls can pass and with closed flap they remain in the collector and can be replenished or exchanged. The process works continuously and the tubes remain free of mud, algae, bacteria and scaling. The operation of the system is ed via sight glasses and electronic measuring instruments. The screen surfaces are arranged on shafts with pivoted bearings and can be turned on demand to have fouling removed by the water flow. In this process the balls are caught in the collector. This time-consuming procedure is automatized (3c), gear motors (M) operate the relevant actuators. The minal diameters of the screens have been adjusted to respond to the developments in power station technology and are produced in sizes from nominal diameter 150 mm to 3600 mm. The <b>cleaning</b> ball diameters <b>range</b> from 14 to 30 mm and filling one collector normally requires several hundred of them. However, some cleaning systems can require well over a thousand cleaning balls. The lifetime of the cleaning balls which are produced of biodegradable natural rubber is around 4 weeks.|$|R
