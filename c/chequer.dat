5|$|The Hall of Ambassadors ("Sala dos Embaixadores"), {{sometimes}} called the throne room or the Hall of Mirrors, was designed by Robillon in 1757 {{and is one of}} the largest reception rooms in the palace. This long low room has a ceiling painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt console table above which are pier glasses adorned with crystal sconces. The throne dais, set in an apse, is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and the floor is a <b>chequer</b> board pattern of black and white marble tiles.|$|E
5|$|Commander Martin Brooke (played by Alex Ferns) {{is the son}} of a car {{mechanic}} and his naval {{background is}} based on piloting, rather than commanding a ship. He is assisted by Lt Cdr Jenny Howard (played by Emily Hamilton), who is initially his temporary XO, but eventually accepts Brooke's offer to stay on the ship. Lieutenant Commander William Lewis, the Marine Engineering Officer (played by Ian Bartholomew), is the superior of Charge Chief Marine Engineering Artificer (CCMEA) Andy Fellows (played by Steve Speirs) and Lewis's refusal to give the engines full maintenance regularly infuriates him, though not as much as LMEA Dave Finnan (played by Paul <b>Chequer)</b> who has just had a baby with his daughter Teresa (played by Chloe Howman). New Operator Mechanic Rosie Bowen (played by Joanna Page) settles into her first posting and attracts the attention of OM Mickey Sobanski (played by Lee Turnbull), who is contemplating his future in the Navy after an incident in the first episode.|$|E
5|$|Some of Belton's many {{rooms have}} been altered {{over the last}} 300 years both in use and design. One of the {{principal}} rooms, the Marble Hall (1), {{the first of the}} large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a <b>chequer</b> board patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton's conception, the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from William the Conqueror to William III, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by Jeffry Wyatville, who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate oak installed new doors.|$|E
50|$|The {{now defunct}} Royal Parks Constabulary {{originally}} wore {{green and white}} <b>chequers,</b> but later changed to the standard police blue and white <b>chequers.</b> The Royal Parks Constabulary Scotland were a separate force to their aforementioned English counterparts and they also used green and white <b>chequers.</b>|$|R

25|$|The <b>Chequer</b> Board (1947) : A {{dying man}} looks up three wartime comrades, {{one of which}} sees Burma during Japanese {{occupation}} and in its independence period after the war. The novel contains an interesting discussion of racism in the US and in the US Army stationed in Britain: British townsfolk prefer the company of black soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Commando, a red <b>chequer</b> bird, was bred in Haywards Heath, Sussex in the United Kingdom by Sid Moon. Moon was {{a pigeon}} fancier {{who had served}} with the Army Pigeon Service during the First World War. With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Moon offered the service of his pigeons to the war effort in 1939. Commando was one of the pigeons taken into military service.|$|E
25|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme is}} the bridging of social barriers such as class (Lonely Road and Landfall), race (The <b>Chequer</b> Board), or religion (Round the Bend). The Australian novels are individual hymns to that country, with subtle disparagement of the mores of the United States (Beyond the Black Stump) and overt antipathy towards the post-World War II socialist government of Shute's native Britain (The Far Country and In the Wet).|$|E
50|$|Caddington has a Non-League {{football}} team Caddington F.C. and a thriving cricket club with three adult teams and a youth development section. It {{is also home}} to Caddington <b>Chequers</b> FC who compete in the Leighton & District Sunday Football League. The <b>Chequers</b> Public house have also sponsored Caddingtons newest football club, AFC <b>Chequers</b> Caddington who compete in the South Beds & district Sunday football league.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{isolated}} location, {{there were}} no inns in the village until 1800, though by the 1840s there were four (the Sun in Church Lane, the <b>Chequers,</b> the Double <b>Chequers</b> at Mill Hill and the Hardwicke Arms). In 1834, the overseer of the poor considered that an excess of beer-houses may have been partly responsible for recent problems. Only the <b>Chequers</b> was left after 1967.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 Little Kimble {{received}} the British Royal Train. The G8 Summit {{was held in}} Birmingham that year and the wives of the G8 countries' leaders, including Cherie Blair and Hillary Clinton, were taken to <b>Chequers</b> via the Royal Train and Little Kimble, which is the nearest station to <b>Chequers.</b> The train reversed at Princes Risborough and the wives alighted at Little Kimble, whence they were transferred to <b>Chequers</b> via limousine.|$|R
25|$|Kingswood's Church of Jesus Christ and the Wisdom of God, much {{of which}} was {{formerly}} {{one of the two}} early St Sophia's (Greek Orthodox) Churches in London, marks the start of Buckland Road and is a Grade I listed building on architecture, it features red brick and stone in various patterns e.g. <b>chequer</b> work, herringbone and basketweave; exotic marble and other stone, nine imported corinthian capitals from Turkey, Arts and Crafts movement lectern, pulpit and reading desk, in ebony and holly with mother of pearl inlay, priests' chairs with domed canopies, Byzantine capitals from Constantinople and Ephesus decorate the aisles and west wall.|$|E
25|$|Each shoulder-clasp {{consists}} of two matching curved halves, hinged upon a long removable chained pin. The surfaces display panels of interlocking stepped garnets and <b>chequer</b> millefiori insets, surrounded by interlaced ornament of Germanic Style II ribbon animals. The half-round clasp ends contain garnet-work of interlocking wild boars with filigree surrounds. On {{the underside of the}} mounts are lugs for attachment to a stiff leather cuirass. The function of the clasps is to hold together the two halves of such armour so that it can fit the torso closely in the Roman manner. The cuirass itself, possibly worn in the grave, did not survive. No other Anglo-Saxon cuirass clasps are known.|$|E
25|$|Honeywood {{is a large}} Grade II listed {{house at}} {{the western end of}} the picturesque Carshalton Ponds. At its earliest, it dates from the 17th century but it has been much {{extended}} and restored since. In particular, during the period 1896 to 1903 when it was owned by one John Pattinson Kirk, a London merchant, a large Edwardian wing was added to the south side. The 17th century element lies behind the fa√ßade {{in the form of a}} flint and chalk <b>chequer</b> building. The house now plays host to the London Borough of Sutton's Museum, and has a local history collection, including objects that date back to the Bronze Age. There is a tea room and a shop.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chequers</b> Estate Act 1917 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that designates <b>Chequers</b> as the {{official}} country residence of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It was given Royal Assent on 20 December 1917.|$|R
50|$|Cassington's two {{remaining}} public houses are the <b>Chequers</b> and the Red Lion, {{on opposite sides}} of Upper Cassington green. In the 1990s the <b>Chequers</b> was demolished and replaced with a row of traditional cottages built of traditional local stone and a new village hall, but a new <b>Chequers</b> Inn was included in the redevelopment. It is controlled by the Young's pub company. The Red Lion remains in its original building, complete with a stone-lined well visible inside the building.|$|R

25|$|Several of Shute's novels {{explore the}} {{boundary}} between accepted science and rational belief, on the one hand, and mystical or paranormal possibilities, including reincarnation, on the other hand. Shute does this by including elements that can be considered fantasy or science fiction in novels that are classified as mainstream. These are based in elements that would be considered religious, mystical, or psychic phenomena in the British vernacular when they were written. These include: Buddhist astrology and folk prophecy in The <b>Chequer</b> Board; the effective use of a ouija board in No Highway; a messiah figure in Round the Bend; and past and future lives with a psychic connection, near-future science fiction, and Aboriginal psychic powers in In the Wet.|$|E
25|$|Continuing {{under the}} new High Hoe Road bridge, the river passes the {{derelict}} Grade II listed Italianate pumping station built in 1881 to pump sewage away from Worksop, before passing under the Chesterfield Canal again, through a 3-arched aqueduct. A feeder, which is at a higher level, passes under the canal through a culvert, and joins the canal through a sluice just below Kilton lock, after which the river and canal run parallel, until they pass through separate arches of a nine-arched viaduct which carries the Sheffield to Lincoln Railway line, opened in 1849. The river then follows a winding course through the estate of Osberton Hall and the village of Scofton, turning north to skirt {{the western edge of}} Ranby. Ranby <b>Chequer</b> Bridge marks {{the point at which the}} river, having flowed eastwards for most of its course, turns to the north west. The bridge itself can be reached from Ranby village by a footpath which runs along the central reservation of the A1 road for a short distance. The next major crossing is the B6045 at Hodsock Red Bridge, its three arches constructed of red bricks with stone lining, after which an early 19th-century Grade II listed twin-arched bridge carries the drive to Hodsock Priory over the river.|$|E
500|$|The first {{parts of}} the Close to be {{constructed}} were this first floor barrel-roofed common hall above a store room, kitchen and bakehouse which were completed in 1348. The fireplace, with a lectern, and the east window with stained glass, were added in the 15th century. [...] A room known as The <b>Chequer</b> above the staircase was added in the early 15th century. It has a large fireplace {{which may have been}} enlarged following a fire. One of the vicars known as The Receiver sat in the room to receive rents and other funds due to the vicars, which were kept in a large chest dating from 1633. Next to The <b>Chequer</b> is the [...] Muniment Room which has a filing cabinet dating from around 1420 used to hold documents such as leases of land. Beneath these rooms is The Treasury which has ten cupboards where the vicars vestments were stored.|$|E
50|$|John Russell Greenhill was an English vicar {{who owned}} <b>Chequers,</b> Bucks. He {{was the son}} of Samuel Greenhill, Esq. of Swyncombe, Oxon of the East India Company and Elizabeth Russell.

500|$|Temeraire duly {{received}} {{orders to}} join the Cadiz blockade, and having sailed to rendezvous with Collingwood, Harvey awaited Nelson's arrival. Nelson's flagship, the 100-gun , arrived off Cadiz on 28 September, and he took over command of the fleet from Collingwood. He spent {{the next few weeks}} forming his plan of attack in preparation for the expected sortie of the Franco-Spanish fleet, issuing it to his captains on 9 October {{in the form of a}} memorandum. The memorandum called for two divisions of ships to attack at right angles to the enemy line, severing its van from the centre and rear. A third advance squadron would be deployed as a reserve, with the ability to join one of the lines as the course of the battle dictated. Nelson placed the largest and most powerful ships at the heads of the lines, with Temeraire assigned to lead Nelson's own column into battle. [...] The fleet patrolled a considerable distance from the Spanish coast to lure the combined fleet out, and the ships took the opportunity to exercise and prepare for the coming battle. For Temeraire this probably involved painting her sides in the Nelson <b>Chequer</b> design, to enable the British ships to tell friend from foe in the confusion of battle.|$|E
