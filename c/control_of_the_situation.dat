Although he performs adequately when they initially secure the empty colony, he quickly loses <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> when the Aliens ambush his troops. Ripley takes over, driving the command vehicle, and Gorman is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he transfers command of the colony's defense to Hicks.

Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak... his tongue is like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party.

40|$|Careful {{character}} {{design is}} a way to strengthen a role-playing game experience. Well-defined characters that are consistently communicated to players are an important ingredient in a potentially successful game. In this paper I will explore the important aspects in a character, those that support and make character immersion possible. My starting point is that in a role-playing game posing as somebody else is elementary to the game. This is close to arguments that character immersion is a key element <b>of</b> a role-playing. <b>The</b> pleasurable role-playing experience thus requires a player to be able to present a character and (to some extent) experience what the character is experiencing. Pleasure in role-playing games, however, has double logic. On the one hand, it requires character immersion {{but on the other hand}} it always requires simultaneous knowledge that one is playing a game. 1 <b>Control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> (as a player of a game) and knowledge that events in a game have no real consequences can make even unpleasant events and failures of a character pleasurable for a player. The player’s actions, nevertheless, make it possible to break a game and ruin the illusion for bot...|$|R

5|$|Members of Clann Somairle seem to {{have been}} attacking parts of the Crovan dynasty's island-kingdom, {{possibly}} taking advantage of the warring between Rögnvaldr and Óláfr. It may have been that they were also lending support to Alan's destabilising incursions into the Isles.

In fact, the saga notes that Óspakr-Hákon was also a son of Dubgall, and it is likely that his family connections would have made him a palatable over-king of the unruly Clann Somairle. Óspakr-Hákon's kingdom was likely meant to encompass the territories of Clann Somairle, and control of the Crovan dynasty's domain may have been retained by the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} remained {{deeply concerned}} about the Bolshevik threat, and in May 1919 the Winnipeg General Strike broke out, creating a national crisis which ministers feared {{would lead to a}} revolution. The mounted police were deployed to maintain public order and generate intelligence on the strikers; 245 mounted police were sent into the city, supported by four machine guns mounted on lorries. On June 21, which became known as Bloody Saturday, military veterans marched through the city in support of the strikers; the authorities called in the mounted police to break up the marchers. By the time the police arrived, the protesters had begun to riot and the police carried out two mounted charges. The police then concluded that they were losing <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and fired their revolvers into the crowd, killing one man and injuring others.

5|$|The {{provisions}} {{remained in}} effect for three years; at one point Henry's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward Ieven joined forces with Montfort. It was not until 1261 that Henry was able to move against the opposition. Receiving a papal annulment of the provisions, he reassumed control of government. Over the next two years, however, Henry's governing deteriorated the situation once more. He failed to reconcile with Montfort, and alienated Gloucester's son and heir Gilbert. In April 1263 Montfort returned to England after a long stay in France, and reignited the reform movement. On 16 July Henry was surrounded by rebel forces in the Tower of London, and once more forced to accept {{the conditions of the}} provisions. Prince Edward, now firmly {{on the side of his}} father against Montfort, now took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> In October Edward took Windsor Castle, and the baronial alliance started to break up.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit, which his father had helped to found. From 13 November 1914, Nevinson spent nine weeks in France with the FAU and the British Red Cross Society, mostly working at a disused goods shed by Dunkirk rail station known as the Shambles. The Shambles housed some three thousand badly wounded French troops, who had been evacuated from the Front and then all but abandoned. For weeks they had been left unfed and untended with the dead and dying lying together on dirty straw. Nevinson, alongside his father and other volunteers, worked to dress wounds, help clean and disinfect the shed and started to make it habitable. Nevinson later depicted his experiences in The Shambles in two paintings, The Doctor and La Patrie. As the French authorities began to take <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> Nevinson was reassigned as an ambulance driver. Although Nevinson would often make much of this time as an ambulance driver, particularly in his publicity material, he only held the role for a week as, due to his poor health, he lacked the strength to steer the vehicle. By January 1915 his worsening rheumatism had made him unfit for further service and he returned to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, {{early in}} 1262, Edward fell {{out with some}} of his former Lusignan allies over {{financial}} matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, with only limited results. Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement. It was at this pivotal moment, as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began to take <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights. He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey – and retook Windsor Castle from the rebels. Through the arbitration of King LouisIX of France, an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called Mise of Amiens was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.|$|E

5|$|By 1264, {{the reign}} of Henry III was deeply troubled by {{disputes}} between the king and his nobility. The conflict was caused by several factors: the influence of foreigners at court, a wasteful war over the crown of Sicily, and a personal dispute between King Henry and Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. In 1258, Henry was forced to accept the so-called Provisions of Oxford, whereby he effectively surrendered control of royal government to a council of magnates. In 1259 the baronial program of reform was further elaborated upon in the Provisions of Westminster. The provisions remained in effect for three years; {{it was not until}} 1261 that Henry was able to move against the opposition. Receiving the papal annulment of the provisions his emissaries had campaigned for, he re-assumed control of government.
