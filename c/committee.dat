5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential <b>committee</b> promotions to ranking member.

On the Judiciary <b>Committee,</b> Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services <b>Committee.</b> Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services <b>Committee</b> to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary <b>Committee.</b> Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations <b>Committee</b> following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L.

It is expected to report its findings regularly to its corresponding-level party <b>committee.</b> If a member of the local party <b>committee</b> is involved in corruption, the local CDI should ask the party <b>committee</b> at the corresponding level and the CDI at the level above to approve a full investigation. Before the 2014 reforms it was difficult for the CDIs to carry out their responsibilities; although they no longer needed approval from the secretary of the corresponding-level party <b>committee,</b> CDI officials were often appointed to positions of power within the institutions they were tasked to supervise (see above). The 2004 reforms increased CDI independence from the party committee; they were previously elected by the corresponding-level party <b>committee,</b> but beginning in 2004 CDI membership was selected by the upper-level CDI.
