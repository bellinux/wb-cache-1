40|$|AbstractDe-bonding {{of carbon}} fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRP) <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>plates</b> from the concrete substrate {{is one of}} the major reasons behind premature failures of beams that are externally strengthened with such CFRP materials. To delay or prevent de-bonding and therefore enhancing the load carrying capacity of strengthened beams, several anchorage systems were developed and used. This paper investigates the use of CFRP mechanical anchorage of CFRP <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>plates</b> used to externally strengthen reinforced concrete beams under flexure. The pin-and-fan shape CFRP anchor, which is custom-made from typical rolled fiber <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> bundles of loose fiber is used. Several reinforced concrete beams were casted and tested in standard four-point bending scheme to study the effectiveness of this anchorage system. The beams were externally strengthened in flexure with bonded CFRP <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> then fastened to the soffit of the beams’ using various patterns of CFRP anchors. It is observed that the CFRP plates begins to separate from the beams as soon as de-bonding occurs in specimens without CFRP anchors, while in beams with CFRP anchors de-bonding was delayed leading to increase in the load carrying capacity over the un-anchored strengthened beams...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{response of}} Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams strengthened by an Externally Bonded Reinforcement (EBR) {{made out of}} Fiber‐Reinforced Polymers (FRPs) is deeply influenced by {{the interaction between the}} concrete substrate and the FRP system, either cured in place (sheets) or preformed (plates). In particular, the strength of FRP‐EBR RC beams is often controlled by debonding phenomena which develop at the adhesive‐to‐concrete interface. The most recent theoretical formulations as well as some experimental results obtained in the last years pointed out the differences which characterize the debonding strength of FRP <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>plates.</b> According to the findings of those studies, the fracture energy is a fundamental parameter governing the debonding phenomenon. However, determining its value is not sufficient for simulating the behavior of the FRP‐to‐concrete interface and modeling relevant problems such as intermediate debonding in RC beams externally strengthened by FRP. Consequently, formulating and calibrating local bond‐slip models which take into account the different behavior of <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> <b>plates,</b> is of fundamental importance for modeling FRP‐strengthened RC members. The present paper is aimed at identifying bond laws for <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>plates</b> through an Indirect Identification Method (IndIM), recently implemented and validated by the authors. A wide collection of experimental results obtained by pull‐out tests on FRP <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>plates</b> is firstly reported and then employed for identifying the above mentioned bond‐slip laws. Finally, the results of the identification procedure demonstrate that the debonding phenomenon, described as a fracture process in mode II, should be modeled by assuming different bond‐slip relationships for FRP <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates for strengthening existing reinforced concrete (RC) structures is strictly {{related to the}} bond of the FRP reinforcement to the concrete substrate. Although numerous experimental studies have investigated this bond, experimental data concerning cyclic tests on both FRP <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>plates</b> applied on concrete specimens are still lacking.

40|$|The {{fatigue crack}} growth {{behavior}} under constant amplitude and under single overload of 2024 aluminum alloy in <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> product form has been investigated. Constant amplitude fatigue crack growth tests showed superior crack growth {{resistance of the}} plate attributed to a pronounced roughness induced crack closure {{as a result of}} the coarse and elongated grain structure. Crack growth tests with single overload showed that the retardation effect caused by the overload is not primarily influenced by roughness crack closure at the crack path. In this case, the sheet material with lower yield strength revealed a higher retardation effect than the plate material. The observed crack growth behavior has been simulated with the LTSM-F model, which accounts for retardation of crack growth after an overload due to material strain hardening at the crack front. Dissimilar strain hardening at the crack tip due to different yield strength for the <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> has been considered by means of strength gradients inside the overload plastic zone. The analytical results confirmed the observed material crack growth trends. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

However, the S 0 waves are known to be dispersive, and that dispersion must be considered in order to isolate the small, texture‐induced shifts in the S 0 wave velocity. Currently, there are two approximate dispersion correction methods, one proposed by Thompson et al. 9 and the other introduced by Hirao and Fukuoka. 20 In this paper, these two methods will be evaluated using an exact theory for wave propagation in orthotropic plates. Through the evaluation, the limits of the current texture measurement techniques are established. It is found that when plate thickness to wavelength ratio is less than 0. 15, both Thompson’s and Hirao’s methods work satisfactorily. When the thickness to wavelength ratio exceeds 0. 3, neither Thompson’s nor Hirao’s dispersion correction method provides adequate corrections for the current texture measurement techniques. Within the range of 0. 15 – 0. 3, Thompson’s method is recommended for weakly anisotropic <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> Hirao’s method may be more appropriate for some strongly anisotropic cases...|$|R
