40|$|A {{photographic}} shutter was considered, {{comprised of}} a mechanically driven, pivoted opening blade and a spring driven, pivoted <b>closing</b> <b>blade</b> which is released by a magnetic holding coil through an armature lever. The {{magnitude of the}} viscous drag of air on the <b>closing</b> <b>blade</b> is approximated, {{and its effect on}} the travel time (lag time) of the blade is determined to be insignificant. A set of equations is derived representing the dynamic performance of the combination of the <b>closing</b> <b>blade</b> and the armature lever. These equations are used to develop a mathematical representation of the variation in lag time due to manufacturing tolerances of the parts involved. Then an optimization computer program is devised and utilized which uses an 2 ̆ 2 exhaustive 2 ̆ 2 search technique to locate the minimum for the variation in lag time as a function of five independent variables. A previously written 2 ̆ 2 gradient based 2 ̆ 2 optimization computer program is also employed to minimize variation in lag time. The exhaustive program yields a reduction in variation of lag time of 6 percent while the gradient based program yields a reduction of 2 percent...|$|E

40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{characteristics of}} tuned and randomly mistuned blade assemblies which possess two blade-alone natural modes with close frequencies are studied. Modal interactions {{among the two}} blade modes are shown to be come extremely significant for small frequency separation. The two distinct loci of the aeroelastic eigenvalues, which characterize an assembly with well separated modes, fully merge into a single root locus as the blade-mode frequency separation vanishes. Also, while {{in the case of}} well separated blade modes the introduction of random mistuning into one blade mode affects only the assembly modes which are predominantly of that blade-mode type, mistuning results in the localization of all the assembly modes when the blade-alone natural frequencies are close. Results indicate {{that in the case of}} closely-spaced blade modes a single-degree of freedom blade model yields qualitatively erroneous results and that an N-blade assembly with two <b>close</b> <b>blade</b> modes behaves like an equivalent 2 Nb-blade assembly with a single blade mode...|$|R

50|$|A {{butterfly}} knife, {{also known}} as a fan knife and in the Philippines as the balisong, is a folding pocket knife.

40|$|A new inverse {{inviscid}} method {{suitable for}} the design of rotating blade sections lying on an arbitrary axisymmetric stream-surface with varying streamtube width is presented. The geometry of the axisymmetric stream-surface and the streamtube width variation with meridional distance, the number of blades, the inlet flow conditions, the rotational speed and the suction and pressure side velocity distributions as functions of the normalized arc-length are given. The flow is considered irrotational in the absolute frame of reference and compressible. The output of the computation is the blade section that satisfies the above data. The method solves the flow equations on a (phi 1, psi) potential function-streamfunction plane for the velocity modulus, W and the flow angle beta; the blade section shape can then be obtained as part of the physical plane geometry by integrating the flow angle distribution along streamlines. The (phi 1, psi) plane is defined so that the monotonic behavior of the potential function is guaranteed, even in cases with high peripheral velocities. The method is validated on a rotating turbine case and used to design new blades. To obtain a <b>closed</b> <b>blade,</b> a set of closure conditions were developed and referred...|$|R

2500|$|The lockback's {{blade locking}} {{mechanism}} is a refinement of the slipjoint design; both utilize a strong backspring located {{along the back}} of the knife.

50|$|Another {{concern with}} {{installing}} a ceiling fan {{relates to the}} height of the blades relative to the floor. Building codes throughout the United States prohibit residential ceiling fans from being mounted with the <b>blades</b> <b>closer</b> than seven feet from the floor; this sometimes proves, however, to not be high enough. If a ceiling fan is turned on and a person fully extends his or her arms into the air, as sometimes happens during normal tasks such as stretching or changing bedsheets, it is possible for the blades to strike their hands, potentially causing injury. Also, if one is carrying a long and awkward object, one end may inadvertently enter the path of rotation of a ceiling fan's blades, which can cause damage to the fan. Building codes throughout the United States also prohibit industrial ceiling fans from being mounted with the <b>blades</b> <b>closer</b> than 10 feet from the floor for these reasons.|$|R
