For the compare function, IBM implemented what would now be called an XOR gate using opposing electromagnets. If neither magnet was energized or both magnets were energized at the same time, the relay armature would not move. If only one magnet was energized, the armature would move and touch one of two contacts placed on either side. The two contacts were wired together internally and connected to an exit hub that indicated an unequal comparison.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{physiological}} {{effects of a}} single kettlebell workout to a high-resistance circuit workout in resistance-trained males. Methods: 12 resistance trained healthy males (age: 24 ± 2. 97 years; height: 1. 75 ± 0. 064 m; body mass: 75. 99 ± 8. 46 kg) participated in this study. Participants had a familiarization visit and two subsequent experimental visits (kettlebell workout; circuit workout). The kettlebell workout consisted of 12 -minutes of standardized kettlebell swings. The circuit workout consisted of three sets of 6 repetitions of smith machine squats, bench press, leg curl, and lat pulldown. Heart rate, rectal temperature, skin temperature, blood lactate, rating of perceived exertion, muscle pain, and thermal sensation were measured throughout. Statistical analysis was done using one-way repeated measures ANOVA and a one-sampled T-test both with alpha set at 0. 05. Results: More work was performed in the kettlebell swing workout <b>compared</b> to <b>circuit</b> workout (p 3 ̆c 0. 006). Heart rate was significantly higher throughout exercise for kettlebell (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) <b>compared</b> to <b>circuit</b> workout. Core temperature was significantly higher post-exercise in kettlebell <b>compared</b> to <b>circuit</b> workout (KB: Post-exercise = 38. 03 ± 0. 342 ˚C; CW: Post-exercise = 37. 43 ± 0. 341 ˚C, respectively; p 3 ̆c 0. 008). Rating of perceived exertion, and thermal sensation were significantly higher during kettlebell than circuit workout (both p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Muscle pain was significantly higher the last two measurements of exercise in kettlebell than the circuit workout (p 3 ̆c 0. 006).

40|$|Verification of gate-level {{implementations}} of arithmetic circuits {{is challenging}} {{due to a}} number of reasons: the existence of some hard-to-verify arithmetic operators (e. g. multiplication), the use of different operand ordering, the incorporation of merged arithmetic with cross-operator implementations, and the employment of circuit transformations based on arithmetic relations.

Specifically, the verification task is decomposed into a sequence of equivalence checking subproblems, each of which <b>compare</b> <b>circuit</b> pairs derived from the implementation under verification based on the proposed self-referential functional equations.
