40|$|The UK brewing {{industry}} {{is valued at}} £ 28 bn per year and provides over 700, 000 jobs in the UK. A growing sector of this market (7 % growth p. a.) is comprised of microbrewers who brew cask ale, a product worth £ 1. 8 bn and responsible for 45, 000 jobs. There are now over 100 microbrewers in the East Midlands. In the UK, the domestic market for cask ale is extremely saturated and brewers are looking to expand their market by selling bottled beer in the same market and exporting abroad. However, bottling beer is currently extremely expensive and time consuming for microbrewers in the East Midlands region, since it is either bottled by hand or sent a considerable distance, {{as there is no}} contract bottling facility in the region. Recent research indicates that about 25 % of the regional craft brewers in the East Midlands now bottle condition beer and others have expressed an interest in doing so. However, there are no contract bottling companies that are central to the East Midlands area and so beer is transported significant distances to be bottled and returned to the production brewery for distribution. This makes the process costly and environmentally less sustainable than it could be if a local facility were available. The scope of this dissertation is to identify the optimal solution for a fleet of vehicles, which will provide a <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service</b> of beer, from a centralised Bottling Plant. The objective is to achieve reduction in CO 2 emissions potentially generated by the introduction of a service of collection and delivery of beer from the Bottling Facilities. This dissertation explains why this problem is considered a Vehicle Routing Problem and how was resolved using the Cost Saving heuristic introduced by Clarke and Wright (1964), and later the Tabu Search metaheuristic introduced by Glover (1986). It is later explained how this heuristics were implemented using a macro in Microsoft Excel and the simulations obtained. The results show that the heuristic and metaheuristic combined generate a high quality solution, reducing considerable the CO 2 emissions projected. However, some considerations before using the tool designed must be contemplated, therefore recommendations are given in this document. Finally, guidance, for the future end-user of the software implemented, is presented and future research directions are addressed...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} current {{performance}} of the clinical biochemistry service provided to general practitioners, with particular attention to result turnround times, and to identify and improvements required. METHODS: Postal questionnaire survey of general practitioners in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets who used the clinical biochemistry laboratory of the Royal London Hospital. A flow analysis study of turnround times for general practitioner samples was also performed. RESULTS: Responses to the questionnaire showed that although 82 % of general practitioners thought the current quality of service provided was better than fair, the actual turnround times achieved were longer than the acceptable times required. There was also a strong demand (> 66 % of responders) for additional information-such as highlighting of abnormal results-to be provided with results. There was wide variability between practitioners {{in their use of}} the laboratory (from none to > 800 requests per year), with no apparent correlation to practice size. Of the repertoire of tests requested, a surprisingly high percentage (14. 3 %) were for thyroid function. Flow analysis of turnround times for thyroid function tests showed that problems lay not with the time taken for analysis (only 7. 8 % of the total turnround time) but with the pre- and postanalytical phases, that is, the sample <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> results <b>delivery</b> <b>service.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the proportion of health care delivered in the primary care sector will inevitably increase the requirement for pathology services. Improvements in the specimen <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> results <b>delivery</b> <b>service</b> to general practitioners are needed to meet their expectations. It remains to be determined whether increased investment in these aspects of laboratory service would result in improved patient care in the primary sector...|$|R

40|$|Certain racial, ethnic, and {{economic}} groups, specifically men {{of color and}} men with low incomes, experience disproportionately high rates of chronic illness and of diseases and conditions that are leading causes {{of death in the}} United States. The dismal rates of morbidity and premature death among poor men and men of color in the United States underscore societal inequities and exacerbate health disparities among these populations. As the evidence of disparities continues to compound, the need for many-layered responses to address complex and intractable health inequalities becomes more obvious. Detailing the actual utilization of health services in specific populations by gender, race, ethnicity, and income can contribute to a wider understanding of health dispari-ties and the costs of inadequate access to quality health care. Such population-based approaches to data <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> health <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> within a community context can both ameliorate health disparities and suggest novel interventions to inform policy decisions.

40|$|The {{ability of}} an economy to adapt {{to changes in the}} {{economic}} environment has long been regarded as an important constituent of economic growth (e. g. North 1991). The adaption of existing firm and market structures requiring the configuration of path dependant organisational structures, operating routines and the wider regulatory institutions that bound market structure. Rail hauled freight was regulated during the 19 th century as if the railway companies' had a monopoly of carriage in this market. By 1918, government was considering how best to deal with a mature industry, where the benefits of competition needed to be weighed against the efficiency associated with a natural monopoloy. Government control of the railways in the war had demonstrated the benefits of co-operation, perhaps even nationalisation. The creation of the Ministry of Transport in 1919 and the subsequent Railways Act of 1921 were an attempt by government to ensure the continued financial health of a private sector rail network, which at the same time could deliver a cheap, efficient service to the business community, thereby ensuring Britain's continued prosperity. The difficulty faced in the post-war market was very different to that of 1914. Massive investment in road hauled, internal combustion engine technology by government during the war provided cheap assets to those wishing to establish their own businesses. The legislative process surrounding the 1921 Act specifically distinguished between rail and road transport, and attempts by the railway companies, the London North Western Railway in particular, to obtain road powers failed, largely it seems through vagaries of the administrative process. Although the railways were eventually granted road powers in 1928, the difficulties associated with changing the regulatory framework are indicative of a key management problem faced by management: how to change the regulatory infrastructure to better suit operational and commercial reality? It was the emergence of road haulage on a large scale that was to provide the main difficulty faced by the railway companies' in the period 1923 to 1939, and beyond into nationalisation. Indeed it may be argued that the difficulty of chosing the most appropriate mode of transport is still at the heart of transport policy today. This paper will argue that it was the failure of government to act on the analysis of its own servants that created many of the problems faced by railway managers in the inter-war period. The potential difficulties were recognised by civil servants and some railway managers in 1919, but the political process was not able to deliver an effective response. There was a missed opportunity to enable the railway companies to focus on providing the best transport, rather than rail or road hauled, service. Regulation created a market of road hauliers and rail hauliers, and did not encourage the integration of both. The acquisition of road carriers by railway companies' extended <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>services,</b> rather than providing a new business model for the carriage of freight. The paper begins with a discussion of the legislative changes surrounding the introduction of the Ministry of Transport and the 1921 Act, before moving on to examine the particular administrative process surrounding the failed attempt to acquire road operating powers for London North Western Railway. The more general issue of transport co-ordination and integration is examined through the flawed attempts by government to intervene in regulating the appropriate mode of transport, through both the continued regulation of the railways as a monopoly and the restrictions on road hauliers of their right to operate on certain routes. The paper will conclude that it was the path dependency of administrative structures and regulatory routines that failed to deliver an effective environment within which an integrated freight haulage network could have developed. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Districting is the {{partitioning}} a large geographical region into sub areas {{according to}} some criteria in order to carry out operations {{that have to be}} conducted within the region.

30|$|Empirical {{evidence}} {{also suggests}} that poor people use saving products more than they use credit. The Opportunity International Bank of Malawi has 45, 000 borrowers and 250, 000 savers, the Equity Bank in Kenya has 715, 000 borrowers and four million depositors, and the Grameen Bank has over US$ 1.4 billion in deposits, which is 145 % of its outstanding loan portfolio of US$ 965 million (Maes and Reed 2012). In a study in Bangladesh, {{it is found that}} there are 27.8 million depositors and about 20.6 million borrowers in a sample of 28 MFIs and that 26 of these 28 Bangladeshi MFIs have more depositors than borrowers (Khan and Ashta 2012). Another study has shown that only 24.5 % of the services of the microfinance institutions go towards the extremely poor (Rahman 1998). Extremely poor people generally tend to exclude themselves from traditional microcredit programs, either through self-exclusion or through a process of peer screening. Self-exclusion refers to the poor people's fear {{of not being able to}} repay the loans due to different social and/or religious barriers; thus, they are not willing to borrow (Hashemi 1997). Many of the poor people are also excluded by the peer members of the traditional group methodology, where they are regarded as risky and unreliable as social collateral (Hulme and Mosley 1997). While the poor people do have their own ways of coping with vulnerability, they do so by accessing savings schemes and emergency loans to enable themselves to cover short-term crises (Hasan and Iglebaek 2004). In this process, they develop a social relationship with the microfinance institutions, where they demand to be served individually through carefully designed savings products. Safe Save in Bangladesh has demonstrated such relationship with its clients through the introduction of a daily <b>collection</b> system <b>and</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> at the doorstep of the clients. The basic philosophy of Safe Save's financial service to its clients is to give them the opportunity to save, without any mandatory requirement to borrow, unlike the traditional Grameen approach, where progressive borrowing is a precondition to access such service.|$|R
40|$|This report {{argues that}} the general {{practice}} sector needs to collect the Indigenous status of patients {{in order to provide}} health interventions specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, suggesting effective Indigenous identification processes are not widespread in the sector, undermining both <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>and</b> data <b>collection.</b> Summary:The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) was commissioned to evaluate the implementation of the National best practice guidelines for collecting Indigenous status in health data sets (the Guidelines) across health sectors as part of the National Indigenous Reform Agreement. The general practice sector was prioritised in this evaluation because it has a unique role in providing access to health interventions specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as well as in providing input to data collections. This report summarises the evaluation and support project work in the general practice sector between January 2011 and December 2012. Over this period, the project investigated: available information on Indigenous identification in the sectorbarriers to identification and the impact of sub-optimal identification processeschanges introduced since the Council of Australian Governments Closing the Gap commitmentsmeasures to improve identification. The AIHW convened national workshops for general practice sector stakeholders in December 2011 and November 2012. These workshops provided a unique forum for stakeholders to discuss and progress issues. Outcomes from the workshops helped direct the focus of work in the sector. Sub-optimal <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> recording of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status in the general practice sector is a longstanding problem, as in other sectors. Improving this process by implementing the Guidelines is not straightforward. While state and territory governments undertook to implement the Guidelines throughout the health system, general practice is not part of their jurisdictional responsibilities. The Australian Government has some capacity to influence behavioural change but reforms require multi-layered strategies and the involvement of sector-specific stakeholders. Consensus on barriers, enablers and recommendations for improving rates of Indigenous identification has emerged from studies undertaken in this field. These recommendations, which were supported and extended by the general practice workshops, focus on making changes through multiple channels, while ensuring these are centrally coordinated and integrated in an overall plan. The Council of Australian Governments Closing the Gap Indigenous health initiatives, which focused on primary health care, have helped to improve identification in the sector and led to improved uptake of health interventions specific to Indigenous people. These reforms have helped to address some of the barriers to identification, but there are opportunities for further improvements and for the potential of reforms to be fully realised. Some of the identified barriers which have not yet been addressed include the need to: establish a central point of national responsibility and organisation, for example, through the establishment of a taskforce of relevant government and non-government stakeholders, with the remit of improving both data <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> the <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> outcomesimprove clinical information systemsinform Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about the GP-mediated health interventions for which they may be eligible...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study of factors impacting Information and Communication Technology (ICT) adoption in the supply chain of Facilities Management (FM) in Denmark. The research questions addressed in this study are: What are the key factors that influence adoption and assimilation of ICT systems in the supply chain of FM? What are the main benefits gained from deploying ICT systems in FM supply chain? This study is important because it investigates motivators, barriers and benefits of adopting ICT systems in the FM supply chain, which is new to the FM literature as well as the IT innovation adoption literature and supply chain management literature. The report takes the starting point on the definitions of supply chain, supply chain management and FM to go deeper into a literature review of factors that can affect the adoption and assimilation of ICT in the supply chain.   On the base of this literature review a semi-structured interview guide has been developed and 12 in depth interviews have been conducted with respondents from 12 different companies. Each interview lasted circa 1. 5 - 2 hours and all interviews were fully transcribed. Data for the study were also gathered from archival sources as well as attendance to practitioner conferences and workshops on the topic of IT systems in FM. The participant lists of these seminars and conferences, the web site of the Danish network for FM as well as discussion with industry experts were used to find relevant companies and people to interview. The results of the study show {{that there are a number}} of factors that influence adoption and assimilation of ICT in the supply chain of FM in Denmark. By following the literature, these factors have been grouped according to organizational, technology and external environmental factors. Some of the most important organizational factors are better FM management decisions, better long term and short term planning and forecasting of FM resources, better overview and control over the budget and the activities that need to be done as well as bbetter service provided to the customers.   Among the organizational barriers important ones are the difficulty of writing in the contract the process of how and when to get data from the FM service providers, and lack of resources to implement the systems and to make the necessary organizational changes in order for the system to get implemented. Among the external drivers there are improve and control relationships with FM service provider, opportunity to offer single point of contact also in complicated bundled services, government regulation, and critical mass of users. Among the external barriers there are lack of collaboration among software providers, clients and users in order to develop and store all those info and disagreements between the service provider and the customer about the data that need to deliver. In any case supplier-customer interdependence was found as a key external factor. Among the technological factors important are increased control and systematization in data <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery,</b> better decision regarding service provision and employees got more control of their daily work. Among the technological barriers there are the ICT systems are still not user friendly, different systems are not compatible, and lack of standard format and classification schemes for FM data input.
