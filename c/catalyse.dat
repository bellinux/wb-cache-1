5|$|Enzymes must bind their {{substrates}} {{before they}} can <b>catalyse</b> any chemical reaction. Enzymes are usually very specific as to what substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{biological}} macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins {{are essential}} parts of organisms {{and participate in}} virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that <b>catalyse</b> biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion breaks the proteins down {{for use in the}} metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Technetium can <b>catalyse</b> the {{destruction}} of hydrazine by nitric acid, and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies. This caused {{a problem in the}} separation of plutonium from uranium in nuclear fuel processing, where hydrazine is used as a protective reductant to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state. The problem was exacerbated by the mutually-enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage, and required a process modification.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{is similar to}} the reaction <b>catalysed</b> by pyruvate kinase, which also converts pyruvate to PEP. However, pyruvate kinase <b>catalyses</b> an irreversible reaction, and does not consume ATP. By contrast, PPDK <b>catalyses</b> a reversible reaction, and consumes 1 molecule of ATP for each molecule of pyruvate converted.|$|R

30|$|The {{transesterification}} (TER) {{process for}} biolubricant synthesis can be <b>catalysed</b> chemically or enzymatically. Equations (1) and (2) illustrate a two-stage base <b>catalysed</b> transesterification for biolubricant synthesis.|$|R
5|$|The {{generation}} of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated, with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions. When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing parts, domains act as modules with simple independent functions, {{which can be}} mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions. For example, polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics; they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each <b>catalyse</b> one step in the overall process, like a step in an assembly line.|$|E
5|$|The most {{sensitive}} enzyme assays use lasers focused through a microscope to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they <b>catalyse</b> their reactions. These measurements either use {{changes in the}} fluorescence of cofactors during an enzyme's reaction mechanism, or of fluorescent dyes added onto specific sites of the protein to report movements that occur during catalysis. These studies are providing a new view of the kinetics and dynamics of single enzymes, as opposed to traditional enzyme kinetics, which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules.|$|E
5|$|These {{so-called}} non-coding RNAs ("ncRNA") can be encoded {{by their}} own genes (RNA genes), but can also derive from mRNA introns. The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), {{both of which are}} involved in the process of translation. There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to <b>catalyse</b> chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules, and the catalysis of peptide bond formation in the ribosome; these are known as ribozymes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{molecular}} biology 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline decarboxylase (OHCU decarboxylase) [...] is an enzyme involved in purine catabolism. It <b>catalyses</b> the decarboxylation of 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU) into S(+)-allantoin.

5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to <b>catalyse</b> the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases <b>catalyse</b> {{peptide bond}} cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic residue {{of the active}} site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{inhibition}} is {{an unusual}} type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Ornithine decarboxylase can <b>catalyse</b> the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated imine, a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.|$|E

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that clavaminate synthase (CS) <b>catalyses</b> three oxidative reactions in the clavulanic acid biosynthetic pathway. The first CS <b>catalysed</b> step (hydroxylation) {{is separated from}} the latter two (oxidative cyclisation and desaturation) {{by the action of}} a hydrolytic enzyme, proclavaminate amidinohydrolase, which modifies (or 'mutates') the sidechain of the product of the first reaction thereby converting it into a substrate for the second CS <b>catalysed</b> reaction...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the question of}} whether cosmic ray <b>catalysed</b> false vacuum decay can be phenomenologically more important than spontaneous decay via quantum tunnelling. We extend the zero bubble wall width Landau-WKB analysis of <b>catalysed</b> false vacuum decay to include the leading order effects of finite wall width and derive an expression for the thin-wall bubble action. Using this we calculate the exponential suppression factor for the <b>catalysed</b> decay rate at the critical bubble energy, corresponding to the largest probability of <b>catalysed</b> decay. We show that, in general, cosmic ray <b>catalysed</b> decay is likely to be more important than spontaneous decay for sufficiently thin-walled bubbles (wall thickness less than about 30 % of the initial bubble radius), but that spontaneous decay will dominate for the case of thick-walled bubbles. Since any perturbative model with a cosmologically significant false vacuum decay rate will almost certainly produce thick-walled bubbles, we can conclude that cosmic ray <b>catalysed</b> false vacuum decay will never dominate over tunnelling in imposing phenomenological constraints on perturbative particle physics models.

5|$|The best-known role of {{proteins}} {{in the cell}} is as enzymes, which <b>catalyse</b> chemical reactions. Enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only {{one or a few}} chemical reactions. Enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism, as well as manipulating DNA in processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription. Some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification. About 4,000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes. The rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous—as much as 1017-fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase (78 million years without the enzyme, 18 milliseconds with the enzyme).|$|E

40|$|The neurometabolic {{disorder}} L- 2 -hydroxyglutaric aciduria {{was recently}} {{shown to be}} due to a defect in L- 2 -hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. This FAD-linked enzyme <b>catalyses</b> the irreversible conversion of L- 2 -hydroxyglutarate to alpha-ketoglutarate. The formation of L- 2 -hydroxyglutarate results from a side-activity of mitochondrial L-malate dehydrogenase, the enzyme which normally <b>catalyses</b> the interconversion of oxaloacetate and L-malate, but which also <b>catalyses</b> the NADH-dependent conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to L- 2 -hydroxyglutarate.
