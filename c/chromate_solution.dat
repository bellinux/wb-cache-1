50|$|Electroplating {{chromium}} metal from a <b>chromate</b> <b>solution</b> involves {{the formation of}} chromium hydride. If the temperature is high enough the chromium hydride rapidly decomposes as it forms, yielding microcrystalline body-centred cubic chromium. Therefore, {{to ensure that the}} hydride decomposes sufficiently rapidly and smoothly, chromium must be plated at a suitably high temperature (roughly 60C to 75C, depending on conditions). As the hydride decomposes, the plated surface cracks. The cracking can be controlled and there may be up to 40 cracks per millimeter. Substances on the plating surface, mostly chromium sesquioxide, are sucked into the cracks as they form. The cracks heal over and newer electroplated layers will crack differently. When observed with a microscope the electroplated chromium will appear to be in the form of crystals with 120° and 60° angles, but these are the ghosts of the original hydride crystals; the actual crystals that finally form in the coating are much smaller and consist of body centred cubic chromium.|$|E

Cr(VI) removal occurs more rapidly from the <b>chromate</b> <b>solution</b> than from COPR leachate. The reaction is first order with respect to both [Cr(VI) ] and the iron surface area, but iron surface reactivity is lost to the reaction. Buffering pH downward produces little change in the removal rate or the specific capacity of iron until acidic conditions are reached. SEM and XPS analyses confirm that reaction products accumulate on the iron surface in both liquors, but that other surface precipitates also form in COPR leachate. Leachate from highly alkaline COPR contains Ca, Si, and Al that precipitate on the iron surface and significantly reduce the specific capacity of iron to reduce Cr(VI).

The maximum ion exchange capacity was found to be 47. 21 mg g(- 1) for Ca(II) and 27. 70 mg g(- 1) for Mg(II). The kinetic data were tested using Lagergren-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Kinetic data correlated well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the chemical adsorption was the rate-limiting step.
