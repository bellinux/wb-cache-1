The degradation studies of <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> were conducted on four different soils; clay and loamy sand from Thailand, and silt loam and loam soil from Oregon. The variables used included three different temperatures: 1. 7 C (35 F), 23 C (70 F), and 32 C (89. 6 F); three moisture contents: saturation, field capacity, and midway between field capacity and wilting point at a temperature of 30 C; and pH of 6. 5 and 7. 3 for the loamy sand at moisture content midway between field capacity and wilting point at 30 C temperature. The effect of the two chemicals on microorganismal activity was studied using [superscript 14]C-glucose as an indicator in clay and silt loam soils at 30 C at saturated moisture content. The adsorption of <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> on clay and silt loam soils was determined at 23 C. The vapor pressure of propoxur at 23 C and 32 C was determined. The evaporation rate of <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> and propoxur from clay and silt loam soils at 32 C was measured. Leaching of the two chemicals in clay and silt loam was measured in soil columns to compare their mobility.

The efficacy of commercial formulations of β-cyfluthrin and <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> plus deltamethrin at labeled rates was evaluated against adults of 16 field {{strains of the}} red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst); seven strains of sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.); and two strains of the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.). Concrete arenas in plastic Petri dishes (9 cm diameter) were used to simulate the concrete floor of empty bins. The time for ~ 100 % knockdown and mortality of adults of laboratory strains of the three species was first established by exposing them to insecticide-treated concrete surfaces for 1 to 24 h. Adults of field strains of each species were exposed to specific established insecticide-time combinations. Mortality of all species was lower than knockdown, suggesting recovery after seven days when placed on food. <b>Chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> plus deltamethrin did not control all R. dominica and most O. ]surinamensis field strains. β-cyfluthrin was extremely effective against R. dominica but ineffective against T. castaneum and O. surinamensis field strains, even at four times the high labeled rate.

The pyrethroid bifenthrin was evaluated {{as a potential}} new protectant {{in combination with the}} organophosphate <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl,</b> which is already registered for control of several insect pests of stored cereals. Sorghum (200 metric tons) was treated after both the 1999 and 2000 harvests and sampled at intervals to assess treatment efficacy and residue decline during up to 7 mo of storage. Generally, test strains of the beetles Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L), and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) were prevented from producing live progeny for up to 7 mo.

40|$|Four organophosphorus insecticides, azamethiphos, fenitrothion, <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl,</b> and {{pirimiphos-methyl}} {{were each}} mixed with carbaryl and evaluated as structural treatments on concrete and galvanized steel panels (0. 3 × 0. 3 m) against adults of three liposcelidid psocids: Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel, L. entomophila (Enderlein), and L. paeta Pearman. Residual toxicities and persistence of these insecticide mixtures were assessed at 30 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 2 % r. h., and a photoperiod of 12 : 12 (L:D) h from 1 day after treatment (0 week) and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8, and then every 4 weeks up to week 40. Mortality was recorded at exposure periods of 6 h and then every 24 h until end-point was achieved. Significant enhancement in residual toxicities {{was observed in}} azamethiphos plus carbaryl against L. entomophila, and <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> plus carbaryl and pirimiphos-methyl plus carbaryl against all three species on steel surfaces, compared with the individual effectiveness of these insecticides reported earlier. We conclude that combining carbaryl with either azamethiphos, <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl,</b> or pirimiphos-methyl as a structural treatment will provide long-term protection (up to 40 weeks) against infestation by all three psocid species on steel storage structures, whilst carbaryl with fenitrothion will give shorter protection (up to 8 weeks). On concrete structures, however, only azamethiphos plus carbaryl will provide long-term protection against L. bostrychophila (up to 28 weeks) and L. paeta (up to 16 weeks). None of the four insecticide mixtures studied would provide long-term protection against an L. entomophila infestation on concrete surfaces...|$|E

We evaluated time-dependent immediate knockdown (KD) and 7 -day mortality responses of adults of 16 {{strains of the}} red flour beetle, 7 strains of the sawtoothed grain beetle and 2 strains of the lesser grain borer collected from Kansas farms exposed on concrete surfaces to β-cyfluthrin, at low (0. 086 mg(AI) /m 2) and high (0. 172 mg(AI) / m 2) rates, and <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> plus deltamethrin (0. 573 mg(AI) /m 2). Similar species reared since 1999 served as standard laboratory strains. The minimum time for KD and mortality of laboratory strains was established through time-response studies. Time for 100 % KD and mortality was selected for each insecticide-species combination for testing against field strains. Mortality of all species against the two insecticides was lower than KD, suggesting recovery when placed on food. Nonlinear or linear models fitted to KD and mortality data showed significant differences among species and insecticides. Only one red flour beetle strain showed reduced susceptibility to the two insecticides compared to the laboratory strain. Both field strains of lesser grain borers were less susceptible than the laboratory strain to <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> plus deltamethrin but not to β-cyfluthrin. In sawtoothed grain beetle, one strain was significantly less susceptible to <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> plus deltamethrin than the laboratory strain, and two field strains were significantly less susceptible to β-cyfluthrin. Reduced susceptibility in field strains {{could be due to}} development of resistance.

40|$|Globally, {{organophosphate}} (OP) pesticide {{usage and}} exposure is widespread. Studies {{have found that}} fetuses and infants are more sensitive than adults to environmental toxicants and that prenatal exposure to low levels of OPs {{has been associated with}} an Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-like phenotype (ADHD-LP). ADHD is the most commonly studied and diagnosed cognitive and behavioral disorder in school-age children. The etiology of ADHD is unclear, but genetic and environmental factors, such as pesticide exposure, have been hypothesized. Numerous animal studies have demonstrated that in utero exposure to OP pesticides adversely affects neurodevelopment, but human studies remain limited. Using a prospective cohort study design, this research investigates the relationship between in utero exposure to chlorpyrifos and ADHD-LP in low to middle income, school-age, children from a Mexican birth cohort. Maternal, third trimester, second-morning void urine samples were analyzed for 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol (TCPY), a urinary metabolite of chlorpyrifos and <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl.</b> Maternal and child Paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) polymorphisms, PON 1 G 192 R and PON 1 L 55 M were analyzed to explore their relationship with ADHD-LP and as a modifying factor in the relationship between chlorpyrifos (or <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl)</b> exposure and ADHD-LP. We assessed ADHD-LP for children 6 - 13 years old using subscales of Conners’ Parental Rating Scales-Revised, Conners’ Continuous Performance Test, and the parental scores for Behavior Assessment System for Children- 2. Lastly, we assessed whether urinary concentrations of TCPY were associated with circulating thyroid hormone (TH) levels as a potential non-cholinergic mechanism of action of OP neurotoxicity using publicly available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Results of this work suggest fetal exposure to chlorpyrifos, <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl,</b> or TCPY and maternal PON 1 polymorphisms may influence the display of ADHD characteristics in childhood. We also found that urinary TCPY concentrations altered THs. Considering the continued widespread agricultural and possible residential use of chlorpyrifos and <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> in Mexico, this research has added to the current knowledge on environmental predictors of child neurodevelopment and behavior, and provided additional insights into proposed biological mechanisms, susceptibility factors, and biomarker utility...|$|E

Data from the topical application bioassays show that <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> was the most toxic insecticide to T. castaneum adults of the Nikinci population selected with pirimiphosmethyl and deltamethrin, while malathion was the weakest, and both selection procedures changed/reduced significantly only the toxicity of deltamethrin and bifenthrin, increasing their resistance ratios (RR) at the LD 50 from 1. 1 to 1. 8 (bifenthrin) and from 0. 9 to 2. 2 (deltamethrin). Deltamethrin was the most toxic insecticide for Jakovo adults selected with the LD 80 of pirimiphosmethyl, while malathion was again the least toxic.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the entomological impact of <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl,</b> Bacillus thuringiensis, and Gambusia affinis on mosquitoes control in artificial breeding places. MethodsA Latin square design with 4 replicates {{was performed in}} order to {{evaluate the}} efficacy of chlorpyrifosmethyl, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Gambusia affinis on larva. The larvicide was applied at the dosage of 100 mg a. h/ha, Bacillus thuringiensis at the recommended dosage and 10 fishes per m 2 were applied at 1 × 1 m 2 artificial breeding sites. The larval densities for both anopheline and culicine were counted according to larvae / 10 dippers prior and 24 h after application. ResultsAll three control agents are effective for mosquito density reduction, {{and the difference between}} the three agents and the control is significant (P< 0. 05). There is also significant difference among <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl,</b> Bacillus thuringiensis and Gambusia affinis. Bacillus thuringiensis exhibited more reduction on mosquito larval density than fish and larvicide (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsBacillus thuringiensis in comparison with two other agents is the appropriate method for larviciding in the breeding places.

Five larvicides, i. e., <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl,</b> Bacillus thuringiensis, temephos, fenitrothion and methoprene were tested using WHO standard test method in the laboratory condition, against the field and lab strains of Anopheles stephensi Liston of Hormozgan province, southeastern Iran. The LC 50 values were calculated from the probit-regression line for each larvicide. Results exhibited the LC 50 values for B. thuringiensis, <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl,</b> fenitrothion, temephos and methoprene as 0. 08483, 0. 01115, 0. 001131, 0. 001613, 0. 00073 mg L - 1, respectively for lab strain.

There were three strains of Rhyzopertha dominica, and one strain each of Sitophilus oryzae, Tribolium castaneum, Oryzaephilus surinamensis and Cryptolestes ferrugineus. These strains were chosen to represent a range of possible resistant genotypes, exhibiting resistance to organophosphates, pyrethroids or methoprene. Treatments were applied at rates that are registered or likely to be registered in Australia. Adults were exposed to freshly treated wheat for 2 weeks, {{and the effects of}} treatments on mortality and reproduction were determined. No single protectant or protectant combination controlled all insect strains, based on the criterion of > 99 % {{reduction in the number of}} live F 1 adults relative to the control.

If the extent of exceedances is calculated (RQ = MECmax > RAC), in most cases the RQ was less than 5 (Table  1) indicating a limited risk due to pesticides in smaller water bodies.|$|E
40|$|Spinosad and <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> plus {{deltamethrin}} efficacy at labeled {{rates on}} hard red winter wheat were evaluated against 11 field {{strains of the}} red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst); six strains of the sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.); and two strains of the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopedha dominica (F.), collected mostly from farm-stored grain in Kansas. Adults were exposed to wheat treated with spinosad at 1 mg(active ingredient) /kg or chlorpyrifosmethyl plus deltamethrin at three plus 0. 5 mg(active ingredient) /kg. Adult mortality was assessed after 7 and 14 d and progeny production after 42 d. Spinosad did not provide complete mortality or progeny suppression of T. castaneum and O. surinamensis field strains, but was effective against R. dominica strains. <b>Chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> plus deltamethrin produced complete mortality and progeny suppression of field strains all three species. The two least susceptible T. castaneum and O. surinamensis strains and the two R. dominica strains were chosen for dose-response tests only with spinosad.

40|$|Abstract Background Pyrethroid {{resistant}} mosquitoes {{are becoming}} increasingly common in parts of Africa. It is important to identify alternative insecticides which, if necessary, {{could be used to}} replace or supplement the pyrethroids for use on treated nets. Certain compounds of an earlier generation of insecticides, the organophosphates may have potential as net treatments. Methods Comparative studies of <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> (CM), an organophosphate with low mammalian toxicity, and lambdacyhalothrin (L), a pyrethroid, were conducted in experimental huts in Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa. Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes from the area are resistant to pyrethroids and organophosphates (kdr and insensitive acetylcholinesterase Ace. 1 R). Several treatments and application rates on intact or holed nets were evaluated, including single treatments, mixtures, and differential wall/ceiling treatments. Results and Conclusion All of the treatments were effective in reducing blood feeding from sleepers under the nets and in killing both species of mosquito, despite the presence of the kdr and Ace. 1 R genes at high frequency. In most cases, the effects of the various treatments did not differ significantly. Five washes of the nets in soap solution did not reduce the impact of the insecticides on A. gambiae mortality, but did lead to an increase in blood feeding. The three combinations performed no differently from the single insecticide treatments, but the low dose mixture performed encouragingly well indicating that such combinations might be used for controlling insecticide resistant mosquitoes. Mortality of mosquitoes that carried both Ace. 1 R and Ace. 1 S genes did not differ significantly from mosquitoes that carried only Ace. 1 S genes on any of the treated nets, indicating that the Ace. 1 R allele does not confer effective resistance to <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> under the realistic conditions of an experimental hut. </p...|$|E
40|$|Benin {{has embraced}} World Health Organization-recommended {{preventive}} strategies to control malaria. Its National Malaria Control Programme is implementing and/or coordinating various actions and conducting evaluation trials of mosquito control strategies. Mosquito control {{is based on}} the use of insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying, but the efficacy of these strategies to control malaria vectors is endangered by insecticide resistance. Here, we present the results of a nationwide survey on the status of insecticide susceptibility and resistance in Anopheles gambiae s. l. (Diptera: Culicidae) carried out in Benin in 2006 - 2007 (i. e. before extensive vector control was undertaken). Overall, our study showed that the S molecular form of An. gambiae s. s. predominates and is widely distributed across the country, whereas the frequency of the M form shows a strong decline with increasing latitude. Susceptibility to DDT, permethrin, carbosulfan and <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> was assessed; individual mosquitoes were identified for species and molecular forms, and genotyped for the kdr and ace- 1 loci. Full susceptibility to <b>chlorpyrifos-methyl</b> was recorded and very few samples displayed resistance to carbosulfan. High resistance levels to permethrin were detected in most samples and almost all samples displayed resistance to DDT. The kdr-Leu-Phe mutation was present in all localities and in both molecular forms of An. gambiae s. s. Furthermore, the ace- 1 (R) mutation was predominant in the S form, but absent from the M form. By contrast, no target modification was observed in Anopheles arabiensis. Resistance in the An. gambiae S molecular form in this study seemed to be associated with agricultural practices. Our study showed important geographic variations which {{must be taken into account}} in the vector control strategies that will be applied in different regions of Benin. It also emphasizes the need to regularly monitor insecticide resistance across the country and to adapt measures to manage resistance...|$|E
