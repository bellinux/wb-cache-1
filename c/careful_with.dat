5|$|Henry {{inherited}} a vast fortune and a prosperous economy {{from his father}} Henry VII, who had been frugal and <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> money. This fortune was estimated to £1,250,000 (£375million by today's standards). By comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms. Although he further augmented his royal treasury through the seizure of church lands, Henry's heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy.|$|E

25|$|After {{his absence}} due to {{metabolic}} illness, Götze {{returned to the}} field on 14 July 2017 where Dortmund successfully defeated Urawa Reds 3–2 in a friendly match. On 19 August 2017, {{he made his first}} start in seven months in a 3–0 away win against VfL Wolfsburg to start their 2017–18 Bundesliga season; he assisted a goal, and played industriously. After the match, Dortmund's coach Peter Bosz hailed Götze's performance, but stated that he needs to be <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> his midfielder in order to gain full recovery.|$|E
25|$|The rails were {{delivered}} by boat to Bideford Quay by the S.S. Snipe in May 1898 and the sleepers also {{arrived at the}} quay, coming from West Hartlepool in September. Wood blocks were used on the quay, flush with the road surface to deaden the noise, as was the practice on roads with heavy horse and cart traffic in many places. The wood became very slippery and caused accidents in wet weather, the company not always being as <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> the application of sand and gravel {{as it should have}} been.|$|E

25|$|Taylor was <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> his fitness, {{following}} an ankle injury in 1964 {{kept him from}} the first seven games of the season. Taylor wore two pairs of thin Chamois inners and Mitre wicket-keeping gloves from which he cut away all the padding from inside the palms and removed the webbing. His reasoning for this was that he liked to feel the ball in his palm and if taking the ball correctly {{most of the time}} the bruising wasn't too troublesome. This can be contrasted with Knott who preferred plenty of padding on his palms.|$|E
25|$|Since {{social media}} {{marketing}} {{first came to}} be, strategists and markets have been getting smarter and more <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> the way they go about collecting information and distributing advertisements. With the presence of data collecting companies, {{there is no longer}} a need to target specific audiences. This can be seen as a large ethical gray area. For many users, this is a breach of privacy, but there are no laws that prevent these companies from using the information provided on their websites. Companies like Equifax, Inc., TransUnion Corp, and LexisNexis Group thrive on collecting and sharing personal information of social media users. In 2012, Facebook purchased information from 70 million households from a third party company called Datalogix. Facebook later revealed that they purchased the information in order to create a more efficient advertising service.|$|E

Gwen's name is signed in at 8:37 p.m. with {{a license plate}} number that matches the {{campaign}} car in which Rosie's body was found. They question Gwen, who admits she recently lost her keycard but maintains she was at a Tacoma bed and breakfast {{on the night of}} Rosie's murder. Linden asks her about the campaign car, but she warns them to be <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> murder accusations. Later at Holder's apartment, Linden studies the grand opening photo and notices Jackson's former head of security had a broken arm. At the casino, the detectives tell Drays that Jackson framed her former head of security for murder and will eventually do the same to her. They demand to see all withheld casino security footage from the night of Rosie's murder.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, ABS-CBN {{produced}} {{the first ever}} Filipino TV series to be shot in high-definition. This was Rounin, a science fiction, fantasy series created by Erik Matti. This was followed by Budoy in 2011. Prior to this, big budget series like Esperanza, Mula Sa Puso, Pangako Sa 'Yo, and Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay were shot in 16mm film with a 4:3 aspect ratios while low budget series {{on the other hand}} were shot in smaller formats. Beginning with Be <b>Careful</b> <b>With</b> My Heart in 2012, all of ABS-CBN's TV series were all produced in high-definition format. Ningning is the first Filipino TV series to be broadcast in HD on October 5, 2015 while Maalaala Mo Kaya is the first mini-series to do so the day before. On the other hand, the first ever locally produced live entertainment program to be broadcast in HD is the musical variety show ASAP on October 4, 2015.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, long-time Stooge fan Mel Gibson executive-{{produced}} a TV film (The Three Stooges) {{about the}} lives and careers of the comedians. Playing Moe was Paul Ben-Victor, Evan Handler was Larry, John Kassir was Shemp, and Michael Chiklis was Curly. It was filmed in Australia and was produced for and broadcast on ABC. It was based on Michael Fleming's authorized biography of the Stooges, The Three Stooges: From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons. Its unflattering portrayal of Ted Healy led Healy's son to give media interviews calling the film inaccurate. Additional errors of fact included the portrayal that Moe Howard was down on his luck after Columbia cancelled their contract {{and worked as a}} gofer at the studio, where he, his brothers and Larry had formerly worked as actors. In reality, Moe was the most <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> his money, which he invested well. He and his wife Helen owned a comfortable house in Toluca Lake, in which they raised their children.|$|E
25|$|People {{with only}} a casual concern for Internet privacy need not achieve total anonymity. Internet users may protect their privacy through {{controlled}} disclosure of personal information. The revelation of IP addresses, non-personally-identifiable profiling, and similar information might become acceptable trade-offs for the convenience that users could otherwise lose using the workarounds needed to suppress such details rigorously. On the other hand, some people desire much stronger privacy. In that case, they may try to achieve Internet anonymity to ensure privacy — use of the Internet without giving any third parties the ability to link the Internet activities to personally-identifiable information of the Internet user. In order to keep their information private, {{people need to be}} <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> what they submit to and look at online. When filling out forms and buying merchandise, that becomes tracked and because the information was not private, some companies are now sending Internet users spam and advertising on similar products.|$|E

25|$|During the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, the Druze in Mandatory Palestine {{were under}} {{pressure}} from both the Jewish Yishuv leadership and from the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee and {{found it difficult to}} form an opinion about the conflict between the Jews and the Palestinian Arabs. Noble Druze men from nearby countries visited Druze villages in Palestine and preached neutrality. During {{the early days of the}} conflict, a meeting of all the noblemen from all the Druze villages was conducted in Daliyat al-Karmel, where they all agreed not to take part in the riots instigated by the Arab Higher Committee. This decision was backed by Druze leaders in Jabal al-Druze. In the Druze community there were opposing trends: In mixed Druze and Muslim villages such as Isfiya, Shefa-'Amr and Maghar where there were old sectarial disputes and in Druze villages near Haifa and the Jewish settlement in the western Galilee, the local Druze leaders tended to prefer the Jews in the conflict; at the Druze villages deep in Arab areas, the local leaders were more <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> support of the Jews. Josh Palmon was tasked by the Jewish Agency for Israel to manage the relationship with the Druze. He initially led a preventive approach with the Druze, aimed at making sure the Druze will not join the Arab Higher Committee.|$|E
