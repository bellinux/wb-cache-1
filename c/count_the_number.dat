5|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's age by anthropologists {{depends on whether}} or not the individual was an adult or a child. The {{determination of}} the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can <b>count</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the library}} had {{a cache of}} books waiting for the {{completion}} and grand opening that was provided by local residents and schools, as Carnegie's gift for the construction did not cover the initial costs of new books. A call was also put out for citizens to donate books to the new facility to expand the collection. In 1907, the Seattle Public Library {{took control of the}} Carnegie library, when Ballard was annexed by the neighboring City of Seattle government. Early Scandinavian immigrants to Ballard and the Pacific Northwest in particular made use of the new facility; Ballard as an area has a strong historical presence of Scandinavian people. Early in the library's existence, it had a turnstile at the entrance to its book stacks, to <b>count</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of book borrowers that passed through. With the arrival of World War I, the Carnegie Library became home to various community activities, such as dispensing information on the war, and also provided Red Cross and English language classes. In 1942, during World War II, one of the first African American librarians in Seattle, Lucille Smith, was assigned to the Carnegie library.|$|E
5|$|Max Payne 2 {{uses the}} same game engine as the one used in Max Payne, but with several {{significant}} upgrades. Even though the game only supports DirectX 8.1, the graphics in Max Payne 2 mimic those generated by DirectX 9 by making optimal use of effects such as reflection, refraction, shaders, and ghosting. The developers considered one particular scene in which effects are used well: When Max has lucid dreams, the screen appears fuzzy and out of focus. Since Max Payne, the polygon <b>count</b> (<b>the</b> <b>number</b> of polygons rendered per frame) has been increased, which smooths out the edges of character models. In addition, characters have a much greater range of expressions. Previously, Max had only one expression available; in Max Payne 2, he often smirks and moves his eyebrows to react to different scenarios.|$|E

5|$|According to 2010 {{population}} census, 22.3 {{percent of}} Chinese Indonesians {{lived in the}} capital city of Jakarta, located on the island of Java. When the island's other provinces—Banten, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, and East Java—are included, this population accounted for around half (51.8 percent) of all Chinese Indonesians. This data doesn't <b>count</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of ethnic Chinese that has foreign citizenship. West Kalimantan have about 8.15 percent of population is ethnic Chinese, followed by Bangka–Belitung Islands (8.14 percent), Riau Islands (7.66 percent), Jakarta (6.58 percent), North Sumatra (5,75 percent), Riau (1.84 percent). In each of the remaining provinces, Chinese Indonesians account for 1 percent or less of the provincial population. Most Chinese Indonesians in North Sumatra lived in the provincial capital of Medan, they are one of major ethnics in the city with the Bataks and Javanese people, but in province, they constituted only a small percentage because of the relatively large population of the province, the sizeable chinese population also presence in Binjai, Tanjungbalai and Pematangsiantar city. Bangka–Belitung, West Kalimantan, and Riau are grouped around the hub of ethnic Chinese economic activity in Singapore and, with the exception of Bangka–Belitung, these settlements existed long before Singapore's founding in 1819.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{study by the}} French historian Bernard B. Fall determined that the US Navy transported around 310,000refugees. The French were credited with around 214,000airlifted refugees, 270,000seaborne refugees and 120,000 and 80,000 Vietnamese and French military evacuees respectively. During the US Navy voyages, 54 people died on board, and 111 babies were born. Fall believed that of the 109,000refugees who went south by their own means, a large number hitchhiked on southbound French transport vessels that were {{not related to the}} migration operation. Fall felt that the figures were likely to have been overestimated, due to immigration fraud. Some refugees would travel south and register themselves, before smuggling themselves onto vessels returning north for another shipment of humans. They would then return south and re-register to claim another aid package. Likewise, with instances of entire villages moving south, the authorities frequently did not explicitly <b>count</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of villagers, but simply took the word of the village leaders. The chiefs would often inflate the population figures to claim more aid rations. The mass exodus did not disrupt the north largely because whole villages often emigrated, instead of half a village moving and leaving the remainder of the community in disarray. Fall estimated that around 120,000Viet Minh troops and their dependents went north. Most of these evacuations were attributed to Viet Minh military strategy, with some being ordered to stay behind in readiness for future guerrilla activities. The northward movement was facilitated by vessels leaving from assembly areas at Qui Nhơn and Cà Mau at the southernmost extremity of Vietnam. The voyages to North Vietnam were provided by empty French ships heading back north to fetch more southbound anti-communists, as well vessels from communist nations such as Poland. The Viet Minh also actively cultivated the Montagnard indigenous people of Vietnam, whose land in the Central Highlands was encroached upon by incoming northern settlers. The communists spread propaganda through broadcasts in tribal languages and infiltrated the highland areas. According {{to a study by the}} Michigan State University Group, some 6,000tribespeople went north with the communists, accompanied by some Viet Minh who had adopted the indigenous culture.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe study some {{counting}} and enumeration {{problems for}} chordal graphs, especially concerning independent sets. We first provide the following efficient algorithms for a chordal graph: (1) a linear-time algorithm for <b>counting</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of independent sets; (2) a linear-time algorithm for <b>counting</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of maximum independent sets; (3) a polynomial-time algorithm for <b>counting</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of independent sets of a fixed size.
