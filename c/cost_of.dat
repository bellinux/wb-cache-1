40|$|The {{health care}} <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> {{population}} ageing are for {{an important part}} attributable to higher mortality rates in combination with high <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying. This paper answers three questions that remain unanswered regarding the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying: (1) contributions of different health services to the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying; (2) variation in the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying; and (3) the influence of preceding health care expenses on the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying. We retrieved data on 61, 495 Dutch subjects aged 65 and older from July 2007 through 2010 from a regional health care insurer. We included all deceased subjects of whom health care expenses were known for 26 months prior to death (n ¼ 2833). <b>Costs</b> <b>of</b> dying were defined as health care expenses {{made in the last}} six months before death. Lorenz curves, generalized linear models and a two-part model were used for our analyses. (1) The average <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying are V 25, 919. Medical care contributes to 57 % of this total, and long-term care 43 %. The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying mainly relate to hospital care (40 %). (2) In the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying, 75 % is attributable to the costliest half of the population. For medical care, this distribution figure is 86 %, and for long-term care 92 %. Age and preceding expenses are significant determinants of this variation in the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying. (3) Overall, higher preceding health care expenses are associated with higher <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying, indicating that the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying are higher for those with a longer patient history. To summarize, there is not a large variation in the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying, but there are large differences in the nature <b>of</b> these <b>costs.</b> Before death, the oldest old utilize more long-term care while their younger counterparts visit hospitals more often. To curb the health care <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> population ageing, a further understanding <b>of</b> the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dying is crucial...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Although the {{clinical}} relevance of minor depression {{has been demonstrated}} in many studies, the economic costs are not well explored. In this study, we examine the economic <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> minor depression. Method: In a large-scale, population-based study in the Netherlands (n = 5504) the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> minor depression were compared with the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> major depression and dysthymia. Excess costs, i. e. the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> a disorder {{over and above the}} costs attributable to other illnesses, were estimated with help of regression analysis. The direct medical costs, the direct non-medical costs and the indirect non-medical costs were calculated. The year 2003 was used as the reference year. Results: The annual per capita excess <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> minor depression were US$ 2141 (95 % CI = 753 - 3529) higher than the base rate <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> US$ 1023, while the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> major depression were US$ 3313 (95 % CI = 1234 - 5390) higher than the base rate. The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> minor depression per 1 million inhabitants were 160 million dollars per year, which is somewhat less than the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> major depression (192 million dollars per year).

5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> welding plays {{a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> materials includes the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the base and filler material, and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
