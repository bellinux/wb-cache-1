5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to a blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' {{depending on whether the}} entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E
5|$|Although strenuous and {{requiring}} physical fitness, {{none of the}} conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing. The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, {{even those who are}} acclimatized. In serious cases, it <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to high-altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema, which <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|At high {{pressures}} (more {{than about}} 20atm or twoMPa), {{a mixture of}} helium and oxygen (heliox) <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to high-pressure nervous syndrome, a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding {{a small amount of}} nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.|$|E

5|$|Most beekeepers {{affected}} by CCD {{report that they}} use antibiotics and miticides in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals they use makes it unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, {{it is possible that}} not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon. Beekeepers use miticides to rid colonies of Varroa infestations; however, treatment <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of miticides {{for an extended period of}} time <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to colony collapse. Although miticides are not a direct cause of CCD they do play a role in it.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the inert gas component of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is usually achieved by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas, as substituting a different inert gas may have counter-diffusion complications due to differing rates of diffusion, which <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression.|$|E
