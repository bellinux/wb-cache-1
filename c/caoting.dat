This article proposed a method which used the extreme value of resonant amplitude spectrum {{to extract the}} thickness feature value, it can solve the feature value extraction difficult question which caused by two situations of time domain signals aliasing when the coating layer thickness is quite small and signals weak when signal attenuates seriously. And when the extreme point distributed unevenly in the actual detection, some measurements to improve the feature value extraction precision are proposed, which increased the detection signal-to-noise rated effectively. Take the structure of steel shell bonding rubber coating layer as the detection object, the detection experiment is studied to confirm its validity...|$|E

The 42 university students {{participating in the study}} took part in both the FTFI and the <b>CAOT.</b> After these tests, they completed a questionnaire about their attitudes towards and their perceptions of the tests. Ten of them were interviewed after the questionnaire to understand more deeply their attitudes and performance. Their performance on the two tests was examined using Multi-Faceted Rasch Analysis. The results of this study indicated that Korean university students showed much more favorable attitudes to the <b>CAOT</b> compared with previous studies on direct and semidirect tests, but they still preferred the FTFI to the <b>CAOT</b> in spite of significant negative attitudes to the FTFI with respect to aspects such as nervousness, preparation time, and tiredness. In terms of performance, Korean university students generally had low speaking abilities, but their speaking ability could still be discriminated well by the Rasch model. Their performance was assumed to be affected by many other intervening factors, but the findings suggested that their performance was not influenced by factors such as test order, bias between raters and test formats, computer familiarity, gender or age differences; however, there was an effect for the severity between raters. The students preferred the FTFI overall, but the study also showed that the FTFI was more difficult than the <b>CAOT,</b> indicating a test format effect on performance. Finally, the results of the analyses using the ability estimates and compensating for rater severity indicate that the students' attitudes about the FTFI were associated with their performance on the FTFI, while there was no relationship between their attitudes to the <b>CAOT</b> and performance on the <b>CAOT.</b> The students performed better on the FTFI when they had more positive and less negative attitudes toward the FTFI. That is, this study indicates that Korean university students' attitudes to the FTFI could be important sources of construct irrelevant variance on their speaking test performance on the FTFI. Based on all the findings of this study, I conclude that the use of the <b>CAOT</b> should be considered by teachers and administrators in Korea. The <b>CAOT</b> may be useful for the assessment of achievement during or {{at the end of the}} course, or as an alternative test method, in the situation where it is needed to test students' overall oral ability, but hard to conduct the FTFI, especially due to its impracticality (e. g., the lack of skillful teachers and a large number of students) ...|$|R

40|$|Reverse {{micelles}} are {{studied in}} sodium AOT/water/isooctane mixtures as functions of AOT concentration (<b>CAOT),</b> water to AOT mole ratio (w 0) and temperature (T), from 294 to 333 K, using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (LS). By four-component {{analysis of the}} spectra, {{it is possible to}} extract the LS parameters (intensities, Ii, and lifetimes, τi) of the triplet positronium (o-Ps) present in the aqueous (I 3, τ 3) and organic (I 4, τ 4) phases. The latter lifetime is constant and corresponds with the value measured in pure isooctane, while τ 3 is remarkably lower than the value for pure water. This difference is attributed to the out-diffusion of o-Ps from the water cores to isooctane. The relevant rigorous diffusion equations imply two fitting parameters, the radius of the water aggregates (r 0) and a transmission factor (h). Fixation of r 0 = 3. 6 nm for <b>CAOT</b> = 0. 1 M, w 0 = 20, and T = 294 K, as known from previous work, allows the quantitative derivation of the r 0 values for all other conditions. The water spheres appear to present some permeability to o-Ps, with a transmission factor h = 0. 12 nm- 1. The sphere radius increases smoothly with <b>CAOT</b> and w 0 and, more importantly, with T. The changes with w 0 give r 0 = 0. 181 w 0 and 0. 186 w 0 nm at 294 and 298 K, respectively, and are in excellent agreement with previous proposals. The sum of the intensities, Itot = I 3 + I 4, is much lower than the o-Ps intensity in pure isooctane. In particular, at <b>CAOT</b> > 0. 04 M, Itot appears very close to the value found for pure water. The possibility of a strong inhibition of Ps formation due to the micelles, as proposed in previous work, is ruled out because of the negligible electron or positron scavenging ability of alkyl sulfonates. It is thus concluded that Ps formation occurs primarily in the aqueous part of the micelles, the water aggregates representing efficient traps for the positrons while they are slowing down in the solutions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Corticotomy in {{accelerating}} orthodontic tooth movement, also {{defined as}} corticotomy-assisted orthodontic treatment (<b>CAOT),</b> is a promising technique that recently had many applications in orthodontics. AIM: The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare the use of piezoelectric surgery and conventional rotatory osteotomy technique for <b>CAOT,</b> determining the duration of surgery and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: <b>CAOT</b> was performed in a sample of subjects, randomly choosing piezoelectric: surgery (PS Group) or conventional rotary osteotomy technique (RT Group). The duration of surgery was recorded and the oral health-related quality of life evaluated using the short form Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP- 14) preoperatively, 3 and 7 days after surgery. t-test and Cronbach's alpha were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 12 patients (mean age 14; range: 13 - 17) were enrolled. The time needed to complete the osteotomy cuts was greater (p = 0. 1) for the piezoelectric surgery group (mean 34. 3 minutes; range 35. 3 - 32. 6) than for the rotator group(mean 28. 2 minutes; range 27. 1 - 29. 2). Oral health-related quality of life deteriorated from baseline (OHIP- 14 mean: 6. 33) to first follow-up, 3 day after surgery, in both groups (PS Group: 22. 67 OHIP- 14; RT Group: 21. 33 OHIP- 14). At 7 days follow-up there was a nearly complete recovery of the original OHIP- 14 values, even faster with the conventional rotary osteotomy technique; however, no statistically significant differences were recorded between the two methods (p = 0. 35). Cronbach's alpha values indicated an excellent internal consistency reliability. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical decision-making regarding the use of corticotomy-assisted orthodontic treatment, it should be aware of the expected decrease in oral health-related quality of life both using piezoelectric surgery or rotary osteotomy technique. In addition, the piezoelectric osteotomy requires a longer surgical time...|$|R

40|$|O uso de linhagens celulares e bastante promissor como modelo biologico in vitro, tanto para a melhoria do rendimento dos testes de toxicidade quanto para reducao dos seus custos. Destaca-se no presente trabalho a utilizacao da linhagem celular permanente de hepatocitos de Danio rerio, denominada ZF-L. Diversos trabalhos comprovam a sensibilidade de ZF-L quando expostas a diversos contaminantes, com a utilizacao satisfatoria de diferentes biomarcadores. Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a toxicidade da fracao soluvel em agua da gasolina (FSG) e de um efluente de posto de combustivel (EF) para ZF-L. Para isso, foi feita a exposicao das celulas por 1, 3 e 6 h a diferentes diluicoes de FSG e EF. A FSG foi obtida simulando derrame de gasolina em ambiente {{tropical}} e o EF foi coletado do ultimo tanque de decantacao de um posto de combustivel. Antes da exposicao foram feitas diferentes diluicoes das solucoes teste em agua destilada, com adicao dos sais da salina tamponada com fosfato (PBS). Para verificacao da citotoxicidade, foram aplicados os testes de viabilidade celular por exclusao do azul de tripan (AT) e o de reducao do brometo de dimetiltiazol difeniltetrazolio (MTT), testando as diluicoes de 5, 10, 25 e 50 % dos contaminantes. O controle foi feito expondo as celulas apenas ao PBS. A partir dos resultados obtidos pelo AT, foram selecionadas as diluicoes com viabilidade celular maior que 80 % para aplicacao do ensaio do cometa, quantificacao de especies reativas de oxigenio (ERO) e capacidade antioxidante total (<b>CAOT).</b> Os resultados da viabilidade celular para ambos os poluentes, tanto para AT quanto para o MTT obedeceram a um padrao de resposta concentracaodependente. Demonstram tambem a maior citotoxicidade do EF em relacao a FSG, provavelmente devido a visivel presenca de detergentes em sua composicao. Para o ensaio do cometa, ERO e <b>CAOT</b> foram selecionadas as diluicoes de 5, 10 e 25 % de FSG e 5 e 10 % de EF. Com relacao a quantificacao de ERO e <b>CAOT,</b> foi verificada menor producao de ERO nas amostras expostas aos poluentes e <b>CAOT</b> aumentada em relacao ao controle, demonstrando que nas concentracoes e periodos de exposicao avaliados as ZF-L aumentaram suas defesas antioxidantes, evitando o estresse oxidativo. O ensaio do cometa indicou a alta genotoxicidade de FSG, com escores de dano proximos ao valor maximo (300), que seguiram um padrao concentracao-dependente. No caso das ZF-L expostas ao EF nao houve uma relacao concentracao-dependente na ocorrencia de danos no DNA e os escores apos 1 h foram maiores que o controle, mas apos 6 h foram significativamente menores nas amostras tratadas com EF que no controle, indicando uma possivel atuacao do sistema de reparo de DNA. Assim, e possivel afirmar que o EF apresentou alto potencial citotoxico enquanto a FSG apresentou alto potencial genotoxico para as ZF-L, nas concentracoes e nos tempos estudados, e que ZF-L apresenta-se como modelo biologico adequado para verificacao da qualidade ambiental. The {{development of}} in vitro biological models using cell lines is promising, both {{for improving the}} performance of the toxicity test as to reduce its costs. Several studies have confirmed the sensitivity of ZF-L, a permanent hepatocyte cell line of Danio rerio, when exposed to various contaminants, with the satisfactory use of different biomarkers. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the toxicity of the gasoline water soluble fraction (GSF) and an effluent from a gas station (EF) for ZF-L. For this, ZF-L was exposed for 1, 3 and 6 h to different dilutions of GSF and EF. In order to obtain GSF, a simulation of gasoline spill in a tropical environment was made, and the EF was collected from the last settling tank of a fuel station. These solutions were both diluted in distilled water previously to the exposure of the cells. To check the cytotoxicity, two methods were applied: cell viability (CV) by Trypan Blue exclusion (TA) and dimethylthiazol diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction (MTT) testing the dilutions of 5, 10, 25 and 50 % of contaminants. The control cells were exposed only to phosphate buffered saline (PBS). With the results from TA, the dilutions with more than 80 % CV were selected to proceed with comet assay, quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The CV results for both pollutants evaluated with AT and MTT methods showed a concentration-dependent response. They also demonstrated greater cytotoxicity of EF compared to GSF, probably due to the visible presence of detergent in its composition. In order to run the comet assay, ROS and TAC the following dilutions were selected: 5, 10 and 25 % of GSF and 5 and 10 % EF. Regarding the quantification of ROS and TAC, the results showed lower production of ROS in samples exposed to pollutants together with an increase in TAC in comparison to control, suggesting that at the concentrations and exposure periods evaluated in this work, the ZF-L increased their antioxidant defenses, preventing oxidative stress. The comet assay results indicated the genotoxic potential of GSF, since the scores of DNA damage were close to the maximum value (300), and also followed a concentration-dependent standard. As for the ZF-L cells exposed to EF the results showed that after 1 h the scores were higher than in control cells, but after 6 h they were significantly lower in samples exposed to EF in comparison to respective control, indicating a possible role of DNA repair system. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that EF has a cytotoxic potential while FSG showed high genotoxic potential for ZF-L, at the concentrations and exposure times evaluated in this study, and ZF-L appears as a biological model suitable for the assessment of environmental quality...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY To {{study the}} {{relative}} roles of sodium (Na+) and calcium ions (<b>Ca't)</b> in {{the response of}} adrenal glomerulosa cells, we investigated the effects of different Na+ concentrations in the incubation media and the actions of substances that interfere with Cal+ fluxes. Basal aldosterone secretion and response to angiotensln II (AH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or potassium (K+) were dependent on extracellular Na+ con-centration. Veratridine, a Na+ channel opener that dissipates Na+ gradients, blocked the stimulated steroid-ogenic response. Mersalyl acid and tetracaine, which are potent Cat+ antagonists, blocked the effects of aldo-sterone secretagogues. Divalent cations with CaI+ antagonistic action such as manganese (Mn>+), nickel (Ni'+), and cobalt (Co 1 +) blocked the aldosterone secretory response to AH, ACTH, and K+. Barium (Ba 1 +) and strontium (SH+), known to mimick Ca*+ effects, increased or did not affect responses of the glomerulos* cells. Sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of ATP-dependent Ca>+ translocatkm, did not alter the stimulated aldo-sterone responses. Trifluoperazine (10 ~ * M), an inhibitor of calmodulin, blocked AH and K+-induced aldo-sterone secretion, but was partially effective on ACTH-stimulated aldosterone output only at a concentration of 10 * M. The actions of ouabain on aldosterone biosynthesis were similarly affected by all these drugs. Thus, both extracellular Na+ and Ca>+ appear {{to play a role}} in the steroidogenic response of isolated glomerulosa cells. The intracellular action of Cal+ may involve a calmodulin-like protein. The effects of ACTH are onl...|$|R

40|$|Occupational {{therapy is}} an {{essential}} health service that enables Canadians to maximize their productivity, reduce lifestyle restrictions and avoid unnecessary dependency. A sense of wellbeing and meaning in one’s daily occupations is an important determinant of health and an effective means to reduce health care costs for the public purse. Occupational therapists, as the primary service providers for occupational therapy, are faced with similar human resource challenges as are other health professionals such as nurses and doctors. Initiatives are needed to improve their workforce shortages and to optimize utilization. Labour market information and workforce studies indicate {{that there is a}} strong and persistent demand for occupational therapy services across Canada to address the challenges of ageing, mental health issues such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and chronic disease management. Accessing vital occupational therapist services is limited due to therapist shortages, {{despite the fact that the}} use of occupational therapy is underutilized when compared with countries with similar health systems. This underutilization is primarily due to both a shortage of therapists, and limited use or exclusion of occupational therapy from appropriate health care settings. The Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (<b>CAOT)</b> believes that the answer to human resource concerns for their profession lies in effective health human resource planning and greater utilization of occupational therapists in many areas of health care under federal jurisdiction, including: services provided to military personnel and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; veterans; public service employees; and, aboriginal populations. In an effort to improve the health human resource planning for occupational therapy in Canada...|$|R
