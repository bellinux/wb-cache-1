40|$|ABSTRACT: Diblock {{copolymer}} vesicles are tagged with pH-responsive Nile Blue-based {{labels and}} used as {{a new type of}} pH-responsive colorimetric/fluorescent biosensor for far-red and near-infrared imaging of live cells. The diblock copolymer vesic les descr ibed herein are based on poly(2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl phosphorylcholine-block- 2 -(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate) [PMPC-PDPA]: the biomimetic PMPC block is known to facilitate rapid cell uptake {{for a wide range of}} cell lines, while the PDPA block constitutes the pH-responsive component that enables facile vesicle self-assembly in aqueous solution. These biocompatible vesicles can be utilized to detect interstitial hypoxic/acidic regions in a tumor model via a pH-dependent <b>colorimetric</b> <b>shift.</b> In addition, they are also useful for selective intracellular staining of lysosomes and early endosomes via subtle changes in fluorescence emission. Such nanoparticles combine efficient cellular uptake with a pH-responsive Nile Blue dye label to produce a highly versatile dual capability probe. This is in marked contrast to small molecule dyes, which are usually poorly uptaken by cells, frequently exhibit cytotoxicity, and are characterized by intracellular distributions invariably dictated by their hydrophilic...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the investigation of colour memory of users (designers, printers, students, etc.) in cross-media situations, particularly, between physical (printed) and digital (on-screen) colours. The preliminary experiment reported here supports findings by other researchers that there are systematic shifts between the memory colours of observers and the target colours that are being memorized. The results also confirm our hypothesis that when users are asked to select a colour on screen to represent a memorized target (or, we argue, to represent a colour that they have imagined) there are additional systematic <b>colorimetric</b> <b>shifts.</b> Users tend to select colours that are much more saturated then the target. There are implications of this work for soft-proofing and the use of imaging software by designers...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The need {{to detect}} trace amounts of target {{molecules}} is great, {{particularly when it}} comes to biosensing. With the early detection of a disease, the odds of the successful treatment of an individual increases significantly. To enhance the capability of biomolecular detection, we have created an optical biosensor capable of the enhancement of multi-modal optical signals. Our substrate employs diatoms, a type of algae, with unique optical properties to achieve multi-modal enhancement. Diatom shells, called frustules, are made of biosilica with quasi-periodic pores. These frustules exhibit a very large surface area which allows for a large area of interaction for analytes. Additionally, the porous structure of the frustule acts as a photonic crystal capable of enhancing optical signals. Here we demonstrate the multi-modal enhancement capabilities of our biosensor through the detection of biological analytes using <b>colorimetric</b> <b>shifts,</b> surface enhanced Raman scattering and fluorescence biosensing...|$|R
30|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{is a major}} {{life-threatening}} {{disease for}} human, and the identification of TB at an earlier stage is shown to prevent spreading and to treat the disease. In this study, we choose an early secretory antigenic target (ESAT- 6), {{one of the major}} proteins in TB. We introduced a single-step antibody-based <b>colorimetric</b> red spectral <b>shift</b> assay using gold nanoparticle, and the detection limit was found to be 1.25  pM. The specificity of this assay was elucidated by using the control protein (CFP- 10), and it does not show the color change upon adding GNP. On the other hand, ESAT- 6 alone is not bound to GNP. With this evidence, the presence of pre-complexed ESAT- 6 and anti-ESAT- 6 antibody was demonstrated with the reliability of the <b>colorimetric</b> red spectral <b>shift</b> assay. This strategy is simple and quick to detect similar kinds of analyte as a single step. Further, this assay can be expanded with a small molecule complexed with an appropriate antibody to be suitable for point-of-care detection. This methodology will definitely work with smaller-size proteins and peptides. With larger-size proteins, depending on the amino acid charges, there might be a variation.|$|R
30|$|To {{develop the}} {{colorimetric}} detection of ESAT- 6 by antibody-based <b>colorimetric</b> red <b>shift</b> spectral changes, 1  μl of 1  μM ESAT- 6 (final volume will be 500  nM) was initially mixed with 1  μl of optimal anti-ESAT- 6 antibody concentration. After 30  min of incubation, 20  μl of GNP {{was added to}} each tube and then waited for 30  min. Then, the optimal NaCl concentration was added, and the spectral changes were measured under the wavelength from 400 to 800  nm. Similarly, the other concentrations of ESAT- 6 (0 to 500  nM) were titrated with the same optimized anti-ESAT- 6 antibody concentration. To check the limit of detection, ESAT- 6 was tested from the lowest picomolar (from 1.25  pM) until the nanomolar (500  nM) order. The concentrations of other molecules (anti-ESAT- 6 antibody, GNP and NaCl) were kept constant.|$|R
40|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} {{refers to}} the ability of the human visual system to (partially) adapt to the intensity and colour of the illumination, producing an approximately colour constant appearance of objects across changes in illumination. It has been studied intensively during the past decades for its scientific potential to improve our understanding of human colour vision and for its practical implications in lighting design, printing and display technology. Models that predict the adaptive shift due to changes in lighting/viewing conditions are referred to as Chromatic Adaptation Transforms (CATs). They are typically based on one or more sets of corresponding colours (CC), which are colours that appear similar under different lighting conditions. However, most previous CC experiments were limited to near neutral illuminants, while new solid-state lighting technologies open up a range of potentially chromatic illuminants for which no systematic CCs or CAT is available. Therefore, new CC data will be collected to 1) increase our understanding of CA and 2) to derive a new CAT applicable to a wider range of illuminants. CC data will be collected using a novel viewing booth in which a data projector will be used to independently adjust the chromaticity and luminance of a real 3 D stimulus and of the background adaptation field. The projector based setup allows a strict focus on the adaptive shift by seperating it from the <b>colorimetric</b> illuminant <b>shift,</b> while the enhanced realism of physical 3 D scenes, compared to 2 D stimuli presented on a display, should result in a chromatic adaptation process more representative of real-life viewing conditions (e. g. {{it has been reported that}} the degree of adaptation is lower for softcopy stimuli). status: publishe...|$|R
