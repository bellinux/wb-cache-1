Noting that obstetric care in Chicago was often inadequate, he opened a clinic on Chicago's Maxwell Street after consulting with the noted social worker Jane Addams. Early on, DeLee provided prenatal <b>care</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood's women, but the babies were delivered by midwives in the area. Over time, hundreds of women began having their babies delivered by DeLee.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is <b>to</b> {{describe}} <b>the</b> provision of a human value system in nursing management that would lead to an environment conducive <b>to</b> quality of <b>care</b> <b>to</b> nurses. Caring is a complex phenomenon with caring concepts which emphasized the human element in human resource management in the health services. Watson (1985) focused on the philosophical and spiritual basis of caring. The ten carative factors as described by Watson (1985) were used as a framework for <b>the</b> application of <b>caring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> human resource management process in nursing. This framework enables a basis {{for the development of a}} caring environment for the nurse manager, in which the nurse could experience caring. It served as a point of departure for a research study undertaken during 2000 on <b>caring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> caregivers in health services...|$|R

5|$|Should {{a patient}} be {{transferred}} to an assisted living facility, nursing home, or hospital, the hospice would continue to provide <b>care</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patient which is on par with the services provided under the routine home care benefit. In this way, {{the only difference between}} respite and routine care is that the hospice pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a patient receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to what other patients of the hospice unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} two days, the Australians {{continued}} to provide protection to the US engineers before being replaced by an American infantry battalion. 1 RAR subsequently flew out on 26 February, returning to Bien Hoa airbase. Meanwhile, following the attack at Tan Binh the Viet Cong attempted to avoid further contact, choosing instead to harass the American work parties with occasional mortar and sniper fire. These tactics proved ineffective, and although the Americans lost a further three killed and 29 wounded, the road was completed by 2 March. The Americans then launched an extensive civic action program {{in an attempt to}} consolidate their gains, repairing damaged houses, distributing food and providing basic health <b>care</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local population. Despite such efforts though, American commanders were pessimistic about the possibility of achieving any long term gains in Binh Duong Province unless the South Vietnamese Army was able to provide lasting protection for the local population. On 7 March, just five days after the completion of Operation Rolling Stone, the US 1st Brigade was redeployed with US 173rd Airborne Brigade and 1 RAR on Operation Silver City, sweeping the south-west sector of War Zone D.|$|E

Government aid in providing <b>care</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> elderly and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia {{to be a part of}} the working population in nearly a high rate as men. Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re-entry programs. Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce, as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{ascension}} of Emperor Basil I (867–886) heralded this revival, as he {{embarked on}} an aggressive foreign policy. Continuing the policies of his predecessor, Michael III (842–867), he showed great <b>care</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fleet, and as a result, successive victories followed. In 868, a fleet under the droungarios tou plōïmou Niketas Ooryphas relieved Ragusa from an Arab siege and re-established Byzantine presence in the area. A few years later, he twice heavily defeated the Cretan pirates at Kardia and in the Corinthian Gulf, temporarily securing the Aegean. Cyprus also was temporarily recovered and Bari occupied. At the same time, however, the Muslim presence in Cilicia was strengthened, and Tarsos became a major base for land and seaborne attacks against Byzantine territory, especially under the famed emir Yazaman al-Khadim (882–891), despite the heavy defeat {{of one of his}} raids before Euripos.|$|E
