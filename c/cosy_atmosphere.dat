50|$|Værsgo is {{the debut}} album of Kim Larsen who formed Gasolin' in 1969 with Wili Jønsson and Franz Beckerlee. It was {{released}} in 1973 {{while he was still}} a member of Gasolin', and the album contains songs which were not found suitable for Gasolin'. With 17 songs, it was apparent that Kim Larsen had a lot of songs to offer. It is also apparent why these songs did not fit into the Gasolin' frame. Unlike the hard and disciplined rock of Gasolin' the songs on Værsgo have a loose and <b>cosy</b> <b>atmosphere</b> with a lot of romance and sentimentality and childlike innocence.

Breaching confidentiality causes harms {{that are not}} commensurable with the possible benefits gained. Limitations or exceptions put on confidentiality would destroy it, for the confider would become suspicious and un-co-operative, the confidant would become untrustworthy and the whole climate of the clinical encounter would suffer irreversible erosion.

An electronic textbook means the programme which is able to gather together students into virtual reality, where they are given equal possibility {{to use the same}} teaching programme, to communicate directly with the teacher and other students in the group while sitting at the computer. E-textbook is a perfect means for developing students’ independence and for encouraging them to care for newest technologies. E-textbooks are proper for students of various ages as well as for adult people, but especially for those who are eager to acquire not only compulsory, but also some additional material in order to take part in Olympiads, contests, use it in real life or at work. The main aim of the work is to create the course of programme models, introduce it to students and teachers, afterwards let them learn the particular methods and ways how the electronic material was prepared. Finally, to find out the feedback and, what is the most important thing, to set the efficiency of the programme. The e-textbook assures: •	a possibility of presentation of great variety of information; •	much more freedom for creative activity, <b>cosy</b> and lovely <b>atmosphere</b> while studying; •	individualization and intensification of teaching process; •	interest in the newest information technologies and their usage in daily life; •	learning in a convenient place, time, tempo; •	saving lesson’s time, quick filling the gaps in one’s education; •	possibility to learn without stopping lessons, interrupting professional career or daily chores; •	enables to acquire the teaching material, consultations and self-evaluation in an easy way; •	possibility to access a self-learning result, not paying attention to ways and forms of gaining knowledge; •	to become eager to study independently...|$|R
5000|$|When today's Marienplatz (the former Schrannenplatz) as a {{store for}} cereals and other {{agricultural}} products {{had become too}} small, Viktualienmarkt as its official successor evolved where it is still situated today due to a decree issued by King Maximilian I on 2. May, 1807. The King ordered that {{those parts of the}} market between Heiliggeist Church and Frauenstraße should be relocated and told the municipal authorities to demolish the buildings of the charitable Heiliggeist hospice which had been acquired by the city. Thus the [...] "green market" [...] had its own place, which was also named [...] "market place" [...] for some time. It was only later that the word [...] "Viktualien" [...] (victuals), which is a Latin word for food, was used. From 1823 to 1829 the central market already had to be enlarged significantly. In 1885 the ancient Heiliggeist infirmary was demolished and the Heiliggeist Church was extended to the west. Thus a new image was created for both the market and the city. In 1852 the precursor of today's Großmarkthalle, the Schrannenhalle, was built close to the ancient city wall at the end of Blumenstraße. It burned down in 1932 and was reopened in 2005. In 1855 the fish market was moved to Westenriederstraße. In the course of time many additions were made to the market, as for example a butchers' hall, a tripe hall, pavilions for bakeries, fruit vendors and a fish hall. The butchers' shops at the foot of Petersbergl (Peter's hill, site of Peter's Church), the stalls for poultry and venison and the stands of the flower vendors expanded even further. During World War II this square with its <b>cosy</b> <b>atmosphere</b> was severely damaged. There was even talk of closing down the market in order to erect multi-story buildings on this important site. Instead, the municipal authorities revitalised Viktualienmarkt with considerable financial support, and the citizens of Munich enriched it with memorial fountains for the folk singers and comedians Karl Valentin, Weiß Ferdl and Liesl Karlstadt. Later, memorial fountains for the folk singers and comedians Ida Schumacher, Elise Aulinger and Roider Jackl were added.|$|E

She was determined to make the experience of her own illness the manifesto of a revolutionary cultural change.

In her view, the patient needs psychological support and therapies that can reduce and mitigate stress, in addition to seeking a <b>cosy</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> spaces full of light and contact with nature. The aesthetic quality of the hospital can therefore help patients to better endure their disease. Many archistars have designed Maggie’s Centers pro bono: Frank Gehry has designed the center in Dundee, Scotland, Zaha Hadid the Kirkcaldy Fife near Edinburgh, Roger Stirk Harbour and landscape designer Dan Pearson have conceived London’s Maggie’s Center and many more have been created in recent years.|$|E

This merger is a pilot project to improve service for {{students}} and faculty. Ångström Laboratory has around 900 staff and almost 10, 000 students, of whom most also spend time at other campuses. In this paper we describe the background and the implementation of the pilot project. One of the main reasons for moving together was the wish to gather together all kinds of student services, including the distribution of written examinations in one place. The central location and open environment of the Library made it a good choice. The heart of the Library and Student Services is an open office consisting of two service desks located in the library area. There are silent study areas; computers for searching and printing, an area for relaxing with newspapers and journals, meeting rooms and offices for the staff. The result is a lively place with a <b>cosy</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> As the Library and the Student Services still belong to different parts of the University we are now starting to find out how best to collaborate.

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of LED lighting, nowadays designers and architects have more flexibility to evoke emotions and create certain atmospheres in a space by means of artificial lighting. The perceived atmosphere in a space is an experience of the surroundings in relation to ourselves; it is an affective evaluation of the environment (Scholten et al., 2003; Vogels, 2008). Previous studies related to atmosphere perception have given valuable insight into the relation between white light and the perceived atmosphere (Vogels et al., 2008). Moreover, in (Seuntiens and Vogels, 2008) four <b>atmospheres</b> (<b>cosy,</b> relaxing, activating and exciting) were designed by professional lighting designer for a standard living room and verified by end users. This study found clear commonalities between the professional lighting designers {{with respect to the}} chosen light characteristics to evoke a certain atmosphere in the room. However, it was not clear how much variation in light characteristics was allowed before an initially perceived atmosphere disappears. In the present research three experiments were conducted to investigate the allowed variation in light characteristics (luminance, color temperature, hue and saturation) on two <b>atmospheres,</b> namely <b>cosy</b> and activating. In the first study, a tuning experiment was conducted in order to investigate the allowed variation in light characteristics on the initially perceived “cosy” and “activating” atmosphere. In general, the results of the first experiment showed that participants allowed quite some variation in light characteristics in both atmospheres. On average participants allowed an increase in luminance of the white light sources of a factor two to four compared to the initial luminance level, and a decrease in luminance of at least a factor of two. Furthermore, a consistent change of about 800 K was allowed for the increase in color temperature in the “cosy” atmosphere and the decrease in color temperature in the “activating” atmosphere. Due to technical limitations, the decrease in color temperature in the “cosy” atmosphere and the increase in color temperature in the “activating” atmosphere were not investigated in this study. Finally, the allowed change in hue and chroma of the colored luminaires was found to be larger in the “activating” atmosphere than in the “cosy” atmosphere. In order to investigate the effect of a change in light characteristics on the perceived atmosphere, a difference scaling experiment was conducted. In this experiment, participants compared the average allowed change in light settings as obtained from the first study to the light settings corresponding to a “cosy” or “activating” atmosphere as reference. A short version of the original atmosphere questionnaire of Vogels (2008) was used to assess the perceived atmosphere in the room. The results showed that an increase in luminance of the white light sources reduced the cosiness and tenseness of the atmosphere, and enlarged its liveliness and detachment (with a reverse effect for a decrease in luminance). A decrease in color temperature was found to increase the cosiness, and to reduce the liveliness and detachment of the atmosphere. With regard to the colored luminaires, a change in hue was found to mainly affect the cosiness and detachment, whereas a decrease in chroma mainly affected the liveliness and detachment. In a follow-up experiment participants assessed the perceived atmosphere for the allowed change in light settings without the initial “cosy” and “activating” atmosphere as a reference to compare with. In general, similar trends with respect to the changes in the atmosphere were found, however, the effects were considerably smaller. This indicates that participants found it more difficult to distinguish the atmosphere related to the different light settings when they could not directly compare them. In this study, boundaries for the allowed variation in luminance, color temperature, hue and chroma were obtained for the “cosy” and “activating” atmosphere. In addition, the results gave further insight into the relation between light and perceived atmosphere. However, this research also has its limitations in the sense that some light characteristics, such as the spatial distribution of the light, and its dynamics, as well as the spatial configuration of the light sources, were not included. More research is needed to investigate the effect of these aspects on perceived atmosphere further. Man-Machine Interaction GroupElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
40|$|BesenはBesenwirtschaftenの略語で、日本語では「ベーセン」と表記する。Besenは日本語に訳せば箒(ほうき) の意味で、ワイン農家が玄関前や看板の飾りに使われている。ワインのほかにシンプルな伝統食の提供も許されていることから、ワイン農家レストランともいえよう。これはドイツに存在するワイン直売の特別な形態であり、地域によって呼び名が異なるがBaden-Wurttemberg州のWurttemberg地方では一般的に使用されている。この伝統は紀元 800 年頃にカール大帝によって初めてワイン農家に自家の居間でワインを販売する権利が与えられた時期からとされ、現在に至っている。本稿ではドイツ全体のワイン生産と消費の状況を概観した上で、特にBesenの歴史的発展と役割変化について文献資料を用いて整理する。また、 2005 年から 2008 年の夏の間に行われた聞き取り調査から得たデータを中心にBaden-Wurttemberg州Wurttemberg地方におけるワイン農家がかかわっているいくつかの協同組織の形成と役割について概説し、さらに 3 つのBesen農家の事例を紹介し、その成功の鍵と地域の文化的特徴によって支えられてきた要因を分析する。何世紀にもわたって貧困のシンボルであったBesenの役割は大きく変化してきている。その歴史的発展過程において、ワイン農家の協同組合の役割が非常に大きい。貧困の脱出においてだけではなく、レストラン、バー、パブなどワインを取り扱う業者との間の合意の成功を導いた。そのことによって、結果的にBesen農家、ワイン協同組合、飲食業界が暗黙の了解のように地方ワインの販売に協力することになっている。今日において、経済のグローバル化の影響を受けつつも、なお 8 割近いワインの地域内消費が実現されている。現在もBesenは依然としてワイン農家の販売戦略の一つである。しかし、その地域におけるコミュニケーションの社会的な場として、またくつろいだ雰囲気が醸し出されている場としての役割が見直され、それによって、観光の場として生かされているように見受けられる。したがって、Besenは伝統文化の象徴とワインの直売としての販売形態といった新しい意味合いを有するようになり、グローバルゼーションに対応するローカルゼーションとしての存在意義も注目されるべきではないかと考えられる。農家レストランが増えつつある日本にとっても、地域に根付き、伝統文化を生かした、地域活性化および地域間交流を志向する本事例のあり方から多くの示唆を得ることができるのではなかろうか。The term "Besen" is a colloquial {{short form}} of "Besenwirtschaft", {{which is a}} special form of {{distribution}} of wine in Germany, especially in Baden-Wurttemberg. The wine-growers place a broom ("Besen" in German) {{in front of their}} doors. This tradition started around 800 with a decree from Karl the Great which permitted wine-growers to serve their wine in their own private homes. In this paper the focus is laid {{on the basis of the}} production and consumption of wine in Wurttemberg, especially on the historical development and the change of the function of the "Besenwirtschaften" till today, and after having carried out some "Besen" - case studies, on the attempt to find the keys to the success of the "Besen" and the characteristics of the traditional culture as a social location in Wurttemberg. The historical development of the "Besen" has changed in the last centuries. In the beginning the "Besen" symbolized poverty and poor quality of the wine. Now we are confronted with the new meaning of the "Besen" and its dealing with globalization. Nowadays the "Besen" has more or less the function of a social location of communication and is still a strategy of direct marketing and an important method of selling one 2 ̆ 7 s own wine directly at the farm, managed by the whole family in a special, <b>cosy</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> In this paper, from the historical development and the changing of the function of "Besen", we can point out the factors of the continuance of "Besen" up to today. The "Besen" have changed in from and function, having passed through different periods and conditions after some schemes of compromises that have taken place. "Besen" today has the new meaning as a traditional culture and the method of direct selling marketing. Moreover, the modern "Besen" version is in the opposite standpoint to globalization. That means that "Besen" is not only the compromise between tradition and modern, local and global. Finally you can say that nowadays the situation of the "Besen" culminates in the tradition as a new style. It inspires some ideas with the time of globalization of agriculture for all farmers, even those in Japan. The knowledge about the traditional, folkloristic and local background of the "Besen" could help to establish successful and sustainable farmer 2 ̆ 7 s restaurants in Japan in their local areas...|$|E
