Based on analytical calculations, pipe wall thickness of a swing check valve housing was selected for the nominal pipe diameter DN 300 and water test pressure p = 2. 4 MPa. All 3 D models of components, {{as well as the}} assembly, were made in the program tool SolidWorks. The 3 D model of the swing check valve with flanges was subjected to stress analysis (Finite Element Analysis) for the purpose of checking the accuracy of the analytical calculations. Fluid flow analysis (Flow Simulation) was used for presenting fluid flow process and rate through the swing <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> <b>assembly.</b> A low-budget 3 D MakerBot Replicator 2 X printer was used for constructing a reduced-scale 3 D assembly model of the swing check valve with lever and weight, by implementing the FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology.

40|$|Savannah River Site {{personnel}} {{are planning a}} two phase program in order to significantly {{reduce the amount of}} dissolved chlorinated solvents that are being transported to the McQueen branch Aquifer via the wellbore and gravel pack zones of the A/M Area production well system. In Phase I of the program a commercially available inflatable packer and <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> will be installed inside the casing at the altitude of the McQueen Branch Confining Unit. This immediate, short term solution will eliminate the majority of the contaminant mass that is moving downward through the wellbore of the A/M Area production wells. During the packer installation process several pre- and post- testing activities are planned to aid SRS investigators in understanding the dynamics of the flow conditions and effectiveness of the installed assembly. The second phase of the program will address the small amount of contaminant mass that is moving downward through the continuous gravel pack of the production wells. The investigative data obtained during Phase I of this program will be beneficial for developing plans and appropriate actions for the Phase II activities. Site {{personnel are}} currently evaluating various options, i. e. casing perforation with grout injection or partial well abandonment, to eliminate the downward flow in the gravel pack at the altitude of the McQueen Branch Confining Zone. In addressing potential remediation actions for the dissolved solvents in the Cretaceous sediments, due to the limited vertical extent of the plume and the size, any remediation program should incorporate carefully located wells screened vertically within the plume trajectory. This optimizing approach will minimize water treatment and pumping costs and maximize the amount of contaminant removal. Flow and contaminant transport modeling scenarios are currently being developed to address the Cretaceous sediments. These efforts involve incorporating the available characterization data and the results of previous modeling work to more precisely define the extent and magnitude of this plume. SRS proposes incorporating depth discrete sampling during any future characterization effort to optimize any proposed remediation system. Finally, by using a full three-dimensional model rather than the traditional quasi-three dimensional methods an efficient remediation system can be developed...|$|E

All three fires started in the aluminum manifold and <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> (MCV) <b>assembly</b> and produced similar damages to the aircraft in which they occurred. This paper discusses a failure analysis conducted by the NASA Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) Oxygen Hazards and Testing Team on the 2003 U. S. Navy VP 62 fire. It was surmised that the fire started due to heat generated by an oxygen leak past a silicone <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> seal or possibly because of particle impact near the seat {{of one of the}} MCV <b>assembly</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> An additional analysis of fires in several <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> poppet seals from other aircraft is discussed. These burned poppet seals came from P 3 oxygen systems that had been serviced at the Naval Air Station (NAS) in Jacksonville following standard fill procedures. It was concluded that these seal fires occurred due to the heat from compression heating, particle impact, or the heat generated by an oxygen leak past the silicone <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> seal. The fact that catastrophic fires did not occur in the case of each <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> seal fire was attributed to the protective nature of the aluminum oxide layer on the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> poppets. To prevent future fires of this nature, the U. S. and Canadian fleets of P 3 aircraft have been retrofitted with MCV assemblies with an upgraded design and more burn-resistant materials...|$|R

One failure mode occurs when the GLV <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> fails and product passes into the well annulus, potentially reaching the wellhead.

The crawler also had to pause occasionally so mud could be removed from its treads and bearings. Technicians then quickly prepared the shuttle to host the crew’s countdown dress rehearsal known as the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT). Discovery’s seven astronauts flew to Kennedy on 5 August 2009 for the training activity which concludes later in the week with a complete practice countdown, minus liftoff, involving the crew and the launch team. Meanwhile, in an unprecedented operation, modifications were made to the left Solid rocket booster on the pad. The modifications involved replacement of a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> filter <b>assembly</b> in the booster which was found to have broken. In a potentially delaying factor, in depth testing of the external tank with X-ray revealed voids in the foam which might have formed during the injection molding of the foam. This has also been decided as a suspect factor in the foam shedding during STS-127. The air in the voids could have expanded due to the high temperatures generated during ascent thus breaking the foam. The reviews considered a rollback as an option since the defect could not be set right in the pad. Later, the tank was cleared for launch as is without any additional inspections.|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in {{the nuclear}} {{industry}} is of great importance from a safety precaution point ofview (McElhaney, 1995). Choosing <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> for these high-pressurized systems comes with agreat challenge. The valves causes what is called <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slams when closing, leading to a hugepressure wave traveling through the system. To prevent this from happening calculations have to bedone {{to see what kind}} of forces are generated during a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam.

40|$|A semi-empirical {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to describe the}} dynamic behaviour of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in pipeline systems. The method is based on parameterized valve models and dimensionless valve characteristics, which may be obtained from experiments. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is considered as a black box with certain input and output characteristics. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closure and associated pressure surges are the dominant phenomena. Undamped <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> may {{be considered as a}} special case of damped <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> Much attention is paid to the description of the hydrodynamic (fluid) forces on the internal, moving valve elements. These elements may be considered as translating or rotating bodies with (at least) one plane of symmetry. The equations of motion for the constrained, unsteady motion of such a body in an unconfined, unsteady fluid flow are based on the dynamical theory of Kirchhoff, extended to an unsteady fluid flow. The equivalent equations for a body in a confined fluid are based on Lagrange's method of generalized coordinates. A general (dimensionless) valve equation of motion is developed, which is valid for most of the existing <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> types. Basic differential equations are derived for the transient flow in a pipe with constant initial flow deceleration. The equations are applied to describe the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closure under reflection free and reflecting boundary conditions in the form of dimensionless, analytical equations. The theory is based on conventional waterhammer theory. The pipe and valve equations are coupled via the integral form of the momentum equation. The uncoupled and coupled, (dimensionless) pipe and valve equations show formally which (dimensionless) variables and valve, system and fluid parameters are relevant to the dynamic behaviour of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in pipeline systems. In that sense they are used in a dimensional analysis to develop (dimensionless) valve characteristics and dynamic scale laws. Based on the dimensionless valve characteristics, models for undamped and damped <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> are developed and implemented in the waterhammer computer code CVWP (<b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Waterhammer Program). Experiments are performed in the test facility at Delft Hydraulics to measure several valve characteristics of weakly and strongly damped <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> The dynamic scale laws are validated by means of numerical simulations. The valve models are validated against experimental data. The study has been performed within the <b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Research Project (CVRP) ...|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{the recent}} work {{performed}} by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) relative to nuclear industry <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> performance, no information was readily available regarding the failure characteristics of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> based on valve type (e. g., swing check, lift check). Although it had been recognized by component experts that the two most significant factors in determining <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> performance were valve design (i. e., type) and operating conditions, no industry data was available relative to the former. In cooperation with the Nuclear Industry <b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Group (NIC), ORNL has reviewed and analyzed <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> failures from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations` (INPOs`) Nuclear Plant Reliability Database System (NPRDS) according to several parameters,including valve type. Since the valve type identification is not inherently included within the NPRDS engineering record for each component, ORNL had to rely upon input from NIC, valve manufacturers, and catalogs to supply the missing information. As {{a result of this}} effort, approximately 77 % of the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> failures occurring during the 1991 - 1996 study period and nearly 62 % of the overall installed population were identified according to type.

40|$|This study {{systematically}} {{explores the}} relatively neglected surge protection strategy of installing an in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> at an intermediate point within a pipeline. The in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is selected to isolate {{part of the}} system from a high-pressure source of fluid subsequent to a low-pressure water hammer event, in this way greatly reducing or eliminating any return surge. A typical application involving a pipeline with an isolated high point within its profile is numerically investigated. The low pressure transient event first opens an air-vacuum valve at the line’s high point. However, the violent expulsion and collapse of this air cavity is thereafter avoided, and thus the resulting water hammer pressures dramatically reduced, by an in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> installed between the high point and the downstream reservoir. The effectiveness of the surge protection is shown to depend on hydraulics and topology of the line (particularly the position of the high point), on the position of the <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> and on both the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> Although the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> only protects the lower (normally upstream) portion of the line from the return surge, the transient response of the remainder of the line can sometimes be improved through installing either a bypass around the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> or by perforating the <b>check</b> <b>valve’s</b> working element.
