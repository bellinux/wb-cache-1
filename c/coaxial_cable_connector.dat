The principle of duality is employed.

The theory has application in calibrating near-zone /-Y field strength instrumentation and in determining the response of an unsheathed <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> <b>connector</b> mounted flush with {{the skin of a}} // / / missile to intense plane-wave electromagnetic field pulses...|$|E
40|$|Failures of {{connectors}} used {{in radio}} frequency (RF) systems cost the telecom industry, mainly cellular phone providers, {{billions of dollars}} annually. This cost is incurred because {{the integrity of the}} connectors cannot currently be monitored in-system and failure results in catastrophic signal loss. The Smart Connector project aims to solve this problem by designing a connector with the capability to sense and report its own integrity. An integrated sensor chip has been developed that mounts on a molded inter-connect device inside of a <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> <b>connector.</b> The current prototype system uses a direct connection to the chip to send the sensor data. However, for the system to be feasible in the target environment it must communicate sensor data wirelessly down the coaxial cable. The sensor chip uses a small loop coupler to inductively couple RF energy from the center conductor of the coaxial cable. The loop coupler is used to wirelessly receive power and to send and receive data from the sensor chip. Because the sensor chip is completely passive (it has no power source) the power available to transmit data is limited. The goal of this thesis is to develop a low power, wireless telemetry system for the Smart Connector sensor disk. This work investigates the analysis and design of an intra-coaxial cable reflected power communication system for use in the Smart Connector system. Theoretical analysis and experimentation proved the plausibility of using an intra-coaxial reflected power communication method for the telemetry system. Design guidelines were derived through the theoretical analysis which highlight many trade-offs and requirements for use in a final Smart Connector system. A simulation model of the communication link, which closely matches results from the theoretical model, was developed using the Cadence tool set. Finally, a complete prototype system capable of sending and receiving data packets via intra-coaxial cable reflected power communication was implemented...|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} {{repeater}} units, most stations utilize duplexers. These are notch filters usually in {{an array of}} six, eight, and sometimes four units. They separate the transmitter and receiver signals from each other so one antenna and coaxial line can be utilized. While this solution is very efficient and easy to install, factors such as humidity and temperature can affect the performance of duplexers, so in most configurations a dryer is installed to keep humidity out of the duplexers and <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable,</b> along with heated buildings in which they are installed in. Excellent quality <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable,</b> <b>connectors,</b> and antennas must also be used, as a single-antenna is not as forgiving as a dual antenna system since any RF leakage or poor connection can greatly decay the reliability and performance of the repeater.

The pin is soldered to the center conductor of the <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> coming from the antenna, and the grounded side forms a 1.5 inch (38 mm) long sleeve around the coax.

50|$|DS3 {{interconnect}} cables {{must be made}} with true 75-ohm <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> and <b>connectors.</b> <b>Cables</b> or <b>connectors</b> which are 50 ohms or which significantly deviate from 75 ohms will result in signal reflections which will lower {{the performance of the}} connection, possibly to the point of not working. GR-139-CORE, Generic Requirements for Central Office <b>Coaxial</b> <b>Cable,</b> defines type 734 and 735 cables for this application. Due to losses, there are differing distance limitations for each type of cable. Type 734 has a larger center conductor and insulator for lower losses for a given distance. The BNC connectors are also very important as are the crimping and cable stripping tools used to install them. Trompeter, Cannon, Amphenol, Kings, and Canare make some of the true 75 ohm connectors known to work. RG-6 or even inexpensive RG-59 cable may work temporarily when properly connectorized, though it does not meet telephony technical standards. Type 735 26 AWG is used for interconnects up to 225 feet, and Type 734 20 AWG is used for interconnects up to 450 feet.|$|R

MHV connectors can be recognized by the slightly protruding insulation on the male plug and the slightly different insulation length in the female jack. Despite these design differences, MHV and BNC plugs and jacks can be made to mate by brute force. This causes safety hazards, since a user can accidentally (or deliberately) mate a low voltage cable to a high voltage jack, (although in a correctly made MHV connector the pin is further back in the insulator than on BNC so theoretically they should never be able to make contact when used with BNC) ...|$|R

The data fit well with a circuit simulation of the entire measurement system. A high impedance preamplifier input stage gives best results, since lock-in input impedances may differ from manufacturer specifications.

40|$|The European {{emission}} standard is an EU directive which describes what emission limits car manufactures {{are required to}} meet. In order to meet these requirements car manufacturers use different techniques and components. In a modern diesel automobile a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) is used to gather soot from the exhausts. As soot accumulates in the DPF, the back pressure increases and the capability to hold more soot decreases. Therefore the DPF continuously needs {{to get rid of}} the stored soot. The soot is removed through a process called regeneration. In order to optimize when to perform regeneration, it is vital to know the amount of soot in the filter. A method for estimating the soot mass in a DPF using a radio frequency-based sensor has been developed. The sensor that has been studied is the Accusolve soot sensor from General Electric. A parameter study has been performed to evaluate the parameters that affects the sensor’s output. Parameters that have been studied include positioning of the sensor, temperature in the DPF, flow rate through the DPF and distribution of soot in the DPF. Different models for estimation of soot mass in the DPF has been developed and analyzed. An uncertainty caused by removing the <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> <b>connectors</b> when weighing the DPF has been identified and methods for minimizing this uncertainty has been presented. Results show that the sensor output is sensitive to temperature, soot distribution and position, and also show some sensitivity to the flow rate.

50|$|The SHV (safe high voltage) {{connector}} {{is a type}} of RF connector {{used for}} terminating a <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable.</b> The <b>connector</b> uses a bayonet mount {{similar to those of the}} BNC and MHV connectors, but is easily distinguished due to its very thick and protruding insulator. This insulation geometry makes SHV connectors safer for handling high voltage than MHV connectors, by preventing accidental contact with the live conductor in an unmated connector or plug. The connector is also designed such that when it is being disconnected from a plug, the high voltage contact is broken before the ground contact, to prevent accidental shocks. The connector is also designed to prevent users from forcing a high voltage connector into a low voltage plug or vice versa (as can happen with MHV and BNC connectors), by reversing the gender compared to BNC.Details of the connector comprising dimensions of the mating parts, voltage rating, mininium insulation requirements and more are specified by the IEC document 60498.|$|R
