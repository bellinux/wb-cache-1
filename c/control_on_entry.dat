40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{practice}} {{nurse is}} central {{to the development of a}} primary care-led National Health Service. Skin diseases can have a major impact on patients' lives but general practitioners (GPs) lack many of the skills of practical dermatology care and support. AIM: To determine whether a primary care dermatology liaison nurse should be introduced by our health authority. We identified the resources consumed and the benefits that accrued from a practice nurse who had received training in practical dermatology care. METHOD: A cost consequence study in parallel with a randomised controlled trial was undertaken in a group of nine GPs and 109 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years who had a diagnosis of psoriasis or eczema. RESULTS: Although there was a significant improvement in our primary outcome measure within group, when compared with the control group significance was not achieved. There was no significant change in the Euroqol measure but the clinical instrument showed a significant change when compared with <b>control.</b> <b>On</b> <b>entry,</b> our qualitative data identified three main themes [...] the embarrassment caused by these skin conditions, the wish for a cure rather than treatment, and concern over the long-term effects of steroids. On completion, 20 % of patients expressed that they had received a positive benefit from the clinic. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the difficulties of obtaining relevant information to facilitate decisions on how resources should be allocated in primary care. Not all questions can be answered by large multi-centred trials and studies themselves have an opportunity cost consuming resources that could otherwise be spent on direct health care. Often, local resource decisions will be based on partial evidence-yielding solutions that are satisfactory rather than optimum but which are, nevertheless, better than decisions taken with no evidence at all...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} {{successes of}} recent quota-based harvest cooperatives in the Pacific Northwest and an Alaskan salmon marketing cooperative highlight {{the potential for}} more extensive forms of collective behavior afforded by the Fishermen's Collective Marketing Act (FCMA) of 1934. Court rulings during the 1930 s- 1950 s clarified what was considered anti-competitive behavior by fishermen's groups, {{but the lack of}} <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> <b>entry</b> and harvests in the mostly open access fisheries undermined the full potential of the FCMA. With more fisheries now being managed by limited access and quotas, fishery cooperatives will be better able to share harvest capacity and/or profits, reduce costs, improve product quality, and negotiate prices.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the first {{national}} survey of legislation regulating the security industry in Australia. In addition to estimating {{the size of the}} industry, an assessment was made of legislative statutes and enforcement strategies. The survey found that the industry was up to three times the numerical strength of the police. There was a trend towards comprehensive licensing of security occupations, primarily through <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> <b>entry</b> by criminal record checks and minimum training requirements. However, there was significant inconsistency between the eight jurisdictions. Strategies for monitoring the conduct of licensed personnel were relatively passive, relying largely on complaints. The authors argue that the industry and consumers could greatly benefit from a unified national system, with the implementation of more proactive forms of compliance monitoring and professional development...|$|R

40|$|The road {{transport}} sector, an essential {{mode of transport}} in OECD economies, is conventionally divided into two, largely unrelated, parts – the road freight industry and the road passenger industry. The sectors under discussion – trucking, buses, and taxis – have quite different characteristics and scope for competition, which reflect inter alia differences in the timeliness and economies of scale and scope in operations. Trucking can sustain high level of competition {{and to some extent}} buses as well while there is some debate as to how and what form of competition can be introduced in taxis. As in the air transport industry, international trucking is governed by restrictive bilateral treaties. Most countries have liberalised their domestic trucking sector, removing <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> <b>entry</b> and prices. In the bus industry, long-distance bus services are liberalised in some countries while intra-city or local buses are very rarely liberalised.

40|$|During {{enactment}} of the Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (MFCMA) of 1976 it was widely anticipated that extension of fishery jurisdiction to 200 miles by the United States would result in substantial economic benefit to the domestic fishing industry. The traditional analyses of exploited fisheries show that {{in the absence of}} <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> <b>entry</b> into the domestic fishery, exclusion of foreign fleets will only yield temporary economic rents which will eventually be dissipated by additional domestic fishing effort. This paper examines post-MFCMA trends for the New England Otter Trawl fleet {{to determine the extent to}} which this hypothesis holds. By using a simulation program for this fishery, revenues and costs for representative vessels from four major New England ports from 1976 to 1982 were calculated and factor rents to owners, captains, and crew were estimated. For three of the four ports considered, the estimated real economic surplus for the typical vessel peaked in 1977 - 1978 and declined dramatically through 1982. While this finding indicates that some of the potential rents from the fishery may have been dissipated by a substantial increase in fleet size, other indicators show that this decline in economic surplus may have been due to exogenous factors and not rent dissipation as predicted by standard models.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the heterogeneity of}} violent behaviors in patients with schizophrenia, one must consider underlying clinical symptoms of the illness and their change over time. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine persistence and resolution of violence in rela-tion to psychotic symptoms, ward behaviors, and neu-rological impairment. Psychiatric symptoms and ward behaviors were assessed in violent inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and in nonvi-olent <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> <b>entry</b> into the study. Patients were followed for 4 weeks; those who showed resolution of assaults over this time were classified as transiently violent, and those who remained assaultive were cate-gorized as persistently violent. At the end of the 4 weeks, psychiatric symptoms, ward behaviors, and neurological impairment were assessed. Overall, the two violent groups presented with more severe psychi-atric symptoms and were judged to be more irritable than the nonviolent control subjects, but the tran-siently violent patients showed improvement in symp-toms over time. At the end of 4 weeks, the persistently violent patients had evidence of more severe neurologi-cal impairment, hostility, suspiciousness, and irritabil-ity than the other two groups. Canonical discriminant analyses identified two significant dimensions differen-tiated the groups. The first, characterized by positive psychotic symptoms, differentiated the violent patients from the controLsubjects;_the second,xharacterized by neurological impairment and high endpoint score for negative symptoms, differentiated the transiently from the persistently violent patients. Identification of cer-tain symptoms associated with different forms of vio-lence has important implications for the prediction and differential treatment of violent behavior in patients with schizophrenia...|$|R

[...] "Standards for immigration reform" [...] announced in January 2014 by Congressional Republicans are mostly compatible with the Obama administration's legislative proposals, except that the Republicans favor step-wise implementation (rather than a package approach) with border security and interior enforcement preceding [...] "paths" [...] to legal status. Journalist and immigration critic Roy Beck supports portions of this agenda involving “immigration reduction": specifically endorsing bills to limit family-sponsored immigration to spouses and children, to end “birthright citizenship”, and to tighten “interior enforcement” and employer verification requirements. Another Obama critic, Congressman Tom Tancredo, has been an “outspoken” advocate “for immigration reform” {{in the sense of}} stricter <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> illegal <b>entries</b> (though he also attends naturalization ceremonies to support new citizens “doing it the right way").

30|$|In recent decades, {{spending}} on Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) worker benefits has increased {{due to an}} increase in the number of awards coupled with the length of time beneficiaries remain on the rolls. 1 This increase in program costs has led to calls for stronger program oversight including tighter <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> program <b>entry</b> (see Morton 2015 for a review of various proposals) and helping current beneficiaries return to work (e.g., Social Security Advisory Board 2009; DeHaven 2013). One way to address this issue is to increase the number of post-award medical reviews that the Social Security Administration (SSA) conducts to determine whether beneficiaries remain eligible for the program. Whether SSA should increase the number of medical reviews depends on factors such as the potential program savings, the cause of the increase in the number of benefit awards in recent years, and the economic outcomes for beneficiaries removed from the rolls as a result of a medical review. We focus on the last point by examining the earnings of former beneficiaries, which we interpret as a plausible upper bound on the potential earnings that beneficiaries who remain eligible for the program could attain if their eligibility were hypothetically to cease.|$|R

Moreover, this immunity exerts a potent effect <b>on</b> <b>controlling</b> viral <b>entry</b> into the trigeminal neurons.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of Qualitative Sociology ReviewThe article explores {{the use and}} importance of taking a biographical approach to conducting participatory action research (PAR) with asylum seekers and refugees in order to: better understand lived experiences of exile and belonging; contribute to the important field of Biographical Sociology; provide a safe space for stories to be told; and in turn for these stories to feed in to policy and praxis. The authors’ combined work on the asylum-migration nexus, the politics of representation and participatory action research methodology (PAR) as ethno-mimesis(i) argues {{for the use of}} biography to contribute to cultural politics at the level of theory, experience and praxis, and is constitutive of critical theory in praxis. PAR research undertaken with Bosnian refugees in the East Midlands and Afghan refugees in London will be the focus around which our analysis develops. We develop a case for theory building based upon lived experience using biographical materials, both narrative and visual, as critical theory in practice towards a vision of social justice that challenges the dominant knowledge/power axis embedded in current governance and media policy relating to forced migration. The dominant power/knowledge axis related to forced migration is embedded in current (New Labour) governance and re-presented in some media texts as identified below. New Labour governance is symbolised in the competing discourses of a) strong centralised control and b) more open systems, network and partnership based governance (Newman, 2003 : 17 - 23; Clarke, 2004; Lewis, 2000). Open systems are made up of partnerships and networks – “joined up government”, “that transcends the vertical, departmental structures of government itself” (Newman, 2003 : 20) to develop or foster a consensual style of governing. Progressive governance is defined by Newman (2003 : 15) as involving a significant shift from governance through hierarchy and competition to governance through networks and partnerships with an emphasis upon inclusion. Progressive governance involves the production of techniques and strategies of responsibilisation of citizens operationalised through the development of networks, alliances, and partnerships, with a strong focus upon active citizenship. Thus, spreading responsibility for social control to non state agencies and “communities” (Garland, 2001). In relation to forced migration/asylum discourses around the exclusion of the “other” (involving criminalisation, detention and deportation) and the maintenance and control of borders (developing ever more tighter <b>controls</b> <b>on</b> <b>entry</b> and asylum applications) exist in tension with discourses that speak of human rights, responsibilities and possibilities for multi-cultural citizenship especially in the community cohesion literature. There is a conflict at the heart of New Labour’s approach to asylum policy linked to the “alterity” of the asylum seeker that promulgates hegemonic ideologies and discourses around rights to belonging and citizenship, perceived access to resources (redistribution) and misrecognition fostering suspicion of the “stranger”. Alongside discourses of fairness and rights to enter and seek refuge, there exist regressive discourses that water down the vitally important actual and symbolic 1951 UN convention, and foster a split between “bogus” and “genuine” refugees, making it extremely hard to seek asylum in the UK.
