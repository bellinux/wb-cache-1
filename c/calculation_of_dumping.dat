40|$|The unfair-trade {{codes of}} the GATT/WTO are suited to {{addressing}} complaints from manufacturing than agriculture. This {{is because the}} seasonality and uncertainty of agricultural output, together with substantial use of contracting with factors of production, makes sales at a loss a rational business practice during certain times of the year. This cost dumping induces the use of constructed values in the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> margins by the US, which typically generates high duties. The model provides for cyclical dumping arising as a supply phenomenon. This contrasts with cyclical dumping in manufacturing that is induced by demand fluctuations.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyDumping is to unfairly sell goods {{at a lower price}} (at foreign market) as compared to their normal value at domestic market of the manufacturing country, thus causing material injury to the local industry of the importing country. Other researchers have explored the global (WTO Agreement) and the European Union’s (EU) Anti-Dumping law mostly with a commercial perspective. At doctoral level EU-China, EU-Japan and EU-Korea trade relations with reference to the application of protective measures have been studied. This dissertation is, however, the very first aimed to examine the application of EU Anti-Dumping law relating to Pakistan. This is a complete health check of EU-Pakistan trade relations with reference to the application of Anti-dumping duties on Pakistan. This study is a combination of doctrinal research and empirical research, whereby it critically evaluates the Commission’s investigation and the judgements of the EU Courts related to Pakistan and thus establish their consistency or inconsistency; it also studies the voting patterns within the Council and the impact of AD duties on Pakistani imports. It is a qualitative exploratory study based upon an inductive approach. Contradictions are found in the calculations of normal value and export price, constructed normal value, the comparison of normal value and export price, the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> margin, and the calculation of injury. Suggestions are made as {{to the extent to which}} Unions’ anti-dumping rules need to be reviewed to moderate their tilt that unequivocally favours Union manufacturers. Moreover, this dissertation identifies many provisions of the basic regulation, which being too vague offers multiple interpretations, which are thus recommended to be amended. In the empirical part of this research the voting style of EU member states for or against the adoption of AD measures against Pakistan has been studied. Thereafter, the content analysis of stated reasons for specific voting styles reveals that the member states vote on the basis of the findings and conclusions of investigation as done by the Commission, thus trade partner loyalty is not the reason for their voting. Furthermore, application of the ADDs is found to be reason of import decline from Pakistan to the EU...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Commission of the European Community has made Korea one of three main target {{countries}} of anti-dumping measures, because Korea is pressing to export more of the electronics products which the Community is struggling to protect, study of the Community Antidumping Law in Korea has barely begun. Therefore, in this thesis, the measures that may be imposed by Community authorities with respect to trade with countries not members of the European Community, especially with Korea, under the Community Anti-dumping Regulation, {{in the context of the}} GATT Anti-dumping system are explained and analysed. With regard to the Community's anti-dumping rules, protectionist bias in their application is examined, in particular the determination of normal value and export price, constructed normal value and constructed export price, the comparison of normal value and export price, the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> margin, and the determination of injury, and proposals are made as to the extent to which the Community anti-dumping rules need to be revised to diminish the bias in their range that explicitly favours Community producers and a finding of dumping, in the context of the GATT rules. With regard to the Korean Anti-dumping rules, on the other hand, they are introduced, generally. Anti-dumping measures in Korea have not been applied properly in favour of Korean producers, mainly because of the lack of transparency and institutional inertia. Therefore, enactment of a special Act governing anti-dumping complaints, modelled on a unitary system rather than a bifurcated system, should be considered for the transparent and speedy investigations. Institutional inertia must be rectified, i. e., more precise definition is required in some terminologies, and provisions on cumulation and anti-circumvention should have been prescribed before their application. Through a comparative study of the anti-dumping laws in the Community and Korea, it becomes clear that various aspects of the technical methodology applied by the authorities in anti-dumping determinations have a tendency to make findings of dumping largely automatic and inevitable. Therefore, it must always be borne in mind that anti-dumping measures can be imposed only where dumping and resulting injury is actually established, not artificially. This study has looked at anti-dumping laws in the Community and Korea comparatively, in the context of the GATT Anti-dumping rules. The Community refers to GATT and the Code in the preamble of its anti-dumping regulation, which has no binding effect in Court, and adopts the regulation in accordance with existing international obligations, in particular those arising from Article VI of the GATT and from the GATT Anti-dumping Code. However, this does not ensure an interpretation in conformity with GATT rules and its spirit, because the wording of the GATT anti-dumping rules taken literally is very ambiguous and can be interpreted very differently. Therefore, a comparative study with the Community's antidumping rules and its practice as a legislative model should be very helpful, in order to improve the current Korean anti-dumping system, because the GATT anti-dumping rules can play a very limited role only as a guideline...|$|E
40|$|Anti-dumping duties are {{the most}} {{commonly}} applied trade defence instrument, {{not only in the}} European Union, but also globally. 1 In the European Union, they are imposed after an investigation by the Commission, in which the Commission tries to ascertain whether a specifi c product has been imported into the Community at a price below its "normal value" (i. e. has been "dumped"), whether this has caused or threatens to cause "material injury" to the Community industry, and, lastly, whether it is in the Community interest to impose an anti-dumping duty. All three elements are problematic in one way or the other. Recent reform discussions focused on the defi nition of the "Community industry" and the "Community interest", which are increasingly problematic concepts in times of globalization, as Community undertakings outsource production world-wide and commercial policy is burdened with non-economic policy goals. The methods for the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dumping</b> margin, i. e. the difference between the "normal value" and the export price, despite their importance for the fi nding <b>of</b> <b>dumping,</b> receive less attention outside the circles of anti-dumping experts...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Dispute {{settlement}} in the World Trade Organization (WTO) is carried out under the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU). In effect since January 1995, the DSU provides for consultations between disputing parties, panels and appeals, and possible retaliation if a defending party fails {{to comply with a}} WTO decision by an established deadline. Automatic establishment of panels, adoption of panel and appellate reports, and authorization of requests to retaliate, along with deadlines and improved multilateral oversight of compliance, are aimed at producing a more expeditious and effective system than had existed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). To date, 398 complaints have been filed, approximately half involving the United States as complainant or defendant. Expressing dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement results in the trade remedy area, Congress, in the Trade Act of 2002, directed the executive branch to address dispute {{settlement in}} WTO negotiations. WTO Members have been negotiating DSU revisions in the currently stalled Doha Development Round of trade negotiations but no final agreement on the DSU has been reached. Use of the DSU has revealed procedural gaps, particularly affecting the compliance phase of a dispute. These include a failure to coordinate procedures for requesting retaliation with procedures for tasking a WTO panel with determining whether a defending Member has complied in a case and the absence of a procedure for withdrawing trade sanctions imposed by a complaining Member where the defending Member believes it has fulfilled its WTO obligations. As a result, disputing Members have entered into bilateral agreements permitting retaliation and compliance panel processes to progress on an agreed schedule and have initiated new dispute proceedings aimed at removing retaliatory measures. Where a U. S. law or regulation is at issue in a WTO case, the adoption by the WTO of a panel or Appellate Body report finding that the measure violates a WTO agreement does not give the report direct legal effect in this country; thus federal law is not affected until Congress or the executive branch, as the case may be, takes action to remove the offending measure. Where a restrictive foreign trade practice is at issue, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides a mechanism by which the United States Trade Representative (USTR) may challenge the measure in a WTO dispute settlement proceeding and authorizes the USTR to take retaliatory action if the defending Member has not complied with the resulting WTO decision. Although Section 301 was challenged in the WTO on the ground that it requires the USTR to act unilaterally in WTO-related trade disputes in violation of DSU provisions requiring resort to multilateral WTO dispute settlement, the United States was ultimately found not to be in violation of its DSU obligations. H. R. 496 (Rangel) would create an Office of the Congressional Trade Enforcer (CTE) that would, inter alia, investigate restrictive foreign trade practices in light of WTO obligations and call on the USTR to initiate WTO dispute proceedings where the CTE finds that WTO violations have occurred; express congressional dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement decisions finding that the U. S. practice of “zeroing” (i. e., disregarding non-dumped sales in the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> margins) violates the WTO Antidumping Agreement and with decisions of the WTO Appellate Body generally; and place restrictions on the Department of Commerce in implementing the revised antidumping methodology that it adopted in 2007 in response to the WTO “zeroing” decisions. S. 363 (Snowe), would give the U. S. Court of International Trade exclusive jurisdiction to review de novo certain USTR determinations under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which may in some cases involve the initiation and conduct of WTO disputes; the bill would also amend various Section 301 authorities themselves...|$|E

This solution may have a rather unfavourable impact on the surrounding area considering the dissipation <b>of</b> <b>dumped</b> ash (polluting with fine particles of fly ash and bottom ash) and contamination of mine waters (which are collected and discharged into the nearby river). In order to prevent this situation it is necessary to adapt the hauling technology to given circumstances. The essential characteristic of this technology is that it makes maximal use of the intrinsic property of ash, which tends to solidify in contact with water forming a steady and stable completely ambient-neutral rock mass. So the proper <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> wall thickness for long – distance slurry pipeline is of great importance...|$|R
