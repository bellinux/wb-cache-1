Addressing customers’ complaint quickly, is very important because hotel industry {{is one of the}} businesses that is tough with requests and grievances coming in by phone, online, email or in-house guest leaning over the welcome desk. To (Chang et al., 2011; Stewart & Hitt, 2012), if prompt response to guest requests such as extra pillow, remote battery, blanket etc. are adhered to quickly, customers will be very appreciative. With the notion that the “customer is always right” a certain percentage of customers in the hotel industry are notorious for high hopes and complaints, so staff should always bear in mind to do what is expected of them. Comment gathered from website, cards in room and front desk logs can be used as guide during meetings and training sessions (Simon, Mazilu, Andrei, Severineanu, & Dumitrascu, 2010) and at the management level for implementing policy. The information gathering tools, when properly used by SH can be a huge plus in attracting new customers and keeping existing ones.|$|E
40|$|Sound without {{picture is}} quite normal. Picture without sound {{stays in the}} olden days. Video conference is both sound and picture, and they are of equal importance. By {{developing}} the audible quality of the video conference, the participants are likely to let themselves immerse into a close to natural face to face conversation. It {{is well known that}} distraction of technique make us focus more on the tool than the task, and thereby hindering flow. Quick Set is the video <b>conference</b> <b>equipment</b> for the beginner, and it is mostly part of small to medium sized installations. The Quick set of today comes with a coder - decoder (codec), a camera, a microphone and a remote control. The customers mostly provide themselves with screens. This implies that most users of the Quick Set experience their conversation partner through a pair of poor TV speakers, and that Cisco has no quality assurance of the video conference experience as a whole. This is obviously not how it should be. But why should the customer buy Cisco speakers? They will probably be more expensive than regular consumer speakers. Is delivering superior sound quality enough to convince the customer? AV partners I have been in contact with tell me that customers in general are not preoccupied with sound quality. What they are concerned about is the resolution of the screen. So who are we to please and how? The user analysis shows that there is one person that is highly important to think of when designing video <b>conference</b> <b>equipment,</b> namely the decision maker who also tends to be the installer and operator of the system. The conclusion of the research phase is that if Cisco is going to offer a sound solution, ti should provide the customer with added value and preferable pleasing these company gatekeepers. Another influential finding from the research carried out is that AV partners most commonly install a configuration consisting of two 55 inches screens with a camera placed in the middle and with two speakers placed {{on each side of the}} screen set-up to improve eye contact. According to the sound engineers at Cisco, mono sound should not be played one more than one speaker, otherwise the sound quality decreases. This finding drew me towards developing a solution that also could work in a between screens-configuration making it easier for Cisco to control both placement of camera and speaker, hindering mono sound on several speakers or sound coming from elsewhere than the screen. Could work with several Cisco systems and possibly be placed between the screens. Either placed above the screen as preferred by the Cisco sound engineers, or placed between the screens in an AV set-up, the audio module operates in close relation to the camera. Integration of camera in the sound module has been a recurrent issue through the whole project. The BAR audio module integrates a new concept camera module and is truly adaptable being able to be used in several different configurations: • Together with Quick SetThe audio module is placed above the screen in a horizontal configuration. • Between screensA shorter version of the audio module in its vertical configuration, rotating the camera module 90 ° • Without the camera moduleIn any configuration where the customer need an audio solution. With its clean cut front face Bar is in line with both the current and the future product portfolio. The integration of the camera and the vertical configuration are both current contributions that possibly will have an impact on the further direction of the Quick Set design. </p...|$|E

40|$|Nobody {{really knows}} with {{certainty}} what education using {{digital video communication}} technology will be like in the next ten years. The only thing that seems certain {{is that it will}} not be like the present. While no one can see into the future, we can research present realities and current rates of change as bases for projecting ahead. Video conference systems that operate over IP (Internet Protocol) are being implemented in educational organisations, businesses and homes around the globe. Video conference manufacturers inform us that the implementation of such systems and their use is relatively straightforward. This {{may or may not be}} the case. This research argues that there is significantly more to implementing video conferencing over IP than simply installing the equipment, training staff and commencing classes. This study reports on an investigation into the effectiveness of implementing digital video conferencing over IP in educational institutions. It specifically looks at this in respect of the desktop and small group user. Research in desktop videoconferencing in education exists but is not abundant, for example, Thompson (1996), Kies et al., (1997), Bogen et al., (1997), Daunt (1999), Davis and Kelly (2002), Davis et al., (2004). With the considerable progress made in IP technologies, more educational providers are moving to use desktop and small group videoconference systems to link to classes and/or students over the Internet. This is a trend that is growing rapidly world-wide. The implementation and application of IP video conferencing in education is under-researched. This study examines three separate case studies to collect the required data. It looks at the processes required to set up effective communications with students and teachers using digital media. It identifies the specific difficulties that need to be overcome, both technically as well as the human factors that are involved. It addresses these issues chiefly as related to desktop users and small groups of participants in particular. In conclusion it also focuses on the design aspects of the video <b>conference</b> <b>equipment</b> and venues used in educational environments. The aim of the research, therefore, is to understand current and future trends of implementing and using video conferencing over IP, in a technical, human and design sense. The research has practical significance for educational institutions, as it provides useful information for students, tutors, technicians and designers involved in digital video conferencing technologies now, and in the years to come...|$|E
40|$|Background: When {{investigation}} {{of patients with}} suspected Head&Neck tumours have been completed he/she is presented at a multidisciplinary tumour conference at Sahlgrenska University Hospital to establish a diagnosis and tumour classification and make treatment suggestions. As the travelling distances in the region can be long, {{it is possible to}} participate in the conference using video conference technology. The objective of this thesis was to analyse quality factors associated with the tumour conference. Methods: After the patients' investigation material was presented at the tumour conference, decisions were made about diagnosis, tumour classification and treatment suggestion. A new assessment was then made with the patient present in person and differences compared with previous decisions were registered. Questionnaires were used to evaluate the patients' satisfaction with the tumour conference. A record was kept of the frequency with which the tumour conference was able to establish a diagnosis and a treatment decision and the reasons for a lack of decision. Further data registered were the time between the therapy decision and the start of treatment, and the frequency of and reasons for changes to the tumour conference decisions {{prior to the start of}} treatment. Based on information from the patient questionnaires, the cost to participate in the tumour conference was calculated. The cost of using video <b>conference</b> <b>equipment</b> and of physicians from DGHs (District General Hospital) attending the tumour conference was calculated. Results: The tumour classification or treatment plan changed for nine per cent of the patients after they had been assessed following participation in person. The patients who participated in person at the tumour conference were seldom (15 %) accompanied by their physician, while the patients who participated using video conference technology were always accompanied by their physician, which influenced the patients' experience of satisfaction. A quarter of the patients who had been referred to the tumour conference needed to supplement their examinations. The clinics which more frequently allowed their physicians to take part in the tumour conference required additional examinations less frequently. The waiting time for treatment at an ENT clinic and an Oncology clinic was 19 days and 38 days respectively. At the start of treatment, the classification or treatment plan was changed for 1. 4 % of the patients. When a patient and physician from a DGH took part in the tumour conference, the cost was SEK 5, 366, while the cost of participating using video conference technology was SEK 2, 036. Conclusions: If the patient attends the tumour conference, a greater precision in the diagnosis is achieved. In addition, patients feel that it is valuable for them to take part in the tumour conference and they also feel that they are supported if their physician from the DGH accompanies them. A large percentage of the patients who are presented at the tumour conference require additional examinations. The decisions made at the tumour conference are still valid at the start of treatment. In socio-economic terms, it is more effective to allow a patient from a DGH to take part in the tumour conference using video conference technology...|$|E
40|$|At 5 : 30 am, Moussa Ong´ayo, an {{extension}} worker in Kakamega, is already {{excited by the}} prospect of his first wireless video conference in one of his villages. He activates his personal portable assistant (PPA), and tells it to download his mailbox and display the new messages on the flat screen above his breakfast table. Later, over a cup of tea, he reads his mail and dictates responses, which his PPA records, processes and automatically dispatches by email or text message. Then he calls up today´s weather map and asks his PPA to download and overlay on it satellite images showing the crops currently being grown in the district. He studies the composite image with interest, and makes some mental notes on what to tell the farmers at the meeting planned for today. Suddenly, a locust alert from the national IPM centre pops up on the screen. He dictates a message to a colleague at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute in Limuru, an expert in the field of indigenous practices, to ask for advice on how to protect crops against locusts. He puts on his new multipurpose watch and looks at the time. He should hurry, this will be a busy day. His PPA displays his ´to-do´ list: one meeting with a farmers´ association, several farm visits and tasks from his support unit. When the PPA has calculated his optimal travel route, it sends text messages to inform everyone of his schedule, he collects some printed flyers (after a video show, farmers always ask for flyers to take home) and packs them in his van. He can still marvel over this vehicle - it is equipped with a public address system, a foldable video screen and a computer system with a docking station for his PPA. When he starts the engine, the computer comes to life and automatically connects to two satellite systems, WorldSpace´s Afristar for a broadband Internet connection, and the Galileo satellite navigation system. En route to his first appointment, Moussa passes one of the district´s weather monitoring boxes. His computer automatically makes contact and downloads the data recorded over the last month. A tune informs him that the data transfer was successful, so he can continue without stopping. Just before he arrives at the farm, the Galileo system warns his PPA to project onto the windscreen in front of him the farmer´s name and the purpose of his visit. He has been asked to assist Catherine Adoyo and her neighbour in solving a land dispute. After the usual greetings, he asks Catherine to call her neighbour, and together they walk to the disputed boundary. Moussa uses the Galileo receiver in his watch to determine the exact boundary. He starts up his laptop, which has a wireless connection to the equipment in the van, logs on to the computer of the land registry office in Nairobi, and downloads the cadastral information on the two farms, including a detailed map. Moussa notes that their farms are located in an area under customary law, and submits a request for any oral records relating to the two farms. He is informed there is a video, in which the respected head of the clan who died five years ago explains the rights of the two women to the disputed land. They decide to settle their dispute in accordance with the deceased man´s explanation. Using a webcam, Moussa scans their irises, and inserts these biometric signatures into an electronic form to register their agreement. His next call takes him to Joseph Wambui who has applied for a bank loan to purchase a new tractor. The bank has asked him to assess Joseph´s creditworthiness. Joseph explains his future plans and Moussa taps the details into his PPA. Later, he connects the PPA to the computer in his van and within seconds, the machine produces a business plan and an assessment of the economic feasibility of Joseph´s ambitions. Within a few seconds, the PPA gathers details of the Joseph´s business performance over the past year from the tax office database, and commodity price projections {{for the next five years}} from the Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange. Moussa emails his report and recommendation to the bank manager, and receives confirmation of receipt, and an assurance that a decision will be made within a week. Moussa is eager to be on time for his next appointment - a meeting with the leaders of the local farmers´ association. The local MP has promised to address the meeting over a video link, and will be waiting in his office in Nairobi. While Moussa installs the video <b>conference</b> <b>equipment,</b> his PPA links up with the MP´s office. ´Ladies and gentlemen, the honorable Oscar Chavangi would like to say some words to you from his office in Nairobi´. The MP´s familiar face appears on the screen. ´Fellow citizens, your extension worker Moussa has invited me to be with you today?´. The farmers gasp with surprise. Moussa beams.
