40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{different}} processing conditions (pressure, holding time and temperature) on the impregnation/consolidation quality of CF/PEKK composite were investigated using compression molding process. Microscopic investigation of cross-sections, density measurements and flexural mechanical properties {{were used to}} examine the quality of impregnation and consolidation. A qualitative model to describe the impregnation and consolidation process of this material was developed. The model predicts the variations of void content during consolidation as well as the holding time, moulding temperature and pressure required to reach full <b>consolidation.</b> Good <b>agreement</b> between theoretical predictions and experimental data was achieved. Optimum processing conditions can be determined based on selected void content...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the topic of democratic consolidation in Guatemala. The country became a formal democracy in the 1980 s, but since that moment it has started an ongoing process of democratic consolidation. Within the same time period we see the emergence of neoliberalism in the region. Neoliberalism focused on the opening up of markets to international trade and included the introduction of many free trade agreements such as CAFTA-DR. While CAFTA-DR had as primary objective to facilitate trade, there were also political objectives attached to it that revolved around promoting democracy in the region. The aim of the thesis is to research how CAFTA-DR promoted democracy and to what extent it contributed to the strengthening of democratic institutions in Guatemala. The thesis identifies three main ways through which CAFTA-DR influences democratic <b>consolidation.</b> The <b>agreement</b> aims at increasing institutional transparency, strengthening {{the rule of law and}} enhancing accountability structures. While there are many elements present in the agreement that help to strengthen democratic institutions, obstacles are present that can significantly limit the effect of the agreement...|$|R

In this note, the problem of consolidation displacements around an axially loaded sphere was considered. It is demonstrated that both the uncoupled analysis and the coupled analysis give the same governing equation for pore fluid pressure dissipation with time. A simplified procedure for deriving transient strain components is illustrated. A general solution for time-dependent displacements is obtained using uncoupled <b>consolidation</b> analysis.

25|$|Władysław of Opole's {{daughter}} was married with Henry IV Probus, Duke of Wrocław. Historians place the wedding between {{the second half}} of 1277 and March 1280, this is, between the six-months of captivity of Henry IV by his uncle Bolesław II the Bald (since 22 July 1277) and the Congress of Vienna. The wedding couldn't take place prior to 1277, because in the description of the events of Henry IV's imprisonment in the Polish-Silesian Chronicle, the Duke of Wrocław is identified as a boy, which would be impossible if he was then married. In the Congress of Vienna was settled the dispute between the Dukes of Wrocław and Opole, proved in a document were Władysław called Henry IV his son-in-law. It's possible that the <b>consolidation</b> of the <b>agreement</b> was just the wedding between Henry IV and Władysław's daughter.|$|R

The technique utilizes high intensity white X-ray radiation from a synchrotron radiation source to obtain energy spectra from small (0. 001 cu mm) volumes deep within composite samples. The viability of the technique was tested using a model system with 800 micron Al 203 fibers and a commercial purity titanium matrix. Good agreement was observed between the measured residual radial and hoop strain gradients and those estimated from a simple elastic concentric cylinders model. The technique was then {{used to assess the}} strains near (SCS- 6) silicon carbide fibers in a Ti- 14 Al- 21 Nb matrix after <b>consolidation</b> processing.

40|$|Post-training {{administration}} of morphine (0. 25, 0. 5, or 1 mg/kg) dose-dependently impairs retention of an inhibitory avoidance response in mice. The effects on retention performance {{induced by the}} drug appear {{to be due to}} an effect on memory consolidation. In fact, they were observed when drugs were given at short, but not long, periods of time after training, i. e., when the memory trace was susceptible to modulation. Moreover, these effects are not to be ascribed to an aversive or a rewarding or nonspecific action of the drugs on retention performance, because the latencies during the retention test of those mice that had not received a footshock during the training were not affected by post-training drug administration. Pretreatment with either selective D 1 or D 2 dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists SCH 23390 and (-) -sulpiride administered at per se noneffective doses (0. 025 and 6 mg/kg, respectively) potentiated the effects of morphine, while either selective D 1 or D 2 receptor agonists SKF 38393 and LY 171555 at per se noneffective doses (5 and 0. 25 mg/kg, respectively) antagonized the effects of the opiate on memory consolidation. No significant differences were evident between the effects of D 1 and D 2 receptor active compounds, thus suggesting that D 1 and D 2 receptor types are similarly involved in the effects of morphine on memory <b>consolidation,</b> in <b>agreement</b> with previously reported results. These results are discussed in terms of a possible inverse relationship of endogenous opioid and DA systems in the brain that are involved in memory processes...|$|R
40|$|Protein folding {{is a grand}} {{challenge}} of the postgenomic era. In this paper, 58 folding events sampled during 47 molecular dynamics trajectories for a total simulation time of more than 4 μs provide an atomic detail picture of the folding of a 20 -residue synthetic peptide with a stable three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet fold. The simulations successfully reproduce the NMR solution conformation, irrespective of the starting structure. The sampling of the conformational space is sufficient to determine the free energy surface and localize the minima and transition states. The statistically predominant folding pathway involves the formation of contacts between strands 2 and 3, starting with the side chains close to the turn, followed by association of the N-terminal strand onto the preformed 2 – 3 β-hairpin. The folding mechanism presented here, formation of a β-hairpin followed by <b>consolidation,</b> is in <b>agreement</b> with a computational study of the free energy surface of another synthetic three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet by Bursulaya and Brooks [(1999) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, 9947 – 9951]. Hence, it might hold in general for antiparallel β-sheets with short turns...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Pharmaceutical (Pharma) {{industry and the}} changes that have occurred particularly over the last 10 years {{as a result of the}} overall economic downturn, the rising cost of healthcare and the costs associated with the development and sales of pharmaceuticals. One response of big Pharma to this has been the recent spate of partnerships, mergers and acquisitions, <b>consolidation,</b> diversification, licensing <b>agreements</b> and downsizing in both human and capital resources. Four major challenges facing the complex Pharma industry are highlighted and discussed. These include the decline in the discovery, approval and marketing of new chemical entities (NCE) with fewer and fewer blockbuster drugs making it to the market, competition from generics drugs, regulatory pressures and the weak growth in the US market (the largest market) and therefore the need to explore other markets to name a few. In addition to the research driven aspect of the paper, a summary of the interviews conducted with executives and other industry practitioners (to get their personal views) is presented. Finally referencing some of the strategies adapted by some companies, this thesis identifies Organizational Dynamics areas of concentration and the role they can play within companies in their plans to ensure long term viability. The analysis focuses on the commercial aspects of the industry and offers some steps that will be useful in changing the current business model and setting the stage for futur...|$|R

50|$|The {{interest}} rate charged on jumbo mortgage loans is generally higher than a loan that is conforming, due to the higher risk to the lender. The spread, or {{difference between the two}} rates, depends on the current market price of risk.

40|$|Abstract In May 2010 the Danish {{government}} and the Danish People’s Party signed the Fiscal <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Agreement</b> {{with the objective of}} rebalance public finances. One of the main elements was a labor market reform, which reduced the potential unemployment insurance (UI) benefit duration from 4 to 2 years. Based on the experiences from the 1990 s the Ministry of Employment estimated, that no more than 2. 000 - 4. 000 UI-recipients would exhaust their benefits on an annual basis because of the reform. In February 2014 AK-Samvirke announced, that 33. 919 UI-recipients had exhausted their UI benefits in 2013. This leads to following questions regarding: 1) how the reduction of the potential UI benefit duration affected the job search behavior among the unemployment, and how the reform affected the exit rate from unemployment to employment; 2) how the discrepancy between the Ministries forecast and the actual number that lost UI benefits can be explained. To answer these questions I will conduct a thorough description of the UI benefit reforms and the economic situation in the 1990 s and in 2010. In addition, I will include 3 Danish studies and statistics that shed light on the impact of the potential UI benefit duration reduction. In my analysis I juxtapose the above-mentioned descriptions with two disparate theoretical perspectives – a demand-side and a supply-side perspective. I conclude, in accordance with the supply-side theory, that the reduction of the UI benefit duration increased the search activity among the unemployed. But generally seen, the shortening of the benefit period did not increase the individual probability of finding a job. Finally I show, in accordance with the demand-side theory, that the incongruity (between the Ministries forecast and the actual number that exhausted their benefits) resulted from: 1) A contractionary fiscal policy (including a labor market reform that caused uncertainty); 2) The economic depression; 3) The erroneous notion, that the experiences from the 1990 s were comparable; 4) The selected phase-in of the labor market reform...|$|E
