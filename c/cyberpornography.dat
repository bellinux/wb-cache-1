40|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>cyberpornography</b> as a cybercrime reality {{can not be}} separated from the process of human meaning that involves human reason and conscience. The philosophical approach provides a perfect understanding of the <b>cyberpornography</b> through a complete, critical, systematic and comprehensive perspective in order to obtain an essentials understanding of the <b>cyberpornography</b> either textual or contextual. Philosophical understanding of the pornography should not be done partially or separately, it must be in a whole understanding about the natureof oneself, responsibility towards the universe and devotion to God as a civilized man.

40|$|Sociological {{theories}} of deviant behavior {{have not been}} systematically applied {{to the problem of}} who uses and who does not use <b>cyberpornography</b> on the Internet. The present study contributes to the literature by providing the first systematic application of selected sociological {{theories of}} deviance to the problem of explaining use of <b>cyberpornography.</b> It tests a blended theoretical perspective, which includes measures from social control and opportunity theories of deviance, as well as measures of broader deviant lifestyles, as possible predictors of use of cyberporn. A key hypothesis is that persons with the strongest ties to conventional society will be less likely than others to use cyberporn.

40|$|In this research, I {{take the}} {{established}} trilogy of pornography, identity and law {{and explore the}} question of what happens when 'cyber' is added to the equation. Informed by cyberpunk writings, cybertheorists and academic sources, and using such theoretical frameworks as queer theory, post-feminism and cyberfeminism, I look at how the (inter) relationship between pornography, identity and law can be understood and analysed in a cyber age: what new <b>cyberpornographies</b> and cyberidentities will evolve before the law, and what forms might law take in relation to them...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore the {{changing}} form of pornography and put forward tentative suggestions {{as to how}} the phenomenon of <b>cyberpornography</b> might influence orthodox understandings of pornography. Feminist interventions have long been critical in altering the frame through which pornography is understood, but how does the emergence of <b>cyberpornography</b> complicate these visions? The title of the paper comes from a comment supermodel Kate Moss made after her Calvin Klein adverts were accused of being pornographic. She said `the more visible they make me, the more invisible I become'. The issues implicit here are identity and the relationship between subject and object, issue that have been central to the orthodox view of pornography. If these are disturbed, what then? In Surrealist paintings, precisely that quality of subtle disturbance is central. Magritte's `This is not a pipe' is the classic example. And of course it is not a pipe, but a picture of one, just as it is a picture of Kate Moss to which we react. Informed by Surrealist theories of art and film, I examine how understandings of pornography might be affected. Taking this a stage further, I turn to the cyberpunk novel Neuromancer by William Gibson and the work of various cybertheorists. Using their visions of cyberculture, I try to imagine how <b>cyberpornography</b> might work and how we might understand pornography beyond the simplistic subject/object, stimulus/response debates within which it is commonly cast. If, as the postmodernist, postfeminist, gender and queer theorists argue, identity, gender, subjectivity and sex are destabilising, how will new pornographies fit in? It is my contention that the emergence of <b>cyberpornography</b> and postmodern debates on the fragmentation of the subject must irrevocably complicate our understanding of pornography. In turn, these new understandings may perhaps provide {{a way out of the}} anti-censorship/pro-censorship impasse...|$|E
40|$|What {{exactly is}} popular culture? Does "Big Brother" really pose an {{inherent}} challenge to law? And what connection does {{the regulation of}} <b>cyberpornography</b> have with the film "Pretty Woman"? These {{are some of the}} questions I was left with after reading "Romancing the Tomes", a cross-disciplinary collection of conference papers exploring the 'uneasy relationship' between law and popular culture from a feminist perspective...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In this article, {{we propose}} the {{clinical}} construct of Video-terminal Dissociative Trance (VDT) and discuss its potential usefulness {{for the assessment}} and treatment of people who display problematic Internet use. VDT {{is defined as a}} clinical syndrome characterized by clusters of symptoms in the psychological domains of addiction, regression, and dissociation in the individual’s interactions with the computer and its applications. Method: Study 1 examines the relationships between Internet addiction symptoms, dissociative experiences, and attachment styles in a sample of university students. Study 2 explores the associations between Internet addiction symptoms, <b>cyberpornography</b> use, and dissociative experiences in another sample of university students. Two clinical vignettes are presented to provide anecdotal evidence for VDT cases. Results: Preoccupied attachment style and dissociation predicted Internet addiction symptoms in Study 1. Dissociation scores predicted Internet addiction symptoms in Study 2, while <b>cyberpornography</b> use did not add to the prediction. Clinical vignettes suggest that a VDT framework can help to interpret both of these findings and improve the understanding of the specific motives behind an individual’s misuse of the Internet. Conclusions: VDT may involve significant disturbances in the state of consciousness, identity, and memory, the dilution of self-awareness and self-integrity, and the replacement of the customary sense of personal identity by a new virtual identity. People who display problematic Internet use may greatly benefit from clinical interventions aimed at addressing these symptoms and understanding their origins...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} a part of a broader {{empirical}} study of Internet users with excessive and dysfunctional Internet use symptoms. The aim of this particular article was to describe user profiles of Internet addicts in Serbia. The study recruited 100 subjects in total, 50 in both the clinical and control group. The clinical group included the Internet users who asked for professional help due to the symptoms of the excessive Internet use and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for Internet behavior disorder proposed by the American Psychology Association. The results have shown that population with Internet addiction symptoms equally included both males and females, mostly adolescent and younger population, teenagers and university students, persons with higher income and users from economically more developed areas of Serbia. The user profile of this group is characterized by frequent logging on with intervals of several hours online at one time, mainly in the evening or at night, and also intensive negative reactions to any form of Internet access deprivation. By means of factor analysis, three dimensions of pathological use have been established: mixed type with particular need for up-to-date information, social interaction addiction and need for fun-seeking, namely pursuing hobbies online (<b>cyberpornography,</b> online games, music, art and so on) ...|$|E
40|$|Congress {{introduced}} the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Internet Protection Act (2 ̆ 2 CIPA 2 ̆ 2) {{in order to}} filter obscene and indecent material {{in response to a}} perceived threat to members of the public, specifically minors, who are exposed to pornographic material on the Internet. The provisions of CIPA have provoked tension between two competing interests: protecting minors from <b>cyberpornography,</b> and safeguarding First Amendment rights. This Note argues that the Supreme Court erred by upholding the constitutionality of CIPA. As a result of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision, the nation 2 ̆ 7 s youth will have restricted access to constitutionally protected information. The Court improperly relied on a provision of the Act permitting adults to request that library filters be disabled upon request. Part II of this Note provides background on CIPA and the litigation surrounding it. The decisions of both the district court and the Supreme Court are analyzed in detail. Part III explains what an Internet filter is and how filters work in the context of CIPA. Part IV identifies the burdens that libraries face as a consequence of CIPA. Part V recognizes several less restrictive alternatives to the implementation of CIPA. Part VI expounds upon the substantial effect that CIPA will have on today 2 ̆ 7 s youth. The Note concludes by arguing that CIPA simply does not accomplish what it was designed to do...|$|E
