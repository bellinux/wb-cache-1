Inafune recalled the final two months of development as particularly turbulent, when he had to take responsibility for assessing and dividing up tasks among the team members who were not meeting deadlines.

Digitally manufactured building designs made from wood can help produce extraordinary cores for multistorey timber buildings. This study aims at investigating the possibilities of such novel building cores. Based on the thesis that contemporary technologies supporting the production of large-scale timber structures offer unique opportunities to redefine the visceral parts of multi-storey buildings, which in turn has architectural effects throughout, the research shows how a combination of mass production and mass customisation strategies can be applied to timber architecture. The end result is a novel design and production strategy based on innovative manufacturing methods that give rise to new construction strategies, new structural ideas, new buildings, and new ways of using those buildings Godkänd; 2014; 20141023 (andbra) </p...|$|R

Daniella is unnerved by this left-hand drive car, and the resulting stress causes her to perform poorly, hitting the car 22 times during the challenge.
