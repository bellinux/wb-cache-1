5|$|September 17, 1876– A {{hurricane}} moves ashore near Wilmington, causing localized {{severe damage}} and <b>capsizing</b> several ships; a military camp is {{destroyed by the}} storm, and two people drown during the storm.|$|E
5|$|The former {{hospital}} ship was repurchased by the Ward Line in 1927, who refitted her and placed {{her back in}} service on the Havana route under her original name of Havana. In January 1935, Havana grounded on a reef north of The Bahamas and remained there for three months. After being refloated and repaired, she was placed back in service as SS Yucatán in June. In 1940 the ship was removed from passenger service to be converted into a freighter. After <b>capsizing</b> in port in 1941, the ship was again refloated and renamed SS Agwileon.|$|E
50|$|To <b>capsize</b> (or spill) a knot is {{to change}} its form and {{rearrange}} its parts, usually by pulling on specific ends in certain ways. When used inappropriately, some knots tend to <b>capsize</b> easily or even spontaneously. Often the <b>capsized</b> form of the knot offers little resistance to slipping or unraveling. A reef knot, when misused as a bend, can <b>capsize</b> dangerously.|$|R
5000|$|The Fastnet race, and {{particularly}} the 1979 Fastnet race (the disastrous race that changed yacht racing for all time), has been the occasion for many sailboat <b>capsizes,</b> turtlings and fatalities. [...] In the 1979 race, [...] "15 sailors died, five boats sank, and at least 75 boats flipped upside down." [...] In any event, adopting heaving to as a storm tactic {{proved to be a}} good preventive of <b>capsize</b> during the race. Not one of the hove to yachts were <b>capsized</b> or suffered any serious damage. [...] See also <b>Capsize</b> of Drum (1985) and <b>Capsize</b> of Rambler (2011), both of which involved large Maxi yachts that lost their keels.|$|R
5000|$|In {{competitive}} yacht racing, a <b>capsized</b> boat {{has certain}} special rights as it cannot maneuver. A boat is deemed <b>capsized</b> when the mast is touching the water; {{when it is}} fully inverted, {{it is said to}} have turned turtle or turtled. [...] Good racers can often recover from a <b>capsize</b> with minimal loss of time.|$|R
5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The court found that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the <b>capsizing</b> of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E
5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled their homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship <b>capsizing</b> near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Channel 4 {{television}} programme What Sank the Mary Rose? attempted {{to investigate the}} causes suggested for her sinking by means of experiments with scale models {{of the ship and}} metal weights to simulate the presence of troops on the upper decks. Initial tests showed that the ship was able to make the turn described by eyewitnesses without <b>capsizing.</b> In later tests, a fan was used to create a breeze similar to the one reported to have suddenly sprung up {{on the day of the}} sinking as the real Mary Rose went to make the turn. As the model made the turn, the breeze in the upper works forced it to heel more than at calm, forcing the main deck gun ports below the waterline and foundering the model within a few seconds. The sequence of events closely followed what eyewitnesses had reported, particularly the suddenness with which the ship sank.|$|E
25|$|Intermediate sailors are {{encouraged}} to <b>capsize</b> their dinghies in a safe location with supervision at least once to become acquainted with their boat's floating properties and the <b>capsize</b> process. The boat is then righted, bailed out, and the sails reset, {{so that in the}} event of an uncontrolled <b>capsize,</b> the boat and its occupants are familiar with the procedure and may recover.|$|R
5|$|<b>Capsize</b> is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During <b>capsize,</b> an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A <b>capsize</b> can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the <b>capsize</b> instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Capsized!</b> is {{the ninth}} studio album {{released}} by the Ohio rock band Circus Devils in October, 2011. All songs on <b>Capsized!</b> were written and performed by Robert Pollard, Todd Tobias, and Tim Tobias.|$|R
5|$|Of {{the three}} lifeboats, the James Caird was deemed {{the strongest and}} most likely to survive the journey. Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird, a Dundee jute-manufacturer and philanthropist, whose {{sponsorship}} had helped finance the expedition. Before its voyage, the ship's carpenter Harry McNish strengthened and adapted the boat to withstand the mighty seas of the Southern Ocean. Surviving a series of dangers, including a near <b>capsizing,</b> the boat reached the southern coast of South Georgia after a voyage lasting 16days. Shackleton and two companions then crossed the island's mountainous interior to reach a whaling station on the northern side. Here he organised the relief of the Elephant Island party, {{and the return of}} his men home without loss of life. After the end of the First World War in 1918, the James Caird was brought back from South Georgia to England in 1919 and put on permanent display at Shackleton's old school, Dulwich College from 1922.|$|E
5|$|The RAF made {{a second}} attempt on 29 October, after {{the ship was}} moored off Håkøya Island outside Tromsø. Thirty-two Lancasters {{attacked}} the ship with Tallboys during Operation Obviate. As on Operation Paravane, No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss, partially the result of bad weather over the target. The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. Tirpitzs 38cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns. Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from <b>capsizing,</b> and anti-torpedo nets were installed. Tirpitz retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared {{for her role as}} a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Trainor leaning {{on a bed}} reciting the song's lyrics, {{interspersed}} with scenes of dolls and a young girl and boy having a tea party. As the video progresses, Trainor proceeds to fail at her attempt to bake pies, setting a pie on fire. Trainor is then shown scrubbing the kitchen floor. The entire video is interspersed with scenes of a singing and dancing barbershop quartet. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} video, Trainor tests potential suitors. The first date cooks her a meal consisting of a small portion of scallops, which fails to impress Trainor. The second potential suitor takes her to a carnival and tries to impress her with his strength, which also fails to impress Trainor. The third date takes her boating, with the boat nearly <b>capsizing</b> and Trainor getting seasick. This also fails to impress Trainor. Finally, Trainor meets Charlie Puth on the online dating service, PlentyofFish. Puth comes to Trainor's home with a carryout pizza, which succeeds in impressing Trainor. The video ends with Trainor smiling and inviting Puth into her home.|$|E
50|$|In 1824, he was {{in command}} of the {{schooner}} USS Ferret, which <b>capsized</b> at sea. He (and other survivors) remained with the <b>capsized</b> vessel for twenty-one hours before being rescued. Five crew members died.|$|R
50|$|Turtling {{commonly}} {{occurs when}} a boat <b>capsizes</b> and is not righted or attended to in time, allowing it to roll through the approximately 90 degrees of a <b>capsize</b> through to 180 degrees from upright.|$|R
50|$|Trimaran <b>capsizes</b> {{are more}} likely to be of the pitchpole type than a roll to one side due to their higher {{sideways}} stability and speeds. <b>Capsized</b> trimarans are harder to turn upright after they have turtled than monohull boats. While some <b>capsized</b> trimarans righted by sideways rotation may suffer heavy damage to mast and rigging, many modern and ancient trimarans are explicitly designed for this method of righting. Harnesses pulling on the stern toward the bow, or from the bow toward the stern of <b>capsized</b> trimarans have been shown to be able to successfully turn them end-over-end. Several design features reduce the chance of pitch-pole capsize; these include having wing nets with an open weave designed to reduce windage and decks and nets that shed water easily. The best way to avoid <b>capsize</b> is to reduce sail in heavy weather.|$|R
5|$|The <b>capsizing</b> of the {{battleship}} Novorossiysk in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on Stalingrad {{until the end}} of the year. The hull had to be patched, the water pumped out and all the projections removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons, pivot into deeper water, then trim it down to elevate the bow off the bottom and pull it free. These preparations were very time-consuming and it wasn't until mid-July 1956 that it could be pulled off the rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs. She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P-1 or KSS anti-ship missiles fired from the converted Sverdlov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in December 1956. The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull, but there was no appreciable change in the ship's draught. Details are not known about other tests, although she reportedly served as a target for P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 Styx) missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing munitions. By the early 1960s her usefulness had come to an end and she was scrapped, possibly in 1962.|$|E
5|$|The high {{waves and}} winds caused the {{greatest}} marine damage {{in a decade}} around New York City. More than 100boats were overturned or beached in Jamaica Bay, and another 150boats were wrecked between Hell Gate and {{the west end of}} Coney Island. At least ten houseboats were damaged or sank, with boaters injured and requiring rescue. A man attempting to row ashore near Point O' Woods required rescue amid strong winds. Passengers swam safely ashore after their boat capsized in Hell Gate. President Theodore Roosevelt directly experienced the effects of the hurricane while vacationing on the naval yacht Sylph along Long Island. Also on the yacht were Roosvelt's wife, son, his secretary, several friends and members of the press association. The yacht experienced gusty winds and heavy rainfall, along with rough seas, and witnessed a boat <b>capsizing</b> in Hell Gate. Passengers left the deck of the yacht for safety while their belongings were secured. After the President was considered to be in danger, the yacht headed for land, and instead of embarking toward Ellis Island as originally planned, the yacht landed at Brooklyn Navy Yard. Farther north, high winds downed many trees along coastal Connecticut, which cut telegraph and telephone lines in Bridgeport. A boy was killed in Hartford after stepping onto a downed power line. Several boats were washed ashore along the Connecticut coast. Farther inland, winds disrupted power in Leicester and damaged crops.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} destroyed {{ships from}} Cape Fear to Currituck, North Carolina, ruined crops, uprooted forests, displaced gristmills, and demolished roads inland. At Wilmington, the storm inflicted damage to numerous buildings, {{among them the}} Cape Fear Bank, which suffered the loss of its chimneys. The city's wharves also experienced moderate damage, with a sloop from Bermuda <b>capsizing</b> and a brig separating from port, drifting toward a nearby plantation. A saltworks at Masonboro Island and several other offshore barrier islands endured severe damage, with the hurricane producing a -high storm surge in some regions, driving thousands of pounds of salt to sea. In all, the salterns at Masonboro Island suffered approximately $60,000 (1815USD) in losses. Damage was similarly severe near Bear Island and locations along the White Oak River. At Swansboro, meanwhile, two schooners struck a sand bar and another two were grounded nearby, and three other vessels later washed into a nearby forest. A second saltworks was completely obliterated, and on a nearby beach, a residence was destroyed, with five family members drowned. A second house was also swept away, with four individuals inside killed. Majestic shade trees throughout the state were uprooted, and doors of houses near Cape Lookout burst open despite being firmly locked shut. At Edenton, the hurricane was {{believed to have been}} worse than the 1806 Great Coastal hurricane. Winds uprooted numerous trees at Fayetteville, obstructing roads, with similar impacts at Raleigh. Significant crop damage was also noted at Winston-Salem, where fences were toppled, and fields of corn, orchards, and forests ruined.|$|E
50|$|The boat set {{off from}} a landing at 4:30 p.m. and <b>capsized</b> 7 km away, at {{approximately}} 5 p.m. on 30 September 2009. It <b>capsized</b> {{in one of the}} deepest parts of the reservoir, in an area around 100 m deep.|$|R
50|$|Both Vermeulen and McGibney {{submitted}} {{an early}} version of <b>Capsized</b> as their final undergraduate assignment, and continued development full-time after graduation as Alientrap Games Inc.. <b>Capsized</b> was released in April 2011 on Steam and is in development for iOS and Android platforms.|$|R
50|$|The Philippine Coast Guard cited cargo {{mishandling}} {{caused a}} ferry to <b>capsize.</b> Commodore Pablo Gonzales Jr., PCG district commander for Southwestern Mindanao, said initial investigation showed no other safety {{issue on the}} MV Danica Joy, which <b>capsized</b> while berthed at the port.|$|R
5|$|This {{time the}} mere {{presence}} of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of <b>capsizing,</b> Epaminondas decided {{that he would have to}} break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 508510 Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Capsizing</b> in yachts {{can occur}} when water {{is able to}} {{infiltrate}} the hull and decrease the vessels water and buoyancy leading to <b>capsizing.</b> Yachts can be deployed with a floatation system which {{is a series of}} strategically placed lift bags within the interior of the hull increasing the vessel's buoyancy and filling void space where water can collect. Providing valuable time to remove the water, fix damage or evacuate.|$|E

25|$|A well {{designed}} ballasted boat can {{recover from a}} <b>capsize,</b> even from turning over completely. The Swan 65 Sayula II won the 1973–74 Whitbread Round the World Race after doing a 180 degree <b>capsize</b> in the Southern Ocean. Righting a multihull that has gotten upside down is difficult in any case and impossible without outside help unless the boat is small or carries special equipment for the purpose. Several round the world racing multihulls have been lost after they <b>capsized.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 5 January 1997, in the Southern Ocean near , Bullimore's boat, Exide Challenger <b>capsized</b> and the {{majority}} of press and media reports assumed that the 57-year-old sailor was lost. The Royal Australian Navy launched a rescue mission for Bullimore and another <b>capsized</b> competitor, Thierry Dubois.|$|R
50|$|After drawing {{attention}} to the <b>capsize</b> by banging {{on the bottom of}} their boat, the kayaker who <b>capsized</b> waits upside down underwater until another kayak arrives to help. The <b>capsized</b> kayaker finds the other kayak, usually the bow, with their hand and uses this for support while they take a breath and perform a hip-flick to right their kayak. If the kayaker runs out of breath before managing to complete the eskimo rescue, as sometimes happens, they will exit their kayak by releasing their spray deck.|$|R
25|$|Marion Eichholz, {{the last}} known {{survivor}} of the <b>capsizing,</b> died on November 24, 2014, {{at the age of}} 102.|$|E
25|$|A capsized kayak may be righted with a roll or eskimo rescue. As {{long as the}} kayaker {{knows how}} to react, the water is not too shallow, and the {{location}} is not close to dangers which that require evasive action by the kayaker – which cannot be taken while capsized – <b>capsizing</b> itself is usually not considered dangerous. In whitewater kayaking, <b>capsizing</b> occurs frequently and is accepted as an ordinary part of the sport.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes a knot is {{intentionally}} <b>capsized</b> as {{a method}} of tying another knot, as with the [...] "lightning method" [...] of tying a bowline. Some knots, such as the Carrick bend, are generally tied in one form then <b>capsized</b> to obtain a stronger or more stable form.|$|R
