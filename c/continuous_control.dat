5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Dugan {{developed}} a gain limiting improvement to the automixing algorithm. The Dugan Gain Limiting System was patented in September 1989 and {{presented to the}} 87th AES convention in October. Dugan described for the AES his prototype of an automixer to be inserted into selected microphone channels of a mixing console, operated by a person, to help in mixing multiple live microphones to have less reverberation and noise, more focus on the desired sound, eliminating the mixing engineer's problem of too-slow human reaction time. The gain limiting system provided smooth, <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> over the equivalent number of open microphones (NOM) that the automixer would send at its outputs. The NOM could be set anywhere between 1 and 10, with higher settings sounding more natural for a recording in a studio, and lower settings offering greater control of acoustic feedback {{in the presence of}} sound reinforcement loudspeakers. An embodiment of Dugan's three patents was produced as the Model D Automatic Mixing Controller, a 3U rack unit handling 8 channels which could be linked with up to 11 other Model Ds to automatically mix as many as 96 channels simultaneously.|$|E

The discrete inputs are used to block undesired transitions and to realize evolutions that are goal-attaining with high probability. An approach is proposed which combines the computation of discrete shortest-paths for given probability-levels with embedded <b>continuous</b> optimal <b>control</b> problems to fix the <b>continuous</b> <b>controls.</b> The result is a control strategy {{which leads to a}} system evolution that maximizes a weighted sum of performance and probability of success.

25|$|In {{terms of}} cockpit {{equipment}} and avionics, the EC225 {{is equipped with}} a full glass cockpit with active-matrix liquid crystal displays; these include four 6-inch by 8-inch multi-functional displays as the predominant instrumentation for key flight information, two 4-inch by 5-inch monitors for displaying aircraft parameters, and a 3-inch screen for backup. The advanced helicopter cockpit and avionics system is described as serving to reduce pilot and crew workload, being used to display flight management and sub-systems information and is complete with a four-axis digital autopilot. During a typical flight, the pilot programs the route into the aircraft and then monitors it, as opposed to direct <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> of the flight; the need for paper charts has been eliminated by these systems. Under autopilot, the automatic flight control system acts to prevent pilot actions from exceeding the established flight envelope; the EC225 remains flyable with all automatic systems disabled. From initiating the startup sequence to being ready to takeoff only takes three minutes, however if the authorised Airbus checklist is used it take approximately 7 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of VEP {{used with}} {{applications}} is the P300 potential. The P300 event-related potential {{is a positive}} peak in the EEG that occurs at roughly 300 ms after {{the appearance of a}} target stimulus (a stimulus for which the user is waiting or seeking) or oddball stimuli. The P300 amplitude decreases as the target stimuli and the ignored stimuli grow more similar.The P300 is thought to be related to a higher level attention process or an orienting response Using P300 as a control scheme has the advantage of the participant only having to attend limited training sessions. The first application to use the P300 model was the P300 matrix. Within this system, a subject would choose a letter from a grid of 6 by 6 letters and numbers. The rows and columns of the grid flashed sequentially and every time the selected [...] "choice letter" [...] was illuminated the user's P300 was (potentially) elicited. However, the communication process, at approximately 17 characters per minute, was quite slow. The P300 is a BCI that offers a discrete selection rather than a <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> mechanism. The advantage of P300 use within games is that the player does not have to teach himself/herself how to use a completely new control system and so only has to undertake short training instances, to learn the gameplay mechanics and basic use of the BCI paradigm.|$|E
2500|$|In {{ethics and}} politics, Deleuze again echoes Spinoza, albeit in a sharply Nietzschean key. In a {{classical}} liberal model of society, morality begins from individuals, who bear abstract natural rights or duties set by themselves or a God. Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity, Deleuze criticizes {{the notion of}} an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation (as the etymology of the word [...] "individual" [...] suggests). Guided by the naturalistic ethics of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers. In the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia, Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of [...] "desiring-production" [...] (a concept combining features of Freudian drives and Marxist labor) into the modern individual (typically neurotic and repressed), the nation-state (a society of <b>continuous</b> <b>control),</b> and capitalism (an anarchy domesticated into infantilizing commodification). Deleuze, following Karl Marx, welcomes capitalism's destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating, but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market. [...] In a 1990 Postscript on the Societies of Control, Deleuze claims that institutions and technologies introduced since World War II have moved social coercion and discipline from only physical enclosures (such as schools, factories, prisons, office buildings, etc.) into the lives of individuals considered as [...] "masses, samples, data, markets, or 'banks'." [...] The mechanisms of modern [...] "societies of control" [...] will be continuous, following and tracking individuals throughout their existence via transaction records, mobile location tracking, and other personally identifiable information.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} of the Republic of China was founded on the Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the People, which states that the ROC [...] "shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people." [...] The government is divided into five branches (Yuan): the Executive Yuan (cabinet), the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency). The constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland China to the Communist Party of China. It {{was created by the}} KMT for the purpose of all of its claimed territory, including Taiwan, even though the Communist Party boycotted the drafting of the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 25 December 1947. The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of the constitution was not in effect. Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidency, ending KMT's <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected {{to reduce the number of}} parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} Switched Linear Quadratic Regulator (SLQR) problem, over a hybrid (continuous and discrete) {{dynamical}} model known as "switched system". The problem {{is defined as}} computing the optimal continuous and discrete switching control to minimise a quadratic cost function that weights {{the states and the}} <b>continuous</b> <b>controls.</b> The original SLQR problem does not handle constraints on states, <b>continuous</b> or discrete <b>controls,</b> and there is no probabilistic behaviour. This thesis focuses on the discrete dynamics in a SLQR problem. The first part of the thesis describes the SLQR problem with discrete constraints, whereas the second part is dedicated to probabilistic switching behaviour. The problem with discrete constraints is described as finding the optimal hybrid switching policy that minimises a quadratic cost function, weighting states and <b>continuous</b> <b>controls,</b> without violating the discrete constraints. The problem with probabilistic switches is defined as finding the optimal hybrid switching policy that minimises an expected value of a quadratic cost function, weighting states and <b>continuous</b> <b>controls.</b> For the SLQR problem with discrete constraints a general relaxation framework is developed to simplify the representations of the value functions and the corresponding control strategies. It is shown that the closed loop performance of the obtained solution with the relaxation framework can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal solution. For the SLQR problem with probabilistic switches it is shown that a relaxation framework can only be developed when there are no discrete constraints involved. Finally, the thesis concludes with a few case studies to illustrate how the optimal hybrid control sequence is computed.
