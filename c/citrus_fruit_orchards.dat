50|$|Average {{precipitation}} is heavy, {{a result}} of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the Mediterranean Sea and the continental air mass. Because they usually meet {{at the point where the}} terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms. Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours.When the continental air mass is weak, Mediterranean winds drop their moisture farther inland. When there is a dominant continental air mass, cold air spills onto the lowland areas, which occurs most frequently in the winter. Because the season's lower temperatures damage olive trees and <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits,</b> groves and <b>orchards</b> are restricted to sheltered places with southern and western exposures, even in areas with high average winter temperatures.|$|R

Because citrus canker is not found in many countries including European Union and Australia, Xcc is strictly regulated in order to prevent its spread. In this study, the effects of X-irradiation on Xcc growth either in the suspension or on the surface of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were investigated. The suspension containing 1 × 107 cfu/ml of Xcc was irradiated with different absorbed doses of X-irradiation ranging from 50 to 400 Gy. The results showed that Xcc was fully dead at 400 Gy of X-irradiation. To determine the effect of X-irradiation on quarantine, the Xcc-inoculated <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were irradiated with different X-ray doses at which Xcc was completely inhibited by an irradiation dose of 250 Gy. The D 10 value for Xcc on <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> was found to be 97 Gy, indicating the possibility of direct application on citrus quarantine without any side sterilizer.

40|$|All {{commercial}} citrus rootstocks are polyembryonic and propagated by seeds. Although these seeds produce uniform {{plant material}} {{most of the}} time, zygotic or polyploid citrus seedlings may arise. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand how zygotic or tetraploid rootstock could affect a citrus rootstock selection field trial. A trifoliate orange selection field trial, which was planted in 1974 and grafted with clementine, was re-investigated with respect to the presence of rootstocks that were not true-to-type. Among the 288 trees investigated, flow cytometry identified 2. 4 % of rootstocks as tetraploid and SSR markers indicated that 6. 6 % were zygotic. Yield data showed that the presence of tetraploid rootstock dramatically decreased (by about 45 %) clementine fruit production. However, zygosity did not always affect fruit production and a range of effects were observed, from a slight increase in production to a 24 % decrease. Exclusion of non-true-to-type genotypes from the production analysis indicated that the best candidate for rootstock was a clone previously ranked in the middle of the 32 rootstocks under evaluation. However, the presence of zygotic rootstock did not appear to cause any significant differences in fruit quality during the first 5 years of the investigation, which suggests that non-true-to-type plants cannot be identified by fruit quality parameters. This study indicates that tetraploid and zygotic rootstocks have a strong impact on <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> production in <b>orchards,</b> and removal of off-type seedlings is required prior to planting in any agronomic trial.

40|$|Abstract — Main {{objective}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> acidity using electrical impedance measurements. Furthermore, the measurements of electrical properties of Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were conducted at various levels of pH and frequencies. This is done as a first step in order to evaluate the Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> acidity that does not damage it. The electrical parameters have significant response to acidity of Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits.</b> The changes of acidity lead to changes in electrical properties of fruits. Resistance per weight, reactance per weight, inductance per weight, and impedance per weight of Garut citrus fuits declined when the pH is increased. While the capacitance per weight of the Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> increases as pH increases. The correlations between pH and electrical parameters are estimated by using multiple regressions equation. Their correlation was highly linear at frequency of 1 MHz. Those estimation equations are the primary basis in nondestructive determining of Garut citrus acidity with electrical impedance measurements...|$|R
