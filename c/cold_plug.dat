50|$|The terms {{hot plug}} and <b>cold</b> <b>plug</b> {{can be taken}} to mean two {{different}} things, depending on the context. In a more generic context, hot plug is the ability to add or remove hardware without powering down the system, while <b>cold</b> <b>plug</b> is the inability to do so. In the context of comparing certain hot-pluggable devices, however, hot plug {{can be taken to}} mean the ability of the system to autonomously detect the addition or removal of hardware as it occurs, while <b>cold</b> <b>plug</b> can be taken to mean the ability to add or remove devices without powering down or rebooting the system, but the inability of the system to detect these changes, in which case the system operator would have to tell the system software that the change has occurred.|$|E
5000|$|Heat {{from the}} {{combustion}} chamber escapes through the exhaust gases, {{the side walls}} of the cylinder and the spark plug itself. The heat range of a spark plug has only a minute effect on combustion chamber and overall engine temperature. A <b>cold</b> <b>plug</b> will not materially cool down an engine's running temperature. (A too hot plug may, however, indirectly lead to a runaway pre-ignition condition that can increase engine temperature.) Rather, {{the main effect of}} a [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "cold" [...] plug is to affect the temperature of the tip of the spark plug.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cold</b> filter <b>plugging</b> point (CFPP) is {{the lowest}} temperature, {{expressed}} in degrees Celsius (°C), at which a given volume of diesel type of fuel still passes through a standardized filtration device in a specified time when cooled under certain conditions. This test gives an estimate for the lowest temperature that a fuel will give trouble free flow in certain fuel systems.

50|$|There are two {{slightly}} differing {{meanings of}} the term hot swapping. It may refer only {{to the ability to}} add or remove hardware without powering down the system, while the system software may have to be notified by the user of the event in order to cope with it. Examples include RS-232 and lower-end SCSI devices. This is sometimes called <b>cold</b> <b>plugging.</b> However, if the system can detect and respond to addition or removal of hardware, it is referred to as true hot plugging. Examples include USB, FireWire and higher-end SCSI devices.|$|R
5000|$|A {{spark plug}} {{is said to}} be [...] "hot" [...] if it is a better heat insulator, keeping more heat in the tip of the spark plug. A spark plug {{is said to be}} [...] "cold" [...] if it can conduct more heat out of the spark plug tip and lower the tip's temperature. Whether a spark plug is [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "cold" [...] is known as the heat range of the spark plug. The heat range of a spark plug is {{typically}} specified as a number, with some manufacturers using ascending numbers for hotter plugs, and others doing the opposite - using ascending numbers for <b>colder</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{was common}} before {{the modern era}} of {{computerized}} fuel injection to specify {{at least a couple}} of different heat ranges for plugs for an automobile engine; a hotter plug for cars that were mostly driven slowly around the city, and a <b>colder</b> <b>plug</b> for sustained high-speed highway use. This practice has, however, largely become obsolete now that cars' fuel/air mixtures and cylinder temperatures are maintained within a narrow range, for purposes of limiting emissions. Racing engines, however, still benefit from picking a proper plug heat range. Very old racing engines will sometimes have two sets of plugs, one just for starting and another to be installed for driving once the engine is warmed up.|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho foi realizado usando biodieseis preparados a partir de óleos de soja, canola, milho, girassol e, também, de gordura suína, através de reações transesterificação. Para todos esses biodieseis foram determinados o ponto de entupimento a frio, o ponto de fulgor e o perfil cromatográfico. Estes biodieseis foram misturados com diesel de petróleo para se produzir misturas contendo 5 % do biocombustível (B 5), 10 % (B 10) e 20 % (B 20), e os ensaios citados foram realizados nestas amostras. Visando a diminuição do ponto de entupimento a frio, alguns aditivos naturais foram testados e se mostraram eficientes. Por exemplo, o limoneno reduziu o ponto de entupimento do {{biodiesel}} de óleo soja em mais de 7 °C. No biodiesel de gordura suína a redução foi de 10 °C, o que significa o ponto de entupimento a frio em temperatura inferior a 13 °C. Os aditivos utilizados são solúveis nos biodieseis estudados e, também, nas misturas diesel-biodiesel, pelo menos nas concentrações testadas. Como importante exemplo de abaixamento do ponto de entupimento a frio das misturas diesel-biodiesel de gordura suína com 10 % de biodiesel (B 10), podese citar o caso da terebentina que provocou uma redução de aproximadamente 8 °C (de 12, 7 ºC para 5, 0 °C). Este mesmo aditivo caus ou uma redução de 13, 6 ºC (de 20, 3 ºC para 6, 7 ºC), na mistura diesel-biodiesel de gordura suína com 20 % de biodiesel (B 20). Este resultado é muito significativo por implicar na possibilidade de usar este tipo de combustível mesmo em regiões mais ao sul do país durante o inverno. The present {{studies were}} performed preparing biodiesel from soya, canola, corn, sunflower oils and the fat swine, through transesterification reaction. The biodiesel produced from these oils were studied for: <b>cold</b> filter <b>plugging</b> point, flash point and for chromatographic analysis. The biodiesels were mixed with diesel to produce blends containing 5 % of the biofuel (B 5), 10 % (B 10) and 20 % (B 20), and these samples were also analyzed {{by the same}} techniques as discussed earlier. In order to decrease the <b>cold</b> filter <b>plugging</b> point, some natural additives have been tested and were proved effectively. For example, limonene caused more than 7 °C reduction in the <b>cold</b> filter <b>plugging</b> point of soybean biodiesel. In the biodiesel obtained from the swine fats, the reduction was found around 10 °C and less than 13 °C for the <b>cold</b> filter <b>plugging</b> point.

40|$|Biodiesel {{production}} from non-edible feedstocks is currently drawing much attention due to legitimate {{concerns about the}} effects of using edible oil for fuel. Pangium edule Reinw is a non-edible feedstock. Pangium is a tall tree native to the Micronesia, Melanesia and the mangrove swamps of South-East Asia. In this study, biodiesel production and characterization from P. edule oil was reported. The seeds were obtained from Bogor, Indonesia. The oil was found to have an acid value of 19. 62 mg KOH/g oil.

This was followed by evaluating the physical and chemical properties of biodiesel and its blends with diesel.

The <b>cold</b> filter <b>plugging</b> point of biodiesel was measured according to GB/T 20828 - 2007. The cold flow properties of biodiesel were investigated {{on the basis}} of the crystallization theory, including {{chemical composition}} and molecular structure. Biodiesel might be considered a pseudobinary mixture, namely, high-melting-point saturated fatty acid methyl esters and low–melting-point unsaturated ones. Bilayer crystal structure of biodiesel was founded. Bilayer structure with headgroups aligned next to each other inside the crystal and away from nonpolar bulk liquid was large platelet lamellae. The results showed that biodiesel was mainly composed of saturated fatty acid methyl esters (C 14 : 0 ～C 24 : 0) and unsaturated ones(C 16 : 1 ～C 22 : 1, C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3). The cold flow properties for biodiesel were determined mainly by the amount and molecular structure of saturated fatty acid methyl esters. The long-straight-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters tend to have relatively poor cold flow properties. The cold flow properties worsen with increasing the amount and carbon chain length of straight-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters.

40|$|The {{potential}} of microalgal oil from Scenedesmus incrassatulus as a feedstock for biodiesel production was studied. Cell concentration of S. incrassatulus and lipid content obtained during mixotrophic growth were 1. 8 g/L and 19. 5 ? 1. 5 % dry cell weight, respectively. The major components of biodiesel obtained from S. incrassatulus oil were methyl palmitate (26 %) and methyl linoleate (49 %), which provided a strong indication {{of high quality}} biodiesel. Fuel properties were determined by empirical equations and found to be {{within the limits of}} biodiesel standard ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214. The quality properties of the biodiesel were high cetane number (62), low density (803 kg/m 3), low viscosity (3. 78 mm 2 /s), oxidation stability (9 h) and <b>cold</b> filter <b>plugging</b> point (- 4 ?C). Hence, S. incrassatulus has potential as a feedstock for the production of excellent quality biodiesel...|$|R
