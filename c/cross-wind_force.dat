40|$|The {{effects of}} heat {{capacity}} lag on the flow over slender bodies are examined via {{an extension of}} Ward's (1949) generalised treatment of the slender body problem. The results are valid for smooth bodies of arbitrary cross-sectional shape and attitude in the complete Mach number range up to, but not including, hypersonic. Transonic flow can be treated owing {{to the presence of}} a dissipative mechanism in the basic differential equation, but the results in this Mach number range are probably of limited practical value. The results show that <b>cross-wind</b> <b>forces</b> are unaffected in a first approximation, but that drag forces comparable with laminar skin friction values can arise {{as a result of the}} relaxation of the internal degrees of freedom. The magnitude and sign of these effects depend strongly on body shape and free stream Mach number. Results are given for surface pressure coefficient and the variations of translational and internal mode temperature on and near the body are also found. The influence of these latter effects on heat transfer to the body is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} recent research that {{has been carried out}} on the cross-wind effects on road and rail vehicles. After a brief introduction to the issues involved, the risk analysis framework is set out. All risk analysis methods require some knowledge of <b>cross-wind</b> aerodynamic <b>force</b> and moment coefficients, and methods of obtaining these through full scale and wind tunnel testing and through Computational Fluid Dynamics methods are then described. The picture of the flow fields around vehicles that is suggested by these measurements and calculations is then presented, and the steady and the unsteady aerodynamic force characteristics described. The detailed methodology for using this information to predict accident risk is then set out, including details of the vehicle dynamics system models that can be used. Finally potential alleviation methods are described and suggestions made for further works...|$|R
5000|$|At Chatham, {{in spite}} of the repugnance to {{innovation}} displayed by the naval authorities of that period, he was able to introduce important innovations in the methods of ship-construction. Quoted as saying [...] "partial strength produces general weakness", he significantly improved the strength and seaworthiness of the Navy's fleet. He improved the design of the bow and the stern, and, from about 1830, he introduced ships with iron diagonal bracing; by thus stiffening the hull a ship's sea worthiness was greatly improved in storms and high seas (it also saved on the need to use wood that was, by then, in short supply for jointing pieces and stiffening). This meant that the rigging had better anchor points to take the <b>force</b> of high <b>cross-winds,</b> while shear <b>forces</b> along the hull were no longer borne by the oakum-packing of the timber planks which had leaked while they were squeezed and released like a sponge. It also reduced the unwanted flexure of the keel and therefore the hull in general, known as 'hogging'. These stronger designs offered better protection than the old forms to the crews against the enemy's fire, permitted a powerful armament to be fitted, and better allowed the ships to be kept on-station during bad weather, since the vessel would be more able to resist the stresses consequently reducing wear on the hull and subsequent leaks and salt water damage (especially insidious and dangerous to a ship where wood and iron were in contact) [...]|$|R

The results of these tests show that the apparent directional stability of the airplane is high and increases with increasing Mach number and dynamic pressure.

The description of the balance gives the mechanical details and the method of operation, and is accompanied by line drawings showing the construction of the balance. The balance is of particular interest, as it allows the model to be set up quickly and accurately in roll, pitch, and yaw, without stopping the wind.

40|$|The {{rollover}} of road {{heavy-duty vehicles}} {{is one of}} the most serious problems related to transportation safety. In this paper, an anti-rollover control system based on lateral acceleration and <b>cross-wind</b> <b>force</b> feedback is proposed. The aim of the control system is to improve the vehicle stability by reducing the carbody roll angle and consequently the vertical load transfer. The performances of the anti-rollover controller have been evaluated through simulations carried out with a MB vehicle model. In order to estimate the aerodynamic loads acting on the vehicle, an extended Kalman filter has been designed. Turbulent windâ€“vehicle interactions have been evaluated through a numerical algorithm based on the corrected quasi-static theory and the vehicle admittance function...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} evolutionary structural optimization (ESO) {{techniques for}} a series of civil engineering applications, including form-finding of complex structures, optimum patch repair for cracks, and building shape and topology optimization considering wind loads. The original ESO method is modified so that tension- or compression-dominant structures can be obtained and optimized. Several case studies demonstrate excellent resemblance of ESO solutions to real structures. The pioneering work of this thesis in applying the ESO method successfully to form-finding and reverse engineering of iconic architectural designs has significantly expanded the opportunity of transdisciplinary cooperation between civil engineers and architects. Cracks represent a frequent occurrence in many aged civil infrastructure such as buildings and bridges. A crack may propagate due to stress concentration at the crack tip, and eventually cause a fracture of the structural component. Patch repairs are economic and easy to apply without destroying the existing structure. The fracture risk of a cracked plate is evaluated by the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip. The most efficient distribution of patch material is determined by using the revised Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization method (BESO). Based on the sensitivities of elements, the topology of the patch material is modified gradually by removing less efficient elements while adding material to more efficient locations, and finally achieves an optimum. It is found that by redistributing the patch material using the proposed optimization technique, the SIF of the cracked plate could be reduced by up to 24 %. Wind loading competes with seismic loading as the dominant environmental loading for building structures, especially for high-rise towers. This thesis presents a systematic study of wind drag on high-rise polygonal buildings using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with both steady-state simulations and transient simulations. Wind loads of various polygonal towers as well as the effect of tower twisting are investigated using parametric studies as a simple procedure of optimization for limited design variables. It is evident from the analysis results that twisting leads to a significant reduction in the <b>cross-wind</b> fluctuating <b>forces</b> as the vortex shedding cannot be synchronised throughout the building height. The ESO method is applied to the optimum structural topology design of buildings considering wind loads. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by examples. The approaches and findings shown in this thesis have established appropriate techniques for various applications of ESO/BESO methods in civil engineering. The work has provided a solid foundation for creating a practical design tool {{in the form of a}} user-friendly computer program suitable for the conceptual design and repair of a wide range of structures in civil engineering...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{properties of}} high-speed trains have in past been optimized through {{trial and error}} design process. Such an approach relies on the experience and skills of the engineer to suggest changes in the design that will lead to an improvement of the aerodynamic performance of the train. Although this process leads to an improvement of the design {{there is no guarantee that}} the best design will be identified. A more rigorous numerical optimization methodology that allows the best design to be identified is required. The majority of numerical design optimization procedures in fluid machinery uses gradient-based search algorithms. These methods work iteratively through the design space until the optimal design is reached. Such an approach is impractical in optimization of vehicle aerodynamics due to computational effort required for such a large number of CFD simulations. The present work presents the use of a surrogate model in form of response surface approximation (RSA) for multi-objective optimization of train aerodynamics. The design problem of vehicle aerodynamics has multiple objectives, i. e. drag, lift <b>force,</b> <b>cross-wind</b> stability, aeroacoustics etc. An optimal solution of such a problem is called the Pareto optimal front and can help the designers to visualize the trade-offs between different objectives and select an compromise design. In this paper we use an example of optimization of aerodynamic properties of the front of a generic high-speed train to demonstrate an efficient multi-objective optimization procedure. Two object functions are chosen and the response surfaces are produced as a result of Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations (RANS) using simple two-equation turbulence model. The Pareto optimal front is obtained using an evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II). The present work shows that our approach is very efficient in terms of optimization time and computational requirements. Instead of large number of CFD simulations (several hundreds) required in traditional gradient-based search algorithms only small number of CFD simulations were required to find an optimal design of the front of the high-speed train...|$|R
40|$|This report deals {{first with}} the {{fundamental}} data required for the investigation. These are chiefly the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on an airplane in a flat spin. It is shown that these forces and moments depend principally on the angle of attack and on the rotation about the path axis, and can therefore either be measured in a wind tunnel or calculated from wind-tunnel measurements of lift, drag and moment about {{the leading edge of}} the wing of an airplane model at rest. The lift, drag and moments about the span axis are so greatly altered by the rapid rotation in a flat spin, that they can no longer be regarded as independent of rotation. No substantial change in the angles of attack and glide occurring in a flat spin is involved. The <b>cross-wind</b> <b>force,</b> as compared with the lift and drag, can be disregarded in a flat spin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aerodynamic {{tests on}} {{cylinder}} in cross-flow are often {{carried out in}} a nominally-symmetric configuration (e. g. symmetric cylinders with zero angle-of-attack). In such a condi-tion, the pressure field and the fluid-induced forces acting on the cylinder are expected to ful-fill some statistical symmetry condition, as it was experimentally observed by several researchers. In particular, {{it was noted that}} the <b>cross-wind</b> <b>force</b> and the torsional moment tend to have zero mean value and to be substantially uncorrelated with respect to the along-wind force. Small (but non-null) correlation or coherence values are often reported and {{it is not clear whether}} or not they should be treated as experimental imperfections or they are rather the trace of some physical phenomenon. With the objective of clarifying the mentioned problem, the present paper introduces the concept of statistically-symmetric random process presenting a definition in which the symmetry constraint is imposed on the characteristic functional. Consequent conditions on the statistical moments and on the covariance eigen-functions are derived accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of tests conducted at Stanford University of a 3 -foot model propeller at four pitch settings and at 0 degree, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, and 30 degrees yaw. In addition to the usual propeller coefficients, cross-wind and vertical forces and yawing, pitching, and rolling moments were determined about axes having their origin at the intersection of the blade axis and the axis of rotation. The tests showed that the maximum efficiency was reduced only slightly for angles of yaw up to 10 degrees but that at 30 degrees yaw the loss in efficiency was about 10 percent. In all cases the <b>cross-wind</b> <b>force</b> was found to be greater than the cross-wind component of the axial thrust. With a yawed propeller an appreciable thrust was found for v/nd for zero thrust at zero yaw. Yawing a propeller was found to induce a pitching moment that increased in magnitude with yaw...|$|E

The object of the tests was to investigate the characteristics of sections suitable for streamline wire which normally has an elliptic section with a fineness ratio of 4. 0; also to learn whether a reduction in fineness ratio would result in improvement; also to determine the pressure distribution on the model of fineness ratio of 4. Four elliptic cylinders with fineness ratios of 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5, and 4. 0 were made and then tested in the 8 by 8 wind tunnel; first, for <b>cross-wind</b> <b>force,</b> drag, and yawing moment at 30 miles an hour and various angles of yaw; next for drag 0 degree pitch and 0 degree yaw and various wind speeds; then for end effect on the smallest and largest models; and lastly for pressure distribution over the surface of the largest model at 0 degree pitch and 0 degree yaw and various wind speeds.

Although airplanes are generally designed so that the propeller nsiz lies approximately in the direction of normal steady flight, the condition of yaw is found during such maneuvers as curved flight and in flight at high angle of attack. These maneuvers are usually of short durntion and, while the effect of yaw- from these causes may be, in apeciticoases, of interest, it is possibly of no great consequence. If, however, propellers are to be yawed in the steady-flight condition, the effects of yaw mny be important. Such a condition would arise in the case that a wing engine is placed, for struo-tuml or other reasons, with its axis at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the plane. Air propellers in yaw {{have been the subject of}} both theoretical and experimental invcatigation (references 1 to 6) but further information concerning the quanti-tative effect of 6 malIangles of yam upon thrust, power, <b>cross-wind</b> <b>force,</b> and efficiency seemed desirable and therefore the present study ma undertaken. While the study was made with the propeller axis in the hori-zontal plane and the angle between the propeller axis and the wind direction is thus called an angle of yaw, the results may be applied as well to angles of pitch Bincesuch body interference as was present would have been the s~me in either case.
