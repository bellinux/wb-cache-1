5|$|Besides the ellipse {{with the}} centre at the focus, Newton also applied Proposition 6 to the {{hyperbola}} (Proposition 12), and the parabola (Proposition 13). Also, to the ellipse with {{the centre of}} force at {{the centre of the}} ellipse (Proposition 10), to the equiangular spiral (Proposition 9), and to the <b>circle,</b> <b>with</b> the centre of force not coinciding with the centre, and even on the circumference (Proposition 7).|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{symbol for}} Venus {{is the same}} as that used in biology for the female sex: a <b>circle</b> <b>with</b> a small cross beneath. The Venus symbol also {{represents}} femininity, and in Western alchemy stood for the metal copper. Polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity, and the symbol for Venus has sometimes been understood to stand for the mirror of the goddess.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, {{he married}} Alison Moir {{and they had}} one son, Douglas in 1900, {{who went on to}} play {{first-class}} and Test cricket for Surrey and England. Eventually, Douglas became a controversial England captain, introducing a form of hostile bowling known as Bodyline. The family lived in a wealthy area of Bombay and were well known in its social and sporting <b>circle.</b> <b>With</b> Douglas at Public School, Jardine and his wife returned to England in 1916. He took an interest in the Surrey team, becoming a member and later a vice-president. His wife died in 1936 while Jardine died in South Kensington on 16 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{upgrades}} {{were made}} to the portion of U.S. Route 202 concurrent with Route 23. This portion of road, which was originally a four-lane undivided road, saw an upgrade to a six-lane freeway south of the Alps Road interchange and to a six-lane surface road north of there. Construction on these improvements was completed in 1986. There were also plans to replace the Flemington <b>Circle</b> <b>with</b> an interchange as part of a project that would have also built a limited-access bypass of Flemington for Route 31; however, this plan was never realized.|$|E
5|$|Lemoine's {{system of}} constructions, the Géométrographie, {{attempted}} {{to create a}} methodological system by which constructions could be judged. This system enabled a more direct process for simplifying existing constructions. In his description, he listed five main operations: placing a compass's end on a given point, placing it on a given line, drawing a <b>circle</b> <b>with</b> the compass placed upon the aforementioned point or line, placing a straightedge on a given line, and extending the line with the straightedge.|$|E

5|$|NY118 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern alignment. Instead, NY118 headed northeastward from its current southern terminus on modern NY100 and US202 to a terminus at NY22 in Croton Falls while all of what is now NY118 was part of NY100. At the time, NY100 continued north along Baldwin Place Road and Myrtle Avenue to meet then-US6 near Mahopac Falls. In June 1934, the portion of NY118 between Somers and Croton Falls became concurrent to US202, a new interstate route extending from Delaware to Maine. The alignments of NY100 and NY118 north of New Croton Reservoir were flipped , placing NY118 on its modern alignment. NY118 initially continued north to NY6N over NY100's original alignment; however, this extension was eliminated in the mid-1940s. With the flip, NY118 terminated at a junction with NY129 in Croton Lake, while the latter extended to a traffic <b>circle</b> <b>with</b> NY100 in the hamlet of Pines Bridge. This alignment remained until , when the route was extended over the easternmost piece of NY129 to end at the traffic <b>circle</b> <b>with</b> NY100. The traffic circle in Pines Bridge was removed between 1988 and 1991 and replaced with a three-way intersection between the two routes.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher's {{original}} helmet sported the colours of the German {{flag and}} his sponsor's decals. On {{the top was}} a blue <b>circle</b> <b>with</b> white astroids. When Jos Verstappen was his teammate, Schumacher added four red diagonal strokes over the visor to differentiate his helmet from his teammate. After Schumacher joined Ferrari a prancing horse was added on the back. From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher changed the upper blue colour {{and some of the}} white areas to red. Since 2004, the helmet sported a white diagonal line with a white vertical line in the zone of the German Flag colours (originally to accommodate sponsor AMD), but then these lines remained in the Suzuka 2006 design.|$|E
5|$|South of here, the Route 413 {{continues}} as a divided highway with one lane {{in each direction}} passing through an area of commercial businesses. The road comes to another oblong traffic <b>circle,</b> <b>with</b> intersections at Oakland Avenue, Washington Avenue, and Lincoln Avenue. One house and two businesses are located along {{the eastern edge of}} the circle. South of this circle, Route 413 ends at a complex intersection with US130 (on which County Route 543 runs concurrently), Taylor Avenue, Salem Road, and Mott Avenue.|$|E

Crossing into Bergen County, Broad Avenue carries US 1/9 through Fairview and Ridgefield before heading into Palisades Park. Here, the two routes join US 46, and the combined road heads north into Fort Lee. US 1/9/46 come to an interchange with I-95, US 9W, and Route 4, where it joins I-95 to head east to the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River. At this point, US 46 ends and I-95 and US 1/9 continue into Manhattan, New York City on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway.|$|E
5|$|The White House, {{originally}} {{dating back}} to 1750, is timber framed and was extended in 1830 {{and again in the}} 1960s. The exterior is covered in hung slates, which caused extensive damage to the original frame which required extensive repairs in 1994. The 1797 chimneys are pointed in shape, to stop birds nesting and draw smoke up from the fire. The lawn {{in front of the building}} was the house's original turning <b>circle,</b> <b>with</b> the road once being a thoroughfare from Chingford to Waltham Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} incorporated {{many modern}} features, such as sound-proofing and under-seat heating, {{and it was}} also the first cinema in Britain to make use of concealed neon lighting. It had a seating capacity of 1,400 in the stalls and 600 in the <b>circle,</b> <b>with</b> a further 146 seats in the café area. When built, the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade, but this was removed when the A56 was widened. During the Second World War the building was used for concerts, including one given by a young Julie Andrews. It also played host to the Hallé Orchestra after the orchestra's own home, the Free Trade Hall, was bombed and severely damaged during the Manchester Blitz of 1940.|$|E

5|$|The route was {{originally}} designated as Route S39 in 1941, a spur of Route 39 (present-day US206) {{that was to}} provide improved access to Fort Dix during World War II. In 1953, Route S39 became Route 68 and it was legislated to extend south of Fort Dix to the Four Mile <b>Circle</b> <b>with</b> Route 70 and Route 72. A freeway for Route 68 was proposed to run between a planned Route 38 freeway and the Four Mile Circle in 1960; however, it was never built.|$|E
5|$|The same {{algebraic}} equations can {{be derived}} {{in the context of}} Lie sphere geometry. That geometry represents circles, lines and points in a unified way, as a five-dimensional vector X = (v, c'x, c'y, w, sr), where c = (c'x, c'y) is the center of the circle, and r is its (non-negative) radius. If r is not zero, the sign s may be positive or negative; for visualization, s represents the orientation of the <b>circle,</b> <b>with</b> counterclockwise circles having a positive s and clockwise circles having a negative s. The parameter w is zero for a straight line, and one otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{revolution}} around Neptune {{has become}} a nearly perfect <b>circle</b> <b>with</b> an eccentricity of almost zero. Viscoelastic damping from tides alone is not thought {{to be capable of}} circularizing Triton's orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role. Tidal interactions also cause Triton's orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon's is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit. This will result in either a collision with Neptune's atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a ring system similar to that found around Saturn.|$|E

5|$|A short {{distance}} later, the two routes enter Manchester Township in Ocean County and continue east through a tract of the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest within the Pine Barrens {{as well as}} a corner of the Fort Dix Military Reservation. The road eventually reaches the community of Whiting, where it passes commercial development at the intersection with CR 539. Here, CR 530 turns south to follow CR 539 and Route 70 continues northeast back into the Pine Barrens. The road turns more to the north-northeast before heading east into Lakehurst to the south of the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. In Lakehurst, Route 70 comes to a traffic <b>circle</b> <b>with</b> CR 4 and CR 12 before running through residential and commercial areas of the town. It intersects with the southern terminus of CR 547, where it widens into a four-lane divided highway. From here, the route crosses over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary railroad line before coming to the Lakehurst Circle, where it intersects the western terminus of Route 37.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Newfoundland and Labrador, each {{province}} and territory bears {{at least some}} elements from its coat of arms upon its flag. The flags of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island are banners of the provincial arms, while Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon each have the shield of the local coat of arms on their flags, with other design elements. The flag of Nunavut uses some elements from its coat of arms along with other symbols and colours. The shield of the arms of each province, on a blue background and circled with ten gold maple leaves, the whole surmounted by a crown, forms the main element of {{the flag of the}} Lieutenant-Governor of that province.
