25|$|An ETF {{combines}} the valuation feature of {{a mutual fund}} or unit investment trust, which can be bought or sold {{at the end of}} each trading day for its net asset value, with the tradability feature of a <b>closed-end</b> <b>fund,</b> which trades throughout the trading day at prices that may be more or less than its net asset value. Closed-end funds are not considered to be ETFs, even though they are funds and are traded on an exchange. ETFs have been available in the US since 1993 and in Europe since 1999. ETFs traditionally have been index funds, but in 2008 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began to authorize the creation of actively managed ETFs.|$|E

40|$|There are {{fundamental}} differences between assets held by closed and open-end funds. Past {{research indicates that}} <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> are less liquid than open-end funds. For example, {{a larger percentage of}} <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> hold less liquid international securities. This paper surveys the existing evidence of the impact of illiquid assets on the prices of open and <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds.</b> Specifically, it surveys existing literature on whether the price discount typically observed on <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> is the expected result given the inescapable costs associated with managing relatively illiquid assets in <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds.</b> This paper synthesizes the various observations into one coherent theme: illiquid assets appear to be a significant source of the differences in the behavior we observe between open and <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds.</b> For a broader audience, this sheds light on valuation issues related to illiquid assets by looking at the case study of <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{a natural}} {{experiment}} in the Indian mutual funds sector that created a 22 month period in which <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> were allowed to charge an arguably shrouded amortized fee whereas open-end funds were forced to charge standard entry loads. We find that allowing <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> to charge the shrouded type of fee led to a proliferation of <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> in the market; 45 new <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> were started over this 22 month period collecting 9. 1 billion $U. S, whereas only two <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> were started in the 66 months prior to this period collecting. 42 billion $U. S., and no <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> were started in the 20 months after this period. We argue that other theoretical determinants of the closed versus open ended organizational form did not change discretely around the natural experiment and thus are unlikely to explain the sudden emergence and disappearance of <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds.</b> We find <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> did not perform better in terms of raw or risk-adjusted returns. If all the investors in <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> during this period had invested in the lower fee open fund variety instead they would have paid 4. 25 percent less in fees over this 22 month period, equal to approximately 500 million dollars in extra fees. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the proposition that}} fluctuations in discounts of <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> are driven by changes in individual investor sentiment. The theory implies that discounts on various funds move together, that new funds get started when seasoned funds sell at a premium or a small discount, and that discounts are correlated with prices of other securities affected by the same investor sentiment. The evidence supports these predictions. In particular, the authors find that both <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> and small stocks tend to be held by individual investors, and that the discounts on <b>closed-end</b> <b>funds</b> narrow when small stocks do well.

5000|$|A <b>closed-end</b> <b>fund</b> (CEF) or {{closed-ended fund}} is a {{collective}} investment model based on issuing a fixed {{number of shares}} which are not redeemable from the fund. [...] Unlike open-end funds, new shares in a <b>closed-end</b> <b>fund</b> are not created by managers to meet demand from investors. Instead, the shares can be purchased and sold only in the market. This is the original design of the mutual fund which predates open-end mutual funds but offers the same actively managed pooled investments.
