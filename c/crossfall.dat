In most cases this results in it being too easy – certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity – for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway – an annulus around the central island – is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of carriageway by a combination of slightly raised surface, adverse <b>crossfall,</b> contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of least resistance being more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} was to conduct a before-and-after comparison of accident statistics to determine the effectiveness of compensatory measures related to geometric design - particularly those visible in a site plan - at points where the actual values were over or under the geometric design limits. The speed in a curve {{proved to be a}} decisive design parameter. It may be affected by the following measures: Improving the skid quality makes it possible to handle curves at higher speeds with better dynamics of vehicle movement. At radii of up to approx. 200 m on the other hand, greater <b>crossfalls</b> exert are scarcely significant in terms of the dynamics. Increasing the radii is effective only if these increases are considerable. Emphasizing the surfaces which are at right angles to the direction of travel, e. g. greater <b>crossfalls</b> with markers or destination signs and clear overall perception, results in driver acceptance of a greater difference in speed before the curve. To decrease the speed in the approach area to the curve, the traffic lanes are not to be too wide. Incorporating counter-curves ahead of sharp curves makes it possible for the sharp curves to have larger radii, better radii sequences and improved visibility. The radii sizes should be coordinated with each other. The study shows that measures taken in the approach area to the curve should be expected to exert the greatest effects. (orig.)

5000|$|Road {{slipperiness}} {{can contribute}} to car accidents. In 1997, over 53,000 accidents were caused by slippery roads in the United Kingdom out of an estimated 4,000,000 accidents (or approximately 1.3 per cent) [...] A small change in road slipperiness can have a drastic effect on surface friction: decreasing the coefficient of friction from 0.45 to 0.35, equivalent to adding a dusting of wet snow, increased the accident rate by almost 1000%. As such, road agencies {{have a number of}} approaches to decreasing road slipperiness. Most roads are designed with a convex camber to provide sufficient drainage, thereby allowing surface water to drain out of the road. Trouble sections include entrances and exits of banked outercurves, where the cross slope is close to zero. Unless these sections have a longitudinal grade of at least 0.4-0.5%, the drainage gradient (resultant to <b>crossfall</b> and longitudinal grade) will be lower than 0.5% so water will not run off the road surface. Storm drains may be installed at regular intervals and modern paving materials are designed to provide high friction in most conditions. Permeable paving allows water to soak through the paving material, reducing slipperiness in very adverse conditions.|$|E

40|$|With an {{increasing}} number of transport operators seeking permits to operate nonstandard or purpose-built vehicle types, information is required to assist road authorities to determine which vehicle types could operate on the road network without compromising the safety of other road users. A project was created by ARRB TR to develop guidelines for determining route access for heavy vehicles. This project was developed in conjunction with the state road authorities, the National Road Transport Commission and the transport industry to obtain an understanding of the road space requirements for a range of common vehicle types. This project {{is the subject of this}} thesis. Two series of field experiments were conducted with six common heavy vehicle types on public roads west of Parkes NSW. Information collected during these full-scale experiments was used to increase the knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of these vehicles and to develop model route access guidelines. Data obtained from these field experiments also provided information to validate computer models and simulation outputs. This thesis showed that: 1) There was experimental evidence to demonstrate that vehicle lateral movement is excited by differences in vehicle wheelpath profiles (point-by-point pavement <b>crossfall),</b> which make a contribution to trailing fidelity (swept width), offtracking and swept path; 2) Vehicle type and speed are prime influences on the lateral movement of the rear trailer and therefore an important input into the model route access guidelines. Notwithstanding the practical and safety implications of applying different speed limits for various vehicle types, speed is a prime contributor to vehicle lateral movement and should be considered when determining route access; 3) Limited lateral position information suggested that one driver of two vehicle types position the vehicles so that the tyres on the rear trailer track on the sealed pavement and not on the pavement shoulder; 4) Based on a statistical analysis of the data obtained from the small sample which only considered the average <b>crossfall</b> of each test section the relative importance of the key parameters was (highest to lowest), IRI, vehicle speed and vehicle type. It was shown that good estimates of lateral movement can be obtained using a double integration technique of the measured lateral acceleration, without applying compensation for the trailer roll or the pavement <b>crossfall.</b> It is recommended that route access guidelines be developed using the lateral performance of a larger sample of vehicles in each class of heavy vehicles operating over a larger range of road types. The route access guidelines should contain a matrix of information on vehicle type/length, pavement condition roughness/profile and lane width. This would provide operators and regulators with a desk-top assessment tool for determining route access...|$|E

40|$|Researches throat {{the world}} has shown that two-way rural {{highways}} are the most dangerous among the other types of roads. It was identified that the most notable cause for immerging fatal and other crashes are unbalanced and excessive speeds, which occur mainly {{in the region of}} the curve. Every combination of horizontal curves has its own unique distribution of real driving speed, which leads in a verity of resulting dynamics effects. To be able to provide adequate safety, road pavement structure must be able to provide the appropriate skid resistance. In the case when friction coefficient is lower than demanded value, dangerous road conditions occur. In the following paper three methods for predicting road safety are presented: models by Lamm, Juvanc and IHSDM. The algorithms of the models were used to make an automated computer program, which is able to calculate the resulting speed profile and the profile of dynamic parameters. Model proposed by Juvanc was further used to show the link between the driving dynamics characteristic (safety measure) and the parameters of road axis.

40|$|There is {{a recent}} trend of {{building}} roundabouts on high-speed roads, often with significant heavy vehicle traffic. With the increased presence of trucks on roundabouts, the issue of rollover has become a concern. Geometric features that allow excessive speed on the approach and entry have been connected to rollover, as well as sudden changes in <b>crossfall</b> and radius. However, {{the effect on the}} rollover threshold of changing the roundabout 2 ̆ 7 s circulatory superelevation is not fully understood. The impact of aggressive driving behaviors, as displayed by high driver speed far from the roundabout, as well as errors that are manifested by the driver maintaining excessive speed in close proximity to the roundabout, should also be further examined and quantified. This thesis describes a rollover model more generalized than those previously used for design considerations. It accounts for the intricacies of semi-trailers and other heavy vehicles by incorporating both complex trailer paths that do not conform to the road alignment and the resulting vehicle tilt. The proposed model is applied in the aforementioned scenarios after introducing delta v - the difference between the critical rollover speed determined from the model and the actual speed. In the comparison of inward vs. outward circulatory superelevation, the study revealed that the 2...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a profile-based ride measure, denoted Heavy Articulated Truck Index (HATI) to highlight road sections providing a poor ride to occupants of heavy articulated trucks. The paper also {{describes the}} validation of HATI and the assessment of its effectiveness in highlighting poor sections in different regions in comparison with other ride measures. The study results showed that, for the sections tested, HATI is better than the other measures in highlighting sections with characteristics that excite vertical, lateral, longitudinal and rotational responses of an articulated heavy vehicle body. Sections with HATI values greater than the threshold have high contents of long wavelength roughness (5 - 20 m) that are typically found in expansive soil areas. These surface irregularities are responsible for the vertical and longitudinal vibrations resulting from exciting body bounce and pitch vibration modes of the vehicle body. Most of these sections are also associated with either high roughness variation between the two wheel paths or high variation in transverse <b>crossfall,</b> which are responsible for inducing translational and rotational lateral vibrations. These findings help asset managers better understand the characteristics of pavement surface roughness and road geometry elements that affect a truck driver's perception of pavement rideability and identify candidate sections for improvements...|$|E
40|$|Efficient and well-maintained road {{systems are}} {{necessary}} for the economic well being of any industrialized country. Maintenance and rehabilitation of existing roads have taken priority over new construction in recent years, thus making information {{about the condition of}} road surfaces extremely important. Several methods of gathering this information have been developed worldwide; one of them is Laser Road Surface Tester (Laser RST), which was developed in Sweden in 1981. The Laser RST is a laser-based, computer-automated, non-contact road profilometer system with the ability to collect and simultaneously process data about the road surface. Variables measured include rut depth, unevenness, cracking, megatexture, rough macrotexture, fine macrotexture, <b>crossfall,</b> curves, and elapsed distance. Subjective evaluations are also supported, if desired. Eleven laser rangefinders (LRFs), mounted {{on the front of the}} Laser RST van, are the primary components of the data collection system. They scan the road with high-speed, high-resolution distance sampling. The signals from the lasers are sent through signal processing cards (SPCs) and then to a computer inside the van for final processing. Data is stored on floppy disk and printed by an on-board printer. The Laser RST is an extremely complex system but it is also a modular one, making troubleshooting and repair relatively easy, inexpensive, and fast. This paper discusses the various modules available. Variables measured are defined and measurement algorithms detailed. The Laser RST system can be customized to meet specific user requirements quickly and easily...|$|E

The software 8 makes an analysis of a road database containing six parameters of infrastructure (radius of 9 curvature, <b>crossfall,</b> longitudinal slope, unevenness, skid resistance and macrotexture) and 10 indicates warning messages when dangerous configurations are detected.

40|$|Traffic safety can be ensured {{only with}} a {{comprehensive}} understanding of the system driver - vehicle - road environment. Accidents on roads happen due to the driver's actions, errors and problems with the vehicles or happen on account of adverse events in the driving environment. A part of the road safety can certainly {{be attributed to the}} pavement surface and its own performance. Particularly important contributing properties are skid resistance and macrotexture. The aim of the work for this thesis was to determine the influence of <b>crossfall</b> and slope on the results of skid resistance measurements. This impact can be notable and may significantly affect the calculation of the characteristic skid resistance values – the limit, minimal and acceptance values - which are used in the assessement of pavement performance of roads in Slovenia. The results of the skid resistance measurements on motorways in 2008, performed with the SCRIMTEX device, served as a basis of the work. These results were compared with the pavement geometric data; with age of asphalt mixtures, built-in the pavement surface; and with traffic load of concerned road sections. A high number of different combinations of influence on skid resistance for the motorway' pavements were examined. Among them some indicate a weak correlation between skid resistance/influential parameter, and only few indicate a moderate correlation. For vast majority the relationship was found to be insignificant. As such, the results don't represent a momentum strong enough to change or adapt the above-mentioned skid resistance characteristic values...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWalking and cycling {{are green}} {{transport}} modes {{which should be}} given more attention in future. The quality of footways is not always very good. In most cities, road managers have difficulties in estimating the quality level of their footway network. Maintenance planning and budgeting are mostly based on ad hoc repairs. The problem {{is the lack of}} a complete evaluation method. After a market survey for different types of measurement equipment, we have combined some ideas to develop an evaluation method for footways. Our approach is based on a network analysis by the manager, with the tool described in this article. Additional information (complaints/defects) is obtained from users, through an application on their smartphones or tablets. The basic idea is that a main inspection is done by the manager at least once a year. An operator travels on a footway with a wheelchair, which is the most “sensitive” type of footway user. This wheelchair is equipped with sensors (of a smartphone) and a skid resistance measuring device. Three parameters (comfort/longitudinal unevenness in the direction of travel, gradient in the direction of travel, and <b>crossfall)</b> can be measured in one run, and a skid resistance measurement is made in each section of the network. In total we will thus have four technical indicators and the feedback from the user. All this information will help the road manager to maintain his footway network. We are open to refine this kind of application in consultation with the wheelchair community, using their feedback on the quality of footways. A similar exercise could be done for cycle tracks. The article will explain the idea behind the method suggested for the evaluation of footways at the network level...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to global climate change, Transport Canada has initiated a Climate Change Adaptation Study {{in order to}} provide an opportunity to improve knowledge of the impacts of climate change on transportation infrastructure in Northern Canada. In particular, this research aims to identify ways to mitigate the impacts of climate change on pavement surface friction characteristics at a project specific location: Runway 07 - 25 of Kuujjuaq Airport in Nunavik, Québec. This site was chosen because it is a complex site with highly variable soil conditions. Runway 07 - 25 is one of the busier runways in Nunavik and its traffic includes jet airplanes. The runway is also exposed to extensive winter maintenance activities. In addition, Runway 07 - 25 is considered a short runway and has a <b>crossfall</b> instead of crown for surface drainage. Increasing ambient temperatures have already led to a deeper active layer over permafrost, which affects overall runway performance. Climate change is especially evident in the winter months with large temperature fluctuations resulting in increased freeze thaw cycles. The site is, therefore, a good location to study solutions to climate change impacts, which are expected to affect other Canadian airports in the future. Kuujjuaq Runway 07 - 25 is of paramount importance to the community of Kuujjuaq, other communities in Nunavik, and communities north of Nunavik. It serves as a regional hub between the south, Nunavik’s communities and Iqaluit to the north, and provides an essential link for emergency evacuations, personal and business travel, as well as the transportation of basic food items. Globally, amongst the groups, the most affected by the impacts of climate change are the Inuit communities in Nunavik. Scientists and residents of these communities are witnessing growing evidence of the impacts of accelerated warming in this region, which is expected to continue into the future. In this research, runway texture and friction are assessed on Runway 07 - 25, as increased winter maintenance activities resulting from climate change are thought to be reducing surface friction. Existing friction and texture measurement data from previous years, current laboratory testing results on samples of the existing asphalt concrete mix as well as current surface texture and friction measurement data from the runway have been analysed to study trends and characterize the runway in terms of its frictional resistance. Friction improving technologies/products are discussed for maintenance and future rehabilitation options...|$|E
