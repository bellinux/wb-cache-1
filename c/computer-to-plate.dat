50|$|The {{technique}} of stochastic screening, which has existed since the seventies, {{has had a}} revival in recent times thanks to increased use of <b>computer-to-plate</b> (CTP) techniques. In previous techniques, computer to film, during the exposure {{there could be a}} drastic variation in the quality of the plate. It was a very delicate and difficult procedure that was not much used. Today, with CTP during the creation of the plate you just need to check a few parameters on the density and tonal correction curve. When you make a plate with stochastic screening you must use a tone correction curve, this curve allows one to align the tone reproduction of an FM screen to that of an industry standard.Given the same final presswork tone value, an FM screen utilizes more halftone dots than an AM/XM screen. The result is that more light is filtered by the ink and less light simply reflects off the surface of the substrate. The result is that FM screens exhibit a greater color gamut than conventional AM/XM halftone screen frequencies.The creation of a plate with stochastic screening is done the same way as is done with an AM/XM screen. A tone reproduction compensation curve is typically applied to align the stochastic screening to conventional AM/FM tone reproductions targets (e.g. ISO 12647-2).|$|E

40|$|Reproductions of {{original}} {{works of art}} have {{played a major role}} in the existence and growth of the graphic arts over the centuries. The one concept that has not changed over time is the difficulty in reproducing art that is true to the original. Using a high-end scanning system is one known method that is able to achieve high quality reproductions. However, it has several limitations. The purpose of this research was to verify that a digital camera system combined with color separation software can be used as an alternative technique to create facsimile reproductions of art.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is to {{investigate}} a novel thermal patterning methodology involving near-infrared (NIR) 830 nm laser irradiation, {{by taking advantage of}} <b>computer-to-plate</b> imaging processes employed in the graphic arts industry and applying that methodology to functionalized derivatives of polythiophene and polyfluorene. Poly(3 -(2 -(2 -tetrahydropyranyloxy) ethyl) thiophene) (PTHPET) was employed as the primary material in this proof-of-concept study, which involved the interaction of NIR laser light with a NIR absorbing dye doped in a pi-conjugated polymer film. Thermal imaging of PTHPET using 830 nm laser irradiation was based on the observation that thermolytic cleavage and removal of the bulky THP group can be accomplished in the absence of acid. Exposure of NIR dye-doped polymer films to a NIR laser liberated the THP group, resulting in an insoluble, negative-tone pattern that was characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy, TGA, variable temperature FT-IR and surface profilometry. PTHPET was patterned with 10 micron resolution. A second method for obtaining pi-conjugated polymer patterns using NIR laser light was demonstrated, wherein, following deposition of a precursor pi-conjugated polymer layer, a second, non-conjugated polymer film was deposited that contained the NIR absorbing dye. The top layer served as a sacrificial light-to-heat conversion layer that absorbed the laser energy and heated the underlying pi-conjugated polymer film. This method of patterning was demonstrated using a THP-functionalized polyfluorene-co-thiophene copolymer, which was found to retain its photoluminescent properties, ~ 86 % of the pristine quantum yield, and could be patterned with < 20 micron resolution.

40|$|<b>Computer-to-Plate</b> (CTP) {{technology}} {{has been used for}} newspaper and book production and been proved successful by several print houses. However these publications are mostly printed with less color and advertisments. Therefore, these fit into the niche market of CTP technolo gy. What about magazine production? Since magazine production normally requires more color, more advertisements, higher quality, can we still make profits from this new idea without a resulting loss of quality? State-of-the-art CTP technology is capable of producing high quality images, and large format. The time savings and labor savings are the biggest advantages. In addition to this, side profits like environmental improvement may bring the graphic arts industry a new face. However, instant change of workflow for magazine production is not possible. Meantime, advertising suppliers are still providing films for combining with editorial pages. The process of translating analog format to digital format is the biggest drawback. This translation step will be continued until the change over of production workflow, which will involve advertising suppliers providing digital file instead of films. For this purpose, lots of efforts have been made through the development of Digital Distribution of Advertising for Publications (DDAP), a graphic arts industry initiative whereby public domain accredited standards for the open process integration inherent to the structure of developing and delivering digital advertising material For example, the file standard for data compression and data transfer has been specified.

40|$|In {{the history}} of {{technological}} development, {{it is usually the}} case that the technology is available before mankind understands the full potential of its use. Thus {{it should come as no}} surprise that CTP (Computer-to Plate) technology is currently waiting for its advantages to be exploited by the graphic arts 2 ̆ 7 market. This was evidenced by the heavy saturation of platesetters presented at DRUPA 1995 (the largest printing trade show in the world), which demonstrated that CTP is no longer a research and development experiment but a marketplace reality and the topic of considerable discussion. Surprisingly, the response of the printing industry to this new age of digital prepress which CTP systems were designed to facilitate has been rather restrained. Although most printers agree that digital formatting and output are the way of the future; printers are still uneasy at the prospect of investing in CTP systems. This reluctance is certainly understandable, since anyone considering buying a platesetter (<b>computer-to-plate</b> system) will potentially have to reorganize and update their front end computer system and its accompanying workflow. To compound the issue, buyers need a pay back period three years or less to recoup their investment, due to the accelerated rate of computer obsolescence. And, as if this isn 2 ̆ 7 t enough to think about, probably the biggest deterrent is coming from the manufacturers themselves. As platesetters begin to carve out market share from conventional imagesetter territory, the manufacturers have now modified the existing technology to work with thermal plates while increasing their efforts to produce Direct-to Press technology. In such a climate of change, most printers would prefer to invest in a system that can prove its profitability along with its potential to upgrade rather than a system destined to be marked as a piece of transitional technology. In an effort to understand and evaluate the aforementioned problems CTP systems are creating in the marketplace, this paper has analyzed a platesetter being used in pro duction to determine the viability of cost justification proposals developed by the CTP manufacturers in order to maximize profits. Several printing companies, who specialize in different market segments, have been interviewed in the data collection process. A comparison of these organizations has demonstrated under which circumstances the investment in a CTP system is justified and which environmental factors have to be considered for an ROI calculation. Among the local participants is the Webster Division of Thomson Professional Publishing a parent company to five different publishing branches that specialize in legal publishing and book production. The Webster location has just recently installed its second CTP system. The other cooperating company is Canfield and Tack, of Rochester, New York a high quality commercial printing company that recently signed a letter of intent to purchase a CTP system. Additional interview sources will be industry consultants, printers, manufacturers and suppliers. By doing a comparison of the considerations upon which each system was evaluated by the different firms, conclusions may be drawn as to the future of CTP in the marketplace, and more significantly, where cost justification fits into this picture of fast moving technology. This thesis strives to secure the answers to three key issues: 1) Can cost justification, using the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s suggested model, provide potential buyers with enough infor mation to prove that CTP systems are a good capital investment; 2) Are the cost benefits achievable with a CTP system enough to warrant such a radical restructuring of work flow; and 3) Does the issue of equipment obsolescence and its economic impact have a determining factor in the decision to install such a system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} Near Infrared (NIR) initiated photopolymerization of multifunctional acrylic esters with NIR-LEDs emitting between 750 – 870 nm. These systems {{comprise a}} zwitterionic cyanine as sensitizer and an iodonium salt with distinct substitution pattern {{in both the}} cation and anion. An optically open window from the UV into the visible part allows embedding of functional materials covering particular this spectral range. Reactivity was studied with a synchronized photo-DSC comprising a self-designed hardware setup for data acquisition. 28 new iodonium salts ([A-I-B]+X-) were studied to show the influence of structural pattern on reactivity. [A-I-B]+X- possesses a different substitution pattern for the cation and the anion, respectively. Electron transfer of the excited state of the polymethine to the iodonium cation bearing different anions such as benzilate, lactate, NO 3 -, PF 6 -, SbF 6 -, p-CH 2 =CH-Ph-SO 3 -, p-C 12 H 15 -Ph-SO 3 -, CF 3 SO 3 -, C 4 F 9 SO 3 -, B(CN) 4 -, B(Ph) 4 -, B(PhF 5) 4 -, N(CN) 2 - or (SO 2 -CF 3) 2 N- results in initiating radicals. Although most of these anions {{do not participate in}} the redox mechanism, there exists a certain dependence between reactivity {{and the nature of the}} anion. Anions with low coordination behavior ((SO 2 -CF 3) 2 N-, B(Ph) 4 -,B(PhF 5) 4 -, B(CN) 4 -) result in acceptable reactivity. This may be explained by the conductivity of the salt in the acrylate monomers such as hexane- 1, 6 -diol diacrylate, tripropylene glycol diacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate and trimethylolpropane triacrylate being different. A high ion mobility leads connects always to a high conductivity. Thus, complete dissociation is necessary to obtain a reactive system. The solubility of the different iodonium salts covers several g/L up to well mixable systems (> 2000 g/L). A good solubility is not mandatory to obtain a high reactivity but it is desirable from a practical point of view. Particular the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion (N(SO 2 -CF 3) 2 -) results in giant solubilities depending on the iodonium cation. Such photoinitiating systems are interesting because they bleach at the excitation wavelength and open therefore the opportunity to cure coatings with large thickness; that is a length up to several millimeters (14 mm). In addition, NIR-exposure additionally results in formation of light-stable brownish photoproducts. This represents an interesting alternative compared to brownish pigments used in dental materials. These findings require to understand the mechanism of sensitizer decomposition in more detail applying exposure kinetics and a coupling of Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) with mass spectrometry (MS) to analyze the photoproducts formed. Data show unexpected cleavage of the polymethine chain at typical positions in case of the oxidized species. These were formed as a result of electron transfer between the excited state of the photosensitizer and the iodonium salt. UPLC-MS experiments additionally indicated a certain sensitivity of the system upon adding of acids and radicals generated by thermal decomposition of AIBN. Thus, treatment of the photoinitiator composition (sensitizer and iodonium salt) with either radical or proton forming agents led almost to the same products no matter the system was either exposed with NIR light or not. Futhermore, photo-initiated crosslinking of multifunctional acrylic esters in polymeric binders was investigated based on digital imaging using the <b>Computer-to-Plate</b> (CtP) technology applying laser exposure in the NIR at 830 nm. Iodonium salts derived from several borates and those with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion resulted in lithographic materials with high sensitivity being comparable with those used in industrial systems. Finally, iodonium salts comprising the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion exhibit a lower cytotoxicity compared to those with the tetraphenyl borate anion as determined by the MTT-test using CHO- 9 -cells...|$|E
