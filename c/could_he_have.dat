Singer auditioned {{a couple}} hundred young men and chose 14-year-old Renfro, saying of him, [...] "Brad was the brightest, the most intense and the most real. Not only <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> the intensity when we wanted, there was a hollowness that he could convey, {{and by the end}} of the picture he had to become this empty vessel." [...] Portraying a manipulative character temporarily influenced Renfro, who said that people around him were worried about his state of mind. Renfro said of his performance, [...] "It's a trip I have to take. People just kind of have to leave me alone when I'm doing it. It's my job."

500|$|On 16 December 1784, St. James's Chronicle stated Hawkins and Boswell {{were both}} writing biographies. However, Thomas Tyers {{published}} before them when his A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson, the first postmortem biographical work on Johnson {{but not a}} full-length biography, ran in the December 1784 issue of The Gentleman's Magazine. This did not deter Hawkins and by 21 December 1784, he began advertising his [...] "authentick" [...] life of Johnson. This provoked an anonymous articles in St. James's Chronicle started attacking Hawkins: [...] "It {{is evident from the}} Conduct of the late Dr. Johnson, that he designed Mr. Boswell for the sole Writer of his Life. Why else did he furnish him with such Materials for it as were withheld from every other Friend ... Little indeed did he suppose that a Person whom he had made one of his Executors would have instantly claimed the Office of his Biographer. Still less <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> imagined that this Self-Appointment would have been precipitately confirmed by the Booksellers." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> would <b>have</b> {{recalled}} the words if <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> said them, however, and I took them up quickly.|$|R
60|$|Some of {{the boys}} mocked Jim Leonard; but {{a good many of}} them thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done it if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> got into the eddy that there was over by the island.

6000|$|... "Mr. Foster!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} breathlessly, but Foster {{thought he was}} not surprised, and sitting on the fence took out a {{cigarette}} as calmly as <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> Graham's checks and must be careful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hark at the innocent!" [...] rejoined Lenoir, with a sneer. [...] "What <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> done? Patriots, friends, brothers, I ask you, what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush!' cried Sophy. 'Had it been so, <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> {{ridiculed}} Lucy? <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> flown out so against papa? No; that caricature undeceived me, and I am thankful. He treated us as cousins--no more--he {{would act}} {{in the same manner}} by any of the Miss O'Mores of Ballymakilty, nay, by Jane Northover herself. We did not allow for Irish manner.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What, with me! No; he was {{not there}} with me. I have never seen the man since I first left Granpere to come here.' And then George Voss began to think what might have {{happened}} had Adrian Urmand been at the hotel while he was there himself. After all, what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> said to Adrian Urmand? or what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> done to him? ...|$|E

"Certainly I {{think that}} I <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> exerted himself this morning, whereas I have advised {{him not to}} exert himself. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> given himself the same counsel, and would {{certainly}} live longer by obeying it than the reverse. As there is no difficulty in the matter, there need be no conceit on my part in saying that so far my advice might be of service to him." ...|$|R
5000|$|State Representative Jane H. Smith, a Republican from Bossier City, {{and herself}} a former {{superintendent}} in Bossier Parish, described Picard as [...] "a warrior and a fighter.

25|$|It is true {{that against}} the {{extremely}} fleet-footed Australian batsmen of his time, Attewell was fairly ineffective. Moreover, with bowlers such as Lohmann and J.T.

60|$|The last dance together! He {{sent his}} heart to her, all his heart--and the music helped him, and the rhythm; the very {{atmosphere}} of the room--rose-scented--helped him to make her understand. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> kissed her hair, so close were the heaped-up fair curls to his mouth; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> whispered to her, and nobody would hear: <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> told her something at any rate, of that love which had filled his heart since all time, not months or years since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> known her, but since all time filling every minute of his life. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> taught her what love meant, thrilled her heart with thoughts of might-have-been; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> roused sweet pity in her soul, love's gentle mother that {{has the power to}} give birth to Love.|$|R

6000|$|... "Because my predecessor, the American Maple White, {{actually}} made such an ascent. How otherwise <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> seen the monster which he sketched in his notebook?" ...|$|E
