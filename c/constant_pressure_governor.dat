40|$|We use {{computer}} simulations {{to study the}} cooling rate dependence of the stability and energetics of model glasses created at <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions and compare the results with glasses formed at constant volume conditions. To examine the stability, we determine {{the time it takes}} for a glass cooled and reheated at <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> to transform back into a liquid, t_trans, and calculate the stability ratio S = t_trans/τ_α, where τ_α is the equilibrium relaxation time of the liquid. We find that, for slow enough cooling rates, cooling and reheating at <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> results in a larger stability ratio S than for cooling and reheating at constant volume. We also compare the energetics of glasses obtained by cooling while maintaining <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> with those of glasses created by cooling from the same state point while maintaining constant volume. We find that cooling at <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> results in glasses with lower average potential energy and average inherent structure energy. We note that in model simulations of the vapor deposition process glasses are created under <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions, and thus they should be compared to glasses obtained by <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> cooling...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{effects of}} {{coronary}} capacitance on instantaneous pressure-flow (P/F) relationships {{were analyzed using}} a theoretical model of coronary flow during diastole that included capacitance. The magnitude of the discrepancy between actual intramural and instantaneously derived P/F relationships was predicted {{to be dependent on}} the ratio of two natural decay constants (central aortic decay constant/intrinsic coronary decay constant). The effects of coronary capacitance are eliminated using <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions. The instantaneous (dynamic) and <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> (static) P/F relationships were compared experimentally using a reservoir to provide <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> perfusion during prolonged diastoles in heart blocked dogs. In the presence of coronary tone, zero flow pressure intercepts (P) ̂ of 27. 1 ± 6. 6 and 11. 0 ± 3. 0 mm Hg were obtained under dynamic and <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions respectively, P < 0. 001. After maximal vasodilation,??s of 14. 2 ± 4. 5 mmHg and 10. 7 ± 2. 4 mmHg were obtained under dynamic and <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions, respectively, P = NS. Pzf derived under <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions were independent of the state of coronary vasomotor tone with a value about 11 mmHg. The slopes of the dynamic P/ F relationships tended to be greater than those derived from <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions. This may suggest an additional component of increasing coronary resistance during diastole that could not b...|$|R
