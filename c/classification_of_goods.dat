40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose several {{equivalent}} definitions of digital curves and hypersurfaces in arbitrary dimension. The definitions involve properties such as one-dimensionality of curves and (n − 1) dimensionality of hypersurfaces that make them discrete analogs of corresponding notions in topology. Thus this work {{appears to be the}} first one on digital manifolds where the definitions involve the notion of dimension. In particular, a digital hypersurface in nD is an (n− 1) -dimensional object, {{as it is in the}} case of continuous hypersurfaces. Relying on the obtained properties of digital hypersurfaces, we propose a uniform approach for studying good pairs defined by separations and obtain a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> pairs in arbitrary dimension...|$|R

40|$|Monoblock {{centrifugal}} pumps {{are employed in}} variety of critical engineering applications. Continuous monitoring of such machine component becomes essential {{in order to reduce}} the unnecessary break downs. At the outset, vibration based approaches are widely used to carry out the condition monitoring tasks. Particularly fuzzy logic, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks were employed for continuous monitoring and fault diagnosis. In the present study, the application of SVM algorithm in the field of fault diagnosis and condition monitoring is discussed. The continuous wavelet transforms were calculated for different families and at different levels. The computed transformation coefficients form the feature set for the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> and faulty conditions of the components of centrifugal pump. The <b>classification</b> accuracies <b>of</b> different continuous wavelet families at different levels were calculated and compared to find the best wavelet for the fault diagnosis of the monoblock centrifugal pump...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{say that}} a pair of topological spaces (X,Y) is good if for every A⫅X and every {{continuous}} f:A→Y there exists f̃:X→Y which extends f and is continuous at every point of A. We use this notion to characterize several classes of topological spaces, as hereditarily normal spaces, hereditarily collectionwise normal spaces, Q-spaces, and completely metrizable spaces. We also show that if X is metrizable and Y is locally compact then (X,Y) is good and we answer a question of Arhangel'skii's about weakly C-embedded subspaces. For separable metrizable spaces our <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> pairs is almost complete, e. g., if X is uncountable Polish then (X,Y) is good {{if and only if}} Y is Polish as well. We also show that if Y is Polish and X metrizable then f̃ can be chosen to be of Baire class 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies certain {{relations}} among vertex algebras, vertex Lie algebras and vertex Poisson algebras. In this paper, {{the notions of}} vertex Lie algebra (conformal algebra) and vertex Poisson algebra are revisited and certain general construction theorems of vertex Poisson algebras are given. A notion of filtered vertex algebra is formulated {{in terms of a}} notion <b>of</b> <b>good</b> filtration and it is proved that the associated graded vector space of a filtered vertex algebra is naturally a vertex Poisson algebra. For any vertex algebra V, a general construction and a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> filtrations are given. To each -graded vertex algebra V=∐_n∈V_(n) with V_(0) = 1, a canonical (good) filtration is associated and certain results about generating subspaces of certain types of V are also obtained. Furthermore, a notion of formal deformation of a vertex (Poisson) algebra is formulated and a formal deformation of vertex Poisson algebras associated with vertex Lie algebras is constructed.
