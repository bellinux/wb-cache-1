Never was there a more appreciative audience, of how it all began from Kit Harewood, the young sailor, having sent home a lion's skin from Africa, which had already served for tableaux of Androcles and of Una---how the boy element had insisted on fun, and the <b>child</b> <b>element</b> on fairies, and how Mrs. William Harewood had suggested Midsummer Night's Dream as the only combination of the three essentials, lion, fun, and fairy, and pronounced that education had progressed far enough for the representation to be 'understanded of the people,' at least by the 6th and 7th standards. On the whole, however, comprehension seemed to have been bounded by intense admiration of the little girl fairies, whom the old women appeared to have taken for angels, for one had declared that to hear little Miss Cherry and Miss Katie singing their hymns like the angels they was, was just like Heaven. She must have had an odd notion of 'Spotted snakes with double tongues.' Moreover, effect was added to the said hymns by Uncle Lance behind the scenes.|$|E

50|$|Within the UIA tree {{there is}} a root element that {{represents}} the current desktop and whose <b>child</b> <b>elements</b> represent application windows. Each of these <b>child</b> <b>elements</b> may contain elements representing pieces of UI such as menus, buttons, toolbars, and list boxes. These elements, in turn, can contain other elements, such as list items.|$|R

Such element content is {{specified}} as content particle in a variant of Backus-Naur form without terminal symbols and element names as non-terminal symbols. Element content consists of: ...|$|R

5000|$|SOAP fault: In case a SOAP node {{fails to}} process a SOAP message, it adds the fault {{information}} to the SOAP fault element. This element is contained within the SOAP body as a <b>child</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E
50|$|A simple example {{would be}} to {{consider}} an XML instance that contained references to a customer and an ordered product. Both the customer element and the product element could have a <b>child</b> <b>element</b> named id. References to the id element would therefore be ambiguous; placing them in different namespaces would remove the ambiguity.|$|E
50|$|W3C XML Schema cannot specify such a {{dependency}} {{between the}} content of an attribute and <b>child</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|R
50|$|XSL-FO's basic content markup {{is derived}} from CSS and its {{cascading}} rules. As such, many attributes in XSL-FO propagate into the <b>child</b> <b>elements</b> unless explicitly overridden.|$|R

5000|$|Content MathML {{focuses on}} the semantics, or meaning, of the {{expression}} rather than its layout. Central to Content MathML is the [...] element that represents function application. The function being applied is the first <b>child</b> <b>element</b> under , and its operands or parameters are the remaining child elements. Content MathML uses only a few attributes.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} {{visually}} representing hierarchy {{is through the}} Nested clusters. The Nested clusters represents hierarchical relationships by using layers of information. The <b>child</b> <b>element</b> is within the parent element, such as in a Venn diagram. This structure of representing hierarchy is most effective in representing simple relationships. For example, when directing someone to open a file on a computer desktop, one may first direct them towards the main folder, then the subfolders within the main folder. They will keep opening files within the folders until the designated file is located.|$|E
5000|$|ANY for specifying {{that the}} defined element allows any content, without restriction, i.e., {{that it may}} have any number (including none) and type of <b>children</b> <b>elements</b> (including text elements); ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] scheme {{introduces}} positional addressing of <b>child</b> <b>elements.</b> This {{is similar}} to a simple XPath address, but subsequent steps can only be numbers representing the position of a descendant relative to its branch on the tree.|$|R
30|$|The Relationship module {{allows for}} specifying {{relationships}}. Relationships {{are defined by}} using <link> elements. As relationships can be established among types, <forEach> <b>child</b> <b>elements</b> {{can be used to}} iterate on these type instances. More details about relationships are presented in Sect.  3.6.|$|R
5000|$|This block {{states that}} the element [...] "some_element" [...] must have an {{attribute}} named [...] "has_name". This attribute can only take true or false as values, {{and if it is}} true, the first <b>child</b> <b>element</b> of the element must be [...] "name", which stores text. If [...] "name" [...] {{did not need to be}} the first element, then the choice could be wrapped in an [...] "interleave" [...] element along with other elements. The order of the specification of attributes in RELAX NG has no meaning, so this block need not be the first block in the element definition.|$|E
5000|$|The format uses a Face-vertex {{polygon mesh}} layout. Each {{top-level}} [...] element specifies a unique id. The [...] element can also optionally specify a material. The entire mesh geometry {{is contained in}} a single mesh element. The mesh is defined using one [...] element and one or more [...] elements. The required [...] element lists all vertices {{that are used in}} this object. Each vertex is implicitly assigned a number in the order in which it was declared, starting at zero. The required <b>child</b> <b>element</b> [...] gives the position of the point in 3D space using the , [...] and [...] elements.After the vertex information, at least one [...] element must be included. Each volume encapsulates a closed volume of the object, Multiple volumes can be specified in a single object. Volumes may share vertices at interfaces but may not have any overlapping volume.Within each volume, the <b>child</b> <b>element</b> [...] is used to define triangles that tessellate the surface of the volume. Each [...] element will list three vertices from the set of indices of the previously defined vertices given in the [...] element. The indices of the three vertices of the triangles are specified using the , [...] and [...] elements. The order of the vertices must be according to the right-hand rule, such that vertices are listed in counter-clockwise order as viewed from the outside. Each triangle is implicitly assigned a number in the order in which it was declared, starting at zero.|$|E
5000|$|To specify curvature, a vertex can {{optionally}} {{contain a}} <b>child</b> <b>element</b> [...] to specify desired surface normal at {{the location of}} the vertex. The normal should be unit length and pointing outwards. If this normal is specified, all triangle edges meeting at that vertex are curved so that they are perpendicular to that normal and in the plane defined by the normal and the original straight edge. When the curvature of a surface at a vertex is undefined (for example at a cusp, corner or edge), an [...] element can be used to specify the curvature of a single non-linear edge joining two vertices. The curvature is specified using the tangent direction vectors {{at the beginning and end}} of that edge. The [...] element will take precedence in case of a conflict with the curvature implied by a [...] element.|$|E
5000|$|Structural tags specify broad {{characteristics}} of their contents. The [...] element, for example, specifies that its <b>child</b> <b>elements</b> represent {{the parts of}} a book. This includes a title, chapters, glossaries, appendices, and so on. DocBook's structural tags include, {{but are not limited}} to: ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Mary Poppins Melody" [...] {{was to be}} {{performed}} when Mary introduces herself to the <b>children.</b> <b>Elements</b> of the song later became part of [...] "Stay Awake". The melody {{was the basis for}} a couple of other songs that were ultimately cut from the film.|$|R
50|$|Virtually {{any kind}} of XML {{validation}} requires access to the document in full. The most trivial example is that an attribute declared in the DTD to be of type IDREF, requires that there be an element in the document that uses the same value for an ID attribute. To validate this in a SAX parser, one must keep track of all ID attributes (any one of them might end up being referenced by an IDREF attribute at the very end); as well as every IDREF attribute until it is resolved. Similarly, to validate that each element has an acceptable sequence of <b>child</b> <b>elements,</b> information about what <b>child</b> <b>elements</b> have been seen for each parent, must be kept until the parent closes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mother and}} <b>child</b> <b>element</b> {{was chosen to}} [...] "universalize" [...] the horrors of slavery—that the latter could be made easier to {{understand}} through the former. The conceit was also a way to not focus on {{the violence of the}} era, which Oliveira said he could not accurately or comfortably depict. Thralled is also partially to humanize the tens of millions in modern slavery worldwide. Oliveira has said that he thought the video game medium was young and should be pushed further, as well as that the interactive medium has endless possibilities for self-expression of [...] "intimacy", for broaching hard topics, and for empathizing with victims. He felt that most games focus on [...] "primitive", animal feelings—"aggressiveness and competitiveness"—and was interested in empathetic and humanizing games that focus on [...] "love and caring". The idea of the shadow figure that pursues the unaccompanied baby descends from a Congolese idea of the dead's world as parallel and reverse to ours, as viewable through reflections in bodies of water and mirrors. The developers also integrated their research on period Congolese and Brazilian culture into the game.|$|E
30|$|Finally, addChild {{primitive}} manipulates some pointers of the Model {{elements in}} order to associate the parent/child relation of these elements. If P is the parent element and C the <b>child</b> <b>element,</b> this primitive will add C to the children list of P and make the parent pointer of C points to P. After this operation, {{it is necessary to}} add both P and C to the marked list (O (1)).|$|E
30|$|For simplicity, Fig.  2 assumes that, for all years 2007 – 13, the phaseout of {{the family}} element of the CTC begins exactly at the income level for which {{the rest of the}} CTC is exhausted. In practice, this {{harmonization}} of phaseout ranges did not take effect until 2012. Before that, there were incomes for which all of the <b>child</b> <b>element,</b> but none {{of the family}} element, was phased out. Note that Fig.  2 ’s simplifying assumption is of little quantitative significance because the amount of the family element is less than one quarter of the full CTC amount.|$|E
30|$|An XRL {{route is}} a {{consistent}} XML document, that is, a well-formed and valid XML file with top element route [25]. The structure of any XML document forms a tree. In case of XRL, the root element of that tree is the route that contains exactly one so-called routing element. A routing element {{is an important}} building block and can either be simple (no <b>child</b> routing <b>elements)</b> or complex (one or more <b>child</b> routing <b>elements).</b> A complex routing element specifies whether, when and in which order the <b>child</b> routing <b>elements</b> are carried out.|$|R
30|$|Listing 2 {{illustrates}} part of {{the document}} that represents, in the metalanguage, the element <regionBase> in an NCL profile. It shows the entries that define the element <regionBase>, its attributes, its <b>child</b> <b>elements</b> and the reference made by the regionattribute {{to one of the}} elements <region> defined in the document.|$|R
30|$|When an <{{interface}}> element defines an {{interface type}} for a composition, in particular for the template, {{it can also}} define a mapping to an interface of a child object of the composition, externalizing this mapped interface. As mappings can be established among types, <forEach> <b>child</b> <b>elements</b> {{can be used to}} iterate on these type instances.|$|R
30|$|The {{inheritance}} {{from the}} core LADM, although being considered easier to implement in theory, in the MDA concept is handled in a two table implementation (Parent – Child) where the <b>child</b> <b>element</b> (GR_LADM) is provided with a foreign key to the parent element. In practice this implementation creates difficulties in applying queries in the database while violation of the integrity constraints might take place. What we would rather have is a single table containing both the parent and the child attributes. Another option {{would be to have}} the choice how the implementation of the inheritance should take place before performing the Database Table transformation in the EA.|$|E
30|$|Additional {{positive}} measures become rare as {{the crisis}} continues. Reinforcements {{of the minimum}} income scheme or child benefits are often no longer (presented as) related to the crisis, but part of reforms prepared {{before the onset of}} the crisis (such as in Austria); increases following a more prudent policy in the crisis years (Finland, Estonia) or combined with more negative measures, leading to rather mixed effects. For instance, the Slovenian as well as the Lithuanian social assistance reform has got varying effects on different family types, due to changes in equivalence rates. Likewise, the increase in the Austrian child care benefit was coupled to tougher access conditions. Similarly, in the UK, a continued uprating of the <b>child</b> <b>element</b> of the child tax credit was combined with decreases in other elements of this tax credit.|$|E

25|$|An {{element is}} a logical {{document}} component that either begins with a start-tag and ends with a matching end-tag or consists only of an empty-element tag. The characters between the start-tag and end-tag, if any, are the element's content, and may contain markup, including other elements, which are called <b>child</b> <b>elements.</b> An example is <greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>. Another is <line-break/>.|$|R
50|$|Complex types {{describe}} the permitted content of an element, including its <b>element</b> and text <b>children</b> and its attributes. A complex type definition {{consists of a}} set of attribute uses and a content model. Varieties of content model include element-only content, in which no text may appear (other than whitespace, or text enclosed by a child element); simple content, in which text is allowed but <b>child</b> <b>elements</b> are not; empty content, in which neither text nor <b>child</b> <b>elements</b> are allowed; and mixed content, which permits both elements and text to appear. A complex type can be derived from another complex type by restriction (disallowing some elements, attributes, or values that the base type permits) or by extension (allowing additional attributes and elements to appear). In XSD 1.1, a complex type may be constrained by assertions — XPath 2.0 expressions evaluated against the content that must evaluate to true.|$|R
