Boys and younger children do show the most risk when a parent is deployed, but rarely does this require <b>clinical</b> <b>intervention.</b> However, studies show that when a military member is deployed to a combat zone, the family cohesion is more disrupted than when service members are deployed to non-combat zones.|$|E

There is only one published <b>clinical</b> <b>intervention</b> trial testing for an effect of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on cataracts.

Overall, the group getting lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) were NOT less likely to progress to needing cataract surgery.

25|$|In the Clinic sample, 100 severe alcoholics {{treated at}} the clinic were {{followed}} for 8 years. The clinic’s methods were multi-modal: detoxification and hospital treatment followed by referral to AA. At {{the end of the}} 8 years, 34% of subjects had achieved stable abstinence, 29% had died, and 26% were still abusing alcohol, and the evidence was that other clinical studies had reported similar lack of success. Subjects who had a stable social environment or who frequently went to AA meetings had the highest rates of abstinence. Overall, however, treatment other than AA did not significantly improve the subjects’ outcome. In fact Vaillant reports the dismal fact that fully 95% of the Clinic sample had relapsed at some time during the 8-year study period. Vaillant noted that clinical treatment helped only in the short term, as crisis intervention and detox. There was one indicator, a financial one, of short-term success: <b>clinical</b> <b>intervention</b> had significantly reduced the cost of future health care for the alcoholics.|$|E
25|$|In the US, Registered {{dietitian}} nutritionists (RDs or RDNs) are {{health professionals}} qualified to provide safe, evidence-based dietary advice {{which includes a}} review of what is eaten, a thorough review of nutritional health, and a personalized nutritional treatment plan. They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar institutions. Certified Clinical Nutritionists or CCNs, are trained health professionals who also offer dietary advice {{on the role of}} nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs. Government regulation especially in terms of licensing, is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or RDN. Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS. These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in obesity and chronic disease. In order to become board certified, potential CNS candidate must pass an examination, much like Registered Dieticians. This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including; <b>Clinical</b> <b>Intervention</b> and Human Health.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{analyze the}} cost {{avoidance}} resulting from <b>clinical</b> <b>interventions</b> made by pharmacy students completing an advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) at a psychiatric hospital. Methods. A retrospective database review of documented <b>clinical</b> <b>interventions</b> by pharmacy students {{was conducted to}} classify interventions by type and significance. Interventions were assigned a cost avoidance value determined by {{an evaluation of the}} literature. Results. Three hundred-twenty interventions were documented by 15 pharmacy students during the 1 -year study period. The majority of interventions were related to psychiatric medication classes and most (n 5 197; 61. 6 %) were classified as being of moderate significance. The most common in-terventions included patient education (13. 1 %), order clarification (11. 6 %), therapeutic dosing adjust-ments (10. 9 %), and laboratory order monitoring (8. 8 %). The estimated cost avoidance from all interventions made by pharmacy students was approximately $ 23, 000. Conclusions.
