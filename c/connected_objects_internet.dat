40|$|International audienceThis {{article focuses}} {{on the way in}} which {{barriers}} between the energy, transport and digital industries are currently breaking down, whereas previously these industries were organised in separate compartments. It follows the literature on <b>connected</b> <b>objects,</b> <b>Internet</b> objects and “big data”. The specificity {{of this paper is to}} propose an original interpretation in terms of an “augmented market strategy”. This refers to a strategy of expanding the boundaries of a market through the networking of industries that mobilise concomitantly the same immaterial (knowledge, information, etc.) or physical (infrastructure, technology, etc.) foundations, at various levels of the value chain. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it seeks to contribute to the exploratory analysis of such strategies, to characterise them and to illustrate the way they manifest themselves presently. On the other hand, we strive to demonstrate the lack of a suitable concept (or concepts) available in the toolbox of industrial economics to understand these trends. Thereafter, we try to measure the value added of interpretations provided by an “augmented market strategy”...|$|E

Applications composed from <b>connected</b> <b>objects</b> in the <b>Internet</b> of Things {{are expected to}} have a huge impact in the transportation and logistics, healthcare, smart environments, and personal and social domains. The world of things is much more complex, dynamic, mobile, and failure prone than the world of computers, with contexts changing rapidly and in unpredictable ways. The growing complexity of Internet of Things applications will be unmanageable, and will hamper the creation of new services and applications, unless the systems will show " self-* " functionality such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration. The Web of Things builds on top of the Internet of Things to create applications composed of smart things relying on standard and well-known Web technologies. In this paper, we present a new agent architecture to enable self-healing and context-aware Web of Things applications. Our agents are the representation of physical objects, Web services, or humans in the Web...|$|R

Nowadays, aggregating data seems {{the easiest thing}} to do. Big data is a popular concept that {{everyone wants to be}} part of. <b>Connected</b> <b>objects</b> flood the <b>Internet</b> with huge amounts of data. Even in research organizations, each person aggregates data at her/his own personal level. Complexity comes with the categorization of this amount of knowledge, at this level. For an organisation, complexity can also be increased when talking about sharing this knowledge among people or services. Strasbourg IHU is an organisation which field of activity concerns image-guided minimally invasive surgery. This organisation is involved in innovation through partnerships with companies in their field. Many people in this organisation aggregate and produce data. They found they have problems capitalising on these data that are poorly shared across the organisation. So they started a project to create a platform to help knowledge sharing, and enhance this knowledge by getting relevant news concerning their specific fields. This document will first give us an overview of the stakeholders and a description of the objectives of the project, and of the different steps of the analysis. A focus will then be done on the use of CERIF in the implementation of the platform, for one of its module.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present the}} design, {{implementation}} and evalua-tion of an enabling platform for locating and querying physical objects using existing WiFi network. We propose {{the use of}} WiFi management probes as a data transport mechanism for physical objects that are tagged with WiFi-enabled accelerometers and are capable of determining their state-of-use based on motion signatures. A local WiFi gateway captures these probes emit-ted from the <b>connected</b> <b>objects</b> and stores them locally after annotating them with a coarse grained location estimate using a proximity ranging algorithm. External applications can query the aggregated views of state-of-use and location traces of <b>connected</b> <b>objects</b> through a cloud-based query server. We present the technical architecture and algorithms of the proposed platform together with a prototype personal object analytics application and assess the feasibility of our different design decisions. This work makes important contributions by demonstrating {{that it is possible}} to build a pure network-based IoT analytics platform with only location and motion signatures of <b>connected</b> <b>objects,</b> and that the WiFi network is the key enabler for the future IoT applications.

40|$|Four-month-old infants {{sometimes}} can perceive {{the unity of}} a partly hidden object. In each {{of a series of}} experiments, infants were habituated to one object whose top and bottom were visible but whose center was occluded by a nearer object. They were then tested with a fully visible continuous object and with two fully visible object pieces with a gap where the occluder had been. Patterns of dishabituation suggested that infants perceive the boundaries of a partly hidden object by analyzing the movements of its surfaces: infants perceived a <b>connected</b> <b>object</b> when its ends moved in a common translation behind the occluder. Infants do not appear to perceive a <b>connected</b> <b>object</b> by analyzing the colors and forms of surfaces: they did not perceive a <b>connected</b> <b>object</b> when its visible parts were stationary, its color was homogeneous, its edges were aligned, and its shape was simple and regular. These findings do not support the thesis, from gestalt psychology, that object perception first arises as a consequence of a tendency to perceive the simplest, most regular configuration, or the Piagetian thesis that object perception depends on the prior coordination of action.
