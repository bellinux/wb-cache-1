Left unattended by city authorities, both local and planetary resources boundaries for water and nutrients will be transgressed. A novel partly dynamic flexible water balance is developed to explore ways to address a looming water crisis. A systems-based flow chart shows how rainwater, groundwater and recycled water interact. Measures from supply-, demand-, and reuse management are combined to manipulate the water flows. Water management in Bangalore, India, focused on supply management over the period 1964 to 2015, tapping distant rivers. This mind-set was challenged by a Water Disputes Tribunal and international financiers. Residents and industry were losing faith in the erratic water supply, and met part or all their water needs by digging or drilling wells. The flexible water balance is tested on Bangalore for the year 2050 when the population has increased from 8 to 20 million. New housing complexes can provide opportunities for effective arrangements to recycle water and nutrients, save energy, and reduce water pollution and air emissions. The flexible water balance indicates that Bangaloreans can get enough household water without tapping river water and still recharge groundwater...|$|E

We find that beyond very moderate levels, segregation actually works to lower the odds of entrepreneurship.

Meeting this deficit has meant the expansion of hydraulic infrastructure to ever distant areas at ever increasing costs. Water supply and disposal in the last decades has been dealt with exclusively by hydraulic engineers. They are once again attracting the interest of architects, landscape architects and planners as the effects of urban development on water resources becomes more evident. In an age of shrinking public budgets, site design can offer a competitive decentralized alternative to the massive engineering projects that would otherwise be needed to meet such demand. This work deals with a set of tools that architects and planners can use to contribute to improving the hydraulic capacity of our cities and to restoring some of the fundamental processes of the natural environment on which they are set.

40|$|Edullinen ostoväkirehu ja rehuntuotannossa saavutettavat mittakaavaedut ovat keskittäneet kasvavien maitotilojen rehuntuotantoa entistä enemmän nurmeen. Samalla ostorehujen käyttö nautojen ruokinnassa on lisääntynyt. Maitotilojen pellon käyttö on kuitenkin ollut 1990 -luvulla melko joustamatonta suhteessa viljelyaloilta maksetuissa tuissa tapahtuneisiin muutoksiin. EU-jäsenyyden myötä viljan ja väkirehujen hinnat alenivat suhteessa kotoisten karkearehujen tuotantokustannuksiin. Voimakkaat muutokset karkea- ja väkirehujen hintasuhteissa voivat aiheuttaa suorien tulovaikutuksien lisäksi muutoksia nautakarjatilojen pellon käyttöön sekä eläinten ruokintaan. Maatalouden taloudellisessa tutkimuslaitoksessa tehdyn selvityksen mukaan väkirehujen käyttö nautojen ruokinnassa on lisääntynyt ensisijaisesti EU-jäsenyyden aiheuttaman rehuviljan hinnan alenemisen vuoksi, ei niinkään tukipolitiikan takia. Varsinkin tuotantoaan laajentaneilla maitotiloilla on hyödynnetty edullista rehuviljaa ja rehuntuotannon mittakaavaetuja keskittymällä aikaisempaa enemmän nurmen viljelyyn ja lisäämällä ostorehujen käyttöä. Tutkimus on tehty kannattavuuskirjanpitoon osallistuneilla maitotiloilla. Pinta-alaperusteiset tuet eivät näytä vaikuttavan lyhyellä aikavälillä merkitsevästi maitotilojen pellon käyttöön, joka on melko joustamatonta suhteessa rehuvilja- ja nurmialoille maksettaviin tukiin. Esimerkiksi 10 %:n korotus nurmituessa kannusti viljelijöitä lisäämään tilansa nurmialaa keskimäärin noin yhdellä prosentilla ja vähentämään rehuviljan viljelyä 4, 2 prosentilla. Tutkimustulosten mukaan myös tilakoolla on merkittäviä vaikutuksia maitotilalla viljeltyjen kasvien pinta-aloihin ja ostorehujen käyttöön. Tilan peltoalan kasvu lisää rehuviljan viljelyä, sillä markkinattomia karkearehuja ei kannata tuottaa eläinten rehuntarvetta enempää. Sitä vastoin jos lehmien määrää lisätään peltoalan pysyessä ennallaan, nurmikasvien viljelyalat kasvavat ja ostorehujen käyttö lisääntyy. Agenda 2000 -uudistus ei merkitsevästi vaikuttane maitotilojen pellon käyttöön. Uudistus kuitenkin lisää väkirehujen edullisuutta nautojen ruokinnassa, jos teollisesti jalostettujen rehujen hinnat laskevat samaan tahtiin niiden raaka-aineena käytettävän rehuviljan hinnan kanssa. During {{the past}} 20 years Finnish {{agricultural}} {{policy has been}} reformed significantly. Agricultural product prices have been lowered {{and the use of}} direct income support has increased. The greatest change happened in 1995 when Finland joined European Union and national agricultural policy was integrated to Common Agricultural Policy. In Finland forage price is based on high production cost, which has risen together with other farm production costs. On the other hand one of the main goals in recent policy reforms has been to reduce feed grain prices. Together with subsidy changes this has given a reason to suspect, that in ruminants diet feed grain and concentrates are substituted for forage. As a result welfare of milk cows and other ruminants may have decreased. In this paper land allocation on Finnish bookkeeping dairy farms in 1989 - 1997 was studied with an econometric model. Farm level models were estimated for forage acreage, feed grain acreage and for <b>concentrated</b> feed <b>demand.</b> In 1993 milk quota exchange was allowed between farms and maximum milk output might be endogenous. Therefore milk supply was modelled simultaneously with land use. Models were estimated by Two-Stage Least Squares and endogeneity of milk output was tested by Hausmann Specification Test. Elasticity of forage allocation was 0, 11 with respect to forage land subsidy and - 0, 11 with respect to feed grain subsidy. For feed grain acreage the corresponding elasticities were - 0, 42 and 0, 29. Changes in acreage based subsidies seem to have no effect on dairy farm land use in the short run. Increased use of acreage based subsidies has not encouraged dairy farms to increase land allocation to feed grains. Acreage based subsidies are also an inefficient way to increase the use of forages in ruminants diet. Forage and feed grain acreage <b>demand</b> and <b>concentrates</b> <b>demand</b> on Finnish bookkeeping dairy farms was quite inelastic with respect to changes in concentrated feed and fertiliser price. On the other hand feed grain acreage has clearly decreased and <b>concentrates</b> <b>demand</b> has increased while feed grain and concentrate prices have decreased. It seems that in ruminants' diet feed grain and concentrates are substituted for forage. The results suggest that the use of fodder in milk cows' diet has increased mainly due to decreased feed grain price. Especially farmers who have expanded milk production, have specialised on forage production and increased use of concentrated feed in cows' diet by purchasing more feed concentrates. This has allowed farmers to feed more animals with the same acreage as before, and utilise economies of size in forage production. The results indicate, that farm size has an important effect on dairy farm land use and on the <b>demand</b> of <b>concentrated</b> feed. The elasticity of forage land with respect to milk price varied between 0, 12 - 0, 15, for feed grain area between - 0, 38 - - 0, 3 and for concentrated feed use between 0, 62 - 0, 76. Feed grain acreage demand was elastic but forage acreage and <b>concentrated</b> feed <b>demand</b> was inelastic with respect to farm total acreage. Feed grain acreage was greater in large farms than in small farms. Also when farmer acquired more land, the feed grain share of total farm acreage increased. Milk output on Finnish bookkeeping farms turned out endogenous in 1994 - 1997. Therefore current milk production quota system significantly allocates production rights to dairy farmers willing to expand milk production. Possibility to increase milk output has significant effects on farm land use and feed self-sufficiency too. vo...|$|R

Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems {{have the potential to}} be an important contributor to urban water self-sufficiency. The goal {{of this study was to}} select an environmentally optimal RWH strategy in newly constructed residential buildings linked to rainwater demand for laundry under Mediterranean climatic conditions, without accounting for water from the mains. Methods: Different strategies were environmentally assessed for the design and use of RWH infrastructures in residential apartment blocks in Mediterranean climates. The harvested rainwater was used for laundry in all strategies. These strategies accounted for (i) tank location (i. e., tank distributed over the roof and underground tank), (ii) building height considering the number of stories (i. e., 6, 9, 12, and 15), and (iii) distribution strategy (i. e., shared laundry, supply to the nearest apartments, and distribution throughout the building). The RWH systems consisted of the catchment, storage, and distribution stages, and the structural and hydraulic calculations were based on Mediterranean conditions. The quantification of the environmental performance of each strategy (e. g., CO 2 eq. emissions) was performed in accordance with the life cycle assessment methodology. Results and discussion: According to the environmental assessment, the tank location and distribution strategy chosen were the most important variables in the optimization of RWH systems. Roof tank strategies present fewer impacts than their underground tank equivalents because they enhance energy and material savings, and their reinforcement requirements can be accounted for within the safety factors of the building structure without the tank. Among roof tanks and depending on the height, a distribution strategy that <b>concentrates</b> <b>demand</b> in a laundry room was the preferable option, resulting in reductions from 25 to 54...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{urbanization}} and industrialization are {{the major}} factors behind growing urban water demand in India. Incidentally, the large urban areas are experiencing faster growth in population, {{and most of them}} are in arid and semi-arid regions, which are naturally water-scarce. As a result, water supplies from local water sources including aquifers are falling far short of the high and <b>concentrated</b> <b>demands</b> in most urban areas. Under such situations, these large cities have to rely on distant large reservoirs. Understanding the pattern and sources of urban water demand is important for sustaining water supplies in cities. The analysis of Class I cities (> 0. 1 million population) and Class II towns (population 0. 05 to 0. 1 million) shows that cities with larger population size have much higher level of dependence on surface water sources. The Population Elasticity of Water Supply (PEWS) change with time and space for Class I cities it was 1. 23 in 1988, 1. 29 in 1999, whereas it has gone down to 1. 05 in 2008. It also shows that Class I cities have better water supply than Class II towns (PEWS was 0. 33 in 1988, 0. 76 in 1999 and 0. 82 in 2008). Given the structure and pattern of urban population growth, economic conditions and water demands, large reservoirs will have a much bigger role in meeting urban water supply needs. • During 1901 to 2011, urban population in India has increased more than 14. 7 times surpassing India's total population growth, which has increased by 5. 2 times • In 2011, 31. 16 % (377. 11 million) of India's population is living in urban areas, which is expected to increase up to 40 % or 550 million in 2021 (Lundqvist et al., 2003) • A large share of urban population live in Class I cities in 2001 as compared t...|$|R
