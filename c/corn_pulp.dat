50|$|The two peoples {{influenced}} {{each other}} in many fields: the French learned the languages of the natives, who bought European goods (fabric, alcohol, firearms, etc.), and sometimes adopted their religion. The coureurs des bois and the soldiers borrowed canoes and moccasins. Many of them ate native food such as wild rice and various meats, like bear and dog. The colonists were often dependent on the Native Americans for food. Creole cuisine is the heir of these mutual influences: thus, sagamité, for example, {{is a mix of}} <b>corn</b> <b>pulp,</b> bear fat and bacon. Today jambalaya, a word of Seminole origin, refers to a multitude of recipes calling for meat and rice, all very spicy. Sometimes shamans succeeded in curing the colonists thanks to traditional remedies (application of fir tree gum on wounds and Royal Fern on a rattlesnake bite).|$|E
50|$|The mural {{is located}} {{above the door}} to the postmaster's office. Blue Eagle used tempra and {{acrylics}} to paint the mural. The painting {{is an example of the}} style known as Traditional Indian Painting. It is painted directly onto the plaster wall of the building. The mural is named Women Making Pishafa, and it depicts people preparing pah sho fah, a flint corn beverage that is made by Creek and other Southeastern tribes. A woman on the right side of the painting pounds corn into cornmeal. In the center, two women separate the corn husk from the <b>corn</b> <b>pulp.</b> A table behind them is set with bowls and a coffee pot, which shows that pishafa can be a soup or a beverage. While the women work, a boy plays with a toy horse, and a man on the left side of the painting shoots an arrow at a flock of birds overhead. During 1964 renovations to the post office interior, dust and dirt damaged the painting. Fred Beaver, a Creek artist, restored the mural.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{nutritional}} quality of four botanical mixtures (AFC) : AFC 1 (containing red <b>corn,</b> pumpkin <b>pulp</b> and marigold), AFC 2 (containing alfalfa meal, pumpkin pulp and marigold), AFC 3 (containing kale, alfalfa meal, marigold and spinach leaves), AFC 4 (containing buckthorn, red <b>corn,</b> pumpkin <b>pulp</b> and marigold), in terms of proximate analysis (crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber, ash), amino acid (AA) profile, vitamin E concentration and lutein and zeaxanthin content, in order to determine the potential of AFCs as feed additives in laying hens nutrition. The crude protein content for the analysed botanical mixtures ranged between 9. 07 - 18. 18 % DM, and crude fiber between 10. 41 - 30. 83 % DM. The amino acid profile of the mixture AFC 4 revealed a content of limiting essential amino acids required for laying hens: lysine 5. 719 % CP, methionine 1. 058 % CP and threonine 4. 415 % CP. The highest content of lutein and zeaxanthin was found in the mixture AFC 4 (66. 659 mg/ 100 g), which also had the highest amount of vitamin E (640. 93 mg/kg). With regard to safety of the botanical mixtures, lead and cadmium concentrations were determined. Concentration of lead ranged from 0. 28 - 0. 75 µg/g DM and 0. 06 - 0. 09 µg/g DM for concentration of cadmium, which was within the legislation of maximal limits of EU regulations. It can be concluded that the botanical mixture AFC 4 had the highest concentration of lutein, zeaxanthin and vitamin E, with an adequate content of essential amino acids. Furthermore, all four botanical mixtures had high amounts of xantophylls and should be tested in laying hens trials in order to establish their effects on lutein and zeaxanthin concentration in egg yolk...|$|R

It was found that differences between laboratories ranged from 2. 40 percentage points for soybean meal to 8. 05 percentage points for sugarcane for iNDF analysis and from 1. 79 percentage points for corn to 10. 06 percentage points for hay for iADF analysis. It was observed that the individual evaluation of each material, the total random variation of the results between laboratories ranged from 88. 75 to 96. 77 % and 88. 75 to 98. 40 % for iNDF and iADF analysis, respectively. The iNDF and iADF levels are dependent on the interaction effect between the evaluated material and laboratory and have low reproducibility; this may be a consequence {{of the differences between the}} methods practiced by each laboratory, demonstrating lack of standardization of procedures used by the laboratories...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of replacing <b>corn</b> with orange <b>pulp</b> (OP) on growth performance, rumen fermentation, nutrient digestibility and blood parameters of fattening lambs. Twenty male lambs were placed in individual pens and fed with four levels of replacement of corn by OP (0, 33, 66, 100 %) during 60 days. Average daily gain (ADG) showed a quadratic effect (p< 0. 007) with the increasing levels of replacement. Inclusion of 33 and 66 % of OP in the diet significantly increased dry matter intake (DMI) compared to control group (p< 0. 01). Ruminal ammonia-N concentration showed a linear decrease (p< 0. 002). Ruminal fluid pH increased linearly with the increasing replacement of corn by OP (p< 0. 001). Acetate concentration showed a linear increase (p< 0. 001). Plasma total protein showed a linear increase (p< 0. 002). Organic matter, crude protein and neutral detergent fiber showed a quadratic effect with the level of replacement. The results of the present study showed that replacement of corn by OP improves DMI of fattening lambs, leading to an enhancement in ADG at the replacement level of 40. 3 %. Also, total replacement of corn by OP did not have any adverse effect on growth performance, rumen fermentation, nutrient digestibility and blood parameters...|$|R
40|$|Misuse of {{pesticides}} in farming activities leads to contamination {{of drinking water}} sources and is responsible for animal and human health problems. The biobeds are practicable option to minimize contamination by pesticides during preparation, use and washing of equipment for pesticide treatments. This research aimed at testing substrate mixtures to optimize biobed efficiency to remove pesticides under the climate of the Yucatan (México). Agricultural soil and 11 mixtures adding vegetable compost, sisal <b>pulp,</b> <b>corn</b> stover and seaweed were tested under controlled conditions. Each biomixture was exposed to a mixture of five pesticides (2, 4 -diclorophenoxyacetic acid “ 2, 4 -D” [1. 08  mg cm− 3], atrazine [2. 50  mg cm− 3], carbofuran [0. 23  mg cm− 3], diazinon [0. 34  mg cm− 3], and glyphosate [0. 36  mg cm− 3]) {{in a period of}} 41  days. Monitoring of the dissipation of pesticide residues showed that pesticides were quickly dissipated in soil at microcosm level experiment, while at two critical times of 20 and 41  days, all mixtures of substrates (biomixtures) were efficient in dissipation of high concentrations of pesticide in a short time (> 99 %). Time, biomixture and type of pesticide were shown to be the main parameters influencing pesticide dissipation (P <  0. 05). Several other physicochemical parameters of the biomixtures, such as organic matter (OM), lignin, water holding capacity (WHC), and pH, were also significant on pesticide dissipation (P <  0. 05), being pH the most significant...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} methane {{and carbon dioxide}} gas production, dry matter degradation, and final pH values {{obtained}} during the in vitro incubation of corn grain, soybean hulls, citrus <b>pulp,</b> <b>corn</b> silage, and crude glycerin. Experiments were performed using a randomized block design with four incubation periods. Each period featured four replicates per ingredient and four blanks, totaling 16 repetitions per ingredient. The lowest total amount of produced gas (37. 96 mL gincubated DM- 1) and the lowest final pH value (4. 95) were obtained for crude glycerin (P < 0. 05), which, however, exhibited the highest (P < 0. 05) DM degradation. Citrus pulp produced the largest amount (P < 0. 05) of CH 4 per gram of incubated DM (13. 56 mL g- 1). However, when methane production was expressed per gram of degraded feed, the ingredients with lower degradation values, such as soybean hulls and corn silage, produced more CH 4 per gram of degraded DM. Citrus <b>pulp</b> and <b>corn</b> grain produced more (P < 0. 05) CO 2 per gram of incubated DM. However, per gram of degraded food, citrus pulp produced the largest amount of CO 2 (P < 0. 05). Crude glycerin and corn grain produced less methane (per gram of degraded feed) than citrus pulp, soybean hulls, and corn silage. Differentiation of ingredients based on their methane production ability is important to express methane production per unit degraded food mass...|$|R
40|$|Replacement of <b>corn</b> by citrus <b>pulp</b> {{or coffee}} hulls explores the {{potential}} of dairy cows to digest fiber-rich feedstuffs. However, for the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, replacing citrus pulp by coffee hulls may reduce milk production costs, since citrus pulp needs to be imported from another state, while coffee hulls are highly available at essentially no cost. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the performance of crossbred cows fed concentrates containing 25 % coffee hulls (Coffee) or 25 % citrus pulp (Pulp) {{as a replacement for}} ground corn grain (Corn; 47. 4 % in the concentrate). Forty-two cows were blocked based on milk yield and allocated to one of the three treatments for 56 days, following a 14 -day standardization period. Concentrates were fed twice a day during the milking routine, 1 kg to each 2. 5 kg of the average milk yield for the block, determined {{at the end of the}} standardization period. The daily 3. 5 % fat-corrected milk yield was 7. 5 kg for Corn, 7. 9 kg for Pulp and 6. 2 kg for Coffee (P 0. 26). The Pulp concentrate provided the highest financial efficiency, while Coffee was the least efficient (P < 0. 01). These data suggest that {{the potential of}} use of coffee hulls is low when added at rates equal to or greater than 25 % of the concentrate offered during the milking routine...|$|R

Os tratamentos avaliados foram: Ração com 2, 50 % de caroço de algodão (dieta controle), ração com 11, 50 % de caroço de algodão e outra com 3, 13 % de caroço do algodão acrescida de lipídio protegido, com base na matéria seca. A relação volumoso: concentrado da dieta foi 50 : 50. Foram utilizados 39 bovinos machos não-castrados com peso vivo médio inicial de 494, 05 kg e 36 meses de idade, os quais permaneceram por 63 dias confinados em baias com 13 animais. Utilizou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado com 3 tratamentos e 13 repetições. O acréscimo das fontes lipídicas testadas no presente estudo não afetaram o peso vivo final, ganho de peso médio diário, RCQ, AOL, EGC e pH post-mortem da carne dos animais. Concluiu-se que a adição de LP na dieta interferiu de forma negativa no ganho de peso e nas características da carcaça, sendo que o mesmo ocorreu nos tratamentos que receberam somente CA, como fonte de gorduraThe aim of {{this study}} was to determine the effect of the inclusion of lipid sources (whole cottonseed and protected fatin diets containing sugar cane, <b>corn,</b> citrus <b>pulp,</b> cottonseed meal,and urea), on animal performance, hot carcass dressing (HCD), ribeye area (RA), fat thickness (FT),and post-mortempH of meat ofNellore cattle duringfinishing, which was carried out from August to October 2009. The treatments evaluated were: ration with 2. 50 % of cottonseed (control diet); ration with 11. 50 % of cottonseed; and ration with 3. 13 % cottonseed added of protected lipid, all on a dry matter basis. The roughage:concentrate ratioof the diet was 50 : 50. Thirty nine intact animalswith average initial body weight of 494. 05 kg and 36 months of age were housed during 63 days in pens with thirteen animals each. A completely randomized design with three treatments and thirteen replications was used.

It was concluded that theaddition of protected lipids in the diet negatively interfered with weight gain and carcass characteristics, and the same ocorred in the treatments that only received cottonseed as the lipid sourc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Ruminal disbiosis {{induced by}} feeding {{is the cause}} of ruminal acidosis, a {{digestive}} disorder prevalent in high-producing ruminants. Because probiotic microorganisms can modulate the gastrointestinal microbiota, propionibacteria- and lactobacilli-based probiotics were tested for their effectiveness in preventing different forms of acidosis. Results Lactic acidosis, butyric and propionic subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) were induced by feed chalenges in three groups of four wethers intraruminally dosed with wheat, <b>corn</b> or beet <b>pulp.</b> In each group, wethers were either not supplemented (C) or supplemented with Propionibacterium P 63 alone (P) or combined with L. plantarum (Lp[*]+[*]P) or L. rhamnosus (Lr[*]+[*]P). Compared with C, all the probiotics stimulated lactobacilli proliferation, which reached up to 25 % of total bacteria during wheat-induced lactic acidosis. This induced a large increase in lactate concentration, which decreased ruminal pH. During the corn-induced butyric SARA, Lp[*]+[*]P decreased Prevotella spp. proportion with a concomitant decrease in microbial amylase activity and total volatile fatty acids concentration, and an increase in xylanase activity and pH. Relative to the beet pulp-induced propionic SARA, P and Lr[*]+[*]P improved ruminal pH without affecting the microbial or fermentation characteristics. Regardless of acidosis type, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that probiotic supplementations modified the bacterial community structure. Conclusion This work showed that the effectiveness of the bacterial probiotics tested depended on the acidosis type. Although these probiotics were ineffective in lactic acidosis because of a deeply disturbed rumen microbiota, some of the probiotics tested may be useful to minimize the occurrence of butyric and propionic SARA in sheep. However, their modes of action need to be further investigated. </p...|$|R
