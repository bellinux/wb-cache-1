40|$|BACKGROUND: Consensus {{statements}} were {{proposed for the}} diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BS). The <b>clinical</b> diagnostic <b>criteria</b> were defined as documented ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia (VT), family history of sudden cardiac death at < 45 years, diagnostic ECGs of family members, inducibility of VT during electrophysiological study, syncope or nocturnal agonal respiration. The clinical validation of these criteria is still missing. Methods and results 280 patients (41 +/- 18 years, male: 168 pts) with diagnostic coved type I ECG were included. Consensus <b>clinical</b> diagnostic <b>criteria</b> were present in 244 (87 %) patients (40 +/- 18 y, 142 males). In 36 pts (13 % of the 280 pts, 51 +/- 12 years, 27 males) consensus <b>clinical</b> diagnostic <b>criteria</b> were not met. Nine patients (25 %) presented with spontaneous type I ECG.

These patients have frequently spontaneous type I ECG and clinical signs of Brugada syndrome as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or conduction disturbances.

40|$|In higher education, {{reliance}} on part-time teachers, including postgraduate students (PGs), in our undergraduate (UG) programmes is widespread. Dental education is no exception: {{the bulk of}} our UG clinical teaching/supervision is provided by casually-employed clinicians. Consistent with reports highlighting the need for professional development for part-time (including PG) teachers, we identified our PGs needed support. This paper describes the programme we developed for our PGs and the initial evaluation. Recommendations from the literature informed our programme design. Evaluation of the programme involved PG-clinical teachers’ perceptions of their experience and analysis of their learning outcomes, using pre- and post-tests. The tests required PG-clinical teachers to identify behaviours related to UG <b>clinical</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> and <b>clinical</b> teacher attributes, and judge the level of performance portrayed {{in a series of}} UG clinic video simulations. To check that <b>clinical</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> for UGs and clinical teacher attributes were identifiable, experienced-clinical teachers completed the same tests. Learning from repeated viewing of the test-videos was not evident. It was difficult to identify and/or classify UG <b>clinical</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> in the videos. Both PG- and experienced-clinical teachers identified and classified more clinical teacher attributes than UG <b>clinical</b> assessment <b>criteria.</b> There was some improvement by PG-clinical teachers in identifying and classifying clinical teacher attributes. These data indicated the programme may have contributed to PG-clinical teachers’ learning about their role, but it did not consistently contribute to improved outcomes for evaluating UG performance.

2500|$|The most {{commonly}} used method to predict clinical probability, the Wells score, is a clinical prediction rule, whose use is complicated by multiple versions being available. In 1995, Philip Steven Wells, initially developed a prediction rule (based on a literature search) to predict the likelihood of PE, based on <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria.</b> The prediction rule was revised in 1998 This prediction rule was further revised when simplified during a validation by Wells et al. in 2000. In the 2000 publication, Wells proposed two different scoring systems using cutoffs of 2 or 4 with the same prediction rule. In 2001, Wells published results using the more conservative cutoff of 2 to create three categories. An additional version, the [...] "modified extended version", using the more recent cutoff of 2 but including findings from Wells's initial studies were proposed. Most recently, a further study reverted to Wells's earlier use of a cutoff of 4 points to create only two categories.|$|E
