40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of routing and {{wavelength}} assignment of multicast sessions with subwavelength traffic demands. We consider this problem in the scenario of WDM ring networks. In order to support multicasting, individual nodes need to have the capability to duplicate traffic. We consider two different node architectures which perform the duplication in optical and electronic domain, respectively. As traffic duplication at the electronic level is much more expensive than the optical alternative, we study the problem of assigning routes and wavelengths to the multicast sessions so as to minimize electronic copying. The solution to this problem can be divided into three phases- 1. routing of multicast sessions, 2. <b>construction</b> of <b>circles</b> by grouping non-overlapping arcs and 3. grouping these circles onto wavelengths. We propose a heuristic algorithm which implements the routing as well as <b>circle</b> <b>construction</b> phases simultaneously and then groups the circles. We present extensive simulation results to show that our approach leads to much lesser equipment cost than that obtained by routing each multicast session along its minimum spanning tree and then using the best known heuristic for <b>circle</b> <b>construction.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, there have been {{large-scale}} and expensive public works tenders that adopted design and build procurement (D&B) contracts which consist of construction and civil engineering. Experts from the academic and <b>construction</b> <b>circles</b> have been studying the effective implementation of these tenders, the difficulties they encountered and the solutions for them. However, design and build (D&B) projects have additional stages such as the pre-planning and design and post-operative stages compared to traditional construction projects.

The risks that were to be assumed by the original employer may be transferred to the design and build contractors by means of a written agreement. Risk Management involves appropriate handling of risks after evaluation and analysis to minimize the negative impacts risks have on the finance with the lowest costs. Risk management is applied to establish necessary guidelines and to obtain key indices for successful design and build projects for contractor to follow.

40|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{discussion}} in design, architecture, and <b>construction</b> <b>circles</b> on creating sustainable environments, and there are also widely varying opinions as to exactly how sustainability can be introduced and approached. Current debates indicate that the term encompasses more than the physical and economic aspects. It includes social, cultural, and behavioral dimensions. Observing contemporary architectural practices, however, reveals that there are two major missing dimensions. On the one hand, there is an emphasis on the physical aspects of sustainability, while socio-cultural and socio-behavioral dimensions are oversimplified. On the other hand, there is a heavy reliance on top-down policies and strategies with the aim of developing guidelines to be implemented for the betterment of environments. Strikingly, this takes place at the expense of other bottom-up strategies that aim at sensitizing users toward understanding the key issues underlying sustainability. These two missing dimensions — socio-behavioural dimensions, and bottom-up strategies — offer a rationale for the professional community everywhere in the world to use sustainability as a term in their daily discourse. Nevertheless, even while talking about it, they do not yet use sustainability or utilize it in their daily practices. This article presents a critical voice on the current developments and efforts in dealing with sustainability of built environments, by adopting an alternative comprehensive approach that places high value on "trans-disciplinarity". This is achieved by adapting previous efforts developed in the field, and by addressing users as key players in the process of creating sustainable environments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a new {{interpretation of a}} digital circle {{in terms of the}} distribution of square numbers in discrete intervals. The number-theoretic analysis that leads to many important properties of a digital circle succinctly captures the original perspectives of digital calculus and digital geometry for its visualization and characterization. To demonstrate the capability and efficacy of the proposed method, two simple algorithms for the <b>construction</b> of digital <b>circles,</b> based on simple number-theoretic concepts, have been reported. Both the algorithms require only a few primitive operations and are completely devoid of any floating-point computation. To speed up the computation, especially for circular arcs of high radii, a hybridized version of these two algorithms has been given. Experimental results have been furnished to elucidate the analytical power and algorithmic efficiency of the proposed approach. It has been also shown, how and why, for sufficiently high radius, the number-theoretic technique can expedite a <b>circle</b> <b>construction</b> algorithm...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{great deal}} of discussions in design, architecture, and <b>construction</b> <b>circles</b> on {{sustainable}} learning environments, and widely varying opinions as to how exactly sustainability can be introduced and approached. Recent literature indicates that the term encompasses more than the physical and economic aspects. It includes social, cultural, and behavioral dimensions. However, investigating contemporary architectural practices reveals that there are two major missing dimensions. On the one hand, there is an emphasis on the physical aspects of sustainability while socio-cultural and socio-behavioral dimensions are oversimplified. On the other hand, there is a heavy reliance on top-down policies and strategies with the aim of developing guidelines to be implemented for the betterment of learning environments. Strikingly, this takes place at the expense of other bottom-up strategies that aim at sensitizing users toward understanding the key issues underlying sustainability. The argument of this paper is based on the belief that adopting the principles of sustainability is a comprehensive approach for a society to seek sound solutions. It calls for a responsive approach that incorporates these missing dimensions into current policies and strategies for designing and building sustainable learning environments. The paper explores different definitions of sustainability as viewed by the international community. It critically analyzes the problems associated with sustainability terminology, while comparing between top-down and bottom-up approaches to sustainability. In order to support the overall argument, the paper offers analyses of a number of real life cases that illustrate how socio-behavioral dimensions can be addressed in a collaborative design process and how bottom-up strategies can be integrated into this process...|$|R
