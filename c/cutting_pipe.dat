40|$|The {{apparatus}} {{for continuous}} <b>cutting</b> <b>pipes</b> (6) and other cylindrical components with any cross-sectional shape into lengths includes means for producing two laser beams. For focussing, {{each of the}} beams is provided with a mirror (3) located respectively at distances (a+c) and (b+d) from the pipe axis. Each mirror is mounted on a rotatory unit (7, 8) whose axis of rotation {{is parallel to the}} pipe axis and is located at a distance (a, b) from the latter. The two laser beams hit a reflective element (11) in opposition to one another. Rotation of the mirrors (3) is arranged so that at the start of cutting the beams are positioned at one edge of the reflective element and during subsequent cutting corresponding to mirror rotations through 180 deg. are brought to the other edge of this element. The feed rate of the pipe (6) is synchronised with the rate of advance of the beams from one edge to another of the reflective element (11). ADVANTAGE - Cutting is carried out without having to interr upt the feed motion of the component. Problems connected with accelerations/decelerations and accurate positioning of the cutting head are eliminated...|$|R
5000|$|On November 21, 2009, {{a release}} of {{radioactivity}} occurred inside the containment building of TMI-1 while workers were <b>cutting</b> <b>pipes.</b> Exelon Corporation stated {{to the public that}} [...] "A monitor at the temporary opening cut into the containment building wall to allow the new steam generators to be moved inside showed a slight increase in a reading and then returned to normal. Approximately 20 employees were treated for mild radiation exposure." [...] , it is believed that no radiation escaped the containment building and the public is not in any danger. The inside airborne contamination was caused by a change in air pressure inside the containment building that dislodged small irradiated particles in the reactor piping system. Some of the small particles became airborne inside the building and were detected by an array of monitors in place to detect such material. The air pressure change occurred when inside building ventilation fans were started to support outage activities. The site has modified the ventilation system to prevent future air pressure changes. Work continued on the project the following day. On January 24, 2010, TMI-1 was brought back online.|$|R
