5|$|In 2003, a <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> was {{introduced}} to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £10 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London. Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass. London government initially expected the <b>Congestion</b> <b>Charge</b> Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent, increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent, and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent. Over {{the course of several}} years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars– a 35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day.|$|E

40|$|There are {{constraints}} on pricing congestible facilities. First, if heterogeneous users are observationally indistinguishable, then <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> must be anonymous. Second, the time variation of <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> may be constrained. Do these constraints undermine {{the feasibility of}} marginal cost pricing, and hence {{the applicability of the}} first-best theory of congestible facilities? We show that if heterogeneous users behave identically when using the congestible facility and if the time variation of <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> is unconstrained, then marginal cost pricing is feasible with anonymous <b>congestion</b> <b>charges.</b> If, however, the time variation of <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> is constrained, optimal pricing with anonymous <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> entails Ramsey pricing. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Congestion</b> <b>charging</b> {{has drawn}} {{considerable}} attention of transport analysts and policymakers as {{a mean of}} relieving urban traffic congestion. Proper prediction of the impacts of charging is necessary for policy makers to take right decisions. A European project named SILVERPOLIS have been introduced in this connection to describe state-of-practice in modelling effects of <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> and to identify features of transport models that are crucial for reliable forecasting of effects of <b>congestion</b> <b>charging.</b> This master thesis {{is a part of}} the SILVERPOLIS project, where Stockholm <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> scheme has been analysed using two different types of dynamic simulators: METROPOLIS and SILVESTER. The simulations are based on traffic data collected before and after the Stockholm <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> trial performed in spring 2006. The result of simulation suggests that METROPOLIS, which has been used for predicting effects of <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> in Ile-de-France, manages well to forecast the consequences of <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> for Stockholm. Comparison with SILVESTER model disclosed that, although calibration results of the two models differs in some respect, both models give similar results regarding impacts of <b>congestion</b> <b>charging.</b> The different modelling features and assumptions have been described for the two models. Despite the fact that the two models vary a lot in their assumptions and modelling style, both of them has proved to be good at describing the effect of <b>congestion</b> <b>charging...</b>|$|R

5|$|In November 2012 Transport for London (TfL) {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} abolish the Greener Vehicle Discount that benefited, among others, vehicles with small diesel engines that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100g per km of CO2. Approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013, the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. The measure was designed to curb {{the growing number of}} diesel vehicles on London's roads. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period before they have to pay the full <b>congestion</b> <b>charge.</b> The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016.|$|E

5|$|Since the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> {{introduction}} in 2003, over £1.2 billion {{has been}} invested in transport through December 2013, including £960 million on {{improvements to the}} bus network; £102 million on roads and bridges; £70 million on road safety; £51 million on local transport/borough plans; and £36 million on sustainable transport and the environment. There has been criticism because during the first ten years since the scheme was implemented, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion, but only £1.2 billion has been invested, meaning that 54% of gross revenues have been spent in operating the system and administrative expenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{main roads}} through the Peak District are the A57 (Snake Pass) between Sheffield and Manchester, the A628 (Woodhead Pass) between Barnsley and Manchester via Longdendale, the A6 from Derby to Manchester via Buxton, the Cat and Fiddle road from Macclesfield to Buxton, {{and in the}} extreme north of the Park the A635 (Saddleworth Moor) running from Manchester to Barnsley and the A62 from Manchester to Leeds, which forms the northernmost border of the National Park at Standedge. These major roads, {{together}} with other minor roads and lanes in the area, are attractive to drivers, but the Peak's popularity makes road congestion {{and the availability of}} parking spaces a significant problem, especially during summer. This led to the proposal of a <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> in 2005, but this was later rejected.|$|E
5|$|After {{not being}} {{selected}} to become Labour's {{candidate in the}} 2000 London mayoral election, Livingstone successfully contested the election as an independent candidate. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge,</b> Oyster card, and articulated buses, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of London Underground. Despite his opposition to Blair's government on issues like the Iraq War, Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate and was re-elected in 2004, expanding his transport policies, introducing new environmental regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's East End, his leadership after the 7 July 2005 London bombings was widely praised. He stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in London's mayoral elections of 2008 and 2012, losing both to the Conservative candidate Boris Johnson. In 2016, accused of bringing the party into disrepute, he was suspended from Labour.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since its implementation, TfL {{reported}} that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network {{in order to improve}} the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E
5|$|The first {{implementation}} {{of such a}} scheme was Singapore Area Licensing Scheme in 1975, together with a comprehensive package of road pricing measures, stringent car ownership rules and improvements in mass transit. Thanks to technological advances in electronic toll collection, electronic detection, and video surveillance technology, collecting congestion fees has become easier. Singapore upgraded its system in 1998, and similar pricing schemes were implemented in Rome in 2001, London in 2003 with extensions in 2007; Stockholm in 2006, as a seven-month trial, and then on a permanent basis. In January 2008 Milan began a one-year trial program called Ecopass, charging low emission standard vehicles and exempting cleaner and alternative fuel vehicles. The Ecopass program was extended until December 31, 2011, and on January 16, 2012 was replaced by Area C, a trial program that converted the scheme from a pollution-charge to a <b>congestion</b> <b>charge.</b> The Gothenburg congestion tax was implemented in January 2013 and it was modeled after the Stockholm scheme.|$|E
5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the <b>congestion</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E

40|$|Gothenburg {{introduced}} a time-of-day dependent cordon-based <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> scheme in January 2013. This paper explores how {{the introduction of}} the Gothenburg <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> scheme has affected trip tour and trip chaining behavior, using panel surveys conducted in 2012 and 2013, before and after the Gothenburg <b>congestion</b> <b>charging</b> began. This study proposes a typology of trip tour and trip chaining behavior based on organization of trips. Further, the study develops a series of indicators to characterize trip chains and trip tours patterns. Descriptive analysis is used to compare travel patterns before and after congestion pricing at the daylevel, tour-level and stage-level. The analysis results show that car travelers not only suppress activities to a small extent but also tend to have simpler tour patterns after the <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> implementation. The adaptation patterns reduce charges paid to some extent. In general, the reorganization of activities taken from on the way from work/school to home contributes greatly to reducing the <b>congestion</b> <b>charges</b> paid. A linear model is also developed to identify the effects of socio-demographic factors and contextual factors on the amount of charges paid based on panel data...|$|R

5|$|As {{proposed}} in their election manifesto, in February 2003 Livingstone's administration introduced a <b>congestion</b> <b>charge</b> covering 8 square miles in central London, charging motorists £5 {{a day for}} driving through the area. It was introduced {{in an attempt to}} deter traffic and reduce congestion; Livingstone himself took the London Underground to work, and tried to inspire more Londoners to use public transport rather than cars. The policy was highly controversial, and strongly opposed by businesses, resident groups, the roads lobby, and the Labour government; many commentators recognised that if opposition resulted in the policy being abandoned then it could lead to the end of Livingstone's political career. That year, the Political Studies Association named Livingstone 'Politician of the Year' due to his implementation of the 'bold and imaginative' scheme. The scheme resulted in a marked reduction on traffic in central London, resulting in improved bus services, and by 2007, TfL could claim that the charge had reduced congestion by 20%. To further encourage the use of public transport, in June 2003, the Oyster card system was introduced, while bus and Underground journeys were made free for people aged 11 to 18.|$|E
