50|$|Muravyov’s {{disagreements}} with SibCem Chairman Oleg Sharykin over a EUR 476 million transaction to buy Intelcementi’s Turkish assets were given {{as the main}} reason for resigning as SibCem President and exiting the company as a shareholder. Muravyov was behind the deal all along, claiming that it would help the holding company not only to bolster its positions on the Russian market, but also to facilitate its access to international markets. In May 2008, before Muravyov’s resignation, a binding agreement was signed, with SibCem transferring to the seller (a French subsidiary of Italcementi) a <b>commitment</b> <b>fee</b> of EUR 50 million. However, the deal was not closed, and the agreement was terminated by November 2008. SibCem’s continuing core shareholder - Sibconcord LLC - took the matter to courts in early 2009, claiming that the aborted deal had not been duly approved by the board or shareholders, and should therefore be considered null and void. The court found for the plaintiff, triggering the holding company’s attempts to recover the <b>commitment</b> <b>fee,</b> which was still ongoing as of year-end 2012, and is still in litigation.|$|E

50|$|Another form of {{high-end}} executive search, delimited or engaged search, {{is often}} improperly categorized as retained search, {{although there are}} distinct differences. Similar to retained search firms, delimited/engaged search firms require an up-front fee before engaging the search. Unlike a conventional retainer, however, the delimited/engaged search <b>commitment</b> <b>fee</b> is refundable if the recruiter fails to achieve a hire or other deliverable specified in the contract. Moreover, the delimited/engaged search <b>commitment</b> <b>fee</b> does not follow the typical 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 model of retainers, but rather is a relatively small up-front fee which is discounted from the final placement fee of 25-35% of the successful candidate’s first year compensation. Both retained and delimited/engaged searches involve partial payment prior to filling the job, and the contracted recruiter has the search exclusively. Therefore, the search can be customized to the client organization’s needs, with the search professional providing a consultative service throughout the process. While both retained and delimited/engaged searches serve client employers rather than job-seeking executives, delimited/engaged search contracts always (as opposed to sometimes) state a future date when the project must be completed or the downpayment refunded.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{quantitative}} and qualitative data collected through a survey among entrepreneurs and apprentices in micro and small enterprises in Accra, Ghana, to analyse the financial arrangements in informal apprenticeships.

40|$|Abstract The {{financial}} crisis {{that started in}} 2007 {{is one of the}} most dramatic and powerful crises of resent decades. Its causes have highlighted a number of new concerns and issues for each country’s policy makers, practitioners and academics, interested and influenced by monetary and financial issues. Financial crises and bank liquidity creation are often connected. Banks are one of the most important resource of financing of companies during crisis. We need to understand how a financial system can provide liquidity efficiently and the potential role of banks in improving the allocation of resources and maintaining financial stability. Researches and available data show that firms with restricted access to credit (small, private, non-investment-grade, and unprofitable) draw more funds from their credit lines during the crisis than their large, public, investment-grade, profitable counterparts. Interest spreads increased (especially in “market-based economies”), but <b>commitment</b> <b>fees</b> remained unchanged.

It is argued that exchange-based options can provide a more reliable way than cash forward contracting for originators or purchasers of mortgages to manage commitment-period risk, but that <b>commitment</b> <b>fees</b> charged household borrowers should not fully correspond to premiums for put options "traded" on the exchanges. It also is argued that exchange-based futures can provide a more effective and economical way than asset-liability maturity matching in cash markets for thrift institutions to manage portfolio interest-rate risks; in particular, futures trading can permit these institution to meet the maturity preferences of liquidity-conscious creditors and risk-averse borrowers, to reduce the risk associated with unexpected shifts of the yield curve, and to maintain a higher degree of asset quality. The capacity of futures markets to handle large-scale hedging by mortgage market participants will depend upon heavy participation by highly leveraged speculators who are willing to take long positions without the receipt of substantial risk premiums from hedgers.

40|$|We {{rationalize}} {{fixed rate}} loan commitments (forward credit contracting with options) {{in a competitive}} credit market with universal risk neutraility. Future interest rates are random, {{but there are no}} transactions costs. Borrowers finance projects with bank loans and choose ex post unobseravable actions that affect project payoffs. Credit contract design by the bank is the outcome of a (non-cooperative) Nash game between the bank and the borrower. The initial formal analysis is basically in two steps. First, we show that the only spot credit market Nash equilibria that exist are inefficient {{in the sense that they}} result in welfare losses for borrowers due to the bank's informational handicap. Second, we show that loan commitments, because of their ability to weaken the link between the offering bank's expected profit and the loan interest rate, enable to the complete elimination of informationally induced welfare losses and thus produce an outcome that strictly Pareto dominates any spot market equilibrium. Perhaps our most surprising result is that, if the borrower has some initial liquidity, it is better for the borrower to use it now to pay a <b>commitment</b> <b>fee</b> and buy a loan commitment that entitles it to borrow in the future rather than save it for use as an inside equity in conjunction with spot borrowing. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt at looking at the cost and {{benefits}} of the small stock value addition scheme implemented in 2004. Thus far about 146 jobs have been created through the establishment of new abattoirs, however this seem {{to have taken place}} at the expense of mutton producers as they face “losses ” ranging from N$ 1 million to N $ 20 million due to adverse pricing on the part of local abattoirs as well as through the deduction of the value addition <b>commitment</b> <b>fee</b> of N$ 1. 50 per kilogram from the South African reference price. This means that either we intended to create very expensive jobs or intended to reduce the income of farmers. Of equal concern is the low take-off in terms of other downstream activities traditionally link to value addition in the meat sector such as value addition to hides and skins for leather and other uses. With regards to tanning for instance, not much has happened since the scheme was implemented as skins are still exported after the basic process of pickling. The paper recommends that the Meat Board should actively monitor abattoir prices in order minimises potential income shortfalls that producers may suffer as a result of too low prices. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore an alternative, pricing {{structure}} that might be adopted for bank credit cards. Under current pricing practices consumers who pay their accounts in full each month (nonrevolvers) pay no finance charges, whereas those who permit a portion of the unpaid balances to carry forward from month to month (revolvers) pay all of the finance charges. These finance charges constitute about three-fifths to three-fourths of total income available to banks from credit card operations. We propose to permit banks to levy three separate charges: (1) an annual percentage rate from date of purchase or posting to the account to reflect the cardholders ' use of credit services; (2) a transaction fee for the value received by cardholders from having a convenient payment mechanism; and (3) an annual fee or <b>commitment</b> <b>fee</b> that would reflect the value of the option upon the line of credit provided cardholders. An alternative pricing policy should be defensible economically and from the standpoint of public policy. To evaluate proposed changes in the pricing system, policy makers must be able to identify the characteristics of those who, as nonrevolvers, are not paying directly for any of the three basic services provided by credit cards. At issue is how they differ, if at all, from those consumers who are providing most of the income from credit card operations received by banks. Given this information, policy makers can decide whether they wis...|$|E
40|$|In Poland, {{more than}} 90 % of {{electricity}} production {{is based on}} coal fuel. Meanwhile, the financial situation of the mining industry is quite challenging. Companies in this sector are in debt, generating losses caused by {{a sharp drop in}} coal prices and a simultaneous increase in extraction costs that result from descending into lower levels of coal deposits. At the same time, banks are reluctant to loan money because of the risk of a borrowing entity's default. Increasingly, companies are turning to bond issue to maintain their liquidity and finance development projects. However, bondholders impose conditions in the form of covenants that are often difficult to satisfy, and the strictest relate {{to the level of a}} company's indebtedness and ability-to-repay-debt financial ratios. This article discusses bond issue costs. The authors analyze the bond issue programs of three of the four mining companies operating in Poland. The fourth company did not issue any bonds. Bond issue costs are composed of interest payable to investors, issue preparation and support costs, collateralization costs, and the cost of recording and organizing the sale. The main cost involved in bond issuance is the coupon cost, which depends on the company's financial health and its level of indebtedness, the purpose of the issue, its volume, and the type and quality of the safeguards against the risk of loss of funds invested by bondholders. Bonds issued by coal mining companies are assumed mainly by banks, which demand high interest due to the poor financial condition of the issuers. In addition to interest, companies also pay a capital <b>commitment</b> <b>fee,</b> an arrangement fee and a fee for early redemption. Altogether, in relation to the costs of capital raised through a bank loan, the bond issue results in significantly higher costs of raising capital...|$|E
40|$|Background A {{commitment}} {{device is}} some voluntary, deliberate arrangement an individual makes {{in order to}} bind their future choices and influence their future behaviour, in pursuit of some long run benefit. This may {{take the form of}} a public pledge (reputational commitment) or some monetary cost (financial commitment) that encourages individuals to stay on track with their behaviour change goals. Commitment devices are widely applied in the health sector to bring about desired behaviour change such as weight loss, but their effects are largely unproven. Aims This paper asks whether commitment devices can increase the usage of an online weight loss tool to bring about more consistent self-monitoring of behaviours. Method An online field experiment tests the causal effects of commitment devices on weight loss. 364 participants were recruited from the client base of an online weight loss service over July – November 2013, and randomly assigned to one of three groups: limited commitment, financial <b>commitment</b> (monthly subscription <b>fee)</b> and reputational plus financial <b>commitment</b> (monthly <b>fee</b> plus naming one person who would verify their weight loss). The outcome variable is usage of the online account, measured by frequency of food journal and self-reported weight entries over a one-month period. Results The ‘limited commitment’ group use their accounts more frequently than the financial and reputational commitment groups. Being offered the reputational commitment reduces usage. These results run counter to the hypothesised relationship between a commitment strategy and behaviour change. Conclusion Commitment devices may be better characterised as a signal of some innate motivation at the time of take up, rather than a substantive instrument for behaviour change, on average. However, heterogeneity of treatment effects may play an important part in explaining how and when commitment devices are most effective. If commitment devices can work well for identifiable sub-groups, there may yet be a targeted role for them in the public policy toolkit...|$|R
40|$|To {{know how}} {{marketing}} variables affect customer value {{is essential for}} a company {{in order to be}} market and customer oriented, and to improve investment efficiency in both attracting and retaining customers. Thus, the assessment of the influence of marketing variables in customer value is of prime importance. This is recognized in many empirical studies of these variables, which address the impact of a single variable (or sets of a few variables) on customer value. A comprehensive, integrated assessment of all marketing variables and their interdependencies is an arduous and complex task for researchers and marketing managers. This research proposes a theoretical model of customer value that takes into account all significant marketing variables that have been partially addressed in empirical investigations of other researchers. These marketing variables include brand and reputation, point of sale, employees, price, termination <b>fee</b> <b>commitment,</b> discounts, complementarity of products, experiences, emotions, perceived value, quality, satisfaction, switching costs, and loyalty. The model incorporates the relationship between each variable with retention and with customer value as well as the relationships between them.

This variable is widely used in the telecommunication’s industry for its influence on customer retention from the moment of purchase. However, there is strikingly little research in this topic.

We show in a theoretical framework that an equilibrium with waivers can arise without contracts as long as investors' are relatively inert and discount factors are high enough for manager's to care about future fees. Investors are not fooled by waivers and are fully informed of the manager's actions and ability. If past returns have information about future returns, waivers indirectly act as a performance-based salary. ...|$|R

The study provides empirical primary based information on the social-economic impact of microcredit to the economically active poor (EAP) {{with a range of}} income generating activities and constraints advanced by the clients with a view to alleviating poverty. This evaluation clearly states the problem by which the study is set to address within the community through the DCB microcredit to its clientele base via the SGL methodology. An overview of study findings, reveal that during the three years of operation, the bank recorded efficiency and effectiveness in microcredit provisions and that the clients continue to register their achievement towards the bank services and keep on increasing. Positive impacts of the microcredit benefits have been appreciated through various ways such clients and their families have benefited along with its trickle down effects recorded from time to time. Significant study findings revealed, interalia, the following: - 72 % of the clients are satisfied with the services with majority being the middle aged micro entrepreneurs forming about 61 %. -About 60 % of the clients managed to use part of the credit accruals to fund education for their children. - 87 % have greatly improved and expanded their business opportunities in various dimensions. - 55 % have now, through the bank, coming up and inculcated the culture of saving. -The study further revealed that women empowerment is at the forefront as it records about 66 % of the women who have all the way been encouraged to join and benefit from the scheme. -Apart from the scheme benefiting the targeted population, the bank also created 70 full time bank positions. However, problems observed from the study that the clients do face include: Complaints on high interest rate, high <b>commitment</b> <b>fee,</b> short weekly, repayment and grace periods, small starting loan and lack of proper education on entrepreneurial skills in business management, markets, legal and regulatory framework, licensing and tax issues. This evaluation study suggests ways through which the presented problems could be averted hence provide more microcredit and consequently have greater outreach and sustainability. Some of the problems advanced would need thorough education to clear most of the clients' doubts and simply keep the beneficiaries on the right track. A close observation revealed that the client, group leaders and even bank officers miss important regular training skills in their areas of operation. Proper education is among the suggested ways to mitigate most of the problems gathered from the study. A comprehensive training manual is strongly herewith recommended for implementation, as this is a key and road map towards the workable solution. The set up of this project paper is contained in Five Chapters. -Chapter one is an introduction giving a historical background of the DCB and the S G L clients along with their profiles, the evaluation assignment and its setting. -A detailed literature review and conceptual framework providing theoretical and empirical reviews are given in Chapter Two. -Chapter Three dwells on research methodology detailing sampling techniques, data type, data collection methods, data coding, data management, data analysis and presentation. -Results presentation, observations, findings, discussions, recommendations and conclusions are provided in Chapter Four. -Lastly, Chapter Five is on implementation of the assignment.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} assess advice and {{information}} support for firms {{provided by the}} Small Business Service (SBS) Business Link. It uses a new survey of client use, satisfaction and experience of service fees. The general level of satisfaction with, and use of, the service is high: 28 % of all respondents use the services and 82. 6 % are satisfied or very satisfied. However, levels of use and satisfaction vary considerably between areas, with 13 Business Link local hubs accounting for 40 % of the dissatisfied or very dissatisfied respondents. In addition, there is strong variation in satisfaction between services, with grants, diagnostic assessment, financial and accounting advice having low ratings. Charging a fee has been claimed by the SBS to improve the client's sense of value of the services received. Fees are currently charged for services in 37. 3 % of cases. However, there is little positive association of fee charging with satisfaction, whilst for four services charging a fee decreases satisfaction. It is concluded that the SBS has many strengths to build upon, but will need to introduce a step change in performance in some areas and some services, and should reconsider its <b>commitment</b> to using <b>fees</b> {{as a means of}} creating a sense of value among its clients. business advice, client satisfaction, Small Business Service, Business Link...|$|R
