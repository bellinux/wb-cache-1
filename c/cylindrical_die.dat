50|$|Polymer fibers are, in general, {{produced}} on a technical scale by extrusion, i.e., a polymer melt or a polymer solution is pumped through cylindrical dies and spun/drawn by a take-up device. The resulting fibers have diameters typically on the 10-µm scale or above. To {{come down in}} diameter into the range of several hundreds of nanometers or even down to a few nanometers, Electrospinning is today still the leading polymer processing technique available. A strong electric field {{of the order of}} 103 V/cm is applied to the polymer solution droplets emerging from a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>die.</b> The electric charges, which are accumulated {{on the surface of the}} droplet, cause droplet deformation along the field direction, even though the surface tension counteracts droplet evolution. In supercritical electric fields, the field strength overbears the surface tension and a fluid jet emanates from the droplet tip. The jet is accelerated towards the counter electrode. During this transport phase, the jet is subjected to strong electrically driven circular bending motions that cause a strong elongation and thinning of the jet, a solvent evaporation until, finally, the solid nanofibre is deposited on the counter electrode.|$|E

This research is concerned with the effect of sintering temperature on the relative density, hardness, and phase purity after sintering process. Bovine HA (BHA) powder obtained from heated local cortical bovine bone at 900 degrees C for 2 h was uniaxially pressed at 156 MPa into green bodies using a 20 mm <b>cylindrical</b> <b>dies.</b> The compacted green body was pressurelessly sintered in air atmosphere at temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1400 degrees C, at a furnace ramp rate of 5 degrees C/min and dwell time of 2 h. The BHA starting powder was characterized using XRD and FTIR SEM was also used for observing the microstructures of the starting material. The sintered BHA specimens were analyzed using Archimedes method for measuring density; XRD for phase stability; and Vickers method for hardness measurement. The analysis results show that the starting BHA powder and the sintered BHA specimens contain HA. The intensity of the three main peaks of HA decreases with increasing sintering temperature which may be due to decomposition of HA at high temperature. The density and hardness of BHA increases with increasing sintering temperature based on the results obtained. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The elongational viscosity of all materials was calculated, from the results of isothermal measurements carried out at 290 degrees C, by means of the Cogswell's analysis, based on the estimation of the pressure drop due to the converging flow at the die inlet. The behavior in elongational flow was compared with the {{rheological behavior}} in shear flow conditions. It was found that the elongational viscosities of VA and VB are very large and account for a fairly marked pressure drop at the die entrance, due to the orientation of the LCP domains taking place in the converging flow zone. For these materials, the ratio of the elongational viscosity to the Newtonian shear viscosity is up to two orders of magnitude higher than the value expected on the basis of the Trouton rule. For the flexible resins, the Trouton ratio is 3 and ca. 3 - 10, are common values for high molar mass linear polymers. The addition of 10 % LCP into the flexible resins strongly increases their elongational viscosity and makes the blends resemble neat LCPs in their extensional flow behavior. In shear flow, on the contrary, the addition of LCP was shown to induce a marked reduction of the melt viscosity, even when, as for the Ny/VB blend, the LCP is more viscous than the matrix...|$|R

30|$|The {{metallurgical}} {{phase of}} nanocomposites {{is shown in}} Fig. 3 in the longitudinal and traverse directions relative to the hot pressing direction. There are {{significant differences in the}} metallurgical phase microstructure perpendicular and parallel to the hot pressing direction. The graphite in the black region perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction exhibits a flocculent shape, and the graphite in the black region parallel to the hot-pressing direction exhibits a more slender shape. The reasons for this difference are as follows: The hot pressing sintering process is single-action pressing. Vertical pressure is applied on the composite powder in a <b>cylindrical</b> graphite <b>die.</b> There are significant morphological differences between the graphite perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction and the graphite parallel to the hot-pressing direction, because the graphite is intrinsically fluffy. These differences are maintained after isostatic pressing, because the pressures applied to the composite green body are equal in every direction during isostatic pressing after the hot pressing sintering step. Thus, the morphological differences formed during hot pressing sintering remain.|$|R
