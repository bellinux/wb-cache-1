Especially notable were those mills located in the valley at Goldendale and Shelton below the hill towns of Tunstall, Burslem and Hanley. Shelton Steelworks' production of steel ended in 1978—instead of producing <b>crude</b> <b>steel,</b> they concentrated on rolling steel billet which was transported from Scunthorpe by rail. The rolling plant finally closed in 2002.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{starts with}} the mineral structure, {{reducing}} properties of chromium ore and the {{physical and chemical properties}} of chromium oxide and discusses the requirements of the chemical composition of chromite and confirms the selection principle of chromium ore and reducing agent of chromium ore smelting reduction. The chemical compositions of the available chromite request the relatively high contents of chromium and iron, the lower contents of Al 2 O 3, MgO and P in gangue and the lower Cr/Fe ratio in keeping with the case of high chromium. Chromoium ore in South Africa is considered to be suitable for smelting stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crude</b> melts in a smelting reduction converter. From the reducing power and economy angle, carbon as a reducing agent is more suited to reducing chromium ore...|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of these reforms, the {{distribution}} of goods used in industrial production was based on mandatory planning with fixed prices, guidance planning with floating prices, and the free market. Mandatory planning covered sixty industrial products, including coal, <b>crude</b> oil, rolled <b>steel,</b> nonferrous metals, timber, cement, electricity, basic industrial chemicals, chemical fertilizers, major machines and electrical equipment, chemical fibers, newsprint, cigarettes, and defense industry products. Once enterprises under mandatory planning had met the state's mandatory plans and supply contracts, they could sell surplus production to commercial departments or other enterprises. Prices of surplus industrial producer goods floated within limits set by the state. The state also had a planned distribution system for important materials such as coal, iron and steel, timber, and cement. Enterprise managers who chose to exceed planned production goals purchased additional materials on the market. Major cities established wholesale markets for industrial producer goods to supplement the state's allocation system.|$|R
40|$|WP 02 / 2012; The aim of {{this study}} is twofold – on the one hand, to report a flow {{analysis}} based on historical trends of steel, from 1997 to 2008, across some leading geo-economic players; on the other, the analysis of long-term relationship between steel consumption and economic growth by the sensitivity of the demand for steel consumption to a change in the national income. Results show that steel production and consumption have different economic behaviour across some countries: China and Italy have higher average annual growth of production of crude (CHN 9. 75 %; ITA 0. 83 %), <b>steel</b> <b>crude</b> use equivalent (CHN 8. 37 %; ITA 1. 95 %) and steel use finished products (CHN 9. 38 %; ITA 1. 65 %), whereas the US have higher average annual growth of imports (13. 23 %) and China of exports of semi-finished/finished steel products (20. 38 %). In addition, the estimated average elasticity of consumption of steel on national income statistical per countries, based on unidirectional causality that runs from national income to steel consumption, shows de facto positive values, except in UK economies. The analysis here provides main information on the industrial structure of countries and for designing industrial policies aimed to support patterns of economic growth in current turbulent and fast-changing markets...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} EAF of Avesta Works, Outokumpu Stainless AB, {{has been}} used to perform smelting reduction trials of briquettes consisting of oily mill scale sludge, carbon and other wastes. The trials were among several important activities in studies on waste recycling by EAF smelting carried out jointly by Avesta Works and MiMeR, the Minerals and Metals Recycling Research Centre, at Luleå University of Technology. A total of 7 briquette smelting trials were performed. The heats were processed smoothly smelting 3 tonnes of briquettes or 3, 4 % of the weight for metal charges. Quantities of FeSi powder and O 2 gas injected and electric energy supplied were increased while the briquette weight was increased to 6 tonnes. No impacts were found on analyses of the <b>crude</b> stainless <b>steel</b> tapped from the EAF during the trials. Results of the briquette smelting have been evaluated by referring to the data from the reference heats and results from early laboratory tests. The recovery of Cr, Ni and Fe elements from the briquettes was nearly complete and was found to occur mainly through carbon reduction. Positive effects of briquette smelting on protecting metallic charges against gaseous oxidation have also been identified. This protection was through CO gas, generated from solid state C-O reaction in the briquettes, reacting with oxygen in the intruding air. The protection reduced losses of Cr, Ni and Fe elements from metallic charges to the slag. The slag weights were not increased in three trials as compared with the reference heats. There were moderate increases in the slag weights in four trial heats. The increases were, nevertheless, lower by 52 - 69 % than the slag weights generated by a Si-reduction of the briquette oxides. By smelting 6 -tonnes of briquettes in the trials, reliable information and results on C-O reactions in the briquettes for recovery of metal elements in the production EAF were obtained. After the trials, carbon-waste briquettes amounting to 1 - 3 tonnes were smelted very smoothly in many of the EAF heats at Avesta Works to recycle the oily mill scale sludge and other wastes from stainless steel production. The metal recoveries from the briquettes were then estimated based on the information and results of the C-O reaction and metal recovery obtained from the present trial heats.
