5|$|Hydrogen poses {{a number}} of hazards to human safety, from {{potential}} detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a <b>cryogen</b> and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.|$|E
5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} <b>cryogen.</b> Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak and flows {{in the form of}} glaciers and on Triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region.|$|E

25|$|The planned mission {{period was}} to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch {{expectation}} that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard liquid helium supply was exhausted. This occurred on 15 May 2009. Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments are no longer usable. However, the two shortest-wavelength modules of the IRAC camera are still operable with the same sensitivity as before the <b>cryogen</b> was exhausted, {{and will continue to}} be used in the Spitzer Warm Mission. All Spitzer data, from both the primary and warm phases, are archived at the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA).|$|E
2500|$|The insulation, as {{efficient}} as it is, will not keep LNG cold enough by itself. [...] Inevitably, heat leakage will warm and vapourise the LNG. [...] Industry practice is to store LNG as a boiling <b>cryogen.</b> [...] That is, the liquid is stored at its boiling point for the pressure at which it is stored (atmospheric pressure). [...] As the vapour boils off, heat for the phase change cools the remaining liquid. [...] Because the insulation is very efficient, only a relatively small amount of boil off is necessary to maintain temperature. [...] This phenomenon is also called auto-refrigeration.|$|E
2500|$|In {{winter in}} coastal Arctic locations, the delta T between the {{seawater}} and ambient air {{can be as}} high as 40°C (72°F). Closed-cycle systems could exploit the air-water temperature difference. Eliminating seawater extraction pipes might make a system based on this concept less expensive than OTEC. This technology is due to H. Barjot, who suggested butane as <b>cryogen,</b> because of its boiling point of [...] and its non-solubility in water. Assuming a level of efficiency of realistic 4%, calculations show that the amount of energy generated with one cubic meter water at a temperature of [...] in a place with an air temperature of [...] equals the amount of energy generated by letting this cubic meter water run through a hydroelectric plant of 4000 feet (1,200 m) height.|$|E
40|$|Advancement in Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) Technologies is {{essential}} for achieving NASA's future long duration missions. Propulsion systems utilizing <b>cryogens</b> are necessary to achieve mission success. Current State Of the Art (SOA) CFM technologies enable cryogenic propellants to be stored for several hours. However, some envisioned mission architectures require <b>cryogens</b> to be stored for two years or longer. The fundamental roles of CFM technologies are long term storage of <b>cryogens,</b> propellant tank pressure control and propellant delivery. In the presence of heat, the <b>cryogens</b> will "boil-off" over time resulting in excessive pressure buildup, off-nominal propellant conditions, and propellant loss. To achieve long term storage and tank pressure control, the CFM elements will intercept and/or remove any heat from the propulsion system. All functions are required to perform both with and without {{the presence of a}} gravitational field. Which CFM technologies are required {{is a function of the}} <b>cryogens</b> used, mission architecture, vehicle design and propellant tank size. To enable NASA's crewed mission to the Martian surface, a total of seventeen CFM technologies have been identified to support an In-Space Stage and a Lander/Ascent Vehicle. Recognizing that FY 2020 includes a Decision Point regarding the In-Space Stage Architecture, a set of CFM Technology Development Roadmaps have been created identifying the current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of each element, current technology "gaps", and existing technology development efforts. The roadmaps include a methodical approach and schedule to achieve a flight demonstration in FY 2023, hence maturing CFM technologies to TRL 7 for infusion into the In-Space Stage Preliminary Design...|$|R
