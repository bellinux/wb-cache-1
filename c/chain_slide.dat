50|$|Polymers {{fracture}} via {{breaking of}} inter- and intra molecular bonds; hence, the chemical structure {{of these materials}} plays a huge role in increasing strength. For polymers consisting of <b>chains</b> which easily <b>slide</b> past each other, chemical and physical cross linking {{can be used to}} increase rigidity and yield strength. In thermoset polymers (thermosetting plastic), disulfide bridges and other covalent cross links give rise to a hard structure which can withstand very high temperatures. These cross-links are particularly helpful in improving tensile strength of materials which contain lots of free volume prone to crazing, typically glassy brittle polymers. In thermoplastic elastomer, phase separation of dissimilar monomer components leads to association of hard domains within a sea of soft phase, yielding a physical structure with increased strength and rigidity. If yielding occurs by <b>chains</b> <b>sliding</b> past each other (shear bands), the strength can also be increased by introducing kinks into the polymer chains via unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds.|$|R

The model accurately predicts the cross-sectional microstructure of carbon fibers, predicting features such as graphitic sheets and hairpin structures that have been observed experimentally.

Here we suggest that trapped cold ions in an optical lattice can also be of help in understanding stick-slip friction, and also the way friction changes {{when one of the}} sliders undergoes structural transitions. For that scope, we simulated the dynamical properties of a 101 -ions <b>chain,</b> driven to <b>slide</b> back and forth by a slowly oscillating electric field in an incommensurate periodic "corrugation" potential of increasing magnitude U 0. We found the <b>chain</b> <b>sliding</b> to switch, as U 0 increases and before the Aubry transition, from a smooth-sliding regime with low dissipation to a stick-slip regime with high dissipation. In the stick-slip regime the onset of overall sliding is preceded by precursor events consisting of partial slips of few ions only, leading to partial depinning of the chain, a nutshell remnant of precursor events at the onset of motion also observed in macroscopic sliders. Seeking to identify the possible effects on friction of a structural transition, we reduced the trapping potential aspect ratio until the ion chain shape turned from linear to zigzag. Dynamic friction was found to rise at the transition, reflecting the opening of newer dissipation channels. Comment: 9 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

Solvation force oscillations {{are found to be}} associated with the layering transition of liquid film and unstable jumps of AFM tip position. Detailed structural analyses and molecular animations show that the local permeation of chain molecules and the squeeze out of molecules near the edge of contact promote the layering transition under compression.

The soliton excitations of the DNA bases make localized base pair opening and travel along the DNA chain in the form of a bubble.

The microstructural origin of this behavior {{is difficult to}} ascertain with macroscopic observations. This article aims at identifying the deformation mechanisms of a solid propellant by measuring the change in segmental mobility with deformation. The novelty lies {{in the use of}} 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometry to investigate the spin–spin relaxation times T 2 of a solid propellant. In addition, the effect of strain on T 2 is measured using a specific setup transmitting the loading of the tensile machine to the sample inside the NMR apparatus. We compare isolated components, unfilled binders, and solid propellants varying in composition according to a design of experiments. The design of experiments determines the influences of the filler fraction, the amount of curing agents, the plasticizer content, and the presence of filler–binder bonding agents, on the segmental mobilities. The propellant protons can be schematically divided into three segmental mobilities corresponding to distinct relaxation times. The short times correspond to the severely restricted segments situated around cross-links or fillers. The intermediate relaxation times correspond to segments of polymer chains linked at both ends. Finally, the long relaxation times correspond to the highly mobile segments of polymers (dangling ends) and to the plasticizer molecules. The influence of strain on the relaxation times shows that the polymer network is stretched between the fillers while part of the polymer in the sol fraction is immobilized.

On the other hand, the simulations without the branch point motion predicted unreasonably slow relaxation for asymmetric star polymers. For asymmetric star polymers, further tests with and without the branch point hopping revealed that the hopping is much less important compared to the branch point fluctuation when the lengths of the short and long backbone arms are not very different and the waiting time for the branch point hopping (time for removal of all sliplinks on the short arm) is larger than the backbone relaxation time.
