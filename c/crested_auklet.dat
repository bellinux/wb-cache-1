2500|$|Fairway Rock (Census block 1047, Nome, Alaska) {{is a small}} islet in the Bering Strait, located {{southeast}} of the Diomede Islands and west of Alaska's Cape Prince of Wales. It has an area of 0.3km2 (0.12mi2). Known to Eskimo natives of the Bering Strait region in prehistory, Fairway was documented by James Cook in 1778 and named by Frederick Beechey in 1826. Although uninhabited, the island is a nesting site for seabirds — most notably the least and <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> — which prompt egg-collecting visits from local indigenous peoples. [...] The United States Navy placed radioisotope thermoelectric generator-powered environmental monitoring equipment on the island from the 1960s through the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{coastal and}} some wetland areas, various water birds {{can come to}} {{contribute}} {{a large portion of}} both prey numbers and prey biomass. This may include more than 50 species of shorebird (from quite small sandpipers to the largest species of gull), more than 30 species of waterfowl, at least 10 species each of herons, 8 species of rails and any grebes or cormorants that are available. [...] The most regularly reported water bird prey in Europe were, roughly in this order, the [...] common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), the [...] Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), [...] mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), [...] black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), and the [...] Eurasian teal (Anas crecca). The diet of a handful of eagle-owl pairs in the Riau Islands Province of France were found to be dominated by water birds, especially the [...] yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), the colonial abundance of which allowed the eagle-owls to atypically occupy these small islands. The diet of eagle-owls in Norway was dominated in coastal areas by water birds, overall for the nation 53% of the food was made of birds, the species most commonly identified as caught being the [...] mew gull (Larus canus), [...] Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) and [...] common eider (Somateria mollissima). Despite access to large seabird breeding colonies, almost all large bird species hunted in Norway, including large forest grouse in more inland areas, were apparently fully-grown adults and most water birds were caught while resting on open coastal waters. Eagle-owls in northwestern Poland, an area heavily dotted with lakes, relied on birds for about 64% of the diet, more than half of which were water birds. The main prey species there was the Eurasian coot, at nearly 15% of the prey numbers. [...] In Primorsky Krai in Russia, 53.2% of the food for the eagle-owls were made up of birds, predominantly water birds with the primary prey species being the [...] <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> (Aethia cristatella [...] ) (26.9%). In the Russian Far East, similarly, birds occupy up to 57.6% of the diet, a lion’s share of which are water birds. In this study, the grey red-backed vole and reed vole (Microtus fortis) were the most numerous identified individual species but in some years the extremely large Japanese cormorant (Phalacrocorax capillatus), at , were more numerous as prey than either vole. Water birds were found to be even more important in the diet in Korea, as in wetland habitat, with birds in general comprising 68.9% by number and 85.3% by biomass there, but in adjacent upland areas birds were slightly secondary to mammals, which made up 38.7% by number and 64.7% by biomass, led by the brown rat. [...] In Korea, the mallard and the similar spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) made up 38.1% of the biomass. Other recorded bird species in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet includes most type of birds found in their range, including bustards, sandgrouse, parrots, cuckoos, swifts, the [...] hoopoe (Upupa epops), the [...] European bee-eater (Merops apiaster), the [...] common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), the [...] European roller (Coracias garrulus), at least seven species of woodpecker (from the smallest to the largest European species) and more than 80 species of passerine. Among passerines, the only family reported widely as prey besides corvids are thrushes. In the Italian Alps, Turdus species were the fourth most frequently recorded type of prey. In particular, the abundant [...] Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula) [...] is widely reported to be taken by eagle-owls. As thrushes are relatively small, at [...] among the species known to be predated, pairs in the Italian Alps who depended more so on thrushes usually showed lower productivity during nesting attempts.|$|E
50|$|In species {{where both}} sexes invest highly in parental care, mutual choosiness is {{expected}} to arise. An {{example of this is}} seen in <b>crested</b> <b>auklets,</b> where parents share equal responsibility in incubating their single egg and raising the chick. In <b>crested</b> <b>auklets</b> both sexes are ornamented.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crested</b> <b>auklets</b> {{primarily}} forage in deep waters, however {{sometimes in}} areas {{closer to the}} shore, but always in large flocks. Little {{is known about the}} winter diets, however, it is suggested that they feed on a variety of marine invertebrates. <b>Crested</b> <b>auklets</b> are planktivores. Their diet consists mainly of krill, but they are also known to eat copepods, pteropods (such as Limacina), amphipods and larval fishes. <b>Crested</b> <b>auklets</b> dive {{from the surface of the}} water to catch their food. This behavior has been described as underwater [...] "flight".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crested</b> <b>auklets</b> {{are unique}} {{in their use}} of optical, vocal, and {{olfactory}} signals in mating. Their communicative behavior is more complex and diversified than that of closely related species. There are three general evolutionary mechanisms proposed to address the origin of the elaborate display traits of <b>crested</b> <b>auklets,</b> and of showy mating signals by males in general: ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1769 by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas, who named it Aethia cristatella. The genus Aethia includes four auklet species. There are no subspecies of <b>crested</b> <b>auklet.</b> The family Alcidae consists of {{many species of}} shorebirds including other auklets (not in the genus Aethia), puffins, razorbills, guillemots, and murres.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: This <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> was oiled in Alaska {{during the}} M/V Selendang Ayu spill of 2004.|$|E
50|$|In total, Semisopochnoi {{supports}} {{well over}} a million seabirds, {{most of which are}} least <b>auklets</b> or <b>crested</b> <b>auklets.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Crested</b> <b>auklets</b> {{are highly}} social during the {{breeding}} season, before pair formation, and after pair formation. Within a breeding year, however, <b>crested</b> <b>auklets</b> are monogamous, with only 10% {{of the population}} having extra-pair copulations. Partners continue to self-advertise to other birds {{when they are not}} incubating. While some of this advertising behavior can be linked to extra-pair mating, it is suggested that continuation of the behavior allows birds to find pairs for the next breeding season. Only 45.5% of birds remain with the same partner in the subsequent breeding season.|$|R
50|$|Auklets are {{have high}} site fidelity, {{at both the}} colony and crevice level, {{although}} {{there can be a}} high divorce rate of up to 33% in least and <b>crested</b> <b>auklets</b> when both mates survive.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} and summer <b>crested</b> <b>auklet,</b> tufted puffin, and pigeon {{guillemot}} nest on the island; there is also a colony of black-legged kittiwake.|$|E
50|$|While {{there is}} {{variation}} in displays across populations, <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> crests and plume ornaments are consistent in expression within an individual over time. Furthermore, {{there is little}} sexual dimorphism or evidence of condition dependence. From studies, {{it seems to be}} a survival-neutral ornament. Some studies, however, offer up a functional purpose for these ornaments. One study suggests a link between habitat complexity and facial feathering, where tactile facial elongation helps individuals navigate complex underground crevices. The high density of <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> nesting sites can be expected to impose selective pressures on sensory mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Hanna Shoal {{is also an}} {{important}} foraging area for many bird species. Species that have been identified in this region are black-legged kittiwake, black guillemot, <b>crested</b> <b>auklet,</b> glaucous gull, ivory gull, northern fulmar, pomarine jaeger, and Ross’s gull.|$|E
5000|$|Auklets are {{typically}} very social and nest in dense colonies (Parakeet auklets are more dispersed). [...] All {{have some form}} of facial ornamentation such as large crests (Whiskered and <b>crested</b> <b>auklets),</b> auricular plumes (all four species), and <b>crested</b> and whiskered <b>auklets</b> have a tangerine-scented odour which may function in mate choice or species recognition, although this requires more study.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crested</b> <b>auklets</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} the northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. They are particularly prevalent during the non-breeding winter months along the Aleutian Islands, Kuril Islands and the Russian island of Sakhalin. They travel to breeding locations on the islands and shorelines of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea during the late spring and summer. [...] Their habitats consist of slopes, boulder fields, lava flows, and sea cliffs. They are often found with other auklet species such as the least auklet. On a daily basis, <b>crested</b> <b>auklets</b> circle 500 meters above {{the sea and the}} breeding colonies. This circling is triggered by disturbances and predators posing a threat.|$|R
50|$|Both sexes invest highly in parental care; parents share {{equally in}} {{incubating}} the single egg {{and raising the}} chick. Since both sexes are ornamented, <b>crested</b> <b>auklets</b> align with Robert Trivers's parental investment theory, which predicts that with biparental care, mutual choosiness will arise.|$|R
50|$|The large least and <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> colony near Sugarloaf Head {{is one of}} {{the largest}} among the nine auklet colonies in the Aleutian Islands. Crested auklets and least auklets breed in one colony, located on the south facing slopes of Sugarloaf Peak volcano and its {{associated}} cinder cones near Sugarloaf Head. Semisopochnoi Island also supports a significant population of red-faced cormorants.|$|E
50|$|Steller {{sea lions}} {{occur on the}} islands, while {{in the spring and}} summer {{millions}} of seabirds nest on the islands, including roughly six million least auklet (possibly the largest colony in the world), over 900,000 northern fulmar, and tens of thousands of parakeet auklet; <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> also nest on the islands. These islands are part of the Magandskiy Zapovednik or protected bioregion of the Magadan area.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> (Aethia cristatella) {{is a small}} seabird of {{the family}} Alcidae, {{distributed}} throughout the northern Pacific and the Bering Sea. The species feeds by diving in deep waters, eating krill {{and a variety of}} small marine animals. It nests in dense colonies of up to 1 million individuals in the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk. It often breeds in mixed-species colonies with the least auklet, a smaller congener.|$|E
50|$|Coastal cliffs provide nesting {{habitat for}} more than 600,000 seabirds, mostly for crevice nesting auklets. Least Auklets account for 62% of the colony, <b>Crested</b> <b>Auklets</b> for 30%, and Parakeet Auklets for 6%. Each of these species is present on the island in numbers {{exceeding}} 1% of their global populations.|$|R
50|$|Specific odors in <b>crested</b> <b>auklets</b> are {{directly}} related to courtship behavior. This species will preferentially orient to a specific tangerine-scented plumage odor during mechanistic courtship behavior that involves the smelling of the scented neck region. This is one way odor transmission can occur for a sexually selective mate assessment.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} home to 21 species of {{breeding}} seabirds, making it the most diverse seabird colony in the Northern Hemisphere. The island's colonies include <b>crested</b> <b>auklets</b> and least auklets, as well as puffins, storm petrels and other species. It {{is one of only}} four locations in the world where red-legged kittiwakes breed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> {{can measure}} 18 - 27 cm in length, 34 - 50 cm in {{wingspan}} and weigh 195 - 330 g. They have a reddish-orange and yellow tipped bill, yellowish white irises, and white auricular plumes from {{their eyes to}} their ears. Their bodies, wings, and tails are primarily dark sooty grey, while their legs and feet are grey and claws black. The males and females are very similar, although the females have slightly smaller and less curved bills, additionally slightly smaller crests.|$|E
50|$|Talan Island (Остров Талан) , {{is a small}} roundish island, {{which lies}} 11 km (6.8 mi) {{to the north of}} Spafaryev's {{northern}} tip. It is 2 km (1.2 mi) across. Large colonies of seabirds nest on the island in the spring and summer, including over a million <b>crested</b> <b>auklet,</b> a few hundred thousand tufted and horned puffin, tens of thousands of black-legged kittiwake, and thousands of parakeet auklet and ancient murrelet. Common murre also nest here and in the summer dovekie congregate on the island. Steller's sea eagle prey on these seabirds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> is {{recognized}} primarily by two characteristics during the breeding season. The first is its crest, {{a group of}} bristle feathers located on top of its head above its eyes. The second is a social odor that the auklets produce during the breeding season, described as smelling like tangerines. This odor originates from tiny wick feathers, located in {{a small patch of}} skin between the shoulder blades. In winter plumage, their bills are smaller and dull yellow. They lack accessory plates and their crest and auricular plumes are reduced.|$|E
5000|$|All Aethia auklets lay {{one white}} egg {{in a natural}} crevice and {{incubate}} for 25-36 days, after which, a semi-precocial chick emerges and fledges after 25-35 days. [...] Age at first breeding is estimated at 3-5 years. [...] Colony sizes are highly variable, and range from less than 100 individuals to over 1 million, although least and <b>crested</b> <b>auklets</b> tend to nest in greater density than parakeet and whiskered auklets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crested</b> <b>auklets</b> {{are known}} for their {{forehead}} crests, which is made of black forward-curving feathers. These forehead crests are highly variable, and can have between two and twenty three narrow forward curving feathers. The average <b>auklet</b> has 12 <b>crest</b> feathers, which are of variable length, between 8.1 and 58.5 millimetres. Auklets have auricular plumes and a bright orange bill with curved accessory plates. Like forehead crests, these features vary widely within auklet populations.|$|R
50|$|Asserted dominance, {{with regards}} to claimed display area, has been {{correlated}} with crest length in both males and females. The existence of these showy monomorphic traits is indicative of intense sexual selection for both sexes. Large-crested adults of both sexes receive higher levels of sexual interest and displays from the opposite sex compared to those with smaller <b>crests.</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>auklets</b> with larger <b>crests</b> {{are more likely to}} obtain mates and to form pair bonds earlier.|$|R
50|$|The sole {{specimen}} {{of the species}} consists of a partial skeleton on a slab, that includes an incomplete skull, most of the trunk, right wing, parts of the tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus. This species was probably mid-sized for a duck in life, and had arm bones, in particular the humerus, that are much stouter than those of any other anatids. The ulna is short relative to the humerus and hand, as in auks and penguins. As in the <b>crested</b> <b>auklet,</b> the processus extensorius of the carpometacarpus is well-developed and extends less than it does in other diving birds.|$|E
50|$|Fairway Rock (Census block 1047, Nome, Alaska) {{is a small}} islet in the Bering Strait, located {{southeast}} of the Diomede Islands and west of Alaska's Cape Prince of Wales. It has an area of 0.3 km2 (0.12 mi2). Known to Eskimo natives of the Bering Strait region in prehistory, Fairway was documented by James Cook in 1778 and named by Frederick Beechey in 1826. Although uninhabited, the island is a nesting site for seabirds — most notably the least and <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> — which prompt egg-collecting visits from local indigenous peoples. The United States Navy placed radioisotope thermoelectric generator-powered environmental monitoring equipment on the island from the 1960s through the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Paramushir has a sub-arctic climate {{strongly}} modulated by {{the cooling}} {{effects of the}} North Pacific Oyashio Current. The arboreal flora of Paramushir is consequently limited to dense, stunted copses of Siberian dwarf pine and shrubby alder. The alpine tundra which dominates the landscape produces plentiful edible mushrooms and berries, especially lingonberry, Arctic raspberry, whortleberry and crowberry. Red fox, Arctic hare and ermine are notably abundant and hunted by the inhabitants. The island also supports a population of brown bears. In the spring <b>crested</b> <b>auklet</b> nest on the island. The straits between Paramushir and Shumshu island support a notably dense population of sea otters; harbor seals are also common.|$|E
5000|$|According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, <b>crested</b> <b>auklets</b> are {{of least}} concern. [...] The global {{population}} {{is estimated to}} be six million individuals, while the North American population is estimated at 2.9 million birds. However, an accurate assessment of the number of birds is difficult, since those {{on the surface of the}} colony and in the nearby sea form only a small proportion of the variable and poorly understood population.|$|R
25|$|The island {{supports}} a breeding colony of about 35,000 seabirds, including some 25,000 least <b>auklets</b> and <b>crested</b> <b>auklets.</b> In 1925, the tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata), horned puffin (Fratercula radionuclidia), parakeet auklets (Aethia psittacula), and Pallas' murre (Uria lomvia arra) were reported at Fairway Rock, nesting in the crevices of the island's cliffs. A 1960 account reports that Eskimo inhabitants of Little Diomede reported a glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) colony on Fairway Rock {{larger than that}} on Little Diomede.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{occupation}} site on {{the island}} is now considered a National Historic Landmark (the highest level of recognition accorded to historic sites in the US) and is protected under federal law. The island is {{also a part of}} the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (AMNWR) and contains the largest colony of least auklets (over 1,160,000 birds) and <b>crested</b> <b>auklets.</b> Research biologists from Memorial University of Newfoundland have been studying the impact of introduced Norway rats on the seabirds of Kiska since 2001.|$|R
