2500|$|Visitors to Harmony {{commented on}} the {{commercial}} and industrial work being done in this religious settlement along the Wabash River. [...] "It seemed as though I found myself {{in the midst of}} Germany," [...] noted one visitor. In 1819 the town had a steam-operated wool carding and spinning factory, a horse-drawn and human-powered threshing machine, a brewery, distillery, vineyards, and a winery. The property included an orderly town, [...] "laid out in a square", with a church, school, store, dwellings for residents, and streets to create [...] "the most beautiful city of western America, because everything is built in the most perfect symmetry". Other visitors were not as impressed: [...] "hard labor & coarse fare appears to be the lot of all except the family of Rapp, he lives in a large & handsome brick house while the rest inhabit small log cabins. How so numerous a population are kept quietly & tamely in absolute servitude it is hard to conceive—the women I believe do more labor in the field than the men, as large numbers of the latter are engaged in different branches of manufactures." [...] Although they were not paid for their work, the 1820 manufacturer's census reported that 75 men, 12 women, and 30 children were employed, [...] in the Society's tanneries, saw and grain mills, and woolen and cotton mills. Manufactured goods included <b>cotton,</b> <b>flannel,</b> and wool cloth, yarn, knit goods, tin ware, rope, beer, peach brandy, whiskey, wine, wagons, carts, plows, flour, beef, pork, butter, leather, and leather goods.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The role of {{bacteria}} in meibomian gland dysfunction is unclear, yet contamination of compresses used as treatment may exacerbate this condition. This study therefore determined {{the effect of}} heating on bacteria on two forms of compress. METHODS: <b>Cotton</b> <b>flannels</b> and MGDRx EyeBags (eyebags) were inoculated by adding experimental inoculum (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; one species for each set of 3 eyebags and flannels). One of each were then randomised in to 3 groups: no heating (control); therapeutic (47. 4 ± 0. 7 °C); or sanitisation (68 ± 1. 1 °C). After treatment, bacteria cell numbers were calculated. The experiment was repeated in triplicate. RESULTS: There was {{a statistically significant difference}} between each treatment with the eyebag for S. aureus (control= 7. 15 ± 0. 11 logC/ml, therapeutic heating= 5. 24 ± 0. 59 logC/ml, sanitisation heating= 3. 48 ± 1. 43 logC/ml; P< 0. 001) and S. pyogenes (7. 36 ± 0. 13, 5. 73 ± 0. 26, 4. 75 ± 0. 54; P< 0. 001). P. aeruginosa also showed a significant reduction (P< 0. 001) from control (6. 39 ± 0. 34) to therapeutic (0. 33 ± 0. 26) and sanitisation (0. 33 ± 0. 21), but the latter were similar (P= 1. 000). For the flannels, there was significant difference between each treatment for S. aureus (6. 89 ± 0. 46, 3. 96 ± 1. 76, 0. 42 ± 0. 90; P< 0. 001). For S. pyogenes, there was a significant reduction (P< 0. 001) from control (7. 51 ± 0. 10) to therapeutic (5. 91 ± 0. 62) and sanitisation (5. 18 ± 0. 8), but the latter were similar (P= 0. 07). For P. aeruginosa, {{there was a significant difference}} (P< 0. 001) from control (7. 15 ± 0. 36) to sanitisation (5. 83 ± 0. 44); but not to therapeutic (6. 84 ± 0. 31) temperatures (P= 0. 07). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic heating produces a significant reduction in bacteria on the eyebags, but only sanitisation heating appears effective for flannels. However, patients should be advised to heat the eyebag to sanitisation temperatures on initial use...|$|R

50|$|Lightweight white, solid-color or printed plain weave, satin weave, or <b>flannel</b> <b>cotton</b> or cotton/polyester blends are {{the most}} common types of sheeting, {{although}} linen and silk may also be used, including in combination. Goose or duck down and other feathers are frequently used as a warm and lightweight filling in duvets, comforters and quilts. But such fill can protrude in part even from tightly-woven fabric, and be an irritant for many people, particularly those with allergies. Natural and synthetic down alternatives are marketed. Cotton, wool or polyester batting is commonly used as fill in quilts and down alternative comforters. These are less expensive and more easily laundered than natural down or feathers. Synthetic fibers are best in the form of thermofused (where fibers cross) batting. Thick-woven or knitted wool, cotton, acrylic or other microfiber synthetics, or blends of these, are typically used for blankets.|$|R

40|$|PREFACE In early America most quilts {{were made}} for {{utilitarian}} purposes. Later, when time and fabrics became more plentiful, quilt making developed into an art form which flourished during the 19 th century and continues to do so today. Within the broad definition of 2 ̆ 2 patchwork, 2 ̆ 2 three types are represented in this exhibition-pieced, applique and crazy. Pieced quilts are made from materials cut in geometric shapes and put together in pattern blocks. These blocks are repeated to form the quilt top. The designs were often of political, historical or religious events, but many also were associated with abstract visual ideas and images. 2 ̆ 2 Rocky Road to California 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Lincoln Quilt 2 ̆ 2 are examples of the first category; 2 ̆ 2 Indiana Puzzle 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Log Cabin 2 ̆ 2 the second; 2 ̆ 2 Star of Bethlehem 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Jacobs Ladder 2 ̆ 2 the third. Names, however, varied for the identical pattern in different localities. Applique quilts are made by cutting patterns and sewing them to a base cloth. Usually these were not made for regular household use, but rather tended to be the 2 ̆ 2 pretty 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 quilts and had flowers, trees, birds or fruit as motifs. Crazy quilts are made of odd-shaped {{bits and pieces of}} material put together in a random pattern. These reached their artistic height in the Victorian era when fabrics such as silks and velvets replaced <b>cottons</b> and <b>flannels.</b> Creative stitchery fills in certain patches and lines the edges of others. Crazy quilts were often used as decorative throws on couches. All the quilts in this exhibition belong to either museums or individuals in Nebraska and many were made by native Nebraskans. Of special note are the five quilts created by Mrs. Grace Snyder of North Platte. Almost three hundred examples were assembled for consideration and from this number fifty-five were selected solely on their merits as works of art. Their patterns, colors and materials illustrate the wide range quilting provides for individual creativity. Considerations relating to workmanship, condition and age were not used as criteria of primary importance. From this selective sampling {{it can be seen that}} 2 ̆ 2 quilt making 2 ̆ 2 is an art form of quality and importance. INTRODUCTION A quilt is a bedcover, that 2 ̆ 7 s for sure, but it is not a coverlet nor is it a counterpane. It is usually made of two thicknesses of fabric, the top or front pieced together from a variety of materials in a number of colors; the back or lining is generally of one piece in one color, the two frequently but not invariably sandwich a layer of soft padding and the whole thing is stitched through from front to back in a pattern which may conform tei the pieced design or may, on the contrary, follow its own pattern in a kind of visual counterpoint. The pattern can be further embellished with needlework of various kinds, ornamental or commemorative, and, after generations of practice and invention, quilt making has achieved an iconography of its own reflecting the domestic inspirations of uncounted, anonymous, female artists. One has only to recite the names of the traditional patterns to sense the interplay of skill and imagination which makes a quilt into a work of art. At their functional level they have kept the sleeper warm. In addition they have filled the role of social coordinator. They have been the inspiration of virtuoso needlework as well as creative invention. They have been valued elements in a dowry and part of an inheritance handed down through the generations of a family. At their most extraordinary levels of accomplishment they have been status symbols, entirely divorced from the vulgarity of use. Nowadays they are apt to hang on a wall like a painting and to even hang on the walls of an art gallery, their apotheosis achieved. All these considerations have come into play in the organization of this exhibition and it is more than a pleasure to acknowledge the hard work of the members of the Lincoln Quilters Guild and the staff of the Sheldon Gallery in bringing to public attention the achievements of this traditional anonymous art as it exists in the public and private collections of Nebraska. Fortunately, some of the makers are known to us, some of them are giving the art its contemporary form, and we are happy to give them the recognition they deserve. As a gallery-community collaboration it is a pleasure to acknowledge in particular Mrs. Velda Coffey, who first brought the idea of the exhibition to our consideration, Mrs. Mary Ghormley, Mrs. Louise Howey, Mrs. Jean Harnsberger, Mrs. Sally Campbell all of whom provided the knowledge, energy and enthusiasm which is so necessary to the realization of such projects. Our thanks as well to Mrs. Imelda DeGraw of the Denver Museum, who brought a trained curatorial eye to the selection of examples to be shown, to Jon Nelson whose installation took full advantage of the visual amenities of the Sheldon Gallery and to Mrs. Beth Gutcheon who brought to the opening workshop the essential warmth of the creative process itself. Lastly, the catalogue which provides a permanent record of the event, is in no small way the result of the fastidious professionalism of Kaz Tada and Paul Bateman...|$|R

5000|$|In 1953, Scharff was {{preparing}} to design and unveil {{a new kind of}} a nightgown, [...] "the granny gown," [...] made of inexpensive <b>cotton</b> <b>flannel,</b> which {{went on to become the}} Lanz Incorporated’s signature product. It was based on a dress that Scharff's landlady had worn. The gown soon became a popular cover-up for women in the late 1950s. The popularity of Lanz of Salzburg line, eventually helped the company to reorganize and expand to 30 retail stores and establish a manufacturing division. Wendy Wasserstein, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright is known to have worn a Lanz nightgown while writing.|$|E
50|$|The ayam {{generally}} {{consists of}} mobu (모부, a crown) and deurim (드림) which are shaped like daenggi (댕기) {{or a big}} ribbon. The upper 4-5 cm part of the mobu is finely quilted, the vertical line of the front shorter than the back's. On the bottom edge, the front part is more curved than the back. In addition, the vertical lines of {{the front and back}} are a little curvy, so that, when wearing an ayam, it fits well to one's head. Black or purple silk is used for the upper quilted part of the outer fabric, while black or dark brown fur is used {{for the rest of the}} mobu. The fabric for the inner is red <b>cotton</b> <b>flannel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, {{some women}} use a {{washable}} or reusable cloth menstrual pad. These {{are made from}} a number of types of fabric — most often <b>cotton</b> <b>flannel,</b> or hemp (which is highly absorbent and not as bulky as cotton). Most styles have wings that secure around the underpants, but some are just held in place (without wings) between the body and the underpants. Some (particularly the older styles) are available in belted styles. Washable menstrual pads {{do not need to be}} disposed of after use and therefore offer a more economical alternative for women. Also called [...] "mama cloth", reusable menstrual pads can be found on a number of websites, or are made at home (instructions are available online). They have become a popular alternative and are gaining in popularity among women, because they are allergen- and perfume-free, and can be more comfortable for women who suffer from irritations from using disposable pads.|$|E

40|$|Rolled, {{continuous}} stationary phases {{were constructed}} by tightly rolling and packing a whole piece of textile woven fabric into a chromatography column. Columns packed {{in this manner}} possess important features such as low intraparticle mass transfer and high pressure endurance. These properties, as reflected by a reduction of residence time within a column, show promise in decreasing protein purification costs for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. This technique, once commercialized, will create a new value-added market for textile fabrics. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the capabilities of rolled, continuous stationary phase columns in size exclusion chromatography (SEC) separation, ion exchange chromatography (IEC) separation, and pore characterization of cellulase enzyme treated cotton. ^ SEC stationary phase columns were prepared from ten cotton-based fabrics with different yarn diameter, fabric count, fabric compressibility, fabric weave, and/or different chemical treatment(s). The optimal packing parameter with respect to column mass was identified to be 7. 5 – 8 grams for a column with the dimension 180 mm by 10 mm, length by inner diameter. Evaluation of resolution, plate height, and void fraction of the packed column revealed the general requirements of a good SEC separation for a fabric to be large yarns, a small fabric count, and a plain weave with napping. A complete separation of protein from salt was achieved {{on a series of}} <b>cotton</b> <b>flannel</b> stationary phases that were 510 mm long and 10 mm in diameter. <b>Cotton</b> <b>flannel</b> anion exchangers with a static protein capacity of 45 mg/g were prepared from a quaternary ammonium 3 -chloro- 2 -hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride (CHPTAC) with a repeated padding method. Columns packed with CHPTAC derivatized <b>cotton</b> <b>flannel</b> completely resolved BSA and lysozyme. A complete separation of BSA from lysozyme on a scoured <b>cotton</b> <b>flannel</b> column suggested that at pH 8. 0, the fabric is negatively charged on the surface. With the rolled, continuous stationary phase technique, pore volume and surface area of cellulase enzyme treated cotton were characterized. No increase in pore volume or surface area was observed after enzyme hydrolysis, which agrees with the non-increasing dye uptake of enzyme treated fabric. ...|$|E
