5|$|Although in {{operational}} use the Vulcan typically carried various nuclear armaments, {{the type}} {{also had a}} secondary <b>conventional</b> role. While performing <b>conventional</b> combat missions, the Vulcan could carry up to 21 bombs inside its bomb bay. From the 1960s, the various Vulcan squadrons would routinely conduct <b>conventional</b> training missions; the aircrews {{were expected to be}} able to perform <b>conventional</b> bombing missions in addition to the critical nuclear strike mission the Vulcan normally performed.|$|E
5|$|Any second-order {{automaton}} may {{be transformed}} into a <b>conventional</b> cellular automaton, in which the transition function depends only on the single previous time step, by combining pairs of states from consecutive time steps of the second-order automaton into single states of a <b>conventional</b> cellular automaton.|$|E
5|$|In {{petroleum}} geology, {{these black}} shales {{are an important}} source rock that filled <b>conventional</b> petroleum reservoirs in overlying formations, are an unconventional shale gas reservoir, and are an impermeable seal that traps underlying <b>conventional</b> natural gas reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>conventional</b> {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a <b>conventional</b> way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The <b>conventional</b> level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. <b>Conventional</b> morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conventional</b> {{prenatal}} {{tests for}} chromosomal abnormalities such as Down Syndrome rely on analysing {{the number and}} appearance of the chromosomesthe karyotype. Molecular diagnostics tests such as microarray comparative genomic hybridisation test a sample of DNA instead, and because of cell-free DNA in plasma, could be less invasive, but as of 2013 it is still an adjunct to the <b>conventional</b> tests.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of the six}} quartets in the set {{has four}} {{movements}}, and in each case the movements are ordered in a <b>conventional</b> fast–slow–minuet–fast sequence.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using <b>conventional</b> imaging techniques. The resolution of <b>conventional</b> electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E
5|$|Gas uptake and {{elimination}} {{are assumed}} to be exponential, as in <b>conventional</b> Haldanean models.|$|E

5|$|Hovercraft were {{introduced}} in 2002, allowing rescue on mud flats and in river estuaries inaccessible to <b>conventional</b> boats.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>conventional</b> {{for persons}} present when the {{national}} anthem is performed to stand with their arms by their sides.|$|E
5|$|Maglev trains were {{initially}} considered for some lines of Phase 3, but DMRC decided {{to continue with}} <b>conventional</b> rail in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and <b>conventional</b> {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though <b>conventional</b> hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, they can not be recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Western soon {{replaced}} it with a more <b>conventional</b> one-story wooden station slightly to the west. Although well-liked, it proved too small within a decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and <b>conventional</b> transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. <b>Conventional</b> TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E
5|$|The largest bomb used {{in combat}} during the war, Tarzon {{was used in}} strikes against North Korean bridges and other {{hardened}} targets, the Tarzon's improved accuracy over <b>conventional</b> 'dumb bombs' led to the confirmed destruction of at least six high-priority targets during approximately six months of combat use; these included a hydroelectric plant, proving the effectiveness of guided weapons against <b>conventional</b> targets as well as bridges.|$|E
5|$|The {{manufacturers}} have {{made every effort}} to make the very different technology of this car appear similar to <b>conventional</b> cars.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{section in}} Thunder Bay is a four-lane, {{undivided}} expressway. The remainder of Highway61 is a <b>conventional</b> two-lane highway.|$|E
5|$|The six {{stages of}} moral {{development}} are grouped into three levels: pre-conventional morality, <b>conventional</b> morality, and post-conventional morality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conventional</b> Pap—In a <b>conventional</b> Pap smear, {{samples are}} smeared {{directly}} onto a microscope slide after collection.|$|E
25|$|Some economists {{dispute the}} <b>conventional</b> {{theory of the}} reserve requirement. Criticisms of the <b>conventional</b> theory are usually {{associated}} with theories of endogenous money.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{advantages}} of <b>conventional</b> kiln drying include higher throughput and better {{control of the}} final moisture content. <b>Conventional</b> kilns and solar drying both enable wood to be dried to any moisture content regardless of weather conditions. For most large-scale drying operations solar and <b>conventional</b> kiln drying are more efficient than air drying.|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{construction}} low-wing cantilever monoplane, <b>conventional</b> in layout, with a fixed {{landing gear}} and a closed cockpit. The fuselage was semi-monocoque, plywood-covered. Single-piece trapezoid wings with rounded tips, two-spar, plywood (in front) and canvas covered. <b>Conventional</b> cantilever empennage, plywood (fins) and canvas (elevators and rudder) covered. Two seats side-by-side, with twin controls, under a common canopy, with a fixed windshield. <b>Conventional</b> fixed landing gear with a rear skid.|$|E
25|$|Complementary and {{alternative}} medicine (CAM) treatments are the {{diverse group of}} medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that {{are not part of}} <b>conventional</b> medicine and have not been proven to be effective. Complementary medicine usually refers to methods and substances used along with <b>conventional</b> medicine, while alternative medicine refers to compounds used instead of <b>conventional</b> medicine. CAM use is common among people with cancer.|$|E
25|$|This {{compares to}} {{operating}} costs for <b>conventional</b> oil wells which {{can range from}} less than one dollar per barrel in Iraq and Saudi Arabia to over six in the United States and Canada's <b>conventional</b> oil reserves.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} adding cetuximab to <b>conventional</b> chemotherapy (cisplatin) versus cisplatin alone. This study found no improvement in survival or disease-free survival {{with the addition of}} cetuximab to the <b>conventional</b> chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|The Electric Storage {{fuel cell}} is a <b>conventional</b> battery {{chargeable}} by electric power input, using the <b>conventional</b> electro-chemical effect. However, the battery further includes hydrogen (and oxygen) inputs for alternatively charging the battery chemically.|$|E

25|$|The backup {{style of}} bowling {{is where the}} bowler will flick their wrist {{clockwise}} (for right handers) or counter clockwise (for left handers) upon release of the ball. Like a <b>conventional</b> release that generates hook, this technique will also cause the ball to move in a curved path {{rather than in a}} straight line. However a right handed backup will follow a left handed <b>conventional</b> path, and a left handed backup will follow a right handed <b>conventional</b> path.|$|E
25|$|By 1922 Henry {{founded the}} Berliner Aircraft Company {{with a focus}} on <b>conventional</b> aircraft. The Berliner Helicopter was {{successfully}} demonstrated throughout the 1920s but interest was lost due to its limited controllability and engine-out abilities compared to the autogyro and <b>conventional</b> aircraft.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conventional</b> solar box cookers attain {{temperatures}} up to 165°C (325°F). They can sterilize {{water or}} prepare most foods {{that can be}} made in a <b>conventional</b> oven or stove, including bread, vegetables and meat over a period of hours.|$|E

25|$|Quantum dot {{cellular}} automata (sometimes {{referred to}} simply as quantum cellular automata, or QCA) are a proposed improvement on <b>conventional</b> computer design (CMOS), {{which have been}} devised in analogy to <b>conventional</b> models of cellular automata introduced by von Neumann.|$|E
25|$|Routing {{a cluster}} by a cluster in each hop, where {{the number of}} nodes in each cluster is larger or equal to one. MIMO routing is {{different}} from <b>conventional</b> (SISO) routing since <b>conventional</b> routing protocols route node-by-node in each hop.|$|E
25|$|Everything we do, {{we believe}} in {{challenging}} the <b>conventional,</b> {{we believe in}} thinking differently. The way we challenge the <b>conventional</b> is by making something which is original, innovative and precisely what a user needs. We just happened to make a great cricket app.|$|E
