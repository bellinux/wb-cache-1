5|$|Many fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), {{and other}} fungi. Serious {{pathogens}} of many cultivated plants causing extensive damage and losses to {{agriculture and forestry}} include the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for <b>chestnut</b> <b>blight,</b> and plant pathogens in the genera Fusarium, Ustilago, Alternaria, and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous fungi, like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets.|$|E

25|$|Ecologically {{motivated}} {{research into}} genetic modification is underway. There are ongoing schemes that aim to foster disease resistance in trees {{such as the}} American chestnut (see <b>Chestnut</b> <b>blight)</b> and the English elm (see Dutch elm disease) {{for the purpose of}} their reintroduction to the wild. Specific diseases have reduced the populations of these emblematic species {{to the extent that they}} are mostly lost in the wild. Genetic modification is being pursued concurrently with traditional breeding techniques in an attempt to endow these species with disease resistance.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the {{potential}} for significant blight resistance to be randomly expressed in the nuts ACCF sends out has increased, following the culling {{of large numbers of}} mature trees which did not pass resistance tests in their largest orchard. The ACCF is always in need of more good cooperating growers, to help carry on the all-American breeding program, by raising nuts and seedlings and reporting their progress to a central data base.Many ACCF <b>chestnuts</b> have expressed <b>blight</b> resistance equal to an original blight survivor but so far, only a handful have demonstrated superior, durable blight control.

50|$|Grafts {{from large}} {{survivors}} of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant Americans were made beginning in 1980. The first all-American intercrosses are planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in Giles County, VA, and in Beckley, WV. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 & 1992. Nine of them showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test. It appears that inheritance of resistance requires genes of two trees with good combining ability from each source location. Thus, more generations of controlled crosses {{may be required to}} make American <b>chestnuts</b> produce <b>blight</b> resistance that is regularly inherited by seednuts. It takes at least 7 years for an American chestnut to produce nuts, and new trees must be at least 5 years old before their resistance can be tested by inoculation; the test requires 2 years for evaluation. Some of this time may be saved by utilizing grafts, and further progress may result from Elkins' studies underway, to locate chemical markers for resistance. In the meanwhile, ACCF plantings of all-American intercrosses are producing, from open pollinations, large nut crops.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} pathogen for the European <b>chestnut</b> is the <b>blight</b> fungus Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr. The biological protection is the effective solution {{to control the}} fungus. A laboratory experiment was made to find the optimal time for the field application. The intensity of growth of the fungal colonies was analysed at different temperatures and on different medias. According for our concept on too low temperature (under 15 0 C) the growth of all the fungal colonies were slow. But on higher temperature (over 25 0 C) the intensity of growth was the same, as on the optimal room temperature (20 - 25 0 C). Based on these data and the Hungarian weather conditions the optimal times of field applications are in April-May {{and the end of}} September till mid-October...|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the upper}} course of the Tye River was bordered by the Virginia Blue Ridge Railway, a short line {{railroad}} built in 1915. Originally, the area was heavily forested with chestnut trees, which were harvested for lumber transported by the railroad. However, these were largely decimated by <b>chestnut</b> <b>blight</b> in the 1920s. Later, the railroad was used to transport several types of minerals mined nearby in small quantities, but that activity ended by 1970. Passenger train service had ended in 1939, although State Route 56 was built nearby. In the 1980s, the tracks were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|As climate warmed further around 3,000 B.C., beech, walnut, hickories, chestnut, and {{butternut}} grew. These trees produced nuts {{for feeding}} Archaic hunters; Archaic Indian populations grew more rapidly. As populations grew, large families became small tribes in various areas. During {{this time the}} 12 prominent hardwood tree species of Eastern North America existed in Warren County, which were Ash, Beech, Birch, Cherry, Chestnut, Elm, Hickory, Maple, Oak, Sweet Gum, Sycamore, and Walnut. The Chestnut tree is now extinct in Warren County, following the <b>Chestnut</b> <b>blight</b> that decimated the eastern U.S. in the earlier twentieth century. The Archaic period lasted from 8000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.|$|E
25|$|Byrd married Anne Douglas Beverley, a {{childhood}} friend, on October 7, 1913. They {{lived with her}} parents in Winchester until 1916, when he built a log cabin, named Westwood, in Berryville at a family-owned orchard, and they moved there. The cabin was constructed from chestnut logs and {{remains one of the}} few examples of natural chestnut bark existing in the United States due to the <b>chestnut</b> <b>blight.</b> The Byrds had three sons: Harry F. Byrd Jr., Bradshaw Byrd, and Richard Byrd, and one daughter, Westwood Beverly Byrd. In 1926, Byrd purchased Rosemont, an estate outside Berryville, adjacent to the family apple orchards.

5000|$|American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation (ACCF) is {{not using}} Oriental genes for blight resistance, but intercrossing among American {{chestnuts}} selected for native {{resistance to the}} blight, a breeding strategy described by the ACCF as [...] "All-American intercrosses." [...] John Rush Elkins, a research chemist and professor emeritus of chemistry at Concord University, and Gary Griffin, professor of plant pathology at Virginia Tech, {{think there may be}} several different characteristics which favor blight resistance. Both Elkins and Griffin have written extensively about the American chestnut. [...] They believe that by making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they will continue to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest. Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years, developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980. The first [...] "All-American intercrosses" [...] were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in Giles County, Virginia, and in Beckley, West Virginia. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test.

25|$|The Esopus was one {{of three}} valleys that trees {{followed}} into the Catskills, as revegetation of the mountain slopes took place in the glaciers' wake. First to come were the boreal species, such as balsam fir, that today persist only on the summits of the range's higher peaks. Next were the northern hardwoods, primarily beech, birch and maple species, that dominate much of the Catskill forests today. Last were southern hardwood species, mostly oak, hickory and American chestnut, probably following the Indians as they migrated north. Most of the chestnuts died in the <b>chestnut</b> <b>blight</b> of the early 20th century. Catskill forest historian Michael Kudish found that other southern hardwood species {{can be found in the}} Esopus valley all the way to Oliverea, a mile or so below the creek's source.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} the park, and in turn also its flora and fauna, is largely typical for mountainous regions of the eastern Mid-Atlantic woodland, and indeed {{a large portion of}} common species are typical of {{ecosystems}} at lower altitudes as well. On southwestern faces of some of the southernmost hillsides pine predominates and there is also the occasional prickly pear cactus, which grows naturally. In contrast, some of the northeastern aspects are most likely to have small but dense stands of moisture loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance. Other commonly found plants include oak, hickory, chestnut, maple, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The once predominant American chestnut tree was effectively brought to extinction by a fungus known as the <b>chestnut</b> <b>blight</b> during the 1930s – though the tree continues to grow in the park, it does not reach maturity and dies back before it can reproduce. Various species of oaks superseded the chestnuts and became the dominant tree species. Gypsy moth infestations beginning in the early 1990s began to erode the dominance of the oak forests as the moths would primarily consume the leaves of oak trees. Though the Gypsy moths seem to have abated some, they continue to affect the forest and have destroyed almost 10 percent of the oak groves.|$|E
25|$|Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial {{candidate}} (and the late Congressman Flood's nephew), Harry F. Byrd supported creation of Shenandoah National Park, as did his friend William E. Carson, a businessman {{who had become}} Virginia's first chairman of the Commission on Conservation and Development. Development of the western national parks had assisted tourism, which produced jobs, which Byrd and local politicians supported. The land that became Shenandoah park was scenic, mountainous, and had also lost about half of its trees to the <b>Chestnut</b> <b>blight</b> (which was incurable and affected trees as they reached maturity). However, it had been held as private property for over a century, so many farms and orchards existed. After Byrd became governor and convinced the legislature to appropriate $1 million for land acquisition and other work, Carson and his teams (including surveyors and his brother Kit who was Byrd's law partner) {{tried to figure out}} who owned the land. They found that it consisted of more than 5,000 parcels, some of them inhabited by tenant farmers or squatters (who were ineligible to receive compensation). Some landowners, including wealthy resort owner George Freeman Pollock and Luray realtor and developer L. Ferdinand Zerkel, had long wanted the park created and had formed the Northern Virginia Park Association to win over the national park selection committee. However, many local families who had lived in the area for generations (especially people over 60 years old) did not want to sell their land, and some refused to sell at any price. Carson promised that if they sold to the state, they could still live on their homesteads {{for the rest of their}} lives. Carson also lobbied the new President Herbert Hoover, who bought land to establish a vacation fishing camp near the headwaters of the Rapidan River (and would ultimately donate it to the park as he left office; it remains as Rapidan Camp).|$|E
