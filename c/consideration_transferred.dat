Paragraph 80 of Opinion 16 discusses the accounting for a contingency based on maintaining or achieving specified earnings levels.

This Issue only addresses the accounting for <b>consideration</b> <b>transferred</b> to settle a contingency based on earnings or other performance measures. This Issue refers to selling shareholders with positions that could affect the financial results of the acquired enterprise subsequent to the acquisition as "employees, " although it also could include officers, directors, consultants, or contractors. Paragraph 80 of Opinion 16 indicates that upon the resolution of a contingency based on earnings, any additional consideration paid is recorded by the acquiring enterprise as an additional cost of the acquired enterprise. However, paragraph 86 of Opinion 16 indicates that the substance of some agreements for contingent consideration is to provide compensation for services, use of property, or profit sharing and, in those circumstances...|$|E

40|$|A large {{variety of}} Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designs are {{currently}} in production or in development. These aircraft range from small electric quadcopters that are flown {{close to the ground}} within visual range of the operator, to larger systems capable of extended flight in airspace shared with conventional aircraft. Before RPA can operate routinely and safely in civilian airspace, we need to understand the unique human factors associated with these aircraft. The task of flying an RPA in civilian airspace involves challenges common to the operation of other highly-automated systems, but also introduces new considerations for pilot perception, decision-making, and action execution. RPA pilots participated in focus groups where they were asked to recall critical incidents that either presented a threat to safety, or highlighted a case where the pilot contributed to system resilience or mission success. Ninety incidents were gathered from focus-groups. Human factor issues included the impact of reduced sensory cues, traffic separation {{in the absence of an}} out-the-window view, control latencies, vigilance during monotonous and ultra-long endurance flights, control station design <b>considerations,</b> <b>transfer</b> of control between control stations, the management of lost link procedures, and decision-making during emergencies. Some of these concerns have received significant attention in the literature, or are analogous to human factors of manned aircraft. The presentation will focus on issues that are poorly understood, and have not yet been the subject of extensive human factors study. Although many of the reported incidents were related to pilot error, the participants also provided examples of the positive contribution that humans make to the operation of highly-automated systems...|$|R
