50|$|The {{principal}} disadvantages are {{the steps}} of energy conversion and transmission, because each inherently has loss. For combustion engine <b>cars,</b> <b>the</b> energy is lost when chemical energy in fossil fuels is converted by the engine to mechanical energy. For electric cars, a power plant's electricity (from whatever source) is transmitted to <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> batteries, which then transmits the electricity to <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> motor, which converts it to mechanical energy. For compressed-air <b>cars,</b> <b>the</b> power plant's electricity is transmitted to a compressor, which mechanically compresses the air into <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> tank. <b>The</b> <b>car's</b> engine then converts the compressed air to mechanical energy.|$|R
