25|$|In early 1944, a Dornier Do 217 crashed {{high up on}} the Vehner moor in Lower Saxony, between Osnabrück and Oldenburg, and it {{was decided}} to send the V11 to recover the wreckage. Unfortunately the V11 ended up {{crashing}} nearby before it could attempt to lift the Do 217's remains. It was then decided to attempt to recover both using the V14. Flown by Karl Bode and Luftwaffe helicopter pilot Helmut Gerstenhauer, the operation was begun on 11 May 1944. A small team of Focke-Achgelis men and a Luftwaffe recovery company had already dismantled the V11, and the V14 made 10 flights carrying loads beneath it in a <b>cargo</b> <b>net</b> and setting them down where they could be loaded onto road vehicles. All the major parts of the V11 and the Do 217 were retrieved, and much useful experience was gained.|$|E
50|$|In {{maritime}} situations, <b>cargo</b> <b>nets</b> can be {{slung over}} the side of a ship to allow passengers stranded in the water to climb aboard to safety. <b>Cargo</b> <b>nets</b> {{can also be used to}} transfer troops from a ship to landing craft.|$|R
5000|$|In shipping, <b>cargo</b> lift <b>nets</b> {{are used}} to load and unload <b>cargo.</b> The <b>net</b> is spread out by stevedores, who load the goods onto it. They then attach the cinches to a crane hook. Lifting the hook draws {{the corners of the}} <b>net</b> around the <b>cargo.</b> This results in a {{balanced}} and secure load which can be safely hoisted. Goods are transferred {{from one place to another}} in the construction industry using <b>cargo</b> <b>nets.</b> When used to transfer cargo by helicopter, they are referred to as [...] "underslung" [...] <b>cargo</b> <b>nets.</b>|$|R

He was {{pulled off the}} mudflat with a large <b>cargo</b> <b>net</b> and {{the help of the}} US Coast Guard. Both times, he was successfully guided back to the Pacific Ocean using a [...] "sound net" [...] in which people in a flotilla of boats made unpleasant noises behind the whale by banging on steel pipes, a Japanese fishing technique known as oikami. At the same time, the attractive sounds of humpback whales preparing to feed were broadcast from a boat headed towards the open ocean.|$|E

The S124 estate continued in production alongside the new W210 until the S210 estate launched {{more than a year}} later. A two-door coupé version was also built, with the chassis designation C124.|$|E
2500|$|After {{producing}} the band's previous tour, Zoo TV, which featured a complex setup involving 36 different video screens, [...] Williams {{did not want}} to produce another video-based show unless {{it was going to be}} completely different from its predecessor. His initial proposals to U2 featured physical designs, including a center stage surrounded by a racetrack with circling trucks and motorbikes. [...] Fisher researched one of the first LED screens to be imported into the United States. [...] (It was built for the State Fair of Texas in 1995). [...] Fisher proposed to make a much larger LED screen by spacing the pixels further apart, thus creating a lower resolution image. [...] A prototype was built with LED pixels placed 75mm (3in) apart on a <b>cargo</b> <b>net.</b> [...] It worked successfully and served as a basis for the proposal of the design. [...] The idea for producing another video-based tour gained much interest when Fisher and Williams were determined to create the largest video screen in existence at that time. [...] When the idea for the screen was proposed to U2, they decided to take the risk of creating a show based on an undeveloped technological experiment, and invested US$7 million to develop the screen.|$|E
