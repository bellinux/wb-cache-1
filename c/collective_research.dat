He {{requested}} to join, taking up a chair in what he called the [...] "history of systems of thought," [...] and his request was championed by members Dumézil, Hyppolite, and Vuillemin. In November 1969, when an opening became available, Foucault was elected to the Collège, though with opposition by a large minority. He gave his inaugural lecture in December 1970, which was subsequently published as L'Ordre du discours (The Discourse of Language). He was obliged to give 12 weekly lectures a year—and did so {{for the rest of his}} life—covering the topics that he was researching at the time; these became [...] "one of the events of Parisian intellectual life" [...] and were repeatedly packed out events. On Mondays, he also gave seminars to a group of students; many of them became a [...] "Foulcauldian tribe" [...] who worked with him on his research. He enjoyed this teamwork and <b>collective</b> <b>research,</b> and together they would publish a number of short books. Working at the Collège allowed him to travel widely, giving lectures in Brazil, Japan, Canada, and the United States over the next 14 years. [...] In 1970 and 1972, Foucault served as a professor in the French Department of the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York.|$|E
6000|$|The {{fundamental}} idea upon which Socialism rests {{is the same}} {{fundamental idea}} as that upon which all real scientific work is carried on. It is the denial that chance impulse and individual will and happening constitute the only possible methods by which things may {{be done in the}} world. It is an assertion that things are in their nature orderly, that things may be computed, may be calculated upon and foreseen. In the spirit of this belief Science aims at a systematic knowledge of material things. [...] "Knowledge is power," [...] knowledge that is frankly and truly exchanged--that is the primary assumption of the New Atlantis which created the Royal Society and the organization of research. The Socialist has just that same faith in the order, the knowableness of things and the power of men in co-operation to overcome chance; but to him, dealing as he does with the social affairs of men, it takes the form not of schemes for <b>collective</b> <b>research</b> but for collective action {{and the creation of a}} comprehensive design for all the social activities of man. While Science gathers knowledge, Socialism in an entirely harmonious spirit criticizes and develops a general plan of social life. Each seeks to replace disorder by order.|$|E

50|$|The <b>collective's</b> <b>research</b> {{was closely}} tied to the work of {{philosophers}} Sadie Plant (around whom it was founded), Nick Land, and their colleagues throughout the 1990s, and in particular the emerging cyberfeminist thinking that would lead to the Virtual Futures conferences at Warwick {{in the middle of the}} decade. Ultimately, Plant would abandon her academic post and affiliation with the Ccru in 1997, during which time it came under the direction of Land. Under his leadership, the collective became increasingly experimental and unorthodox in its work, with its output (which included writing, performance events, and collaborative art) crossing post-structuralism, cybernetics, science-fiction, rave culture, and occult studies. In 2015, a collection of Ccru pieces entitled Ccru: Writings 1997-2003 was published.|$|R
40|$|<b>Collective</b> memory <b>research</b> {{examines}} {{how the process}} of individual memory formation is a social and collective experience, rather than one that is wholly psychological and individual. The stories that societies tell about themselves {{are an important part}} of this process, as they seek to socialize new members into the national community. But sometimes that national history is very difficult to deal with. Most <b>collective</b> memory <b>research</b> is based on a single case study approach. What is lacking in <b>collective</b> memory <b>research,</b> although not absent, are broader comparative studies. This article develops a general model for the process of collective memory formation, which I can then use in my ongoing empirical research into how several different authoritarian and democratic societies with Eastern and Western cultural traditions have dealt with their violent histories. The cases include Germany (East and West), Japan, Turkey, Yugoslavia and Spain. In this article, I develop a general model of collective memory formation while drawing upon these five cases to illustrate different points. While democratic societies have a greater potential for dealing more fully with their difficult histories, it is far from guaranteed that they will do so...|$|R

50|$|One of Mall's {{other goals}} was {{to raise the}} {{prestige}} of anatomists {{and the study of}} anatomy in America.
