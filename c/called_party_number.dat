50|$|If the PSAP {{receives}} {{calls on}} older-style digital trunks, they are specially formatted Multi-Frequency (MF) trunks that pass the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> <b>number</b> (ANI) only.

50|$|Address {{information}} is not passed along by the public phone network; only the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> phone <b>number</b> is passed. The PSAP uses the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> <b>number</b> to locate the address in the Automatic Location Identification (ALI) database. The ALI database is secured and separate from the public phone network by design. It is generally maintained by the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) under contract by the PSAP.

50|$|The {{telephone}} exchanges may be connected via E1 or T1 trunks which transport the speech from the calls. These trunks {{are divided into}} 64 kbit/s timeslots, and one timeslot can carry exactly one call. Regardless of what facilities are used to interconnect switches, each circuit between two switches is uniquely identified by a circuit identification code (CIC) that {{is included in the}} ISUP messages.

If the destination is an extension that is registered to the call agent, then the call-agent will instruct the phone instrument to send the ring out of the ring buzzers of the phone and simultaneously instruct the calling phone instrument to play the ringing tone. After the rings are played, and when the destination person answers the phone, Call-agent instructs the phones to send the voice traffic, called as [...] "RTP Voice (Real Time Protocol) Traffic" [...] directly to each other.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems based on SIP have {{replaced}} many traditional telephony deployments. Interworking VoIP systems {{with the traditional}} telephone network has reduced the overall level of <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> <b>number</b> and Caller ID assurances by granting attackers new and inexpensive tools to impersonate or obscure <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> <b>numbers</b> when orchestrating bulk commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail boxes, or even circumventing multi-factor authentication systems trusted by banks. Despite previous attempts to provide a secure assurance {{of the origin of}} SIP communications, we still lack effective standards for identifying the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> in a VoIP session. This document examines the reasons why providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has proven so difficult and shows how changes in the last decade may provide us with new strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP sessions. It also gives high-level requirements for a solution in this space. Status of This Memo This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.

5000|$|Therefore, if {{a calling}} party {{being at the}} PSTN network dials a called party ENUM number by touch typing the E.164 <b>called</b> <b>party</b> <b>number,</b> the number will be {{translated}} at the ENUM gateway into the corresponding URI. This URI {{will be used for}} looking-up and fetching the NAPTR record obtaining the called party wishes about how the call should be forwarded or terminated (either on IP or on PSTN terminations) - the so-called access information - which the registrant (the called party) has specified by writing his/her choice at the NAPTR record ("Naming Authority Pointer Resource Records" [...] as defined in RFC 3403), such as e-mail addresses, a fax number, a personal website, a VoIP number, mobile telephone numbers, voice mail systems, IP-telephony addresses, web pages, GPS coordinates, call diversions or instant messaging. Alternatively, when the calling party is at the IP side, the User Agent (UA) piece of software of the dialler will allow to dial a E.164 number, but the dialler UA will convert it into a URI, to be used for looking-up at the ENUM gateway DNS and fetch the NAPTR record obtaining the called party wishes about how the call should be forwarded or terminated (again, either on IP or on PSTN terminations).|$|E

2500|$|A {{telephone}} number {{serves as an}} address for switching telephone calls using a system of destination code routing. [...] Telephone numbers are entered or dialed by a <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> on the originating telephone set, which transmits the sequence of digits {{in the process of}} signaling to a telephone exchange. The exchange completes the call either to another locally connected subscriber or via the PSTN to the <b>called</b> <b>party.</b> Telephone <b>numbers</b> are assigned within the framework of a national or regional {{telephone number}}ing plan to subscribers by telephone service operators, which may be commercial entities, state-controlled administrations, or other telecommunication industry associations.|$|R

50|$|In general, CID as {{transmitted}} from {{the origin of}} the call is only the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> full phone <b>number</b> (including area code, and including international access code and country code if it's an international <b>call).</b> The <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> name is added by the consumer's terminating central office if the consumer has subscribed to that service. Calling name delivery is not automatic. A SS7 (or Signalling System 7) TCAP query may be launched by the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> central office, in order to retrieve the information for Calling Name delivery to the caller ID equipment at the consumer's location, if the caller's name has not already been associated with the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> line at the originating central office. Canadian systems using CCS7 automatically (but not in all cases) send the calling name with the call set-up and routing information {{at the time of the}} call.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, some {{countries}} offer anonymous caller rejection, which rejects all calls when the subscriber's name, number (or both) is blocked. Some telephone companies protect their clients from receiving blocked information by routing anonymous calls to a service (such as AT&T Privacy Manager), where {{the caller is}} required to announce himself or herself. The service then asks the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> {{if they want to}} accept or reject the call. Other telephone companies play a recording to the caller advising them of the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> rejection configuration, and often offer advice (such as prefixing their dialing with *82) on how to get their call to the intended <b>called</b> <b>party.</b> Blocking the <b>number</b> is referred to as calling line identification restriction (CLIR). Emergency services will most likely be able to show the restricted number using a service called calling line identification restriction override (CLIRO), or by using general ANI services.|$|R
