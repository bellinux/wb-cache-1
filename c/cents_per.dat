Within a year, the course became very crowded and disorganized, with crowds behaving poorly.

Only caddies with badges could be hired, and bicycles, baby strollers, horse-riding, and horse-drawn carriages were banned from the course.|$|E

In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide a measure to raise the school tax from two <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> hundred dollars of taxable property to five <b>cents</b> <b>per</b> hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the strongest in the antebellum South.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to measure {{compliance}} with agreed protocols for prophylactic antibiotics for five elective procedures: transurethral resection of the prostate, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, joint arthroplasty and herniorrhaphy in two teaching hospitals. Design/methodology/approach: Compliance was measured during the pre and post intervention periods by reviewing medical records. Findings: Overall, compliance improved by 18 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (95 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CI: 12 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> 23 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> with greater improvements for transurethral resection of the prostate and hysterectomy, increasing by 27 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (95 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CI: 14 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> 40 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> and 24 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (95 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CI: 16 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> 32 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> respectively. Compliance remained low for cholecystectomy (17 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> and hysterectomy (25 <b>per</b> <b>cent).</b> Overall, the proportion of patients not receiving any prophylaxis where its use was indicated, declined by 6 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (95 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CI: 1 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> 11 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> from 23 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> The use of additional anti-microbials that were not recommended in the protocol was high for joint arthroplasty 65 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> and hysterectomy 71 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> but overall this practice declined by 8 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (95 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CI: 3 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> 14 <b>per</b> <b>cent).</b> Costs were reduced from $ 11. 72 to $ 10. 53 per patient between the pre and post intervention groups, while a complete adoption of the protocols could reduce costs by 70 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> to $ 3. 40. There were large variations in correct dosages and timing of antibiotics between procedural groups. Practical implications: although compliance improved there were large differences between the specialties. The adoption of preventive strategies is fundamental to providing safe patient care. The use of inappropriate antimicrobials {{is also an important}} patient safety issue that contributes to antibiotic resistance and is associated with increased costs. Introducing change in health organizations is difficult and the factors influencing successful change strategies require further study. Originality/value: The paper measures and improves compliance with agreed protocols in health care intervention procedures...|$|R
