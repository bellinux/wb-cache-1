50|$|Character {{creation}} involves assigning {{points to}} seven statistics, or attributes: Agility (how physically able the <b>character</b> <b>is),</b> Endurance (how healthy and tough the <b>character</b> <b>is),</b> Intelligence (how well does the character learn, comprehend, remember, or know things), Perception (how aware the <b>character</b> <b>is</b> of their environment), Presence (how cool and intimidating the <b>character</b> <b>is),</b> Reflexes (how fast the <b>character</b> <b>is),</b> and Strength (how physically fit the <b>character</b> <b>is).</b>|$|R
40|$|Handwritten Kanji <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> {{assessed}} by Hayashi 2 ̆ 7 s Quantification Method: a multivariate analysis on categorical variables. Sample <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> 528 handwritten <b>characters</b> selected from signatures written by 230 students. Thirty three {{subjects were asked}} to classify these characters into three levels of legibility: Good-Ordinary-Poor. Good-writing and Poor-writing <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> selected on the majority of this classification. As a result, 50 <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> selected as Good-writing group and 45 <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> selected as Poor-writing one. These <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> analyzed by the Quantification Method. The predictor variables were some global features and local features. First, a discriminant analysis of this method was proceeded between Good-writing group and Poor-writing group. The minimax hit rate of this analys is was 90. 8...|$|R

5|$|The {{characters}} and objects {{are composed of}} simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. Most child <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> {{the same size and}} shape, and are distinguished by their clothing, hair and skin colors, and headwear. <b>Characters</b> <b>are</b> mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle. Their movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion, as they are purposely not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters. Occasionally, some non-fictional <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> depicted with photographic cutouts of their actual head and face in lieu of a face reminiscent of the show's traditional style. Canadians on the show are often portrayed in an even more minimalist fashion; they have simple beady eyes, and the top halves of their heads simply flap up and down when the characters speak.|$|E

25|$|In Chinese, {{many more}} <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> {{simplified}} than in Japanese; some <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> simplified {{in only one}} language; other <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> simplified {{in the same way}} in both languages, and other <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> simplified in both languages but in different ways. This means that those who want to learn the writing systems of both languages must sometimes learn three different variations of one character: traditional Chinese, modern Chinese, and modern Japanese (for example 兩 - 两 - 両).|$|R
40|$|Eighty {{subjects}} viewed {{and visually}} imagined upright or rotated alphanumeric characters and later judged whether test <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> previously seen or imagined (reality monitoring). Identification and test <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> presented verbally or visually. When <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> identified and tested verbally, source confusions (misjudging a seen character as 2 ̆ 2 imagined 2 ̆ 2 and vice-versa) were infrequent and were comparable for rotated and upright <b>characters.</b> When <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> identified and tested visually, source confusions were {{more frequent and}} <b>were</b> influenced by <b>character</b> rotation. Memories for imagined <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> especially susceptible to source confusion. Also source confusions for seen characters increased when <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> rotated. These {{results are consistent with}} the proposal that increasing sensory similarity between perceived and imagined items increases source confusion and that perceived rotation generates cognitive operations similar to those generated when the subject imagines a character rotated...|$|R

5|$|The two {{duplicate}} <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> Ippo and Mamoru Takamura.

He wears sweats and a T-shirt rather than the boxing trunks the other characters wear. This version is based on when Ippo began boxing and was training to fight his rival, Ichiro Miyata. The weaker Takamura has less muscle mass and looks ill. He is based on a fight in the manga when Takamura overdid his weight management.|$|E
