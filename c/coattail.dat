25|$|A {{company may}} also perform direct ambush {{marketing}} by —factually marketing {{their role in}} connection to an event or its participants. For example, a company which produces sporting equipment may advertise {{that they are the}} official supplier for a specific athlete or team. Similarly, a non-sponsor may choose to solely sponsor the event's telecast by a broadcaster, but not the event itself. The factual acknowledgment of a non-sponsor's involvement with the participants in an event by, for example, a television host or commentator, can also be considered an incidental form of <b>coattail</b> marketing, as it provides additional unpaid publicity to the brand.|$|E

With Republicans {{taking control of the}} U.S. Senate, Packwood was in line to become chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Fellow Oregon Republican Senator Mark Hatfield was also elevated to chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, giving Oregon power in the Senate it had never seen before.|$|E

50|$|Presidential <b>coattails</b> is {{the ability}} of a Presidential {{candidate}} to bring out supporters who then vote for his party's candidates for other offices. In effect, the other candidates are said to ride on his <b>coattails.</b> Before the introduction of the secret ballot in the late 19th century, voters cast their ballots by taking a ticket provided by a party worker and putting it in the ballot box. The party-column ballot listed all candidates of the party in a single column and allowed the voter to mark off the party box at the top, which encouraged straight-party voting and the <b>coattails</b> effect. Straight-party voting was the norm, and winners in Presidential elections often had long <b>coattails.</b> They almost always began their term with majorities in the House and Senate.|$|R

In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal contended that being an [...] "Albany careerist" [...] and running confusing campaign ads had hurt Tedisco.

40|$|This article takes {{a closer}} look at how presidential {{elections}} affect the fragmentation of the legislative party system. It reviews the theory and conventional empirical modelling strategy; identifies some drawbacks to this strategy and suggests solutions; and then conducts an empirical investigation of the implications of this critique by combining replication data from Golder (2006) with new data on the key variables measuring the presidential <b>coattails.</b> Fortuitously, the literature’s findings about the shadow cast by presidential elections, usually known as the presidential <b>coattails,</b> are relatively robust. However, important differences emerge on the margins, such as regarding the effect of midterm elections. Moreover, this article demonstrates that subsequent presidential elections, like concurrent and preceding ones, cast shadows, too. It also demonstrates that the conventional modelling strategy underestimates the presidential <b>coattails...</b>|$|R
500|$|The Dream, {{also known}} as the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Sculpture, is an outdoor bronze {{sculpture}} of Martin Luther King Jr. by Michael Florin Dente, located outside the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Oregon. The [...] memorial statue was dedicated on August 28, 1998, the 35th anniversary of King's [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech. It depicts King plus three allegorical sculptures: a man who symbolizes the American worker, a woman who represents immigration, and a young girl shown releasing King's <b>coattail,</b> who represents, according to Dente, the [...] "letting go" [...] that occurs when people sacrifice their time and energy to engage in a struggle.

500|$|When {{producing}} Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, co-director Takeshi Nozue {{had difficulty}} developing {{a framework for}} Tifa's body that was [...] "balanced, yet showed off her feminine qualities." [...] Her outfit too was redesigned at this point, with emphasis on expressing those qualities, while still being pleasing to the eye. A white tank top with black zipped up vest covers her front, a pink ribbon wraps around her left biceps, and boots cover her feet. A black buttoned-up skirt covers her thighs, and she wears shorts beneath, {{with a piece of}} cloth similar to a <b>coattail</b> extending {{from the back of the}} skirt's waistband and ending at her ankles. While her gloves remain, they are worn only during the film's fight scenes. Her hairstyle was changed to end at the middle of her back, with the removal of the dolphin tail from her original design. This alteration was because of the difficulty of animating her original length of hair, as well as problems that arose due to its black color and lighting.|$|E
500|$|According to Dente, {{the working}} class man [...] "has come to the {{realization}} and {{made the decision to}} step forward to announce his support for the universal message of equality, freedom and justice". Dente described the girl's release of King's <b>coattail</b> as [...] "a 'letting go' process when one or more members of a family is called away to contribute their energy and time to a concept and struggle of greatest importance to all people of the world." [...] The artist dedicated the monument to King's sacrifices, to those who believe in King's message, and to the [...] "ongoing march for truth and justice". Business and organizations that contributed $10,000 or more to the project are recognized at the statue. Funders included ARCO, Chevron Corporation, Fred Meyer, The Greenbrier Companies/Gunderson, Inc., International Art Group, Kaiser Permanente, Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, Meier & Frank, Oregon Health & Science University, Oregon Labor Unions AFL–CIO, Oregon Lottery, Portland Development Commission, Portland Trail Blazers, RH Parker/United Foundation, US West, and the William G.

500|$|The Gunfight at the OK Corral is {{a famous}} {{example of a}} real-life western shootout, between the Earp Brothers {{together}} with Doc Holliday, and the Clanton-McLaury gang. It lasted only 30 seconds, contrary to many movie adaptations. The gunfight itself did not actually happen in the corral, but in a vacant lot outside of it. The shooting started when Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury cocked their pistols. Both parties simultaneously drew their guns, which added to the confusion of who fired first. It is not known who fired the first shot, but Wyatt's bullet {{was the first to}} hit, tearing through Frank McLaury's belly and sending McLaury’s own shot wild through Wyatt’s <b>coattail.</b> Billy Clanton fired at Virgil, but his shot also went astray when he was hit with Morgan's shot through his ribcage. Billy Claiborne ran as soon as shots were fired and was already out of sight. Ike Clanton panicked as well and ran towards Wyatt pleading for his life. [...] "Go to fighting or get away!", Wyatt yelled and watched Ike desert his brother Billy and run. Doc instantly killed Tom with blasts from his shotgun. Frank was running to Fremont Street, and he challenged Holliday for killing his brother, but Doc dropped his shotgun, drew his pistol, and shot Frank in the right temple. Wounded and dying, Billy Clanton fired blindly into the gun smoke encircling him, striking Virgil's leg. Wyatt responded by sending several rounds into Billy.|$|E
2500|$|Elections are {{influenced}} by many variables. Some political scientists speculate there is a <b>coattail</b> effect (when a popular president or party position {{has the effect of}} reelecting incumbents who win by [...] "riding on the president's coattails"), although {{there is some evidence that}} the <b>coattail</b> effect is irregular and possibly declining since the 1950s. Some districts are so heavily Democratic or Republican that they are called a safe seat; any candidate winning the primary will almost always be elected, and these candidates do not need to spend money on advertising. But some races can be competitive when there is no incumbent. If a seat becomes vacant in an open district, then both parties may spend heavily on advertising in these races; in California in 1992, only four of twenty races for House seats were considered highly competitive.|$|E
