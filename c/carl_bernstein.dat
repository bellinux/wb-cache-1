The book gained interest in 2005, with the revelation that Felt was [...] "Deep Throat", the Watergate scandal whistleblower who assisted Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward in his and <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernsteins</b> investigation. By 2005, Felt was in declining health and {{unable or unwilling to}} explain why he assisted in the Washington Posts journalists with their stories, which ultimately led to the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon.

25|$|Executive editor Ben Bradlee, a Kennedy loyalist, put the newspaper's {{reputation}} and resources behind reporters Bob Woodward and <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein,</b> who, {{in a long}} series of articles, chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate Hotel complex in Washington. The Post dogged coverage of the story, the outcome of which ultimately {{played a major role in}} the resignation of President Richard Nixon, won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Alfred Bernstein was {{director}} of negotiations for the UPWA from 1946 to 1952. He later represented hundreds of government employees before loyalty-oath committees.

40|$|This project {{examines}} how the youth center {{is viewed as}} an environment of learning. Furthermore, how the Danish School Reform from 2014 has impacted on the learning potentials in the youth center. In this project, four interviews have been made which {{form the basis of}} the analysis. The interviews consist of one leader of a youth center, a child and youth worker, and four children (two boys and two girls). In order to investigate this subject matter three theorists have been elected, this include Basil <b>Bernstein,</b> <b>Carl</b> Rogers, and Etienne Wenger. Through this investigation we found that the youth center contains many potentials of learning, which mainly include developing social skills. The skills accomplished through the youth center have more flexible structure which offers children more co-determination and room for creativity. The School Reform consequences on the youth center involve to shorten the actual time children are in it and cause more tired children. The implication of this is that some learning potentials are impeded...|$|R
5000|$|Animaniacs {{utilized}} a heavy {{musical score}} for an animated program, with every episode featuring {{at least one}} original score. The idea for an original musical score in every episode came from Steven Spielberg. Animaniacs used a 35-piece orchestra, and seven composers were contracted to write original underscore for the series run: Richard Stone, Steve <b>Bernstein,</b> Julie <b>Bernstein,</b> <b>Carl</b> Johnson, J. Eric Schmidt, Gordon Goodwin, and Tim Kelly. The use of the large orchestra in modern Warner Bros. animation began with Animaniacs predecessor, Tiny Toon Adventures, but Spielberg pushed for its use even more in Animaniacs. Although the outcome was a very expensive show to produce, [...] "the sound sets us apart from everyone else in animation," [...] said Jean MacCurdy, the executive in charge of production for the series. According to Steve and Julie Bernstein, {{not only was the}} Animaniacs music written in the same style as that of Looney Tunes composer Carl Stalling, but that the music was recorded at the Eastwood Scoring Stage, which was used by Stalling as well as its piano. Senior producer Tom Ruegger said that writers Randy Rogel, Nicholas Hollander, and Deanna Oliver wrote [...] "a lot of music" [...] for the series.|$|R
25|$|The {{connection}} between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by The Washington Post, Time, and The New York Times. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political repercussions. Relying heavily upon anonymous sources, Post reporters Bob Woodward and <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein</b> uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into {{the upper reaches of}} the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed Judy Hoback Miller, the bookkeeper for Nixon, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{newspaper}} has won 47 Pulitzer Prizes. This includes six separate Pulitzers {{awarded in}} 2008, the second-highest number ever awarded {{to a single}} newspaper in one year, second only to The New York Times seven awards in 2002. Post journalists have also received 18 Nieman Fellowships and 368 White House News Photographers Association awards. In the early 1970s, in the best-known episode in the newspaper's history, reporters Bob Woodward and <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein</b> led the American press' investigation into {{what became known as}} the Watergate scandal; reporting in the newspaper greatly contributed to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. In years since, its investigations have led to increased review of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.|$|E
25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein</b> as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E
500|$|Washington Post journalists <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein</b> and Bob Woodward {{used the}} phrase [...] "Tinker to Evers to Chance" [...] in their account of the Post {{investigation}} of the Watergate scandal in their 1974 book, All the President's Men. The reference described the smooth operation of President Richard Nixon's White House staff in responding to [...] allegations of misconduct.|$|E
500|$|At {{the awards}} {{ceremony}} for the 200 metres at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City John Carlos, Tommie Smith and Peter Norman ignored death threats and official warnings {{to take part}} in an anti-racism protest that destroyed their respective careers. W. Mark Felt an agent of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation who retired in 1973 as the Bureau's Associate Director, acted on conscience to provide reporters Bob Woodward and <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein</b> with information that resulted in the Watergate scandal. Conscience was a major factor in US Public Health Service officer Peter Buxtun revealing the Tuskegee syphilis experiment to the public. The 2008 attack by the Israeli military on civilian areas of Palestinian Gaza was described as a [...] "stain on the world's conscience". Conscience was {{a major factor in the}} refusal of Aung San Suu Kyi to leave Burma despite house arrest and persecution by the military dictatorship in that country.|$|E
500|$|This episode marked Hardin's first {{appearance}} as Deep Throat. Series creator Chris Carter {{stated that the}} character {{was inspired by the}} historical Deep Throat, an informant who leaked information about the FBI's investigation of the Watergate scandal to journalists <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein</b> and Bob Woodward. This Deep Throat was later revealed to be FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. Also cited as an influence was X, the character portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK. Carter created the character {{to bridge the gap between}} Mulder and Scully and the shadowy conspirators working against them; describing Deep Throat as a man [...] "who works in some level of government that we have no idea exists". Carter was drawn to Hardin after seeing him in The Firm, and described the casting as an [...] "easy choice". Hardin flew to Vancouver every few weeks to film his scenes. Carter called Hardin's portrayal [...] "very, very good".|$|E
500|$|The term Watergate {{has come}} to {{encompass}} an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken {{by members of the}} Nixon administration. Those activities included [...] "dirty tricks," [...] or bugging the offices of political opponents and the harassment of activist groups and political figures. The activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into Democratic party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1972. The Washington Post picked up on the story; reporters <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein</b> and Bob Woodward relied on an informant known as [...] "Deep Throat"—later revealed to be Mark Felt, associate director at the FBI—to link the men to the Nixon administration. Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics, calling news articles biased and misleading. A series of revelations {{made it clear that the}} Committee to Re-elect President Nixon, and later the White House, was involved in attempts to sabotage the Democrats. Senior aides such as White House Counsel John Dean faced prosecution; in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{has stated}} that the {{character}} of Deep Throat was [...] "of course" [...] inspired by the historical Deep Throat. The real Deep Throat was an informant leaking information on the FBI's investigation of the Watergate scandal to journalists <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein</b> and Bob Woodward. After the conclusion of The X-Files, this Deep Throat was later revealed to be FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. Also cited as an influence on the fictional Deep Throat was X, the character portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK. In the film, Sutherland's X reveals information {{about the possibility that}} the assassination of John F. Kennedy was orchestrated by elements within the American government. Carter felt he needed to create a character who would bridge the gap between FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and the shadowy conspirators who were working against them; he conceived of a character [...] "who works in some level of government that we have no idea exists".|$|E
500|$|The rhyme {{has also}} {{been used as a}} {{reference}} in more serious literary works, including as a recurring motif of the Fall of Man in James Joyce's 1939 novel Finnegans Wake. Robert Penn Warren's 1946 American novel All the King's Men is the story of populist politician [...] Willie Stark's rise to the position of governor and eventual fall, based on the career of the corrupt Louisiana Senator Huey Long. It won the 1947 Pulitzer Prize and was twice made into a film All the King's Men in 1949 and 2006, the former winning the Academy Award for best motion picture. This was echoed in <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein</b> and Bob Woodward's book All the President's Men, about the Watergate scandal, referring to the failure of the President's staff to repair the damage once the scandal had leaked out. It was filmed as All the President's Men in 1976, starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman. Similarly, Humpty Dumpty is referred to in Paul Auster's 1985 novel City of Glass, when two characters discuss him as [...] "the purest embodiment of the human condition" [...] and quote extensively from Through the Looking Glass. Luis d'Antin van Rooten's 1967 book Mots d'Heures, a collection of homophonically translated poetry, includes a version of the rhyme in nonsensical French text, beginning [...] "Un petit d'un petit, S'étonne aux Halles...".|$|E

2500|$|Writers <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein,</b> {{the veteran}} investigative {{journalist}} of the Watergate scandal, and Vatican expert Marco Politi, {{were the first}} journalists to talk to Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka in the 1990s about her importance in John Paul's life. They interviewed her and dedicated 20 pages to her in their 1996 book His Holiness. Bernstein and Politi even {{asked her if she}} had ever developed any romantic relationship with John Paul II, [...] "however one-sided it might have been." [...] She responded, [...] "No, I never {{fell in love with the}} cardinal. How could I fall in love with a middle-aged clergyman? Besides, I’m a married woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{was married}} three times. Her first marriage, to writer Dan Greenburg, {{ended in divorce}} after nine years.

In 1979, Ephron had a toddler son, Jacob, and was pregnant with her second son Max when she discovered Bernstein's affair with their mutual friend, married British politician Margaret Jay. Ephron was inspired by this to write the 1983 novel Heartburn, which was then made into a 1986 Mike Nichols film starring Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep. In the book, Ephron wrote of a husband named Mark, who was [...] "capable {{of having sex with}} a Venetian blind." [...] She also wrote that the character Thelma (based on Margaret Jay) looked like a giraffe with [...] "big feet." [...] Bernstein threatened to sue over the book and film, but he never did.|$|E
2500|$|William Mark Felt Sr. (August 17, 1913– December 18, 2008) was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{special agent}} {{who served as}} the Bureau's Associate Director, the FBI's second-highest-ranking post, from May 1972 until his {{retirement}} from the FBI in June 1973. During his time as Associate Director, Felt served as an anonymous informant, nicknamed [...] "Deep Throat", to reporters Bob Woodward and <b>Carl</b> <b>Bernstein</b> of The Washington Post, providing them critical information about the Watergate scandal, a scandal which ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974. Though Felt's identity as Deep Throat was strongly suspected by some in Washington, including Nixon himself, and was speculated by many others, it generally remained a secret for the next 30 years. In 2005, Felt finally acknowledged that he was Deep Throat, after being persuaded to reveal his identity by his family.|$|E
