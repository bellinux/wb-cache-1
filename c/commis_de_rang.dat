We discuss in detail the necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of these type of solutions written in terms of Riemann invariants. The most important characteristic of this approach is the introduction of specific first order side conditions consistent with the original system of PDEs, leading to a generalization of the Riemann invariant method of solving multi-dimensional systems of PDEs. We have demonstrated the usefulness of our approach through several examples of hydrodynamic type systems; new classes of solutions have been obtained in a closed form.

We focus on a medical context, where the existing works generally provide large environments to monitor patients using sensors as simple transducers. Those devices forward sensed health parameters to a main base station. This station collects received data and may perform some computations. In this paper, we perform some distributed tasks on the sensors. We propose a distributed algorithm, which allows to raise alarms under some initial rules to alert efficiently medical staff in case of critical situations without needless warnings. Each mote monitors a parameter. When this parameter reaches an abnormal value, the mote communicates with other motes in order to check {{if it is a}} ‘local' anomaly or if the patient is in an abnormal situation. In such cases an alarm is raised. We implemented our algorithm over a network of micaZ sensors running under TinyOS. The obtained results show promising perspectives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{an analysis of}} rank-k solutions in terms of Riemann invariants, obtained from interrelations between two concepts, that of the symmetry reduction method and of the generalized method of characteristics for first order quasilinear hyperbolic systems of PDEs in many dimensions. A variant of the conditional symmetry method for obtaining this type of solutions is proposed. A Lie module of vector fields, which are symmetries of an overdetermined system defined by the initial system of equations and certain first order differential constraints, is constructed. It is shown that this overdetermined system admits rank-k solutions expressible in terms of Riemann invariants. Finally, examples of applications of the proposed approach to the fluid dynamics equations in (k+ 1) dimensions are discussed in detail. Several new soliton-like solutions (among them kinks, bumps and multiple wave solutions) have been obtained.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{algorithm}} for computing a low rank approximation of a sparse matrix {{based on a}} truncated LU factorization with column and row permutations. We present various approaches for determining the column and row permutations that show a trade-off between speed versus deterministic/probabilistic accuracy. We show that if the permutations are chosen by using tournament pivoting based on QR factorization, then the obtained truncated LU factorization with column/row tournament pivoting, LU_CRTP, satisfies bounds on the singular values which have similarities with the ones obtained by a communication avoiding rank revealing QR factorization. Experiments on challenging matrices show that LU_CRTP provides a good low rank approximation of the input matrix and it is less expensive than the rank revealing QR factorization in terms of computational and memory usage costs, while also minimizing the communication cost. We also compare the computational complexity of our algorithm with randomizedalgorithms and show that for sparse matrices and high enough but still modest accuracies, our approach is faster.
