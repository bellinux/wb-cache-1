5|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves were largely unaffected by the blast. Criticism was expressed by local <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot.|$|E
5|$|As European Commissioner for Multilingualism in the Barroso Commission, Orban was {{responsible}} for the language policy of the European Union, i.e. promoting multilingualism for the <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> institutions of the European Union. He was the first to hold this portfolio. Multilingualism has previously and subsequently been a responsibility of the European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism, Ján Figeľ, the first Commissioner whose portfolio explicitly included multilingualism.|$|E
5|$|During the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific, Chilean troops {{occupied}} Lima after defeating Peruvian {{resistance in}} the battles of San Juan and Miraflores. The city suffered the depredations of the invaders, which looted public museums, libraries and educational institutions. At the same time, angry mobs attacked wealthy <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Asian population; sacking their properties and businesses.|$|E

5|$|At the foundry {{near the}} Carey Street Bridge, {{a crowd of}} more than 100 {{gathered}} and threatened to {{set fire to the}} area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired {{over the heads of the}} crowd was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining garrison there.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{degree to which}} they could become emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business, {{including}} shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the Arch of the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader {{proved to}} be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, Isaac Shelby {{relocated}} to Kentucky, on lands awarded {{to him for}} his military service, and became involved in Kentucky's transition from a county of Virginia, to a separate state. His heroism made him popular with the state's <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky electoral college unanimously elected him governor in 1792. He secured Kentucky, from Indian attacks and organized its first government. He used the Citizen Genet affair to convince the Washington administration to make {{an agreement with the}} Spanish for free trade on the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|The Political Cesspool is {{a weekly}} far-right talk radio show founded by Tennessean {{political}} activist James Edwards and syndicated by the organizations Liberty News Radio Network and Accent Radio Network in the United States.

Its sponsors include the white separatist Council of Conservative <b>Citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Institute for Historical Review, a Holocaust denial group.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders {{may have}} {{expected}} Alexios to become their leader, {{but he had}} no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible. In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear fealty to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Venizelists {{during the}} battle has been {{intensely}} contested by witnesses and historians. Vice admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet wrote that Venizelists supported the Allies and attacked passing Greek royalist army units. Venizelists participation was allegedly so extensive, that lead Admiral du Fourne wrote in his report {{that he had been}} involved in a civil war. The Venizelists continued fighting after the evacuation of the Allied marines until the next day, when they capitulated. The royalists claimed that large caches of weapons and ammunition were found in their strongholds packed in French military containers. Venizelists were led to prison surrounded by a furious mob and supposedly only the royal army escorts saved them from being murdered by the angry citizens. Other historians deny that the Venizelists collaborated with the Allied forces: Pavlos Karolidis, a contemporary royalist historian, argues that no Venizelist attacked their fellow <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only weapons found during the raids on prominent Venizelists' houses were knives.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{political}} institutions which hold {{the executive and}} legislative power of the Union. The Council of the European Union represents governments, the Parliament represents <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Commission represents the European interest. Essentially, the Council of the European Union, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and the Council of the European Union, where in most cases both must give their assent. Although {{the exact nature of}} this depends upon the legislative procedure in use, once it is approved and signed by both bodies it becomes law. The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply. According to the 2014 edition of The Official Directory of the European Union, women account for 33% of higher-ranking officials.|$|E

5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 September 2008, under the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2008 ("2008 PEMA Order"), {{responsibility}} for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance at Speakers' Corner {{was taken over}} from the police by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation by way of {{an amendment to the}} Parks and Trees Regulations. To provide greater convenience, the National Parks Board made it possible for people to register online at its website. In addition, it became possible to hold demonstrations provided that they are organized by Singapore <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> participants are only citizens and permanent residents. As the time period restriction was lifted, events can now be held around the clock. In addition, rules on voice amplification were revised to allow the use of self-powered amplification devices like loudhailers from 9:00a.m. to 10:30p.m. This relaxation of the rules potentially allows for speakers' messages to be heard by larger audiences. A minor change was also introduced to the conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner – no banner, film, photograph, placard or poster containing any violent, lewd or obscene material may be displayed or exhibited whether before, during or after the event.|$|E
