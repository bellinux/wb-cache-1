5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow or deep burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species <b>can</b> <b>run</b> and jump over the surface of pools.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{characters}} in the Sonic series, Amy <b>can</b> <b>run</b> at superhuman speeds but not as fast as Sonic. She attacks foes with her ever-present signature weapon, the Piko-Piko Hammer, with which she is very proficient. She also has other minor skills such as tarot card reading and dowsing.|$|E

5|$|Most restorations of ceratopsians {{show them}} with erect hindlimbs but semi-sprawling forelimbs, which {{suggest that they}} were not fast movers. But Paul and Christiansen (2000) argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs and the larger species may have been as fast as rhinos, which <b>can</b> <b>run</b> at up to 56km or 35 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Australian magpie {{moves around}} by walking, {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, {{although}} birds <b>can</b> <b>run</b> in short bursts when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} four tracks at Lysaker will allow NSB to run all local trains that {{previously}} have run to Skøyen {{all the way}} to Lysaker. The closed Høvik Station will be used to turn trains. The Oslo Tunnel remains the bottleneck west of Oslo, so no more trains <b>can</b> <b>run</b> westwards, although more will be able to continue past Skøyen.|$|E

5|$|Under the California constitution, all city {{elections}} in the state are conducted on a non-partisan basis. As a result, candidates' party affiliations are not listed on the ballot, and multiple candidates from a single party <b>can</b> <b>run</b> in the election since a primary election is not held.|$|E
5|$|A , or , is one {{of three}} senior members of the Yamayuri Council, {{although}} it is also possible to generally speak of {{all the members of the}} Yamayuri Council as roses. A Rose makes the important decisions within this group, since she has control over the student council. Candidates for the position, which lasts through the school year, are chosen through an election. Any student <b>can</b> <b>run</b> to become a Rose, although the position is usually given to the en boutons, the Roses' petite sœurs.|$|E
5|$|AMD chose a {{different}} direction, designing the less radical x86-64, a 64-bit extension {{to the existing}} x86 architecture, which Microsoft then supported, forcing Intel to introduce the same extensions in its own x86-based processors. These designs <b>can</b> <b>run</b> existing 32-bit applications at native hardware speed, while offering support for 64-bit memory addressing and other enhancements to new applications. This architecture has now become the predominant 64-bit architecture in the desktop and portable market. Although some Itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as SGI, {{they are no longer}} available.|$|E

5|$|As the MacBook Pro uses a {{different}} hardware platform from earlier PowerPC (PPC)-based Macintoshes, versions of OS X prior to Lion <b>can</b> <b>run</b> PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator, which exacts some performance penalty, cannot emulate some lower-level PPC code, {{and does not}} support 64-bit (G5 specific) PPC features. Rosetta is not present in Lion and later, so PPC applications cannot be run under those versions of OS X.|$|E
5|$|Comverse, {{also known}} as Comverse Network Systems or Comverse CNS, is a {{provider}} of software and systems enabling value-added services for voice, messaging, mobile Internet and mobile advertising; converged billing and active customer management; and IP communications. Comverse's solutions support flexible deployment models, including in-network, hosted and managed services, and <b>can</b> <b>run</b> on circuit-switched, IP, IMS, and converged network environments. Comverse's customer base spans more than 130 countries and covers over 500 communication service providers serving more than two billion subscribers. It typically provided some 70 percent of Comverse Technology's overall revenue. Comverse has 100 local offices in 40 countries, with its corporate headquarters located in Wakefield, Massachusetts, in the US.|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs <b>can</b> <b>run</b> on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the {{original}} clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street, {{and the building}} where the sign had been mounted was demolished so One Bryant Park could be built. An updated model was installed one block away {{on the side of}} a Durst building at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, facing Sixth Avenue near the southeast corner of the intersection with West 44th Street. The new clock is located next to an Internal Revenue Service office. The new clock, which <b>can</b> <b>run</b> backward, is outfitted with a brighter seven-segment display with multiple LEDs per segment, allowing the numbers to be read more easily.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, all twelve T2000 {{units were}} taken out of service, before {{the last of the}} much older T1300. Kollektivtransportproduksjon, the {{successor}} of Oslo Sporveier, stated that procuring spare parts was becoming nearly impossible and that the small size of the series forced high maintenance costs. The initial orders for MX3000 trains did not call for sufficient numbers to replace the T2000. Kollektivtransportproduksjon has estimated the cost of renovating the units so they <b>can</b> <b>run</b> for 15 more years at NOK50 million. Alternatively, the city council has been recommended by Kollektivtransportproduksjon to purchase 15 new MX3000 three-car trains for NOK250 million.|$|E
5|$|Most {{software}} {{that runs on}} Linux <b>can</b> <b>run</b> on FreeBSD using an optional built-in compatibility layer. Hence, most Linux binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. This compatibility layer is not an emulation; Linux's system call interface is implemented in the FreeBSD's kernel and hence, Linux executable images and shared libraries are treated the same as FreeBSD's native executable images and shared libraries. Additionally, FreeBSD provides compatibility layers for several other Unix-like operating systems, in addition to Linux, such as BSD/OS and SVR4, however, it is more common for users to compile those programs directly on FreeBSD.|$|E
50|$|You <b>can</b> also <b>run</b> the Simgua Attractiveness {{principle}} model.|$|R
5000|$|Distributed compilation: Building {{software}} packages typically requires operations that <b>can</b> be <b>run</b> in parallel (for example, compiling individual source code files). By using a compile farm, these operations <b>can</b> be <b>run</b> in parallel on separate machines. An {{example of a}} program {{which can be used}} to do this is distcc.|$|R

5|$|The Hornet Upgrade program (HUG) {{commenced}} in 1999. The project {{sought and}} continues to seek to modernise {{the ability of the}} current ACG fleet of F/A-18A and F/A-18B aircraft and associated support systems. The upgrade project has been set up to elongate the time the Hornet's <b>can</b> <b>run</b> until 2018. The project is being conducted in three phases. This project was established to upgrade the F/A-18 fleet to combine enrichments that will allow the aircraft to more effectively perform its air defence tasks. The project is being conducted in three main phases, phase one has already concluded and phases two and three are currently in production.|$|E
5|$|The V7 {{client is}} {{the seventh and}} latest {{generation}} of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 <b>can</b> <b>run</b> Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is mostly}} active {{during the morning}} and the late afternoon, with the hottest hours of the day being spent in rest. These extremely agile and wary animals <b>can</b> <b>run</b> at speeds of up to , waving their tails and tossing their heads. An analysis of the activity of blue wildebeest at the Serengeti National Park showed that the animals devoted over half of their total time to rest, 33% to grazing, 12% to moving about (mostly walking) and a little to social interactions. However, there were variations among different age and sex groups.|$|E
