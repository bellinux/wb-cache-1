50|$|Gentiana cruciata, {{common name}} star gentian or <b>cross</b> <b>gentian,</b> is a {{herbaceous}} perennial flowering {{plant in the}} Gentianaceae family.|$|E
40|$|Relationship {{between the}} {{endangered}} herbaceous plant Gentiana cruciata and its specialist herbivore, the endangered butterfly Alcon Blue, Phengaris rebeli, was studied in Lithuanian population {{which is the}} northernmost one over the whole known species range in Europe. The size of P.  rebeli population was estimated bas-ing on eggshell counts on the larval host plant. Oviposition behaviour of P.  rebeli was investigated during summer season of 2011 on a grassland area in Neris Re-gional Park, Lithuania. Potential host plants were checked and eggshells of P.  re-beli were counted. A total of 619 eggshells were counted on 248 out of 536 G.  cru-ciata stems checked. Selective choice of both host plants and site for oviposition on host plant was revealed. Approximately 89 % eggs were laid on the organs of the uppermost whorl. Plants selected by females for oviposition almost always had a luxuriant growth {{and most of them}} were higher than the surrounding vegetation.
