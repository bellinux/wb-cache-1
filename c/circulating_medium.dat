25|$|By 1900, {{most of the}} industrializing {{nations were}} on some form of gold standard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the <b>circulating</b> <b>medium.</b> Private banks and governments across the world {{followed}} Gresham's Law: keeping gold and silver paid, but paying out in notes. This did not happen {{all around the world}} at the same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning {{in the early part of}} the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the gold standard was the United States in 1971.|$|E
25|$|The Yuan Government revolutionised {{the economy}} by {{introducing}} paper currency as the predominant <b>circulating</b> <b>medium.</b> The founder of the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan, issued paper money known as Chao in his reign.

The original notes during the Yuan dynasty were restricted in area and duration as in the Song dynasty, but in the later course of the dynasty, facing massive shortages of specie to fund their ruling in China, began printing paper money without restrictions on duration. Chinese paper money was therefore guaranteed by the State and not by the private merchant or private banker.|$|E

The days of being satisfied with only simple hot product to cold feed exchange, restricted to the plot boundaries of each unit, are a thing of the past. This paper presents results of a refinery-wide survey to identify potential high temperature heat sources that are not being recovered and low temperature systems that consume fuel. The best candidates in each category were connected by a <b>circulating</b> heat <b>medium</b> loop where waste heat is recovered for useful purposes. The heat medium chosen is turbine fuel. It is pumped around the refinery to pick up heat at the crude distilling unit, the hydrocracker, the catalytic cracker, and the coker; the heat is used to reboil a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed Water. The heat that is recovered is equivalent to some 660 B/D of fuel: at an illustrative fuel value of say $ 30 per barrel, the value of the recovered heat is $ 20, 000 per day. An energy conservation project at Shell's Norco (Louisiana) Manufacturing Complex involves several processing units and recovers heat that was previously lost to air or cooling water. The recovered heat is used to reboil a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed water. Essentially, the system consists of a <b>circulating</b> heat <b>medium</b> that transfers waste heat to heat consumers.

Ideally, cultured hepatocytes in a BLAD should closely mimic the in vivo oxygenation environment of the liver sinusoid to yield a device with optimal performance. However, most BLADs, including hepatic HF bioreactors, suffer from O 2 limited transport toward cultured hepatocytes, which reduces their performance. We hypothesize that supplementation of hemoglobin-based O 2 carriers into the <b>circulating</b> cell culture <b>medium</b> of hepatic HF bioreactors is a feasible and effective strategy to improve bioreactor oxygenation and performance. We examined the effect of bovine hemoglobin (BvHb) supplementation (15 [*]g/L) in the <b>circulating</b> cell culture <b>medium</b> of hepatic HF bioreactors on hepatocyte proliferation, metabolism, and varied liver functions, including biosynthesis, detoxification, and biotransformation. It was observed that BvHb supplementation supported {{the maintenance of a}} higher cell mass in the extracapillary space, improved hepatocyte metabolic efficiency (i. e., hepatocytes consumed much less glucose), improved hepatocyte capacity for drug metabolism, and conserved both albumin synthesis and ammonia detoxification functions compared to controls (no BvHb supplementation) under the same experimental conditions...|$|R

40|$|In vitro {{models that}} capture the {{complexity}} of in vivo tissue and organ behaviors in a scalable and easy-to-use format are desirable for drug discovery. To address this, we have developed a bioreactor that fosters maintenance of 3 D tissue cultures under constant perfusion and we have integrated multiple bioreactors into an array in a multiwell plate format. All bioreactors are fluidically isolated from each other. Each bioreactor in the array contains a scaffold that supports formation of hundreds of 3 D microscale tissue units. The tissue units are perfused with cell culture <b>medium</b> <b>circulated</b> within the bioreactor by integrated pneumatic diaphragm micropumps. Electronic controls for the pumps are kept outside the incubator and connected to the perfused multiwell by pneumatic lines. The docking design and open-well bioreactor layout make handling perfused multiwell plates similar to using standard multiwell tissue culture plates. A model of oxygen consumption and transport in the <b>circulating</b> culture <b>medium</b> was used to predict appropriate operating parameters for primary liver cultures. Oxygen concentrations at key locations in the system were then measured {{as a function of}} flow rate and time after initiation of culture to determine oxygen consumption rates.
