50|$|During {{construction}} of the park developer Mike Ferguson was ordered to halt excavations due to the delicate nature of the wetlands near the Snake River which was {{the location of the}} park. Work was halted in late April-early May, 1998, but most of the work for the park was already completed. According to the terms of the Clean Water Act developers are required to show that they will do no, or little damage to wetlands before work is begun. It is unclear whether Ferguson knew that he needed such permits in advance of beginning development. On May 28, 1998 Madison County Commissioners voted to grant Mike Ferguson a permit to allow construction on the wetlands where the park was to be located. The vote was unanimous after local residents showed strong support for the project. This was the last step the park needed from county government officials before the park’s construction could be completed. On June 12, 1998 the first of Bear World’s bears arrived to the drive-through wildlife park. The bears arrived two days after Ferguson reached an agreement with Idaho wildlife officials who gave him permission to bring in the bears on a temporary basis. This move allowed Ferguson an opening to avoid, temporarily, a ban on the <b>commercial</b> <b>importation</b> of black bears.|$|E
5000|$|Environmentalists cry foul {{over this}} provision, stating that various laws {{are bound to}} be {{violated}} if the agreement pushes through. Under the Constitution alone, it is imperative that the State promotes the people's right to health (Article II, Section 15), and right to a balanced and healthful ecology (Article II, Section 16). Other laws that may be violated include Republic Act No. 6969 (Toxic Substance and Hazardous and Nuclear Waste Act of 1990) which prohibits the entry of hazardous wastes into and their disposal within the country for whatever purpose, and Republic Act No. 4653 (An Act to Safeguard the Health of the People and Maintain the Dignity of the Nation by Declaring it a National Policy to Prohibit the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Importation</b> of Textile Articles Commonly Known as Used Clothing and Rags) wherein worn clothing and other worn articles, used or new rags, scrap twine, cordage, rope and cables and worn out articles of twine, cordage, rope or cables, of textile materials are also prohibited from being imported into the Philippines. Aside from local laws, one international treaty is also said to be a direct contradiction to the JPEPA. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was ratified in 1989 by 133 countries and is currently adopted by 170 countries, including Japan and the Philippines. It is the most comprehensive global environmental treaty on hazardous and other wastes, addressing cleaner production, hazardous waste minimization and controls on the movement of these wastes. One of the main concerns regarding JPEPA is the possibility of having Japan export their waste products and hazardous materials to the Philippines. Such products are included in Article 29 of the agreement, which defines [...] "originating goods. Under Article 18 of the agreement, both Japan and the Philippines shall either [...] "reduce or eliminate its customs duties eliminate other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with the importation and take part in [...] "improving market access conditions for originating goods.|$|E
40|$|In Australia, 2. 9 {{million people}} {{continue}} to smoke daily, and tobacco still accounts for 8 % of disease burden. Tobacco harm-reduction strategies, {{such as the use}} of Swedish snus, have been suggested as a way to further reduce this disease burden. In Australia, the most dangerous tobacco products (cigarettes) are the least regulated, while oral tobacco products, including snus, cannot be sold legally. Recent epidemiological modelling indicates that there are only small differences in life expectancy between smokers who quit and those who switch to snus. There is a case on public health and ethical grounds for allowing inveterate smokers who want to reduce their health risks to access snus. At a minimum, the recent increase in tax on smokeless tobacco should be reversed, and the ban on the <b>commercial</b> <b>importation</b> and supply of low nitrosamine smokeless tobacco should be reconsidered in light of the epidemiological evidence on its potential to reduce tobacco-related disease in smokers...|$|E
40|$|International {{trade in}} used {{electrical}} and electronics equipment (UEEE) provides an avenue for socio-economic {{development in the}} developing world and also serves as a conduit for transboundary dumping of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) also referred to as electronic waste or e-waste. The latter problem arises from the absence of a regulatory framework for differentiating between functional UEEE and junk e-waste. This has resulted in both functional UEEE and junk e-waste being concurrently shipped to developing countries under the guise of international trade in used electronics. Dealing with these problems will require effective regulation of international trade in UEEE from both exporting and importing countries. Although, the export of e-waste from the European Community to developing countries is currently prohibited, significant amount of e-waste from the region continue to flow into developing countries due to lax regulatory measures in the latter. Hence, there is need for a regulatory regime in developing countries to complement the prohibitory regime in the major e-waste source countries. This paper proposes trade measures modelled in line with WTO rules which could be adopted by developing countries in addressing these problems. The proposed measures include the development of a compulsory certification and labelling system for functional UEEE as well as trade ban on <b>commercial</b> <b>importation</b> of UEEE not complying with the said certification and labelling system. The paper then goes further to examine these proposed measures in the light of WTO rules and jurisprudence...|$|E
40|$|International law {{enforcement}} agencies have increasingly pointed to an apparent rise in poly-drug traffickers: high level drug traffickers who choose to trade in multiple illicit drugs. This project provided the first detailed examination of poly-drug and poly-crime trafficking in Australia. It used three different types of Australian Federal Police data (border seizures, cases and linked-cases) and court sentencing data to estimate the scale of and trends in poly-drug <b>commercial</b> <b>importation</b> at the Australian border from 1999 - 2012; generate and compare criminal profiles of 20 poly-drug and 20 mono-drug traffickers; and conduct social network analysis of three Australian poly-drug networks. The analysis showed that over the 14 year period, from 1999 to 2012, between 5 % and 35 % of commercial importations at the Australian border involved poly-drug trafficking. Poly-drug trafficking occurred in almost every year of analysis: and increased only slightly over time. Finally, poly-drug traffickers were associated with more serious and potentially harmful behaviour. For example, compared to mono-drug traffickers, poly-drug traffickers were associated with larger quantities of drug seized, larger networks, longer periods of operation, and greater involvement in other types of serious crime. The project concluded that some fears about poly-drug traffickers may have been overstated particularly about the inherent escalation of this form of trafficking, but that poly-drug traffickers are likely to pose added risks to governments and {{law enforcement}} than mono-drug traffickers. Two key implications are that first, poly-drug traffickers warrant increased attention in Australia; and second, regulatory or law enforcement responses aimed at one drug may increase {{the problems associated with}} another drug. This demands a new way of thinking about Australian illicit drug markets that can better respond to drug traffickers operating in an inter-connected marketplace...|$|E
40|$|We {{write you}} {{today as a}} group of 226 {{non-governmental}} organisations- representing millions of members throughout Europe and around the world- to urge a permanent end to the importation of wild birds into the European Union. Each year, hundreds of thousands of wild-caught birds are imported into the EU. These imports pose serious and substantial risks to the species traded, to the health and livelihoods of European citizens, and to our identities as responsible and humane global citizens. The EU recognised these risks when it imposed a precautionary moratorium on imports of wild caught birds earlier this year and extended the moratorium again this summer. In our collective view, the most responsible, humane, and science-based course of action is for the EU to make that ban permanent, and join the growing number of nations around the world that have withdrawn from the risky and unacceptable commercial trade in wild birds 1. For this reason, we respectfully call upon the European Union to immediately and permanently halt the <b>commercial</b> <b>importation</b> of wild birds. Wild Bird Imports Threaten Human Lives and Livelihoods International movements of wildlife amplify disease risks to humans, livestock, and local wildlife. Despite our best efforts to quarantine, control, and screen for infectious diseases, history has repeatedly demonstrated that importing wild birds poses recurrent and serious disease risks for both human and animal populations, that outbreaks of such diseases are difficult to prevent and costly to control, and that their impacts are felt throughout the economy. Two recent avian disease outbreaks exemplify our concerns and give credence to the scale and immediacy of the problem at hand. Avian Influenza The current epidemic of avian influenza in Asia {{is only one of many}} ongoing outbreaks of this deadly and virulent disease. Outbreaks of various avian flu strains have also crippled or are now devastating the poultry industry in Europe (Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium in 2002) and North America (Britis...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master of Environmental Sciences) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Fruit flies (Tephritidae) {{can enter}} and {{establish}} in new territories {{due to the}} movement of fruit from one area to another through trade or tourism, which can negatively impact on fruit production and market access. An invader fruit fly species (Bactrocera invadens) has established on the African continent and has spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa. This newly described polyphagous fruit fly species is a successful invader species which continues to distribute and establish in new habitats. The introduction and establishment of B. invadens in South Africa may have serious market access consequences with regard to fruit exports due to its absence in the territories of many trading partners. The Musina area was considered as the study area {{as it is the}} first entry point from Zimbabwe. The national highway (N 1) which runs through the area is a major route from several B. invadens infested countries in the Southern Africa region. A species initiated pest risk assessment was conveyed to determine the risk potential of this pest. The pest risk assessment (PRA) identified several pathways with a high risk to the Musina area, that B. invadens can follow. A detection survey was carried out to determine the status of B. invadens in the Musina area as support to the PRA. The detection survey continued over three years and by the second year B. invadens was detected {{for the first time in}} the study area. The detection survey was followed by a delimiting survey and the pest was eradicated in the area. After several months of no detection, it was however detected again in the area. Risk management options were suggested for regulatory control as an outcome of the pest risk assessment. These measures can be utilised by the National Plant Protection Organisation of South Africa for the <b>commercial</b> <b>importation</b> of host material of B. invadens, control of fruit imported by travellers, informal traders and national control in the event of pest incursions in the area. Corrective actions as well as quarantine actions should be implemented in an integrated approach in the affected areas. Master...|$|E
40|$|Despite good {{crop yields}} the Sahel {{continues}} to import cereals {{to the detriment}} of its own farming. The availability of international suspluses of cereal products at relatively low costs, from the North, erratic crop yields in the South, the difficulties experienced by develop. ing countries in processing local cereals, and finally - the labour-intensive methods of preparation based on millet, maize or sorghum compared to the simplicity of cooking rice or making wheat bread, all contribute to this state of affairs. In 1988 the rainy season was good in the Sahel, and cereal production rose to an unprecedented level - about 9, 213, 000 tonnes according to CILSS (Comite Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la Secheresse au Sahel), which is a rise of 3 % on the previous harvest. Nevertheless, cereal imports {{do not seem to be}} decreasing 1, 017, 000 tonnes of rice and wheat will be brought into the Sahel this year, whether by <b>commercial</b> <b>importation</b> or food aid programmes. The question of nutritional self-sufficiency in the Sahel is thus not linked to rainfall alone: this propensity towards imported cereals is also accounted for by the higher quality of imports, their adaptation to the needs of consumers today, and to their competitive price. Eighty representatives of the Sahelian countries (from Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Mali, and Senegal) met at Thies in Senegal in October 1988 to try and resolve the problem. The meeting was on the initiative of CILSS and the Club du Sahel, with the collaboration of ENDA Third World and GRET (Groupe de Recherches et d'Etudes Techniques), and it set in motion a prograrnme promoting local cereals in the Sahel (PROCELOS). This programme is one of two reassuring moves: the first shows that, according to recent research, products from local cereals have a good reputation with Sahelian consumers. Furthermore, new dietary habits (mainly in towns) do not necessarily involve imports: new products can be supplied based on local cereals. Offering new products In the past 20 years, imports of wheat and rice have risen from about one-eighth to one quarter of the total cereal consumption in Sahelian countries. In order to reverse this trend certain measures must be taken it is possible, for example, to adapt local cereals to current preferences by appropriate marketing strategies for both > traditional products and for new products. It is also possible to get public authorities and funding organizations to distribute recipes for new dishes using local products in canteens and local communities. Encouraging the manufacture of products made up of local cereal flour compounds (biscuits, baby cereal, bread [...] .) should be one of the main aspects of the programme, and as experiments carried out in Senegal have been very positive. But these measures cannot be seen as sufficient. All the Sahelian states must take part as must all those who form part of the cereals network. No lasting success will be seen until a macro-economic climate which favours the promotion of local cereals has been created. To this end the donor countries must also bring into being a sort of food aid code of conduct: for example, if surplus cereals are being brought in to help areas in short supply, European surpluses should be limited Financial measures, too, can also play an important role. Small local manufacturers and businessmen will be attracted to the use and processing of local cereals if their tax position is both clarified and eased. It is for the funding agencies to make new commitments to keep the cereals markets ir~formation systems going, and to finance campaigns to promote products made of local cereals. As for the processing equipment needed, the machinery does exist, even if much of it needs to be adapted. The enormous variety of plant used over such a wide area and the significant regional differences present enormous difficulties so the PROCELOS programme recommends that each country standardizes its equipment in order to make maintenance and the supply of spare parts easier. It is also possible and desirable to manufacture threshing and husking machinery and grain mills locally. For instance, in Senegal good results have been obtained notably with the small-scale manufacture of hammer-mills which are cheap yet effective. This is still time to correct the situation, and if the recommendations of the programme are followed, the objectives can and will be attained.
