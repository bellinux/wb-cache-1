The first is the expression in common use; the last is that of some metaphysicians, who conceived that in adopting it they were introducing a highly important distinction. The eminent thinker, just quoted, seems to countenance the latter opinion. “But seeing,” he continues, “names ordered in speech (as is defined) are signs of our conceptions, it is manifest they are not signs of the things themselves; for that the sound of this word stone should be the sign of a stone, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> in any sense but this, that he that hears it collects that he that pronounces it thinks of a stone.” ...|$|E

As far as electoral process is concerned, the paper argues that Sarkozy's success {{is related to the}} scope of the mobilization and his capacity to unify the French right. Electoral mobilization <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>understood</b> without taking in account party mobilization and UMP members recruitment. Thanks to a members survey carried out in November 2004, the organizational and social features of recruitment are analyzed. UMP membership <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only flexible but related to electoral and presidential contexts. Compared to socialist membership, UMP social selection <b>is</b> <b>not</b> stronger; moreover, UMP happens to be better rooted in the categories of employees and more classically in the catholic world and the private sector. Globally, party mobilization gives clues in order to understand electoral mobilization. In terms of party system, Sarkozy's phenomenon can be analyzed as part of a bipartisan dynamic. Electoral changes and the distribution of legislative seats attest that French dynamic is moving towards an increased domination of the two main parties. In 2007, Sarkozy has succeeded unifying {{a large part of the}} French Right even though part of the electorate has resisted to this attempt...|$|R

It shows that firm heterogeneity matters.

Accordingly, the role of firm heterogeneity in selection models of agglomeration <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> fully <b>understood</b> without paying due attention to various moments of the underlying firm productivity distribution...|$|R

Witchcraft and oracles played a great role in solving disputes among the Azande. In this respect he agreed with Durkheim, though he acknowledged that Frazer and Tylor were right that their religion also had an intellectual explanatory aspect. The Azande's faith in witchcraft and oracles was quite logical and consistent once some fundamental tenets were accepted. Loss of faith in the fundamental tenets could not be endured because of its social importance and hence they had an elaborate system of explanations (or excuses) against disproving evidence. Besides an alternative system of terms or school of thought did not exist.|$|E

It is thus very essential to estimate the Lorentz factor of these particles in the radiation regions both observationally and theoretically. In this paper, according to the frequency dependence of component separation and considering some radiation processes, we obtain the Lorentz factor and its variation in the radiation region observationally for seven multi-frequency observed pulsars. It is found that the Lorentz factor decays substantially in the emission region, and the decay <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> well <b>understood</b> by all known energy loss processes.

Here, we consider spatial heterogeneity, defined as `patchiness¿ of the host population. After briefly reviewing how disease persistence is influenced by population size, reproduction number and infectious period, we explore its dependence on the level of spatial heterogeneity. Analysis and simulation of disease transmission in a symmetric meta-population suggest that disease persistence typically becomes worse as spatial heterogeneity increases, although local persistence optima can occur for infections with oscillatory population dynamics. We obtain insight into the dynamics that underlie the observed persistence patterns by studying the infection prevalence correlation between patches and by comparing full-model simulations to results obtained using simplified patch-level descriptions of the interplay between local extinctions and between-patch transmissions. The observed patterns are interpreted in terms of rescue effects for strong spatial heterogeneity and in terms of between-patch coherence and synchronization effects at intermediate and weak levels of heterogeneity...|$|R
