CARS is a third-order nonlinear optical process involving three laser beams: a pump beam of frequency ωp, a Stokes beam of frequency ωS and a probe beam at frequency ωpr.

To cope with performance degradation due to sample covariance errors, DOA estimation errors and other array imperfections, the eigenstructure of the covariance matrix is exploited to improve the performance of the proposed approaches by constraining the weight vector in the signal subspace.

30|$|Although the spatial-differencing-based {{algorithms}} {{can deal}} with more signals than antennas, there still exist two potential shortcomings. One is that the contributions {{from a group of}} <b>coherent</b> <b>signals</b> may act approximately as that of a single-point signal, consequently, the false angle estimation will appear in the scenario of low signal-to-noise ratio and finite number of snapshots. The other is that part of the information of <b>coherent</b> <b>signals</b> will also be subtracted when the differencing operation is utilized to eliminate the uncorrelated signals, which will directly incur a restricted estimation performance for <b>coherent</b> <b>signals.</b> Aiming at the aforementioned problems, literature [25] designs a relative ratio function and a C-matrix to decern the possible false DOAs and achieve coherent DOA estimation, respectively. However, the method cannot be directly applied into the case of multi-dimensional angle estimation. The biggest difficulties are two-fold. First, the uncorrelated and/or partially correlated DOA estimations are usually by means of spectrum searching, the same as [22 – 24], which will produce huge computational complexity for multi-dimensional case; second, the non-diagonal covariance matrix caused by those uncorrelated or partially correlated signals will directly decrease the effectiveness of their elimination in the coherent DOA estimation stage. Although oblique projecting technique is adopted in [22, 23], it is actually achieved by an alternative projector due to one cannot acquire the array manifold of <b>coherent</b> <b>signals</b> beforehand. Differently, [26] distinguishes the uncorrelated and <b>coherent</b> <b>signals</b> by the moduli of the eigenvalues of a auxiliary matrix; and [27] exploits the sparse signal reconstruction to achieve angle estimation, which can neglect the different types of signals.

30|$|In this paper, {{motivated}} by simultaneously considering {{the reduction of}} computational complexity {{and the promotion of}} estimational accuracy, we propose two approaches based on the techniques of weighted subspace fitting and oblique projection, i.e., the WSFOPED and the improved WSFOPED, to achieve joint DOA and DOD estimation for a mixture of uncorrelated and <b>coherent</b> <b>signals.</b> In the WSFOPED approach, the reduced-dimensional weighted subspace fitting technique plays a very important role, the kernel of which is to remodel the partial noise subspace by a series of parameters; consequently, the DOA information of mixed signals can be acquired by rooting a polynomial represented by those estimated parameters. A new oblique projector is designed to isolate the <b>coherent</b> <b>signals</b> from the uncorrelated ones so that a virtual MIMO array observation can be rebuilt. In the DOD estimation, via Lagrange multiplier optimization, the auto-paired transmit array steering vectors of uncorrelated and <b>coherent</b> <b>signals</b> can be estimated with closed-form expressions. Furthermore, considering the inherent shortcoming (i.e., error propagation) in previous approach, the improved WSFOPED strategy is proposed to refine the accuracy of DOA-DOD estimation, in which one-dimensional spectrum searching in local angular domain is adopted. As a result, the proposed approaches have four notable advantages: (1) computational simplicity in DOA estimation of uncorrelated and <b>coherent</b> <b>signals,</b> where only polynomial rooting or local searching is required; (2) computational simplicity in DOD estimation of uncorrelated and <b>coherent</b> <b>signals,</b> where the transmit array steering vectors are estimated in a closed-form expressions; (3) the automatic pairing of DOA and DOD for the same signal; and (4) compared with non-spectrum-searching and spectrum-searching approaches respectively, WSFOPED and its improved version manifest better performance of DOA-DOD estimation. In a word, the proposed approaches can be considered as new alternatives to their competitors.|$|R

Second, although the adopted ESPRIT-type algorithms in [13, 14] are also low-complexity, they were not based on weighted subspace fitting.
