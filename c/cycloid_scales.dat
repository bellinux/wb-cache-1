5|$|The {{majority}} of teleost species {{belong to the}} clade Euteleostei, which consists of 17,419 species classified in 2,935 genera and 346 families. Shared traits of the euteleosts include similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and dorsal fin (supraneural bones), an outgrowth on the stegural bone (a bone located near the neural arches of the tail) and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base. The {{majority of}} euteleosts are in the clade Neoteleosti. A derived trait of neoteleosts is a muscle that controls the pharyngeal jaws, giving them a role in grinding food. Within neoteleosts, the Acanthopterygii have a spiny dorsal fin which {{is in front of}} the soft-rayed dorsal fin. This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may also play a role in defense. Acanthomorphs have developed spiny ctenoid scales (as opposed to the <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales</b> of other groups), tooth-bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming.|$|E
500|$|Bowfin {{are often}} {{referred}} to as [...] "living fossils", or [...] "primitive fishes" [...] because they retained some of the primitive characters common to their ancestral predecessors, including a modified (rounded externally) heterocercal caudal fin, a highly vascularized gas bladder lung, vestiges of a spiral valve, and a bony gular plate. The bony gular plate is located underneath the head on the exterior of the lower jaw between {{the two sides of the}} lower jaw bone. Other distinguishing characteristics include long, sharp teeth, and two protruding tube-like nostrils. Unlike all of the most primitive actinopterygians, the scales of bowfin differ in that they are not ganoid scales, rather they are large, single-layered <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales</b> closer in similarity to more derived teleosts.|$|E
2500|$|The Jewish law of kashrut, {{which only}} permits the {{consumption}} of fish with scales, forbids sturgeon, as they have ganoid scales instead of the permitted ctenoid and <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales.</b> While all Orthodox groups forbid {{the consumption of}} sturgeon, some conservative groups do allow it.

2500|$|The {{yellow jack}} shows the typical body {{profile of the}} genus Carangoides, having a {{moderately}} deep, compressed elongate shape, with the dorsal profile slightly more [...] than the ventral profile. It is a large fish, growing to a known maximum length of , although more common seen below , and a maximum weight of [...] The dorsal profile of the head is slightly curved from the snout to the nape, with the eye having a moderately well developed adipose eyelid. One of the major diagnostic features is that the upper jaw does not reach to the interior margin of the eye. Both jaws contain narrow bands of villiform teeth, with these bands becoming wider anteriorly. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first containing 7 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 25 to 28 soft rays. The anal fin {{is similar to the}} second dorsal fin, consisting of two anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 21 to 24 soft rays. The lobes of the dorsal and anal fins are slightly pronounced, and the pectoral fin is falcate, being longer than the head. The lateral line has a slight, extended anterior curve, with this curved section being longer than the posterior straight section. The straight section of the lateral line has 22 to 28 scutes, with rest of the body being covered in smooth <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales,</b> and the chest being completely scaled. The caudal peduncle has bilateral paired keels present. There are 24 vertebrae and a total of 24 to 30 gill rakers.|$|E

40|$|Scales of fishes are {{remarkable}} structures. Much {{information can}} be obtained about the growth history and longevity of individual fish by close examination of their scales or other bony structures. On the population level, also, age and growth is an excellent index to well being. Scales are bony structures that grow shingle-like from pockets within the skin. Scales are covered with a very thin, outer layer of skin called the epidermis. Among Michigan fishes there are basically two kinds of scales: the ctenoid scale found on spiny-rayed fishes such as bass, sunfish, perch, and walleye; and the <b>cycloid</b> <b>scale</b> found on soft-rayed fishes such as trout, suckers, and northern pike (Figure 9. 1). The ctenoid scale has small, sharp projections (ctenii) which give a rough texture to spiny-rayed fish. The <b>cycloid</b> <b>scale</b> lacks ctenii; thus soft-rayed fish tend to be smooth textured. Scales start to form when a fish is about an inch long. The number of scales covering the body remains constant throughout life, and in general, scale growth is proportional to fish growth. As the scale grows, circuli (ridges) form on the edge. Circuli form a concentric pattern {{over the course of}} a year that is related to environmental and growth conditions. During the colder months, when fish eat little and growth ceases, the circuli are crowded together and may be incomplete. In the spring, when feeding and growth resume, new circuli form that are spaced further apart. Also, the first new circul...|$|R

Other diagnostic features include the spine and ray counts, with the first spinous dorsal fin having 11 spines and the second dorsal fin having one spine and 19 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines followed by 19 soft rays.

50|$|Both cycloid and {{ctenoid scales}} are overlapping, {{making them more}} {{flexible}} than cosmoid and ganoid scales. Unlike ganoid scales, they grow in size through additions to the margin. The scales of some species exhibit bands of uneven seasonal growth called annuli (singular annulus). These bands {{can be used to}} age the fish. Most ray-finned fishes have ctenoid scales.

50|$|Sharks are {{sometimes}} regarded as {{being among the}} ritually unclean foods according to these regulations, as {{they appear to have}} a smooth skin. However, sharks do have scales, they are just placoid scales, which are denser and appear smooth if rubbed in one direction, in contrast to leptoid scales, ganoid scales, and cosmoid scales. The sturgeon, and related fish, are also sometimes included among the ritually impure foods, as their surfaces are covered in scutes, which are bony armoured nodules; however, fish scutes are actually just hardened and enlarged scales. Scales has thus been traditionally interpreted along the lines of Nahmanides's proposal that qasqeseth (scales) must refer specifically to scales that can be detached, by hand or with a knife, without ripping the skin. In practice this excludes all but <b>cycloid</b> and ctenoid <b>scales.</b> A minor controversy arises {{from the fact that the}} appearance of the scales of sturgeon, swordfish, and catfish is heavily affected by the ageing process - their young satisfy Nahmanides' rule, but when they reach adulthood they do not.|$|R

40|$|A {{new species}} of pygmy perch (Percichthyidae) from {{south-western}} Australia is described {{on the basis of}} 15 specimens collected from the Hay River system. Nannoperca pygmaea sp. nov. differs from the sympatric congener N. vittata (Castel-nau) by the absence of dark pigment on the ventral surface anterior to the anus, the possession of thin latero-ventral stripes, generally fewer dorsal rays and fewer anal rays, hind margin of scales on caudal peduncle without distinct pigment, and a more pronounced spot (ocellus) that is surrounded by a halo at the termination of the caudal peduncle. The new species is distinguished from congeners Nannoperca australis Günther, N. oxleyana Whitley and N. variegata Kuiter and Allen in possessing an exposed and serrated preorbital bone and jaws that may just reach to below the anterior margin of the eye, versus a smooth and hidden preorbital and the jaws reaching to at least below the pupil; and from the remaining congener, N. obscura (Klunzinger) in possessing a distinct haloed ocellus at base of caudal fin versus an indistinct barring, as well as a dark spot behind operculum, and the lack of dusky scale margins. It differs from the other sympatric pygmy perch found in the region, N. balstoni Regan, by the presence of an exposed rear edge of the preorbital (vs. hidden under skin), fewer transverse scale rows (13 vs. 15 – 16), small mouth (rarely reaching eye vs. reaching well beyond eye), ctenoid (vs. <b>cycloid)</b> body <b>scales,</b> generally fewer pectoral rays and smaller maximum size.
