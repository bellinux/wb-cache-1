5|$|Tiberius Julius Alexander was {{probably}} born {{early in the}} reign of the Emperor Tiberius (1437). His father was Alexander, an Alexandrian Jew who held the office of Alabarch; the exact meaning of this term is debated, but it may have denoted a senior <b>customs</b> <b>official.</b> The older Alexander enjoyed Roman citizenship, a rare privilege among the Jews of Alexandria, and therefore passed it to his sons. He also had business connections both with Agrippa, grandson of Herod the Great, and with Antonia, mother of the emperor Claudius. Another prominent member of Tiberius Alexander's family was his uncle, the philosopher Philo.|$|E
5|$|The court's {{patronage}} of literature is especially important, {{because this was}} {{the period in which}} the English language took shape as a literary language. There is little evidence to tie Richard directly to {{patronage of}} poetry, but it was nevertheless within his court that this culture was allowed to thrive. The greatest poet of the age, Geoffrey Chaucer, served the king as a diplomat, a <b>customs</b> <b>official</b> and a clerk of The King's Works while producing some of his best-known work. Chaucer was also in the service of John of Gaunt, and wrote The Book of the Duchess as a eulogy to Gaunt's wife Blanche. Chaucer's colleague and friend John Gower wrote his Confessio Amantis on a direct commission from Richard, although he later grew disenchanted with the king.|$|E

5|$|The {{first stop}} for the {{expedition}} was Oslo. There it was greeted by a great ceremony at Studenterlunden {{in front of the}} University. The truck was loaded with 300kg of medicines, to the value of NOK 50,000. These medicines were to be delivered to the hospital of humanitarian Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné, near the final destination of Libreville, the capital of Gabon. From Oslo the expedition continued to Helsingborg in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark, where more medicines were brought along. For public relations purposes the expedition made its way through several European citiesincluding Hamburg, Cologne, The Hague and Brusselsand was received with ceremony and much attention everywhere. In Belgium a problem arose over a missing customs declaration for the ice, but this was solved when a <b>customs</b> <b>official</b> agreed to accompany the cars through the country. Klevan later received a personal apology for this inconvenience, conveyed by the Norwegian foreign minister Halvard Lange from Lange's Belgian colleague and personal friend.|$|E

25|$|Born in Camprodon, {{province}} of Girona, to Ángel Albéniz (a <b>customs</b> <b>official)</b> and his wife, Dolors Pascual, Albéniz {{was a child}} prodigy who first performed {{at the age of}} four. At age seven, after apparently taking lessons from Antoine François Marmontel, he passed the entrance examination for piano at the Conservatoire de Paris, but he was refused admission because he was believed to be too young.

25|$|On 24 September 1766, customs {{officials}} in Boston, with a deputy sheriff, searched merchant Daniel Malcom's home, {{which was also}} his place of business. They claimed the authority {{to do so by}} a writ of assistance issued to <b>customs</b> <b>official</b> Benjamin Hallowell, and the information of a confidential informant. Malcom allowed them to search, but denied them access to a locked cellar, arguing {{that they did not have}} the legal authority to break it open. According to {{customs officials}}, Malcom threatened to use force to prevent them from opening the door; according to Malcom and his supporters, his threat specified resisting any unlawful forced entry.|$|E
25|$|Enforcing {{the acts}} proved difficult; {{the seizure of}} the sloop Liberty on suspicions of {{smuggling}} triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to extradite colonists to face trial in England. Tensions rose after {{the murder of a}} teen by a <b>customs</b> <b>official</b> in 1770 and escalated into outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the Boston Massacre. In 1772, colonists in Rhode Island boarded and burned a customs schooner. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the Tea Act in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy East India Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but the governor of Massachusetts permitted British tea ships to remain in Boston Harbor—so the Sons of Liberty destroyed the tea chests.|$|E

500|$|Bannings of Candide lasted {{into the}} twentieth century in the United States, where it has long been {{considered}} a seminal work of Western literature. At least once, Candide was temporarily barred from entering America: in February 1929, a US <b>customs</b> <b>official</b> in Boston prevented a number of copies of the book, deemed [...] "obscene", from reaching a Harvard University French class. Candide was admitted in August of the same year; however by that time the class was over. In an interview soon after Candides detention, the official who confiscated the book explained the office's decision to ban it, [...] "But about 'Candide,' I'll tell you. For years we've been letting that book get by. There were so many different editions, all sizes and kinds, some illustrated and some plain, that we figured the book must be all right.

500|$|Initially {{the stay}} at Singapore was peaceful, and Judy stayed with a <b>customs</b> <b>official</b> {{and his family}} for a week ashore. The ship was rarely {{deployed}} until January 1942 when it was deployed with other gunboats to provide covering bombardments {{along the coast of}} Malaya for retreating troops, and occasionally to carry out evacuations. By this time, Judy was primarily being looked after by Petty Officer George White. The Battle of Singapore took place between 8–15 February. On the first day, along with the other military vessels, Grasshopper was sailed out to sea to provide anti-aircraft fire. By 11 February, Grasshopper and its sister ship Dragonfly were the largest vessels left at Singapore. On 13 February, the vessels were ordered to evacuate personnel and leave Singapore. The ships left at 9pm that evening, and travelled together. White later reported that Judy had [...] "personally greeted virtually everyone on board".|$|E
500|$|The initial {{preview of}} the book was met with {{a huge amount of}} controversy, as it showed a nude Madonna wearing a rabbit's tail, shaving the pubic hair of a naked man, and cavorting {{outdoors}} with a dog, suggesting bestiality. [...] The Vatican urged its people to boycott the release, saying that it was [...] "morally intolerable". Indian customs officials said that the book offended the country's public morality. The Press Trust of India (PTI), India's domestic news agency, quoted a top <b>customs</b> <b>official</b> as saying the book would be seized under a section of the Customs Act prohibiting entry of indecent literature. Citizens of Alexandria, Louisiana {{filed a complaint with the}} city's police department on behalf of a group called the Rapides Parish Chapter of American Family Association, claiming that it violated Louisiana's anti-obscenity laws. South US Baptists did not want their Bibles coming off the same printing presses as Madonna's Sex and threatened to stop doing business with a Chicago printer. The Nashville-based Baptist Sunday School Board, a division of the Southern Baptist Convention, reviewed their $2.1million ($ in [...] dollars) printing contract with R.R. Donnelley & Sons. Board President James Draper said he was infuriated that Donnelley also printed [...] "such an obscene book". Entertainment Tonight reported that Madonna herself had initiated the mayhem with the explicit content in the music video for [...] "Erotica", walking bare breasted at designer Jean Paul Gaultier's fashion show and posing nude in Vanity Fair magazine.

500|$|Barr {{tried to}} escape from his {{confinement}} four times. By November 1942 he had recovered sufficiently from the injuries received in June {{to break out of}} the hospital where he was being held in Bergamo, northern Italy. [...] He made his way to the Swiss border, but was challenged by an Italian <b>customs</b> <b>official,</b> whom he struck with a rock before being recaptured. Court-martialled on a charge of murder, Barr only avoided a death sentence when the Swiss Red Cross colonel representing him located the official and proved that he had not died. Barr was instead sentenced to ninety days solitary confinement in Gavi Prison Camp, Genoa. In August 1943, with Italy on the verge of surrender, prisoners of war were rounded up for transport to Germany. Barr jumped from a moving train bound for the Brenner Pass and joined a group of Italian partisans in Pontremoli, remaining at large for two months before again being captured. Taken to a transit camp just over the Austrian border, Barr and fourteen other prisoners escaped by tunnelling under the barbed wire. Eventually he managed to link up with an Allied special operations unit, which was gathering intelligence behind enemy lines, sabotaging Axis infrastructure, and helping Allied prisoners and Italian refugees escape over the Apennine Mountains along the so-called [...] "Alpine Route". Barr was recaptured and escaped once more before finally making it through the Alpine crossing himself, leading a group of more than twenty. After reaching friendly lines in March 1944, he was sent to a military hospital in Vasto, weighing only [...] and in poor health, suffering malaria, malnutrition, and blood poisoning. The assistance he rendered to fellow Allied fugitives earned him the Military Cross (MC) for [...] "Exceptional courage in organising escapes"; the award was gazetted on 1December 1944. He is thought to be one of only five or six RAAF pilots to receive the MC during World WarII.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} days there were running punch-ups between ICAC {{officers}} and angry policemen who stormed their offices in Central District; this situation ended only with the announcement of a partial amnesty for minor corruptions committed before 1977. But gradually, the ICAC made itself felt and several high profile police officers were tried and convicted. Others were forced to retire. As {{a result of its}} investigations, a mass purge took place in early 1978, where it was announced that 119 officers including one <b>customs</b> <b>official</b> were asked to leave under the provisions of Colonial Regulation 55 (see footnote 1 below) to fast track the decisions in the public interest; a further 24 officers were held on conspiracy charges, and 36 officers and a <b>customs</b> <b>official</b> were given amnesties. The move received a mixed response from the public whilst being broadly supported by legislative councillors as being {{in the best interests of}} Hong Kong not to let the affair fester and further demoralise the police Force.
