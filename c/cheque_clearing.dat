5000|$|Following {{concerns}} {{about the amount of}} time it took the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company to clear cheques, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading set up a working group in 2006 to look at the <b>cheque</b> <b>clearing</b> cycle. Their report said that clearing times could be improved, but that the costs associated with speeding up the <b>cheque</b> <b>clearing</b> cycle could not be justified considering the use of cheques was declining. [...] However, they concluded the biggest problem was the unlimited time a bank could take to dishonour a cheque. To address this, changes were implemented so that the maximum time after a cheque was deposited that it could be dishonoured was six days, what was known as the [...] "certainty of fate" [...] principle.|$|E

5000|$|As the [...] "cheques" [...] have superficially the {{appearance}} of a standard cheque, they may be accepted by the cash office of a payee company, who will then pass them to their bank along with regular cheques. Because they are not cheques drawn on a regular bank, it is not possible for them to clear through the normal system operated by <b>Cheque</b> and Credit <b>Clearing</b> Company.

50|$|Sometimes {{real-time}} posting {{is thought}} to mean 'there is no batch'. This is not the case. Real-time posting systems still need to support batch processing.

Examples of those batches would be check (<b>cheque)</b> <b>clearing</b> files or payment exchange files.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the float period (cheque kiting) to delay the notice of non-existent funds.

5000|$|Warrants {{look like}} <b>cheques</b> and <b>clear</b> through {{the banking system}} like cheques, but are not drawn against cleared funds in a deposit account.

50|$|BIS {{added an}} {{additional}} recommendation {{in relation to}} countries which use cheques. It urged the operators of <b>cheque</b> <b>clearing</b> to have special regard {{to the fact that}} cheques may be dishonoured and returned some days after presentation, and this poses special risks. This is particularly relevant to countries such as Britain, Ireland, France, and US and should be regarded as the 11th commandment of payments.|$|E
