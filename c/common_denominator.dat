5|$|Unlike unique {{sciences}} such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or {{discipline of}} design is not {{brought to a}} generally accepted <b>common</b> <b>denominator.</b> The historical beginnings of design are complex {{and the nature of}} design is still the subject of ongoing discussion. In design, there are strong differentiations between theory and practice. The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as intuition. In his Classification of Design (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. industrial design, packaging design, service design), information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design), and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).|$|E

25|$|Critics object {{claiming}} that the ASEAN Way's emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference, forces the organisation to adopt only those policies which satisfy the lowest <b>common</b> <b>denominator.</b> Decision making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue.

Equivalently, it is impossible for a square (the geometric shape) and a right triangle to have both equal areas and all sides commensurate with each other.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that the asset-based {{approach}} is one explanation for sustain ability in programmes supporting vulnerable children. We structure our argument by formulating five questions and then pursuing tentative answers to them.

We then consider the <b>common</b> <b>denominators</b> in programmes that have shown evidence of sustainable practices for supporting vulnerable children. This {{is followed by a}} deliberated link of the identified sustainability factors (e. g. <b>common</b> <b>denominators)</b> with the asset-based approach as a theoretical framework. Subsequently, we consider why the asset-based approach can be considered in terms of supporting vulnerable children in education. We indicate the similarities between the asset-based approach and current discourses focusing on the notion of schools as nodes of support and care. We conclude by suggesting that knowledge of asset-based good practices could be shared with families in school-based sessions, thereby developing schools', families' and communities' capacity to support vulnerable children...|$|R
40|$|Learning and {{processing}} fractions is complex {{for children and}} even adults. Errors produced by children suggest that the knowledge of natural numbers can interfere with this learning {{and processing}} (e. g., Stafylidou & Vosniadou, 2004). Here, a priming paradigm {{was used to test}} this interference and its control in adults. If adults rely on the knowledge of natural numbers to process fractions, performance should be poorer to compare fractions with common numerators (incongruent pairs because the larger fraction is made up of the smaller denominator) than to compare fractions with <b>common</b> <b>denominators</b> (congruent pairs because the larger fractions is made up of the larger numerator). If adults inhibit the knowledge of natural numbers to correctly compare fractions with common numerators, comparing natural numbers should be more costly after the processing of these fractions. Adult participants were presented pairs of fractions with <b>common</b> <b>denominators</b> or numerators, pairs of natural numbers and pairs of squares and were asked to perform a magnitude-comparison task. The comparison of fractions, natural numbers and squares primed the comparison of natural numbers. In the general priming condition, the fraction components differed from the natural numbers that were presented as the probe. In the specific priming condition, they were the same. A questionnaire assessed the conceptual and procedural knowledge of fractions. The results showed that response times were slower and the percentage of errors was higher for fractions with common numerators than for fractions with <b>common</b> <b>denominators,</b> which suggest that the knowledge of natural numbers interfered with the processing of fractions with common numerators. Furthermore, participants compared more slowly and less accurately natural numbers when they were primed by fractions with common numerators compared to when they were primed by fractions with <b>common</b> <b>denominators.</b> This negative priming effect was larger in the specific priming condition than in the general priming condition. These results suggest that the knowledge of natural numbers was inhibited during the processing of fractions with common numerators. In conclusion, the knowledge of natural numbers interferes with the processing of the magnitude of denominators in adults and this interference has to be actively controlled in order to correctly compare fractions...|$|R
