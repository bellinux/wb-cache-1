5|$|Wall, {{along with}} Tommy Tallarico, has {{produced}} the Video Games Live concert series, which began on July 6, 2005. The two had been planning the concert series, which presents orchestrated versions of music from dozens of games, for three years.

Video Games Live was intended to take the idea of a symphonic video game music concert, which was popular in Japan, and <b>combine</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a rock concert to make it appealing to western fans. The series is international and ongoing, with more than 70 shows planned for 2009.

25|$|Due to its {{proximity}} and familiarity, Earth's Moon is discussed {{as a target}} for colonization.

25|$|Japanese scholar Miya Noriko {{presumes that}} the year 1402 was a {{landmark}} for the reigning King Taejong {{of the newly}} founded Joseon Dynasty. After a bloody succession struggle, Taejong ascended to the throne in 1400.

In the 6th month of 1402, Yi Hoe's map of Korea was offered in a ceremony to celebrate his birthday. Then the project to <b>combine</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Chinese and Japanese maps reportedly started in the summer (4th-6th months). This would be of symbolic significance in demonstrating royal power. This hypothesis also explains the factual error about the map of Japan. It was during the reigns of Taejo (1st king) and Jeongjong (2nd) that the map was obtained in Japan, but the date was altered to Taejong's reign.|$|E

25|$|Off {{the field}} issues {{continued}} to overshadow the team, although initially things {{seemed to have}} pacified when former manager Walter Smith was appointed {{as chairman of the}} Plc board in May, however, he lasted less than two months before resigning. Smith's departure coincided with the return of former Chief executive Charles Green in a consultant capacity. Green became embroiled in a row with Rangers manager Ally McCoist after her suggested that McCoist had to win a cup as well as League One that season to save his job. Ultimately, Greens influence was seen to be more damaging than positive and he agreed to resign his position and sell his remaining shares in the club to Sandy Easdale. A second former board member, Imran Ahmad, also sold his remaining shares in the club as it was reported he was preparing to sue the club for £3.4m in unpaid bonus money. Meanwhile, a group of Rangers shareholders, led by former director Paul Murray, requisitioned an EGM to vote on the removal of Plc board directors including chief executive Craig Mather. This was partly the result of shareholders being concerned over Mather's £500,000 annual salary. The Rangers board opening negotiations with the requisitioners in late August to delay the EGM and <b>combine</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> AGM business and after prolonged and fictitious meetings the requisitioners withdrew the request for an EGM. Nevertheless, the requisitioners were not to be deterred and wrote to Rangers with a proposal to have four new directors appointed at the AGM, however the board failed to put this motion on the agenda forcing the requisitioners to seek an interim interdict in order for a new agenda to be sent out thus delaying the AGM.|$|E
