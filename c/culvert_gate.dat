40|$|Numerous bat species, {{including}} some threatened species, inhabit thousands of abandoned mines across the United States. Some of their bat habitat {{has been lost}} as mines are closed to reduce hazards to the public. Bat gates {{have been used to}} close some mines because they restrict public access while still allowing the bats to fly in and out. However, they are not appropriate for mines with trench portals. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposed using culverts in the trenches and closing the culverts with bat gates. BLM worked with the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) to study the effects of this type of closure on the microclimate of the mines, which in turn could affect bats’ fidelity to the habitat. CSM developed a process that integrated continuous climate measurements with data from a computer model and tested it at three abandoned uranium mines in southwestern Colorado. Measurements were taken for 1 year prior to and 1 year after closing the mines with culvert gates. The results showed that the <b>culvert</b> <b>gate</b> closure slightly modified the microclimate by essentially extending the length of the mine, but indicated that bats should be able to locate the same climatic conditions {{a few feet away from}} their original roosting locations. The computer model predictions compared favorably with the measurements, and the model provided relevant insight regarding the qualitative trends reflected by the field measurements...|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{temperature}} sensing (DTS) {{provides an}} important technology {{support for the}} earth-rock junctions of dike projects (ERJD), which are binding sites between <b>culvert,</b> <b>gates,</b> and pipes and dike body and dike foundation. In this study, a blind source separation model {{is used for the}} identification of leakages based on the temperature data of DTS in leakage monitoring of ERJD. First, a denoising method is established based on the temperature monitoring data of distributed optical fiber in ERJD by a wavelet packet signal decomposition technique. The temperature monitoring messages of fibers are combined response for leakages and other factors. Its character of unclear responding mechanism is very obvious. Thus, a blind source separation technology is finally selected. Then, the rule of temperature measurement data for optical fiber is analyzed and its temporal and spatial change process is also discussed. The realization method of the blind source separation model is explored by combining independent component analysis (ICA) with principal component analysis (PCA). The practical test result in an example shows that the method could efficiently locate and identify the leakage location of ERJD. This paper is expected to be useful for further scientific research and efficient applications of distributed optical fiber sensing technology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Flooding in the {{northern}} part of The Netherlands has caused serious economic threats to densely populated areas. Therefore a project has been carried out in a pilot area to assess the retention of water in two river basins as a way to reduce flooding. The physically-based groundwater and sur-face water model SIMGRO was used to model the hydrology of the basins. The model was calibrated using discharges and groundwater levels. Scenarios of measures to assess the possibility of retaining water in the basin were then defined and tested. The first measure was the retention of higher dis-charges using <b>culverts</b> or <b>gates</b> in the upstream part of the basin. The second measure was to make the streams shallower and thereby, increase flood plain storage. The last measure was flood water storage in a designated area in the downstream part of one basin. The analysis indicates that holding water in the upstream parts of the basins proved to be feasible and can result in significant reductions of peak flows...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} mixing and exchange of saltwater between a microtidal estuary and a lake connected by an automated box <b>culvert</b> bi-directional <b>gated</b> structure. The gates open four times each day and remain open {{for a period of}} 2 h. They are programmed to open once during each semi-diurnal tidal phase, thus allowing alternative and partial exchange between the two water bodies. To determine the mixing dynamics, vertical profiles of temperature and salinity were collected as water flowed from the lake into the estuary and vice versa. The profiles were taken over a number of days and during various tidal ranges to examine the effect of tidal amplitude on the mixing dynamics of the plume. The results showed that the structure permits the exchange of saline and freshwater between the two systems, maintaining the lake system as a saline (brackish) environment.

40|$|Although the {{majority}} of the conveyance of irrigation water is by open channels, closed conduits or pipes also {{play an important role in}} water transport, especially in pressurized irrigation systems like sprinkler and drip irrigation. However, pipes may also be found in other imgation methods, either as short sections (such as <b>culverts,</b> syphons, <b>gated</b> pipes) or in longer supply sections, e. g. over difficult terrain, over high-seepage sections or otherwise as buried supply lines. In such applications, pressures are normally lower than in sprinkler and drip irrigation systems, which leads to different materials being used. In situations where water, land, and labour are scarce and expensive, the advantages of buried pipes like no seepage losses, no loss of land, low maintenance, and possible automation may outweigh the high installation cost. Similar to open channel flow, imgation water flow through pipes is a standard component of irrigation engineering. The hydraulics of pipe flow have been studied for a long time and quite a number of empirical and more physically-based formulas have been developed e. g. to relate flow rates to pipe diameter, head loss and material properties.

Water levels and floodplain habitat availability in the Lower Columbia River and estuary (LCRE) are influenced by tides, river flow, hydropower operations, water withdrawals, dikes, <b>culverts,</b> tide <b>gates,</b> and coastal processes. The removal of barriers to fish passage and macrodetritus export by hydrological reconnection of floodplain habitats along 234 river kilometers is catalyzing changes in physical and biological indicators, which we have measured at 3 ̆e 60 reference and 3 ̆e 10 restoration sites in research begun in 2004. Key elements of the restoration program are a conceptual model, prioritization, status-and- trends monitoring, database development, adaptive management, and critical uncertainties and effectiveness research. We investigated and quantified ecosystem controlling factors on water surface elevation, channel morphology, microtopography, inundation, large woody debris, and the composition and distribution of tidal estuarine and freshwater plant communities. We used a sum exceedance value metric to describe the influence of spatially varying water level regimes on Populus balsamifera riparian forests, Picea sitchensis swamps, Salix and Cornus sericea wetlands, and brackish and freshwater marshes. Building on these analyses, we recently proposed a system zonation that is based on discrete transitions in the hydrologic regime. The Estuary is comprised of a lower reach with salinity intrusion, the energy minimum, and an upper reach without salinity intrusion. The Tidal River is also comprised of three reaches, in which water levels are increasingly dominated by river flow instead of tides.

40|$|PURPOSE: In-stream uptake and {{processing}} of nitrate nitrite-N may be improved in large river systems by increasing hydrological connectivity between the main channel and adjoining back-waters, wetlands, and floodplain areas. Engineering designs to increase connectivity and loading to backwaters {{need to consider}} nitrate nitrite-N uptake capacity and efficiency in relation to hydraulic loading and residence {{time in order to}} optimize in-stream N processing. These rela-tionships were examined during three summer periods for a series of backwater systems on the Upper Mississippi River that received flow-regulated nitrate nitrite-N loads via <b>gated</b> <b>culverts.</b> BACKGROUND: Nitrogen (N) runoff to receiving streams and rivers, particularly in the form of nitrate-nitrite-N, has increased several-fold in recent decades (Justic et al. 1995, Vitusek et al. 1997, Goolsby and Battaglin 2001). A consequence of accelerated N mobilization and transport has been water quality degradation of coastal areas and estuaries sensitive to N inputs (Nixon 1995). For instance, increased N loading from the Mississippi River basin has been associated with the development of extensive areas of anoxia and hypoxia (Rabalais et al. 1994) and declines in fish and invertebrate abundance (Pavela et al. 1983) in the Gulf of Mexico. Continued unchecked N loading to coastal systems could lead to significant declines in the diversity an...|$|R

Version 2, though, cannot accommodate systems that have a significant sloping water surface since the vertical coordinate system is aligned with gravity and vertical accelerations are neglected.

30|$|One land {{management}} strategy implemented on {{public and private}} peatlands {{is the use of}} water control structures to control the amount of water discharged through roadside channels, and thereby raise or lower the water table. <b>Gated</b> <b>culverts</b> were constructed and managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to control surface water elevation on public lands before the Evans Road Fire. The US Fish and Wildlife Service manages the water table to reduce wildland fire risk and to improve migratory waterfowl habitat and forage. In contrast, the adjacent private lands where the lightning ignition occurred were being managed to lower the water table (> 2 m) for agriculture and hunting. Figure 3 illustrates the difference in burn depth between managed hydrology on public versus private lands. Poulter et al. (2006) estimated that, {{in order to maintain the}} region’s peatlands as a C sink at the current rate of C sequestration (0.109 kg C m− 2 yr− 1 to 0.127 kg C m− 2 yr− 1), the fire return interval must be > 20 yr to 80 yr. The Allen Road and Evans Road wildfires demonstrate that peat-land wildfires are a C source when the ignitions occur during periods of repeated drought and when land mangers lower the water table through manipulation of water control structures to increase surface water discharge.|$|R

Further pipes have been discovered across the town. The water would have been pressurised in reservoirs; it has been argued by archaeologist Philip Crummy that the pipes would have been fed by a castellum divisiorum, a water tower with multiple outlets, and that in order to get water to where the pipes at Balkerne Lane were found some form of aqueduct or water-lifting wheel would have been need to bring it from springs West of the town.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{barriers}} to fish movement have {{and continue to}} negatively impact fish populations. In the Pacific Northwest, these barriers are typically dams, <b>culverts,</b> or tide <b>gates.</b> Frequently, fish passage barrier removal occurs in an ad-hoc, opportunistic fashion across the landscape without regard for a strategic focus of which projects might yield the greatest benefit at the population level. In response to this, new initiatives have been developed with a more strategic focus, using optimization models {{to arrive at the}} best barrier removal solutions for limited or constrained resources. A group of federal and state agencies in Oregon have developed a Focused Fish Passage Demonstration Project (FFPDP) centered on the coastal Tillamook-Nestucca sub-basin, in hopes of highlighting the benefits of a strategic sub-basin-focused approach. As part of this effort, the best-available barrier and habitat data was obtained for the sub-basin, and an optimization model used to generate the optimum solutions for given assumptions or budget scenarios. A ranked list of top priority {{barriers to}} remove was generated under differing habitat quality assumptions, and several potential FFPDP budgets were utilized as cost constraints to develop optimal fish passage barrier removal scenarios. Compiling available data revealed that 270 manmade barriers obstruct passage to over 250 miles of fish-bearing streams in the study area. Optimization model analysis showed that strategically prioritizing future investments on a relatively small subset of barriers could produce substantial gains in connectivity.

40|$|Fish {{passage is}} a key {{component}} to many facets of fisheries resource management. Connectivity between aquatic habitats {{is an important part}} of garnering successful and healthy fish populations. Without habitat connectivity, resident or fluvial fish species such as native trout and suckers become isolated, leading to reduced levels of genetic diversity and fitness. For anadromous populations, fish passage can allow access to new habitats or fertile spawning grounds that are pivotal for success of the species. In addition to providing access to vital spawning habitats for adults, fish passage also provides access to essential rearing habitats for juvenile life histories. Population isolation due to fish passage barriers also heightens migratory fish exposure to disturbances, thus increasing the potential magnitude of the disturbance at a population level. Fish passage barriers are prevalent throughout the Oregon landscape. Over time, despite fish passage rules and regulations, access to native fish habitats has been blocked or impaired by the construction of impassable <b>culverts,</b> dams, tide <b>gates,</b> dikes, bridges, and other anthropogenic infrastructure. Providing passage at these artificial obstructions is vital to recovering Oregon’s native migratory fish populations. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s (ODFW) latest inventory shows over 27, 800 artificial obstructions to fish passage in the State of Oregon. Of those, only 17 % are documented as providing adequate fish passage for native migratory fish. With so many barriers spread across the landscape, and funding becoming scarce, it is paramount that we thoroughly prioritize fish passage, with inclusion of multiple parameters. This will allow for a focused effort to improving passage conditions and meeting a critical need of Oregon’s native migratory fish. This presentation will focus on the development and methodology used to prioritize fish passage barriers across the State of Oregon...|$|R

40|$|The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) {{manages a}} system of canals and {{structures}} that control the flow through several large storm water treatment areas (STA). The present project was initiated because of the partial failure of a three-barrel, <b>gated</b> box <b>culvert</b> structure that belongs to the system. The structure has a forebay with three sluice gates that control the flow into three 8 ft by 8 ft box culverts. Settling and partial failure of the culverts in the structure was presumably caused by piping of sediment through joints in pre-cast sections of culvert. It was hypothesized that both unsteady pressure fluctuations and pressure differentials between the outside and inside of the culverts led to the piping failure. To better understand flow characteristics in the culvert that may cause these adverse effects, a 1 : 8 -scale model {{of one of the}} three <b>gated</b> <b>culverts</b> was constructed. The bed of the model culvert was instrumented with eight pressure tap transducers. In addition, a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system was employed to record velocity distributions immediately downstream of the sluice gate, where piping and settlement was most prominent in the prototype. Eight experiments of varying gate settings and flow conditions were carried out in the flume model. Both pressure and velocity distribution data were gathered. PIV data provided visual depiction of the formation, travel path, and translation to the flume bed of turbulent flow structures originating in the hydraulic jump recirculation zone within the model. The pressure taps captured spikes in pressures associated with these flow structures as they were translated to the bed. Trends between pressure and velocity were observed in the data and indicated that low gate settings produced conditions that were more likely to cause the aforementioned adverse effects in the prototype. The flow jet in low gate settings produced strong negative pressure zones along the bed, downstream of the gate. It also generated a more pronounced recirculation zone above the jet where turbulent structures were observed to form and be translated to the bed causing spikes in pressure. Adviser: David M.

40|$|The Hudson-Raritan Estuary (HRE) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{urbanized}} estuaries in the world, and centuries of urban and industrial land uses have resulted in severely degraded ecological conditions. The Estuary spans the boundaries of many municipalities within New York and New Jersey (including New York City). Planning for restoration within such an ecologically and politically diverse system poses many challenges. The New York District with its partner the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in a collaborative effort with over 60 organizations in partnership with NY/NJ Harbor Estuary Program released the Draft Comprehensive Restoration Plan. The Plan established 11 goals for the HRE to create and restore a mosaic of habitats within a human dominated landscape. One of the goals, Tributary Connections, aims to reconnect freshwater streams to the estuary and provide a range of quality habitats to aquatic organisms. Historically, anadromous spawning runs of alewife, blueback herring, striped bass and American shad and catadromous runs of American eel were common in the HRE. Poor stream conditions and an increased number of obstacles to upstream migration, like tide <b>gates,</b> <b>culverts</b> and dams have reduced these speciesâ€™ migration opportunities. An integral component of the Tributary Connection initiative will be the identification and prioritization of potential locations to restore diadromous fish passage. Currently the HRE Region has no prioritization or assessment strategy procedures for identifying potential locations. To advance this strategy, the study team is developing a process to inventory and screen barriers and their associated ecological settings. Information collected through this process will be used to determine viability of sites for barrier removal or bypass and successful re-establishment of fish passage in the HRE. The objective of this project is to develop a systematic method for identifying and assessing fish passage barriers within the HRE. The first step of this process will be accomplished by creating as detailed and complete a database of blockages as possible through desktop analysis. As a next step, barriers and tributary reaches will be reviewed to create a thorough database of habitat, biological, structural and landscape attributes. Field assessments will be conducted to identify undocumented obstacles and supplement desktop analysis. Ultimately, these metrics will be used to rank, compare and prioritize individual barriers for restoration potential...|$|R
