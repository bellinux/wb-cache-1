These Buddhist texts were {{translated}} into <b>Chinese</b> (in a <b>Literary</b> <b>Chinese</b> style) in China long ago. The translation rule for mantras were not to translate the mantra, but instead to represent it phonetically with Chinese characters. For the sutras, they were translated into <b>Chinese</b> <b>Literary</b> <b>Language</b> (Wenyan). The terms prajñāpāramitā (...) and samyaksaṃ-bodhi (...) , or [...] "Perfection of Wisdom" [...] and [...] "Fully Enlightened", both appear in the Heart Sutra, but are written using ateji.|$|R

50|$|The {{historical}} and linguistic background to modern Chinese poetry involves a long Classical Chinese poetry tradition, written or chanted in specialized, literary forms versus modern changes both in vernacular varieties of Chinese {{as well as}} the development of and exposure to various other poetic traditions from modern Europe and the United States, both directly and indirectly through Japanese literary sources. Thus, one important change in the history of Chinese poetry involves the revaluation of the use of Classical <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> <b>language</b> and the traditions of Classical Chinese poetry. Another is the more global phenomenon of modernism in poetry, involving rejecting traditional poetic forms and styles in favor of experimental developments and novelties.|$|R

5000|$|Ricci {{could speak}} Chinese {{as well as}} read and write {{classical}} <b>Chinese,</b> the <b>literary</b> <b>language</b> of scholars and officials. He {{was known for his}} appreciation of Chinese culture in general but condemned the prostitution which was widespread in Beijing at the time. During his research, he discovered that in contrast to the cultures of South Asia, Chinese culture was strongly intertwined with Confucian values and therefore decided to use existing Chinese concepts to explain Christianity. He did not explain the Catholic faith as entirely foreign or new; instead, he said that the Chinese culture and people always believed in God and that Christianity is simply the completion of their faith. He borrowed an unusual Chinese term, Tiānzhǔ ( [...] , [...] "Lord of Heaven") to describe the God of Abraham, despite the term's origin in traditional Chinese worship of Heaven. (He also cited many synonyms from the Confucian Classics.) He supported Chinese traditions by agreeing with the veneration of the dead. Dominican and Franciscan missionaries felt he went too far in accommodation and convinced the Vatican to outlaw Ricci's approach. On the other hand, some contemporary authors have venerated Ricci as an exemplar of beneficial inculturation.|$|R

40|$|The first <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> {{history by}} a Chinese author {{appeared}} {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century, founding a body of work spanning almost one hundred years. Of these, the 1920 s and 1930 s was a period of crucial importance. During this time, <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> historians assimilated western theories and methods into their writings. The appearance of various <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> histories incorporating these new theories and methods helps transform these from an early stage of childishness and conservatism into one of maturity and diversification. About one hundred general <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> histories were published during this period, including many famous works, such as Hu Shi's (胡适) Baihua Wenxueshi () and Zheng Zhenduo's (郑振铎) Chatuben Zhongguo Wenxueshi (). Some of them are still popular today. This study approaches these general <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> histories from three aspects, i. e., literary view, conceptions of <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> history and the mode of writing. Besides the deep analysis of the texts, this study also discusses their social, cultural and historical contexts. In this way, this study attempts to discover the reasons for the transformation of <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> historiography and to review the characteristics of the writings. There are five chapters in this thesis. Chapter one traces back to the emergence and early stage of <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> history, and gives a brief account of those histories published in the 1920 s and 1930 s. It also describes the motivation and organization of the thesis. Chapter two explores the influence of the modernization of the traditional <b>literary</b> view on <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> histories. Chapter three analyses the transplantation of Western theories into China, and the way <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> historians assimilate them and apply them to their writing. Chapter four reviews the evolutionist mode of writing which was very popular at that time. The final chapter brings out the characteristics of these writings and discusses their contributions and shortcomings, along with their significance to the later works of <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> historians...|$|R
5000|$|Liu Xie (ca. 465 - ca. 521) enjoys {{paramount}} status among ancient <b>Chinese</b> <b>literary</b> {{critics in}} part because his major work survived, The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons. In 2001, Cai edited and published A <b>Chinese</b> <b>Literary</b> Mind: Culture, Creativity, and Rhetoric in Wenxin Diaolong, a thorough treatment of this masterwork. Notable contributors included Kang-i Sun Chang, Wai-yee Li, Shuen-fu Lin, Richard John Lynn, Victor H. Mair, Stephen Owen, and Andrew H. Plaks, among others. Stephen Owen explains how Liu Xie's formal exposition embodies a [...] "discourse machine" [...] with a logic that contends with Liu's authorial discretion. Owen's Readings in <b>Chinese</b> <b>Literary</b> Thought [...] explains and translates portions of Wenxin diaolong (183-298) but A <b>Chinese</b> <b>Literary</b> Mind is noteworthy in contrast for its comprehensive treatment by multiple contributors.|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} <b>literary</b> <b>language</b> is not {{the language}} we learn the first; it is either a dialect or any other non-literary genre, i. e. the language spoken by our parents. Proficiency in the <b>literary</b> <b>language</b> is of great importance since it has had {{an important role in}} in the history of establishing the Slovenian nation. The <b>literary</b> <b>language</b> is widespread throughout the territory of Slovenia, dialects and other non-literary genres are however confined to a small part of Slovenia. As regards the standard <b>literary</b> <b>language,</b> we consciously and proactively begin to learn it in elementary school. It is therefore of crucial importance that a teacher whether he or she is a class or subject teacher masters the standard <b>literary</b> <b>language,</b> uses it in the classroom and encourages pupils to apply it. The objective of the empirical research carried out was to determine the actual use of the literary and the non-literary language in some elementary schools in the Upper and Central Vipava Valley by teachers and pupils and the implications of the dialect of the Primorska region in teaching speech. The sample consisted of ten teachers coming from the Primorska region and ten audio recordings of lessons of these teachers. Analysis of the results showed that the <b>literary</b> <b>language</b> as well as the non-literary language is used in the classroom both by teachers and pupils; but in general the <b>literary</b> <b>language.</b> Pupils, unlike teachers, prefer to use the non-literary language. It was also found that teachers do not ask pupils to use the <b>literary</b> <b>language.</b> Nevertheless, teachers find it vital that pupils learn how to speak the <b>literary</b> <b>language</b> on one hand and they find it important that the dialect is nurtured on the other hand. Pupils in class do not endeavour to talk specifically the <b>literary</b> <b>language.</b> Moreover, teachers interviewed during the study were not encouraged by all professors to speak the <b>literary</b> <b>language.</b> The interviewed teachers and their professors mostly all in class used the <b>literary</b> <b>language.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays it is {{believed}} that language in daily communication rather than <b>literary</b> <b>language</b> should be the target of learning in L 2 education. This is mainly because <b>literary</b> <b>language</b> is said to be uncommon in life. This paper reports on a study in which some Hong Kong ESL learners’ English proficiency was re-examined through literary texts. These learners had reached intermediate or advanced levels of English prior to the study and were generally competent in daily English. However, many of them encountered difficulty in understanding <b>literary</b> <b>language.</b> Their proficiency in general English test could not match their performances in understanding literary works. The findings reveal that learners who are strong in general proficiency may not be good in understanding <b>literary</b> <b>language.</b> Lack of <b>literary</b> <b>language</b> in the curriculum results in a false and distorted picture about the learners’ proficiency. <b>Literary</b> <b>language</b> helps upgrade L 2 learners’ real proficiency in the target language...|$|R
