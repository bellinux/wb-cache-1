However, simple and costeffective method {{should be available}} with the clinician, alternate to <b>crimpable</b> hooks.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of pre-adjusted {{edgewise}} orthodontic bracket systems, archwire fabrication has been considerably simplified. Archwires that are devoid of any loops or customizing bends can be utilized. These include fabricated tie-back loops, soldered brass hooks, pre-posted archwires and <b>crimpable</b> archwire hooks. Soldering requires chairside or laboratory equipment, is time consuming and may lead to annealing of the archwire. <b>Crimpable</b> archwire attachment allows quick and simple placement of the attachment in any desired position along the archwire {{in or out of}} the mouth. This clinical pearl aims at showing an easy and effective method of <b>crimpable</b> hook attachment without any compromise on arch wire properties...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this innovation was to ease, minimise the working time at chair side by loading the <b>crimpable</b> hook for retraction/protraction/any other clinical situation demanding placement of the <b>crimpable</b> hook when the archwire is in position. For the same reason a plier routinely used which can be modified to suit the above purpose was thought off. This innovative plier serves dual purpose. As it is a modified distal end cutter, there is an added feature of crimping the hook to the arch wire apart from serving the basic purpose of cutting the distal end. Thus saves time at chairside. The innovative FAS *twin function plier has a high efficiency, ease of use, is economic, for distal end cutting of the arch wire...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain the {{versatility}} offered by the use of arch wires with boot loops in retraction mechanics while taking direct anchorage from mini-screws. Materials and Methods: The materials include the mini screws placed at the appropriate location and retraction arches made of 0. 019 X 0. 025 SS with boot loops placed distal to the lateral incisors. Mini screw provides a stable anchorage for enmasse retraction of the anterior teeth with the help of a boot loop using sliding and/or loop mechanics. Results: The arch wires with boot loops have a definite advantage over the soldered/ <b>crimpable</b> hooks because of the versatility it offers during the process of retraction. Conclusion: An innovative approach combining the advantages of absolute anchorage using mini implants and a retraction arch with boot loop is presented here...|$|E
40|$|In {{intraoperative}} {{intermaxillary fixation}} (IMF), bonding a minimally adapted, rectangular, stainless steel, preformed archwire {{directly to the}} teeth with a light-cured composite resin can offer many benefits to clinicians and patients. The procedure is easier and less time-consuming than conventional bracket placement, the risk of occlusal interference is reduced and the patient's comfort is increased. With the use of composite resin, the wire fits buccal tooth surfaces accurately, thus creating a completely passive anchor unit. <b>Crimpable</b> hooks can be easily adjusted along the archwire, thus establishing different directions of postoperative elastic traction. Furthermore, this technique eliminates soft tissue injuries and tooth root damage, which are risks {{associated with the use}} of miniscrews for IMF. In this clinical report, we describe the case of a 50 -year-old man, who required a passive anchor unit to assist IMF before undergoing maxillomandibular advancement to treat severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : It is {{difficult}} to bend NiTi wire because of its shape memory properties. Although prefabricated NiTi archwires, such as the Connecticut Intrusion Arch or utility archwire are available, there is no simple, economic method available to incorporate first or second order bends in NiTi wires. Similarly there is no simple, economic and reliable method available to place stops in NiTi archwires. A simple creative method of using sterile disposable surgical needle segments as archwire stops (Makhija, Abhishek, Kamna or MAK stops) and archwire bends (MAK bends) is demonstrated. These may be adapted as custom stops and bends in NiTi archwires for fabricating intrusion, extrusion, expansion and distalization archwires. Materials and methods: Fresh unused, sterile, disposable, 18 to 23 gauge surgical needles are segmented using a diamond cutting disk to use as <b>crimpable</b> stops (MAK stops), stops of varying length may also be bent with optical pliers to incorporate bends in NiTi wires (MAK bends). Conclusion: MAK stops and MAK bends are simple, easy and an economical chairside method to incorporate a range of applications which, overcome some of issues with formability of NiTi wires...|$|E
