40|$|What is {{the nature}} of {{imperfections}} in the market for liquidity? Studying bidder level data from European Central Bank (ECB) repo auctions, we find that this market appears to be informationally efficient in the sense that participants do not have private information about future short-term rates. However, auction allocations affect banks' subsequent behavior {{in a way that is}} consistent with a degree of allocational and operational inefficiency. Also, large bidders appear to have better access to the interbank market than small ones. Finally, the evidence suggests that the ECB uses <b>collateral</b> <b>haircuts</b> that do not equilibrate opportunity costs. Copyright (c) 2009 The Ohio State University. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of risky debt in which {{collateral}} value is correlated {{with the possibility of}} default. The model is then used to study: 1) the expected amount of debt recovered in the event of default as a function of collateral; and 2) the amount of collateral needed to mitigate the riskiness of a loan to a desired degree. The results obtained could prove useful for estimating recovery rates required by many popular models of credit risk and for determining <b>collateral</b> <b>haircuts</b> in debt transactions. The analysis also generates testable predictions of the behaviour of historical recovery rates of risky debt when collateral is involved. Regulators might benefit from the analysis in developing capital adequacy requirements and reviewing banks' lending standards relative to current collateral values. credit risk; collateral; recovery rates; options theory...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{examine how}} the use of extreme value theory yields {{collateral}} requirements that are robust to extreme fluctuations in the market price of the asset used as collateral. In particular, they study the risk and cost attributes of market risk measures by constructing a risk-cost frontier for the collateral pledged to cover exposures in a securities settlement system. The frontier {{can be used as}} a diagnostic tool to understand the risk-cost trade-off of different methodologies to calculate <b>collateral</b> value (<b>haircuts)</b> and select the most efficient alternative in a variety of settings.

40|$|Central banks play {{a pivotal}} role in well-functioning {{payments}} systems by providing liquidity via collateralized lending. This article discusses the role of <b>collateral</b> and <b>haircut</b> policy in central bank lending, as well as the distinguishing features of the central bank’s policy relative to private sector practices. It presents a model that explicitly incorporates the unique role of central banks in the payments system and argues that central banks must consider how their haircut policies affect the relative price and liquidity of assets, the market’s asset allocation, and the likelihood of participants to default. Furthermore, under extraordinary circumstances, there is a rationale for the central bank to temporarily reduce haircuts or broaden the list of eligible collateral to mitigate the shortage of liquidity in the market. ...|$|R
40|$|All Eurosystem credit operations, {{including}} the important open market opera-tions, {{need to be}} based on adequate collateral. Liquidity is provided to banks against collateral at market prices subject to a haircut. The Eurosystem adap-ted its collateral framework during the crisis to accept lower-rated assets as <b>collateral.</b> Higher <b>haircuts</b> are applied to insure against liquidity risk as well as the greater volatility of prices of lower-rated assets. • The adaptation of the collateral framework was necessary to provide sufficient liquidity to banks in the euro area periphery in particular. In crisis countries, special emergency liquidity assistance was provided. More than 80 percent of the European Central Bank’s liquidity (Main Refinancing Operations and Long Term Refinancing Operations) is provided to banks in five countries (Greece...|$|R
50|$|The {{initial margin}} {{requirement}} {{is the amount}} of collateral required to open a position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the maintenance requirement. The maintenance requirement is the minimum amount of collateral required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total value of <b>collateral</b> after <b>haircuts</b> dips below the maintenance margin requirement, the position holder must pledge additional collateral to bring their total balance after haircuts back up to or above the initial margin requirement. On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, the regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the maintenance requirement higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives clearing accounts, futures commission merchants may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements. This is typically an additional 10%-25%.|$|R
40|$|<b>Haircutting</b> {{non-cash}} <b>collateral</b> {{has become}} {{a key element of}} the post-crisis reform of the shadow banking system and OTC derivatives markets. This article develops a parametric haircut model by expanding haircut definitions beyond the traditional value-at-risk measure and employing a double-exponential jump-diffusion model for <b>collateral</b> market risk. <b>Haircuts</b> are solved to target credit risk measurements, including probability of default, expected loss or unexpected loss criteria. Comparing to data-driven approach typically run on proxy data series, the model enables sensitivity analysis and stress test, captures market liquidity risk, allows idiosyncratic risk adjustments, and incorporates relevant market information. Computational results for main equities, securitization, and corporate bonds show potential for uses in collateral agreements, e. g. CSAs, and for regulatory capital calculations.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of central bank collateralized lending to study the optimal choice of the haircut policy. We show that a lending {{facility}} provides a bundle of two types of insurance: insurance against liquidity risk as well as insurance against downside risk of the <b>collateral.</b> Setting a <b>haircut</b> therefore involves balancing the trade-off between relaxing the liquidity constraints of agents on one hand, and increasing potential inflation risk and distorting the portfolio choices of agents on the other. We argue that the optimal haircut is higher when the central bank is unable to lend exclusively to agents who actually need liquidity. Finally, for an unexpected drop in the haircut, the central bank can be more aggressive than when setting a permanent level of the haircut.
