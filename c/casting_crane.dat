40|$|The {{operators}} of overhead traveling cranes experience discomfort {{as a result}} of the vibrations of crane structures. These vibrations are produced by defects in the rails on which the cranes move. To improve the comfort of operators, a nine-degree-of-freedom (nine-DOF) mathematical model of a “human–crane–rail” system was constructed. Based on the theoretical guidance provided in ISO 2631 - 1, an annoyance rate model was established, and quantization results were determined. A dynamic optimization design method for overhead traveling cranes is proposed. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimize the crane structural design, with the structure parameters as the basic variables, the annoyance rate model as the objective function, and the acceleration amplitude and displacement amplitude of the crane as the constraint conditions. The proposed model and method were used to optimize the design of a double-girder 100 [*]t– 28. 5 [*]m <b>casting</b> <b>crane,</b> and the optimal parameters are obtained. The results show that optimization decreases the human annoyance rate from 28. 3 % to 9. 8 % and the root mean square of the weighted acceleration of human vibration from 0. 59 [*]m/s 2 to 0. 38 [*]m/s 2. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the models and method proposed in this paper...|$|E

They had {{become part of the}} core group by the time <b>casting</b> concluded. <b>Crane</b> believed that the part of Chandler, described in the character breakdown as [...] "a droll, dry guy", would be the easiest to cast, though it proved more difficult than he initially hoped. Perry had previously worked with Kauffman and Crane on an episode of Dream On, and requested an audition when he identified with the character. He was turned down due to his involvement as a cast member in LAX 2194, a television pilot about airport baggage handlers in the future. After the producers of Friends saw LAX 2194, it became clear to them {{that it would not be}} picked up for a series, and Perry was granted an audition. He read for the role near the end of the casting period and got it in under a week. Before Perry was cast, Craig Bierko was first choice for the role. Bierko was a friend of Perry's, and Perry coached him for his audition to help him get to know what the Chandler character was like. Jon Cryer had also auditioned for the part. He was doing a play in London and read for a British casting director, though his audition tape did not arrive at Warner Bros. in time for him to be considered.|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceKimberly Waggle KramerInsulated precast {{concrete}} sandwich panels {{are commonly used}} for exterior cladding on a building. In recent years, insulated tilt-up concrete sandwich panels are being used for the exterior load-bearing walls on a building. The insulation is sandwiched between exterior and interior concrete layers to reduce the heating and cooling costs for the structure. The panels can be designed as composite, partially composite, or non-composite. The shear ties are used to achieve these varying degrees of composite action between the concrete layers. A parametric study analyzing the standard, solid single-wythe tilt-up concrete wall panel and solid sandwich (double-wythe separated by rigid insulation) tilt-up concrete wall panels subjected to eccentric axial loads and out-of-plane seismic loads is presented. The sandwich tilt-up panel {{is divided into two}} categories – non-composite and composite wall panels. The height and width of the different types of tilt-up wall panel is 23 feet (21 feet plus 2 -foot parapet) and 16 feet, respectively. The solid standard panel (non-sandwich) is 5. 5 inches in thickness; the non-composite sandwich panel is composed of 3. 5 -inch architectural wythe, 2. 5 -inch rigid insulation, and 5. 5 -inch interior load bearing concrete wythe; and the composite sandwich panel is composed of 3. 5 -inch exterior, load bearing concrete wythe, 2. 5 -inch insulation, and 5. 5 -inch interior, load bearing concrete wythe. The procedure used to design the tilt-up wall panels is the Alternative Method for Out-of-Plane Slender Wall Analysis per Section 11. 8 of ACI 318 - 14 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete and Commentary. The results indicated that for the given panels, the applied ultimate moment and design moment strength is the greatest for the composite sandwich tilt-up concrete panel. The standard tilt-up concrete panel exhibits the greatest service load deflection. The non-composite sandwich tilt-up concrete panel induced the greatest vertical stress. Additionally, the additional requirements regarding forming materials, <b>casting,</b> and <b>crane</b> capacity is covered in this report. Lastly, the energy efficiency due to the heat loss and heat gain of sandwich panels is briefly discussed in this report. The sandwich tilt-up panels exhibit greater energy efficiency than standard tilt-up panels with or without insulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} the concept {{used to construct}} a complex residential Tilt-Up-Panel structure utilizing 3 D-Modeling and animations. The residence is comprised of 108 panels of varying rectangular shapes with "dog legs " and window and door "cutouts" that look like an assembled jigsaw puzzle. The erection and installation procedure calls for a maximum panel-to-panel joint tolerance of 1. 27 -cm (1 / 2 -in), often in ninety-degree joints of one panel to another. Due to the inherent complexities of the program, the owner, the design and construction team decided to utilize 3 D-modeling and animations to experiment with the construction process on the screen before construction {{in order to avoid}} potential costly on-site error. In addition, the 3 D-Animation is also expected {{to be used as a}} training tool to contractors. This paper focuses on describing the methodology used to integrate a crane selection algorithm, a 3 D-modeleing and animation for the selection and utilization of the crane on the construction sites.

50|$|Even though {{years of}} {{experience}} accounts for a good gauge for the appropriate lifting anchor to be used, {{it should not be}} left to the reinforcement fabricators and precast factory personnel to select the lifting anchor. The design engineer should specifically account for the applied loads expected during the lifting, transport and placement (or re-usability requirements) of the element. Flexure, casting bed suction, load direction (axial ‘tensile’, angular ‘sling’, transverse ‘shear’) are also load considerations to be accounted for in the lifting design of the element.The anchor selection, together with additional reinforcement, and rigging arrangements is influenced by:- The dead weight of the element- The number of anchors in the element and the configuration of the anchor- Capacity of the anchor at the specific concrete compressive strengths at time of lift- The dynamic loads applied during lifting (suction to the <b>casting</b> bed, or <b>crane</b> dynamics)- The rigging configurationAll of the above factors must be taken into consideration during the lifting design phase of the element.The weight of the element can be determined by the calculated volume, and using the specific gravity (normal weight reinforced concrete is approximately 24 kN/m3).Establishing the lifting anchor positions will influence the rigging arrangements used and therefore the static analysis of the rigging should be determined. Particular rigging configurations may be more suitable for particular job sites or lifting in place considerations, and the lifting design should denote the assumptions accordingly. For example, the statically determined systems, shown in Figure 3, where the determination of the loads is not always possible.Dynamic loads considered in lifting design are accounted for in two stages; suction to the casting bed on the initial lift and then the dynamic loads induced from crane vibration. These crane impact loads must be accounted for during transportation in the yard and on-site, and the coefficient increases from an overhead gantry crane through to a crane moving over rough terrain. Consideration for the entire transportation loads {{must be taken into account}} during the lifting design.Anchor capacity, or load resistance, should be considered for tensile loads (axial), sling angle (angular) and shear loads (transverse). Consideration of different load combinations may result in wide variations required from the lifting insert. The load directions during production, transport and placement should be considered carefully. Depending on the planned load direction, either a different anchor may be included in the lifting design, alternatively, reinforcement may be included to reduce the possibility of element flexure crack damage. The configuration (size, position and quantity) of this reinforcement should be supplemented to the element reinforcement design to ensure for adequate capacity of the lifting design.Lifting design is influenced by the steel / concrete interaction of the specific anchor selected. Different load cases are considered by the lifting design engineer, such as anchor susceptibility to edge distance, placement sensitivity, and anchor capacity at the specific concrete strength at time of lift. For example, a footed pin head style anchor maybe more susceptible to edge distance than a hairpin style anchor. Or a splayed anchor does not have the same tensile/axial capacity with the equivalent anchor length (effective embedment is greater on a footed anchor than a splayed anchor of equivalent overall length, see figure 4).|$|R
