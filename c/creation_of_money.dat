5000|$|The Global Party {{believed}} that a massive <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> new <b>money</b> by the Bank of Canada would free enterprise, create jobs and wealth, and prevent communism and dictatorship.

5000|$|A gold {{standard}} provides practical constraints against the measures that central banks might otherwise use {{to respond to}} economic crises. <b>Creation</b> <b>of</b> new <b>money</b> reduces interest rates and thereby increases demand for new lower cost debt, raising the demand for money.|$|R
50|$|Another cause <b>of</b> black <b>money,</b> {{the report}} finds {{is the high}} {{transaction}} costs associated with compliance with the law.

5000|$|The Need Act, {{presented}} in the House of Representatives in September 2011 by Dennis Kucinich, is a proposed law that implies that [...] "the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> by private financial institutions as interest-bearing debts should cease once and for all".|$|E
50|$|Thus these {{measures}} may include levy of specific taxation, increase and enlarging {{the scope of}} existing taxation, raising of compulsory and voluntary loans from the public, arranging loans from foreign sovereign states or financial institutions, and also the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> by the government or the central banking authority.|$|E

As long as our population and trade continue to increase there will, in general, {{be a need for}} increasing the volume of money in circulation. The Monetary Authority might satisfy this need by purchasing and retiring Government bonds with new money. This process would operate to reduce the Government debt. This means that the Government would profit by manufacturing the necessary increment of money, much as the banks have profited in times past, though, they do not and cannot profit greatly now because of the costly depression, largely a result of their uncoordinated activities. That is, the governmental <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> would now be profitable where the bankers’ <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> can no longer be profitable, for lack of unified control.|$|E

50|$|In early times, the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> was {{the sole}} {{privilege}} of the kings or other sovereigns - namely the sovereign people, acting through their Government.
