5000|$|Complementary color anaglyphs employ {{one of a}} pair of {{complementary}} color filters for each eye. The most common color filters used are red and cyan. Employing tristimulus theory, the eye is sensitive to three primary colors, red, green, and blue. The red filter admits only red, while the <b>cyan</b> <b>filter</b> blocks red, passing blue and green (the combination of blue and green is perceived as cyan). If a paper viewer containing red and <b>cyan</b> <b>filters</b> is folded so that light passes through both, the image will appear black. Another recently introduced form employs blue and yellow filters. (Yellow is the color perceived when both red and green light passes through the filter.) ...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to the usual red and <b>cyan</b> <b>filter</b> system of anaglyph is ColorCode 3-D, a patented anaglyph system which was invented in order to present an anaglyph image {{in conjunction with the}} NTSC television standard, in which the red channel is often compromised. ColorCode uses the complementary colors of yellow and dark blue on-screen, and the colors of the glasses' lenses are amber and dark blue.|$|R

50|$|In {{advance of}} that, we have {{implemented}} a two-channel field-sequential color system using a two-sided tent-shaped diffusing mirror.

50|$|In an anaglyph, the {{two images}} are {{superimposed}} in an additive light setting through two filters, one red and one cyan. In a subtractive light setting, the two images are {{printed in the}} same complementary colors on white paper.

Low cost paper frames or plastic-framed glasses hold accurate color filters that typically, after 2002, make use of all 3 primary colors. The current norm is red and cyan, with red being used for the left channel. The cheaper filter material used in the monochromatic past dictated red and blue for convenience and cost.

50|$|Simple paper, {{uncorrected}} gel glasses, cannot {{compensate for}} the 250 nanometer difference in the wavelengths of the red-cyan filters. With simple glasses, the red filtered image is somewhat blurry, when viewing a close computer screen or printed image. The (RED) retinal focus differs from the image through the (<b>CYAN)</b> <b>filter,</b> which dominates the eyes' focusing. Better quality, molded acrylic glasses frequently employ a compensating differential diopter power (a spherical correction) to balance the red filter focus shift relative to the cyan, which reduces the innate softness, and diffraction of red filtered light. Low power reading glasses worn along with the paper glasses also sharpen the image noticeably.|$|R

50|$|In digital photography, {{monochrome}} is {{the capture}} of only shades of black by the sensor, or by post-processing a color image to present only the perceived brightness by combining the values of multiple channels (usually red, blue, and green). The weighting of individual channels may be selected to achieve a desired artistic effect; if only the red channel is selected by the weighting then the effect will be {{similar to that of}} using a red filter on panchromatic film. If the red channel is eliminated and the green and blue combined then the effect will be similar to that of orthochromatic film or the use of a <b>cyan</b> <b>filter</b> on panchromatic film. The selection of weighting thus allows a wide range of artistic expression in the final monochromatic image.|$|R
50|$|Orthochromatic {{photography}} {{refers to}} a photographic emulsion that is sensitive to only blue and green light, and thus can be processed with a red safelight.

5000|$|Internally, the VL3 {{marked a}} return to the {{original}} idea of using twisting dichroic filters, to gradually vary the colour of the beam (see US Patent 4602321). This was made practical by the simpler optics employed in a wash luminaire, which do not produce the same beam artifacts that the optics of a spot luminaire would, using this type of colour change mechanism. The subtractive, CMY (Cyan Magenta Yellow) colour mixing system designed for the VL3, featured three sets of three dichroic filters, each set independently rotatable; with the <b>cyan</b> <b>filters</b> at the rear, closest to the lamp and the magenta filters to the front. In their [...] "open" [...] position, the filters sat edge-on to the axis of the light beam, so that only white light emerged. By rotating the filter sets into the path of the beam, a wide variety of colours could be created—from light pastel shades, to deep saturated hues.|$|R
5000|$|Plastic glasses, {{developed}} in recent years, provide both the diopter [...] "fix" [...] noted above, {{and a change}} in the <b>cyan</b> <b>filter.</b> The formula provides intentional [...] "leakage" [...] of a minimal (2%) percentage of red light with the conventional range of the filter. This assigns two-eyed [...] "redness cues" [...] to objects and details, such as lip color and red clothing, that are fused in the brain. Care must be taken, however, to closely overlay the red areas into near-perfect registration, or [...] "ghosting" [...] can occur. Anachrome formula lenses work well with black and white, but can provide excellent results when the glasses are used with conforming, [...] "anachrome friendly" [...] images. The US Geological Survey has thousands of these [...] "conforming", full-color images, which depict the geology and scenic features of the U.S. National Park system. By convention, anachrome images try to avoid excess separation of the cameras, and parallax, thereby reducing the ghosting that the extra color bandwidth introduces to the images.|$|R
5000|$|Viewing anaglyphs through spectrally opposed glasses or gel filters enables {{each eye}} to see {{independent}} {{left and right}} images from within a single anaglyphic image. Red-cyan filters can be employed because our vision processing systems use red and cyan comparisons, as well as blue and yellow, to determine the color and contours of objects. In a red-cyan anaglyph, the eye viewing through the red filter sees red within the anaglyph as [...] "white", and the cyan within the anaglyph as [...] "black". The eye viewing through the <b>cyan</b> <b>filter</b> perceives the opposite. Actual black or white in the anaglyph display, being void of color, are perceived the same by each eye. The brain blends together the red and cyan channelled images as in regular viewing but only green and blue are perceived. Red is not perceived because red equates with white through red gel and is black through cyan gel. However green and blue are perceived through cyan gel.|$|R
50|$|Anaglyph {{images have}} seen a recent {{resurgence}} because of the presentation of images on the Internet. Where traditionally, {{this has been a}} largely black & white format, recent digital camera and processing advances have brought very acceptable color images to the internet and DVD field. With the online availability of low cost paper glasses with improved red-cyan filters, and plastic framed glasses of increasing quality, the field of 3D imaging is growing quickly. Scientific images where depth perception is useful include, for instance, the presentation of complex multi-dimensional data sets and stereographic images of the surface of Mars. With the recent release of 3D DVDs, they are more commonly being used for entertainment. Anaglyph images are much easier to view than either parallel sighting or crossed eye stereograms, although these types do offer more bright and accurate color rendering, most particularly in the red component, which is commonly muted or desaturated with even the best color anaglyphs. A compensating technique, commonly known as Anachrome, uses a slightly more transparent <b>cyan</b> <b>filter</b> in the patented glasses associated with the technique.

5000|$|Simple sheet or {{uncorrected}} molded glasses do not {{compensate for}} the 250 nanometer difference in the wavelengths of the red-cyan filters. With simple glasses the red filter image can be blurry when viewing a close computer screen or printed image since the retinal focus differs from the <b>cyan</b> <b>filtered</b> image, which dominates the eyes' focusing. Better quality molded plastic glasses employ a compensating differential diopter power to equalize the red filter focus shift relative to the cyan. The direct view focus on computer monitors has been recently improved by manufacturers providing secondary paired lenses, fitted and attached inside the red-cyan primary filters of some high-end anaglyph glasses. They are used where very high resolution is required, including science, stereo macros, and animation studio applications. They use carefully balanced cyan (blue-green) acrylic lenses, which pass a minute percentage of red to improve skin tone perception. Simple red/blue glasses work well with black and white, but the blue filter is unsuitable for human skin in color. U.S. Patent No. 6,561,646 was issued to the inventor in 2003.

We selected a wide-band <b>cyan</b> <b>filter</b> that increases the transmission of spectral zones common to the three pseudo-color matching functions of the CCD camera and the spectral transmission of the channel with the lowest sensitivity. This six-channel color measurement instrument shows an improvement in the precision level compared with a conventional three-channel system, obtaining a better Vora factor (greater than 0. 96), color quality factor (greater than 0. 95) and color reproduction index (greater than 96 %).

5000|$|A {{variation}} on the anaglyph technique from the early 2000s is called [...] "Anachrome method". This approach {{is an attempt to}} provide images that look nearly normal, without glasses, for small images, either 2D or 3D. With most of the negative qualities, being masked innately by the small display. Being [...] "compatible" [...] for small size posting in conventional websites or magazines. Usually a larger file can be selected that will fully present the 3D with the dramatic definition. The 3D,(Z axis) depth effect is generally more subtle than simple anaglyph images, which are usually made from wider spaced stereo pairs. Anachrome images are shot with a typically narrower stereo base, (the distance between the camera lenses). Pains are taken to adjust for a better overlay fit of the two images, which are layered one on top of another. Only a few pixels of non-registration give the depth cues. The range of color perceived, is noticeably wider in Anachrome image, when viewed with the intended filters. This is due to the deliberate passage of a small (1 to 2%) of the red information through the <b>cyan</b> <b>filter.</b> Warmer tones can be boosted, because each eye sees some color reference to red.

40|$|Zonation of algal {{communities}} in the intertidal areas of the Hawaiian islands has been correlated with zones of reduced salinity caused by submarine fresh-water springs. Laboratory salinity tolerance experiments showed that the green seaweed Ulva (known as "sea lettuce") tolerated brackish water of half of normal ocean salinity, whereas, Acanthophora sp. did not. A field survey of salinity and algal species zonation at a coastal spring {{on the island of}} Oahu between Diamond Head and Black Point verified the laboratory findings and showed UIva fasciata, Peyssoneila sp., and Gelidium sp. predominating in the brackish areas and Acanthophora sp. and Sargassum sp. in the areas of higher salinity. An algal-salinity survey between Kawaihae and Kona on the island of Hawaii showed that, along most of the coastline, algal communities were non-existent or too sparse for use as a salinity indicator. Spectral measurements and photographic experiments showed that two salinity indicators, Ulva sp. (low salinity) and Sargassum sp. (high salinity) could be mapped by color infrared photography from aircraft.
