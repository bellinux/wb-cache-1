30|$|The use and {{handling}} {{of animals in}} the research project have been approved by Monash University School of Biomedical Sciences Animal Ethics Committee (AEC Approval Number: MARP/ 2012 / 043). All applicable institutional and/or national guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed. Twenty four male, eight-week old Sprague–Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) with an initial weight of around 160 – 200  g were obtained. Throughout the entire experiment, the rats were kept individually in polypropylene cages with paper bedding at 23  ±  1  °C and 12 -hour-light-and-dark exposure (lights on at 0600 and lights out at 1800). Prior to treatment, the rats were acclimatized for 1  week {{to allow them to}} adapt to the laboratory conditions. During that time, they were given standard rat chow and tap water. After the acclimatization, the rats were randomised into three groups: groups A, B and C (n =  8 per group). Group A rats were provided standard rat chow while Groups B and C rats were on/diet (30  % ghee and 30  % sugar). The HF/HS diet was prepared by evenly mixing powdered standard rat chow, <b>coarse</b> <b>granulated</b> cane <b>sugar</b> and ghee in a ratio of 4 : 3 : 3 respectively. The mixture was then baked for 10  min at 160  °C and stored at 4  °C in a fridge until use. The therapeutic intervention, 100  mg/kg GA was subjected exclusively for group C rats via oral administration in drinking water. The treatment duration was 28  days.|$|R
5000|$|Confectioners' {{sugar is}} a refined {{sugar in a}} powder form. It is easily {{dissolved}} in liquid which is ideal for making icing and frosting.
