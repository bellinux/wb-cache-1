50|$|The {{destruction}} of the native vegetation began soon after {{the discovery of the}} island by the Portuguese in 1502, with the introduction of goats. As there were no native herbivorous mammals, the flora was unadapted to such threats. Later with the establishment of permanent settlement on the island by the English East India Company in 1659, many introduced plants became established which <b>created</b> <b>new</b> <b>vegetation</b> types. Furthermore the native trees were subject to catastrophic cutting for such purposes as housebuilding and to fuel stills for the distillation of arrack. As a result of this legacy many endemic plant species are extinct or critically endangered.|$|R
2500|$|Many quoted {{out of date}} {{geological}} writings. Among {{the most}} prominent, Granville Penn argued in 1822 that [...] "mineral geology" [...] rejected revelation, while true [...] "Mosaical geology" [...] showed that God had created primitive rock formations directly, in correspondence with the laws which God then made to produce subsequent effects. A first revolution {{on the third day}} of creation deepened the oceans so water rushed in, and in the Deluge 1,656 years afterwards a second revolution sank land areas and raised the sea bed to cause a swirling flood which moved soil and fossil remains into stratified layers, after which God <b>created</b> <b>new</b> <b>vegetation.</b> As Genesis appeared to show that the rivers of Eden had survived this catastrophe, he argued that the verses concerned were an added [...] "parenthesis" [...] which should be disregarded. In 1837 George Fairholme expressed disappointment about disappearing belief in the deluge, and about Sedgwick and Buckland recanting diluvialism, while putting forward his own New and Conclusive Physical Demonstrations which ignored geological findings to claim that strata had been deposited in a quick continuous process while still moist.|$|R

The living god lay concealed underneath the superficial veneer of death, ready to burst forth like a germinating seed. The deity also had a malevolent side as Xipe Totec was said to cause rashes, pimples, inflammations and eye infections.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT] To develop <b>new</b> <b>{{vegetation}}</b> indices algorithm, some vegetation parameters {{which are}} Vegetation Coverage (VC), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR) {{were obtained by}} ground based observation with spectral reflectance for cypress, willow, konara oak and grasses. VC data was obtained through interpretation of photograph which had taken from cherry picker sited above the vegetation canopy. LAI was directly measured through the number of leaves and their area. APAR data was acquired by using Line quantum sensor. Wide spectral range data was used to relate these vegetation parameters to spectrum. As a result of statistical analysis using these data, significant correlation was found between spectral data and these vegetation parameters. It suggests the possibility of <b>new</b> <b>vegetation</b> indices algorithm...|$|R
50|$|The {{anthropologist}} Mircea Eliade theorizes {{that the}} maypoles were simply {{a part of}} the general rejoicing at the return of summer, and the growth of <b>new</b> <b>vegetation.</b> In this way, they bore similarities with the May Day garlands which were also a common festival practice in Britain and Ireland.|$|R
50|$|The park {{comprises}} two artificial lakes {{that serve}} both as landscape features and stormwater ponds.

50|$|By 2014 {{the park}} {{had grown to}} 250 {{hectares}} with over 40 kilometres of hand-built single track and over 35,000 native seedlings planted. Pests such as goats, sheep, and possums had been dramatically reduced with volunteers maintaining possum traps and bait stations and mustelid traps, allowing <b>new</b> <b>vegetation</b> to flourish.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} national cultural values {{and the development of}} market institutions on three aspects of entrepreneurship (desire, intention, and confidence in <b>creating</b> <b>new</b> ventures). We ask: What different kinds of effects do cultural and institutional factors have on different aspects of entrepreneurship? Our samples come from Vietnam, Taiwan, and the United States (US). The use of three countries allows us to distinguish the separate influences of culture and market institutions on entrepreneurship. Our results suggest that only culture has a significant impact on individuals' desires to <b>create</b> <b>new</b> ventures. However, we found mixed results on whether culture or institution affects individuals' intentions and confidence in <b>creating</b> <b>new</b> ventures. Contrary to our hypotheses, the Vietnam sample had higher scores on intention to <b>create</b> <b>new</b> ventures than both the US and Taiwan samples. The Vietnam sample was also higher than Taiwan on the confidence in <b>creating</b> <b>new</b> ventures. This may suggest an interaction effect of cultural and institutional factors on entrepreneurship. This interaction deserves more attention in future research.
