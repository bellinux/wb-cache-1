For the calcium polyacrylate and the copolymer, parabolic kinetics were observed, indicating the formation of a chromium polyacrylate phase as a coating on the membrane. The rate of absorption is controlled by the diffusion of the chromium ion through this coating. The product formed in the copolymer involves the formation of a coordination complex of a chromium ion with 6 carboxylic acid groups from the same molecule. The absorption of the chromium ion by the polyacrylic acid membranes appears to be more complicated, involving cross-linking.

Aluminum and chromium are the two most commonly used metal hard mask materials for pattern transferring, so their salts were chosen in this study. For instance, selectivity between Cr and Si using non-switching pseudo-Bosch process that gives very smooth and vertical sidewall can reach 1 : 100 [27].

The estimated incremental risks {{for an individual}} developing cancer vary from 3. E- 06 to 1. 0 E- 05. The estimated total exposure chronic noncancer hazard indices vary from 6. E- 02 to 1. E- 01. The critical contaminants were ranked based on their cancer risks and chronic noncarcinogenic hazard quotients. For cancer risks, the critical contaminants released from SRS outfalls are arsenic, tetrachloroethylene, and benzene. For chronic noncarcinogenic risks, the critical contaminants released from srs outfalls are cadmium, arsenic, silver, <b>chromium,</b> mercury, selenium, <b>nitrate,</b> manganese, zinc, nickel, uranium, barium, copper, tetrachloroethylene, cyanide, and phenol. The critical pathways in decreasing risk order are ingestion of contaminated fish, ingestion of drinking water and dermal contact with contaminants in water while swimming...|$|R
