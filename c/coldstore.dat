5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA by the Minister for Home Affairs, the President must be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President's satisfaction. Two months after the decision, a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision. These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989–1990), which held it is sufficient for the President to be subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a threat to national security in order for a detention order to be issued under the ISA. Notable ISA cases include Operation <b>Coldstore</b> in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the socialist opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. Chia Thye Poh, an alleged Communist, was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998. The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA.|$|E

The SATU collapsed in 1963 following the government's detention of its leaders during Operation <b>Coldstore</b> and its subsequent official deregistration on 13 November 1963, leaving the NTUC as the sole trade union centre.

5000|$|This {{development}} in the parish was mostly unchanged until 1950: the Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway which passed through {{the northern part of}} the parish opened 1912; and terraced housing was built on Woad Lane north and south of the station in the early part of the century. Additionally a biscuit factory (Watmough and Sons Ltd) had been established east of Woad Road, and north of the railway line by the 1930s. Watmough became part of Scribbans and Kemp in 1948 (later known as Kemps Biscuits, and later became part of United Biscuits).

5000|$|By the mid-1920s, the Company was {{expanding}} at {{a substantial}} rate. Under {{the provisions of}} the Primary Producers' Co-operative Associations Act 1923, in order to continue to use the word [...] "co-operative", the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd was de-registered under the Companies Act 1863 to 1913, and in February 1925 was re-registered under the 1923 Act as the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd. In the same year the PCD erected its own cold stores at Gladstone, with storage capacity for 150 tons of butter. This obviated the heavy costs of railage to Brisbane, as well as Brisbane cold storage charges, and reduced loss in quality during transit to Brisbane. As a consequence, a higher grade of export butter, and direct overseas shipment of butter from Gladstone, were made possible. The installation of <b>coldstores</b> at the PCD's Gladstone factory had important long-term effects for the Port of Gladstone, where butter formed the staple export from 1926 to 1934, prior to the first chilled beef (distinct from frozen beef) being exported in 1935.|$|R

40|$|The {{freshness}} of agricultural products is kept well when chilled or frozen. Additionally, chilled and frozen food is en vogue due to convenience reasons. The {{growing demand for}} chilled and frozen food {{on a global scale}} has some negative ecological side effects, though. The GEMIT Institute for Business process Management and IT developed the idea to combine an electronic market place for idle cold storage capacities with a tool that helps <b>coldstores</b> increase their energy efficiency. It is ecologically worthwhile in a branch characterized by high CO 2 -emissions and energy consumption. A future marketplace does not only serve as a spot market for short term demand in storage, where it guarantees cheaper storage space in proximity and higher independency from common cold storage services. Additionally, the supplier of empty cold storage space generates new revenues {{and at the same time}} spends the maintenance energy more efficiently. Finally, the participating suppliers can benefit from a benchmarking tool and information about their own energy savings potentials. The current market situation is especially advantageous for an introduction of ECO-Store, with growing cold storage spaces in Germany and an increasing consumption of chilled food worldwide. Aspects that can impose a barrier to the project are considered as well. It was found out that companies might not want to disclose data or cooperate with possible competitors and operating providers of cold storage space fear a decline in prices. Reaching a critical mass of participants in order to assure the cost effectiveness of the investment and to increase the attractiveness itself is a crucial issue. Finally, resembling concepts already exist on the market. Yet, what it makes unique is the combination of the electronic market place and a tool aiming at reducing individual energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the estimated cost of clinical and surgical treatment for basl cell carcinoma of the eyelid. METHODS: This was a pilot study of 12 patients with basal cell carcinoma receiving treatment with 5 % imiquimod cream at the ocular plastic surgery center, medical school University of São Paulo (HC-FMUSP, Brazil). The cost of clinical treatment was estimated based on the time of treatment and amount of medication consumed by patients in the home setting. The cost of surgical treatment was estimated by ophthalmologists with experience in reconstructive plastic surgery based on analysis of images of the same patients. Surgeons responded to a questionnaire with four questions about surgical technique, surgical materials required, estimated duration of surgery and type of anesthesia. RESULTS: Immunotherapy lasted from 8 to 12 weeks. All patients reported each <b>coldstored</b> sachet with 5 % imiquimod cream lasted 3 days. According to the institution, a box with 12 sachets costs BRL 480. 00. Patients required 1. 58 - 3. 11 boxes for complete treatment, corresponding to a total cost of BRL 758. 401, 492. 80. Based on image analysis, surgeons evaluated surgery would require 1 - 3 hours. The estimated cost of surgery room and staff was BRL 263. 00, to which the cost of supplies was added. Thus, the total cost of surgical treatment was BRL 272. 61 - 864. 82. On the average, immunotherapy was 57, 64 % more costly than surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant eyelid tumors are a common finding in clinical ophthalmology. Surgery is still the treatment of choice at our institution, but immunotherapy with 5 % imiquimod cream may be indicated for patients with multiple lesions or high surgical risk and for patients declining surgery for reasons of fear or esthetic concerns. The ability to estimate costs related to the treatment of malignant eyelid tumors is an important aid in the financial planning of health care institutions. Further studies should evaluate the possibility of institutions equating the cost of immunotherapy and surgical treatment by acquiring similar but less expensive medications...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{investigations}} are described of {{the identification of}} aroma compounds which are formed {{as a result of}} oxidative deterioration of butter during cold storage, producing a typical trainy (fishy) off-flavour. As these flavour defects are caused chiefly by autoxidative breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids, it was also studied which fatty acids may act as precursors in the formation of these off-flavours. For this purpose the volatile odorous compounds formed in the autoxidation of pure unsaturated fatty acids were identified and compared with the compounds formed in butter with cold-storage defects. In the introductory chapter (I), a survey is given of results obtained in previous investigations concerning the aroma compounds in butter with coldstorage defects. Aliphatic carbonyl compounds in particular are considered to be responsible for these flavour defects, but these components were isolated only from washed cream and sweet-cream butter, and not from cold-stored butter made from soured cream. In addition, several classes of compounds such as carbonyl compounds with double bonds not in conjunction with the carbonyl group and cis/trans -isomers have been overlooked in previous investigations, because of inadequate analytical techniques. In Chapter II a survey is given of the mechanisms of autoxidation of fatty acids. The mechanisms are discussed of the radical chain reactions leading to the formation of hydroperoxides, and of the dismutation of these compounds to secondary autoxidation products. The latter reactions are of particular interest, as they result in the formation of aroma compounds which may cause flavour defects. In Table 2 a survey is given of the hydroperoxides and the secondary oxidation products that may be expected in the autoxidation of a number of unsaturated fatty acids, and of those which were actually found in previous investigations. Chapter III deals with flavour defects observed in autoxidized food lipids in general and cold-storage defects of butter in particular. First of all, the organoleptic properties and flavour threshold values are given of many secondary autoxidation products (see Table 3) which have very low flavour threshold values and highly repugnant odours. Secondly, autoxidation experiments are described which indicate the contribution of various unsaturated fatty acids to autoxidation off-flavours. Thirdly, the generation of oxidation defects in lipid-containing foods, and the effect of several factors on this type of deterioration, are discussed. Finally, special attention is paid to the development of cold-storage defects in butter. The main factors which influence the keeping quality of cold-stored butter are: the extent to which milk, cream and butter are contaminated with copper, and the pH of the butter serum. It is known that the oxidation processes in butter, which may cause inter alia a trainy flavour, start at the fat/serum interface. Experiments were carried out which provided further evidence that the oxidative deterioration of <b>coldstored</b> butter is due primarily to oxidation of the phospholipids. Further experiments show, however, that 'artificial butter' made from butter fat and milk serum (without fat globule membrane material or phospholipids) may also develop a trainy flavour, provided that a strong pro-oxidant (copper) is present at the lipid/water interface. It must therefore be concluded that it is uncertain whether the off-flavours are formed by oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acids of the phospholipids, or of the butter fat, or even of both. Chapter IV consists of a description of the techniques which were used for the isolation and identification of volatile flavour compounds in oxidized lipids. The special problems concerning the isolation and separation of volatile flavour compounds are outlined. For the isolation of volatile flavour compounds in butter fat, a semi-continuous high-vacuum distillation apparatus was designed. Aroma compounds were isolated from small samples of oxidized lipids by means of a batch-wise high-vacuum distillation technique. The aroma components were first separated by temperature-programmed gas chromatography, using a type of column which minimized the risk of artefact formation. For further separation and identification, the carbonyl compounds from the fractions obtained by gas chromatography were converted into their DNPH-derivatives, because the latter have favourable properties for liquid-chromatographic and spectrometric analyses. A special conversion reaction was used to avoid isomerization and artefact formation. A method of silver nitrate complex chromatography was used for the further separation of mixtures of DNPH's according to type and degree of unsaturation. After these manipulations, the DNPH's were in general separated into the individual compounds. For their further identification ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry were used. Many reference DNPH's have enabled specific characteristics to be determined (absorption wavelengths in ultraviolet and infrared spectrometry, and m/e -values in mass spectrometry). In a few cases odorous compounds other than carbonyl compounds had to be identified. These compounds were separated by gas chromatography (using a second column, if necessary) and subsequently used for spectrometric analysis. Figure 9 is a diagram which visualizes the combination of techniques used for identification of volatile compounds obtained from oxidized lipids. It could be established that even very labile compounds such as 2 cis -enals, 3 cis -enals, etc. were not modified and could be identified correctly by means of this combination of techniques. In Chapter V the results are presented of investigations on the identification of volatile compounds contributing to the trainy flavour of cold-stored butter. For the sake of comparison, the aroma compounds from fresh butter without flavour defects have also been analysed. In Chapter VI the results are given of the identification of aroma compounds which are formed in the autoxidation of a number of unsaturated fatty acids. Many compounds have been identified, which have not been detected previously in butter with oxidation defects or in autoxidized fatty acids. In Chapter VII {{the results of the present}} investigations are discussed and summarized. From the analysis of trainy butter and butter without flavour defects it can be seen that the odorous fraction shows large changes as a result of the oxidative deterioration. Many of the aroma compounds in trainy butter are the same as those found in autoxidized fatty acids. By comparing the composition of the mixture of odorous compounds from trainy butter with that of compounds from autoxidized fatty acids (see Table 25 and Figure 10) it has been possible to determine that the autoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and particularly the autoxidation of linolenic acid (and fatty acids with the same alkyl-terminal structure) chiefly contributes to the development of a trainy flavour. This conclusion was confirmed experimentally; the addition of autoxidized linolenic acid (with a small quantity of arachidonic acid) to butter without flavour defects caused a distinctly trainy flavour. The analyses of aroma compounds which result from the autoxidation of a number of pure unsaturated fatty acids have established that the aroma compounds formed are well in line with those that can be expected from the mechanisms of autoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and the dismutation of the hydroperoxides (see Tables 21 to 24). It was established that the changes in flavour in the first stages of oxidative deterioration of cold-stored butter can be ascribed to the rapid oxidation of the highly unsaturated fatty acids, which play the main part in the development of a fatty-metallic off-flavour. The tallowy flavour in the last stage of oxidative deterioration of cold-stored butter can be ascribed to the continued oxidation of several fatty acids. This thesis, although dealing in particular with cold-storage defects in butter, also presents general information on the development of oxidation flavours in lipid-containing food products...|$|R
