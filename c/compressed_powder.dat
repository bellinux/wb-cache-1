40|$|New {{aspects of}} {{strongly}} nonlinear wave and structural phenomena in granular media are developed numerically, theoretically and experimentally. One-dimensional chains of particles and <b>compressed</b> <b>powder</b> composites {{are the two}} main types of materials considered here. Typical granular assemblies consist of linearly elastic spheres or layers of masses and effective nonlinear springs in one- dimensional columns for dynamic testing. These materials are highly sensitive to initial and boundary conditions, making them useful for acoustic and shock-mitigating applications. One-dimensional assemblies of spherical particles are examples of strongly nonlinear systems with unique properties. For example, if initially uncompressed, these materials have a sound speed equal to zero ("sonic vacuum"), supporting strongly nonlinear compression solitary waves with a finite width. Different types of assembled metamaterials will be presented {{with a discussion of}} the material's response to static compression. The 'acoustic diode effect' will be presented, which may be useful in shock mitigation applications. Systems with controlled dissipation will also be discussed from an experimental and theoretical standpoint emphasizing the critical viscosity that defines the transition from an oscillatory to monotonous shock profile. The dynamic compression of <b>compressed</b> <b>powder</b> composites may lead to self-organizing mesoscale structures in two and three dimensions. A reactive granular material composed of a compressed mixture of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), tungsten (W) and aluminum (Al) fine-grain powders exhibit this behavior. Quasistatic, Hopkinson bar, and drop-weight experiments show that composite materials with a high porosity and fine metallic particles exhibit a higher strength than less porous mixtures with larger particles, given the same mass fraction of constituents. A two-dimensional Eulerian hydrocode is implemented to investigate the mechanical deformation and failure of the <b>compressed</b> <b>powder</b> samples in simulated drop-weight tests. The calculations indicate that the dynamic formation of mesoscale force chains increase the strength of the sample. This is also apparent in three-dimensional finite element calculations of drop- weight test simulations using LS-Dyna despite a higher granular bulk coordination number, and an increased mobility of individual grain...|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that estrogen {{plays a role}} in decreasing the risk of developing colon cancer. Numerous animal studies demonstrate possible mechanisms to explain how estradiol (E 2) prevents this disease. Many of these studies involve removing the ovaries of mice and replacing E 2 at a controlled dose for the length of the study. One method of E 2 delivery involves compacting E 2 and cholesterol into a pellet and implanting it subcutaneously {{on the back of the}} animal. While the release patters of silastic implants have been studied previously, the <b>compressed</b> <b>powder</b> pellets release patterns has not. It is unclear if the results of studies using this hormone delivery method come from a steady release of the E 2 over the entirety of the study or if it is the result of a giant influx of E 2 levels just at the beginning. This ten-week experiment compared the amounts of E 2 released from an E 2 <b>compressed</b> <b>powder</b> pellet, a silastic E 2 implant and a control cholesterol implant. To observe the amount of estradiol released, female mice were first ovariectomized and received either a treatment of: E 2, control, or a silastic implant of E 2. Each week following the surgery, a group of mice were sacrificed from each of the three treatment groups. The blood was tested using an ELISA test to determine the levels of estradiol. The results showed that there was peak of E 2 directly following the implantation of the pellet and a week after implanting the silastic E 2, but the levels then remained constant...|$|E

In p-NPNN, we observe a temperature dependence of the spontaneous field which is very similar to that seen in an aligned single crystal experiment and yield the same Curie temperature (T-c= 670 mK). However, the oscillations in the measured signal are very strongly damped, particularly so just below the transition temperature.

40|$|A {{transient}} combustion {{model of}} nitramine propellants {{is combined with}} an isentropic compression shock formation model to determine the role of nitramine propellant combustion in DDT, excluding effects associated with propellant structural properties or mechanical behavior. The model is derived to represent the closed pipe experiment that is widely used to characterize explosives, except that the combustible material is a monolithic charge rather than <b>compressed</b> <b>powder.</b> Computations reveal that the transient combustion process cannot by itself produce DDT by this model. Compressibility of the solid at high pressure is the key factor limiting pressure buildups created by the combustion. On the other hand, combustion mechanisms which promote pressure buildups are identified and related to propellant formulation variables. Additional combustion instability data for nitramine propellants are presented. Although measured combustion response continues to be low, more data are required to distinguish HMX and active binder component contributions. A design for a closed vessel apparatus for experimental studies of high pressure combustion is discussed...|$|E

The transformation of irreversible compression work to heat during compaction is considered, so is the energy dissipated by the particle-particle friction, and die-wall friction. Die compaction with various shaped punches to produce flat-face (FF), shallow convex (SC) and standard convex (STC) tablets at different compression speeds are then analysed. Evolutions of density and temperature distributions during compaction are examined. The effect of die wall friction on thermo-mechanical behaviours is also explored. It is shown that the punch shape, the compression speed and die-wall friction significantly affect the thermo-mechanical behaviour. The maximum temperature and temperature distribution of the <b>compressed</b> <b>powder</b> changes dramatically when different shaped punches are used. The maximum temperature of the tablet upon ejection can be reduced by decreasing the die-wall friction or the compression speed...|$|E

Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be {{used for the}} input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between the mechanical properties of input materials and the smoothness of material flow from a storage bin, cohesion variability of the <b>compressed</b> <b>powder</b> mixtures, and pelletization process were studied. Three material types were examined: Pyrolysis char from biomass – spruce wood (Picea abies L.), compost and spruce sawdust. Increased input material compressibility and cohesion affected the resulting durability and hardness of the pellets. Additional important material parameters affecting the pelletization process and final pellet quality include flowability and wall friction angle: Pellet durability and hardness increases with decreasing flowability (shift to the cohesive materials mode) and wall angle of the incoming materials. Those parameters {{are taken into account}} when designing conveyors. Application of the Quality by Design (QbD) approach to the prediction of behaviour in the pelletization process is outlined. The feasibility of inferring acceptable pelletization process behaviour from the mechanical-physical properties of the input materials is demonstrated. Web of Science 61232030...|$|E
40|$|Fe- 6. 5 % Si alloys {{have good}} {{magnetic}} properties {{due to their}} high electrical resistivity, very low magneto-stric-tion, and low crystalline anisotropy. Despite their strong potential, these alloys have seldom been used in mag-netic applications because of the very poor ductility of Si-steel above 3. 0 wt % Si [1 - 4]. It is difficult to achieve compressed Fe- 6. 5 % Si powder cores with excellent properties because of the low density due to poor ductility.
