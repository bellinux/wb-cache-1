The new correlations overpredict the restart time when compared to the experimental data especially those with the lower superficial velocities (0.2  m/s) of the cleaning water, but for the 0.6  m/s superficial velocities, the results were quite in agreement with a very slight deviation of 6  %. In qualitative terms, the pressure drop evolution predictions were in good agreement with the experimental data. New and careful experiments under various pipe and fluid properties should be conducted to confirm more on the validity of the restart correlations. On a wider application, the predictive capability of the new correlations should be checked with experimental results obtained from different cleaning liquids (enhanced water) other than cold water. We also want to state that the new correlation can be better applied to a <b>cold</b> water <b>restart</b> and to heavy oil with API gravity greater than 10 o.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Heavy oil {{deposits}} in the West Sak and Ugnu formations are currently considered as potential resources {{to address the}} issue of declining oil production on Alaska's North Slope (ANS). Similarly, an estimated proven and recoverable ANS gas reserve of 38 trillion cubic feet (TCF) can be converted to high premium Gas-to-Liquid products which may be commingled with Alaskan heavy oil products. These commingled blends of GTL and Alaska heavy oil can be transported through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). The primary operational issues that could affect the transportation of these fluids through TAPS are: pump ability of the heavy oil, <b>cold</b> <b>restart</b> following a prolonged shut down, and solid deposition in the pipeline. Since TAPS was originally designed to carry light to medium, low viscosity crude oil, transporting heavy or viscous oil may cause problems with the overall hydraulics. In this study, ANS crude oil was distilled and the heavy fraction cuts (~ 18 ° API gravity) were commingled with ANS crude oil and GTL samples for evaluation. Density and viscosity results showed that addition of GTL significantly reduced heavy oil viscosity to present TAPS conditions. However, solid deposition was observed to be a potential problem...|$|E
40|$|The Alaskan North Slope (ANS) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{hydrocarbon}} reserves in the United States where Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) technology can be successfully implemented. The proven and recoverable reserves of conventional natural gas in the developed and undeveloped fields in the Alaskan North Slope (ANS) are estimated to be 38 trillion standard cubic feet (TCF) and estimates of additional undiscovered gas reserves in the Arctic field range from 64 TCF to 142 TCF. Because the domestic gas market in the continental United States is located thousands of miles from the ANS, transportation of the natural gas from the remote ANS to the market is the key issue in effective utilization of this valuable and abundant resource. The focus of this project is to study the operational challenges involved in transporting the gas in converted liquid (GTL) form through the existing Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). A three-year, comprehensive research program was undertaken by the Petroleum Development Laboratory, University of Alaska Fairbanks, under cooperative agreement No. DE-FC 26 - 98 FT 40016 to study the feasibility of transporting GTL products through TAPS. <b>Cold</b> <b>restart</b> of TAPS following an extended winter shutdown and solids deposition in the pipeline were identified as the main transportation issues in moving GTL products through the pipeline.

50|$|According to Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002), Cooper (2002), Tulloch (2002) and Soper (2004), on IBM PC {{compatible}} platform, a cold boot is a {{boot process}} in which the computer starts from a powerless state. All except Tulloch (2002) also mention that in cold boot, system performs a power-on self-test (POST). In addition to the power switch, Cooper (2002) and Soper (2004) also state that reset button may commence a cold reboot. Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002) contradicts this assertion and states that a reset button may commence either a cold or warm reboot, depending on the system. Microsoft Support article 102228 also confers that although the reset button is designed to perform a cold reboot, it may not disconnect the power to the motherboard - a state that does not correspond to the cold boot definition given above. According to Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002), both the operating system and third-party software can initiate a <b>cold</b> boot; the <b>restart</b> command in Windows 9x initiates a cold reboot, unless Shift key is held.|$|R
40|$|Using {{high-resolution}} 3 -D and 2 -D (axisymmetric) hydrodynamic simulations in spherical geometry, {{we study}} {{the evolution of}} cool cluster cores heated by feedback-driven bipolar active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. Condensation of cold gas, and the consequent enhanced accretion, is required for AGN feedback to balance radiative cooling with reasonable efficiencies, and to match the observed cool core properties. A feedback efficiency (mechanical luminosity ≈ϵṀ_ acc c^ 2; where Ṁ_ acc is the mass accretion rate at 1 kpc) as small as 5 × 10 ^- 5 is sufficient to reduce the cooling/accretion rate by ∼ 10 compared to a pure cooling flow. This value is smaller compared to the ones considered earlier, and {{is consistent with the}} jet efficiency and the fact that {{only a small fraction of}} gas at 1 kpc is accreted on to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). We find hysteresis cycles in all our simulations with cold mode feedback: condensation of cold gas when the ratio of the cooling-time to the free-fall time (t_ cool/t_ ff) is ≲ 10 leads to a sudden enhancement in the accretion rate; a large accretion rate causes strong jets and overheating of the hot ICM such that t_ cool/t_ ff > 10; further condensation of cold gas is suppressed and the accretion rate falls, leading to slow cooling of the core and condensation of <b>cold</b> gas, <b>restarting</b> the cycle. Therefore, there is a spread in core properties, such as the jet power, accretion rate, for the same value of core entropy or t_ cool/t_ ff. A fewer number of cycles are observed for higher efficiencies and for lower mass halos because the core is overheated to a longer cooling time. The 3 -D simulations show the formation of a few-kpc scale, rotationally-supported, massive (∼ 10 ^ 11 M_) cold gas torus.

40|$|Avionics {{networks}} {{rely on a}} set of stringent {{reliability and}} safety requirements. In existing deployments, these networks are based on a wired technology, which supports these requirements. Furthermore, this technology simplifies the security management of the network since certain assumptions can be safely made, including the inability of an attacker to access the network, {{and the fact that it}} is almost impossible for an attacker to introduce a node into the network. The proposal for Avionics Wireless Networks (AWNs), currently under development by multiple aerospace working groups, promises a reduction in the complexity of electrical wiring harness design and fabrication, a reduction in the total weight of wires, increased customization possibilities, and the capacity to monitor otherwise inaccessible moving or rotating aircraft parts such as landing gear and some sections of the aircraft engines. While providing these benefits, the AWN must ensure that it provides levels of safety that are at minimum equivalent to those offered by the wired equivalent. In this paper, we propose a secure and trusted channel protocol that satisfies the stated security and operational requirements for an AWN protocol. There are three main objectives for this protocol. First, the protocol has to provide the assurance that all communicating entities can trust each other, and can trust their internal (secure) software and hardware states. Second, the protocol has to establish a fair key exchange between all communicating entities so as to provide a secure channel. Finally, the third objective is to be efficient for both the initial start-up of the network and when resuming a session after a <b>cold</b> and/or warm <b>restart</b> of a node. The proposed protocol is implemented and performance measurements are presented based on this implementation. In addition, we formally verify our proposed protocol using CasperFDR.

40|$|Oil {{production}} from Alaskan North Slope oil fields has steadily declined. In the near future, ANS crude oil production will decline {{to such a}} level (200, 000 to 400, 000 bbl/day) that maintaining economic operation of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) will require pumping alternative products through the system. Heavy oil deposits in the West Sak and Ugnu formations are a potential resource, although transporting these products involves addressing important sedimentation issues. One possibility {{is the use of}} Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) technology. Estimated recoverable gas reserves of 38 trillion cubic feet (TCF) on the North Slope of Alaska can be converted to liquid with GTL technology and combined with the heavy oils for a product suitable for pipeline transport. Issues that could affect transport of this such products through TAPS include pumpability of GTL and crude oil blends, <b>cold</b> <b>restart</b> of the pipeline following a prolonged winter shutdown, and solids deposition inside the pipeline. This study examined several key fluid properties of GTL, crude oil and four selected blends under TAPS operating conditions. Key measurements included Reid Vapor Pressure, density and viscosity, PVT properties, and solids deposition. Results showed that gel strength is not a significant factor for the ratios of GTL-crude oil blend mixtures (1 : 1; 1 : 2; 1 : 3; 1 : 4) tested under TAPS cold re-start conditions at temperatures above - 20 F, although Bingham fluid flow characteristics exhibited by the blends at low temperatures indicate high pumping power requirements following prolonged shutdown. Solids deposition is a major concern for all studied blends. For the commingled flow profile studied, decreased throughput can result in increased and more rapid solid deposition along the pipe wall, resulting in more frequent pigging of the pipeline or, if left unchecked, pipeline corrosion...|$|E

Transportation of the natural gas from the remote ANS is the key issue in effective utilization of this valuable and abundance resource. The throughput of oil through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) has been on decline and is expected to continue to decline in future. It is projected that by the year 2015, ANS crude oil production will decline to such a level that there will be a critical need for pumping additional liquid from GTL process to provide an adequate volume for economic operation of TAPS. The pumping of GTL products through TAPS will significantly increase its economic life. Transporting GTL products from the North Slope of Alaska down to the Marine terminal at Valdez is no doubt the great challenge facing the Gas to Liquids options of utilizing the abundant natural gas resource of the North Slope. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate and assess the economic feasibility of transporting GTL products through the TAPS. Material testing program for GTL and GTL/Crude oil blends was designed and implemented for measurement of physical properties of GTL products. The measurement and evaluation of the properties of these materials were necessary so as to access the feasibility of transporting such materials through TAPS under cold arctic conditions. Results of the tests indicated a trend of increasing yield strength with increasing wax content. GTL samples exhibited high gel strengths at temperatures as high as 20 F, which makes it difficult for <b>cold</b> <b>restart</b> following winter shutdowns. Simplified analytical models were developed to study the flow of GTL and GTL/crude oil blends through TAPS in both commingled and batch flow models. The economics of GTL transportations by either commingled or batching mode were evaluated. The choice of mode of transportation of GTL products through TAPS would depend on the expected purity of the product and a trade-off between loss in product value due to contamination and cost of keeping the product pure at the discharge terminal...|$|E

A feedback efficiency (mechanical luminosity approximate to epsilon(M) over dot(acc) c(2); where (M) over dot(acc). is the mass accretion rate at 1 kpc) as small as 6 x 10 (- 5) is sufficient to reduce the cooling/accretion rate by similar to 10 compared to a pure cooling flow in clusters (with M- 200 less than or similar to 7 x 10 (14) M-circle dot). This value is much smaller compared to the ones considered earlier, and {{is consistent with the}} jet efficiency and the fact that {{only a small fraction of}} gas at 1 kpc is accreted onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The feedback efficiency in earlier works was so high that the cluster core reached equilibrium in a hot state without much precipitation, unlike what is observed in cool-core clusters. We find hysteresis cycles in all our simulations with cold mode feedback: condensation of cold gas when the ratio of the cooling-time to the free-fall time (t(cool) /t(ff)) is less than or similar to 10 leads to a sudden enhancement in the accretion rate; a large accretion rate causes strong jets and overheating of the hot intracluster medium such that t(cool) /t(ff) > 10; further condensation of cold gas is suppressed and the accretion rate falls, leading to slow cooling of the core and condensation of <b>cold</b> gas, <b>restarting</b> the cycle.

The 3 D simulations show the formation of a few-kpc scale, rotationally supported, massive (similar to 10 (11) M-circle dot) cold gas torus. Since the torus gas is not accreted onto the SMBH, it is largely decoupled from the feedback cycle. The radially dominant cold gas (T vertical bar v(phi vertical bar)) consists of fast cold gas uplifted by AGN jets and freely infalling cold gas condensing out of the core. The radially dominant cold gas extends out to 25 kpc for the fiducial run (halo mass 7 x 10 (14) M-circle dot and feedback efficiency 6 x 10 (- 5)), with the average mass inflow rate dominating the outflow rate by a factor of approximate to 2.
