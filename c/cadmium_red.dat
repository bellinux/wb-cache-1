5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. Cadmium {{selenide}} is a red pigment, commonly called <b>cadmium</b> <b>red.</b> To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E

2500|$|Weiss uses a wood palette {{and a small}} {{range of}} colors; {{typically}} titanium white, yellow ochre, ultramarine blue and <b>cadmium</b> <b>red</b> light, sometimes {{with the addition of}} a deeper red, cadmium yellow light, cerulean and green. [...] He occasionally paints with a knife, but mostly with flat brushes to achieve [...] "a kind of blocky modeling". He uses Claessens oil-primed linen for portraits and panels for landscape work. After forming quick outlines, he works rapidly to block in the light and dark areas of the figure and major compositional elements with turpentine-thinned paint. Following this first stage which takes around half-an-hour, he reworks the areas a dozen times or more, constantly refining and unifying.|$|E
25|$|Vermilion, a toxic mercury {{compound}} favored for its deep red-orange color by old master painters such as Titian, {{has been replaced}} in painters' palettes by various modern pigments, including <b>cadmium</b> <b>reds.</b> Although genuine Vermilion paint can still be purchased for fine arts and art conservation applications, few manufacturers make it, because of legal liability issues. Few artists buy it, {{because it has been}} superseded by modern pigments that are both less expensive and less toxic, as well as less reactive with other pigments. As a result, genuine Vermilion is almost unavailable. Modern vermilion colors are properly designated as Vermilion Hue to distinguish them from genuine Vermilion.|$|R
30|$|Esters, ketones and ether esters are {{suitable}} solvents for clear and pigmented PU coating systems. Traditional extenders, such as barytes, calcium carbonate, talc, kaolin, mica, and silica {{may be used}} in one- and two-component systems. Among the conventional inorganic pigments, titanium dioxide, titanium yellow, various iron oxides, <b>cadmium</b> <b>reds</b> and yellows, some carbon blacks and chrome oxide green {{are suitable}} for most of the 2 K PU systems. Organic pigments frequently found in the PU paint formulations, include quinocridone and perylene reds, monoazo and isoindoline yellows, and phthalocyanine blues and greens. The use of organic pigments from other classes may involve undesirable effects on the curing process of PU paint films [10]. Commercial PU coatings contain various additives, such as catalysts, flattening, leveling, thickening and anti-foaming agents. The presence of catalysts offers advantageous rates of polyurethanes reaction at lower temperatures. Those used in PU industry essentially consist on tertiary amines and tin complexes compounds [9].|$|R

50|$|Many {{pigments}} {{still in}} use are toxic to some degree. Commonly used reds and yellows are produced using <b>cadmium,</b> and vermilion <b>red</b> uses natural or synthetic mercuric sulfide or cinnabar. Flake white and Cremnitz white are made with basic lead carbonate. Some intense blue colors, including cobalt blue and cerulean blue, are made with cobalt compounds. Some varieties of cobalt violet are made with cobalt arsenate.|$|R
50|$|Among Babinet's accomplishments are the 1827 {{standardization}} of the Ångström unit for measuring light using the <b>red</b> <b>Cadmium</b> line's wavelength, and the principle (Babinet's principle) that similar diffraction patterns {{are produced by}} two complementary screens. He {{was the first to}} suggest using wavelengths of light to standardise measurements. His idea was first used between 1960 and 1983, when a meter was defined as a wavelength of light from krypton gas.|$|R

This definition has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|R

It was during this time that Jean Rigaud received his first formal training under his father, Pierre Gaston, who was also a well-respected teacher.

5000|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} and inconvenience in producing sodium and hydrogen lines, alternate definitions of the Abbe number are often substituted (ISO 7944).

500|$|In 1960, the International Conference on Weights and Measures {{defined the}} meter as 1,650,763.73 {{wavelengths}} of light emitted by the krypton-86 isotope. This agreement replaced the 1889 international prototype meter located in Paris, {{which was a}} metal bar made of a platinum-iridium alloy (one {{of a series of}} standard meter bars, originally constructed to be one ten-millionth of a quadrant of the Earth's polar circumference). This also obsoleted the 1927 definition of the ångström based on the <b>red</b> <b>cadmium</b> spectral line, replacing it with 1Å = 1010m. [...] The krypton-86 definition lasted until the October 1983 conference, which redefined the meter as the distance that light travels in a vacuum during 1/299,792,458s.|$|R
50|$|Interferometry {{has been}} used in {{defining}} and calibrating length standards. When the metre was defined as the distance between two marks on a platinum-iridium bar, Michelson and Benoît used interferometry to measure the wavelength of the <b>red</b> <b>cadmium</b> line in the new standard, and also showed that it {{could be used as a}} length standard. Sixty years later, in 1960, the metre in the new SI system was defined to be equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum. This definition was replaced in 1983 by defining the metre as the distance travelled by light in vacuum during a specific time interval. Interferometry is still fundamental in establishing the calibration chain in length measurement.|$|R
40|$|The EC-directive 91 / 338 /EWG puts {{a ban on}} cadmium {{for special}} {{applications}}. In the FRG, for all applications included in that directive cadmium is already substituted today. The substitution of cadmium stabilizers will be completed in the near future. The use of cadmium for corrosion protection has been also greatly diminished. Only the substitution of <b>cadmium</b> pigments in <b>red</b> and yellow "high engineering plastics" and keramic glazes cannot be realized presently. The substitution of cadmium for the colouring of plastics lags behind the technical feasibilities. The nickel/hydrogen accumulator, which is available now, and the lithium accumulator will probably cut back the growing consumpton rate of cadmium for sealed nickel/cadmium cells. There are sufficiently large capacities for the recycling of nickel/cadmium accumulators available {{but the number of}} accumulators returned is still low. Although the EC-directive 91 / 157 allows a deposit on batteries containing environmetally hazardous su bstances, its introduction is not currently planned. Cadmium polluted zinc, lead and copper and especially phosphate fertilizers are responsible for a considerable amount of cadmium input into the environment. A threshold limit for cadmium in phosphate ferilizers for the entire EC is not to be expected in the near future...|$|R

Uptake was strongly dependent on Cd 2 + concentration and was limited to adsorption and cation exchange in pollen walls during a 3 -hour measurement period. Good correlation between measured Cd 2 + uptake and that predicted by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations indicated the adsorptive nature of Cd 2 + uptake. While substantial quantities of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + were released by exchange mechanisms concurrent with Cd 2 + uptake, there was no evidence for leakage of cations due to membrane impairment as indicated by a poor correlation between Cd 2 + uptake and K+ efflux. Virtually all Cd 2 + removed from solution was freely exchangeable with 0. 5 millimolar CaCl 2 and demonstrated that Cd 2 + did not readily enter pine pollen but was adsorbed on the pollen wall. Ultraviolet transmission spectra of treatment solutions and analyses of phosphate and reducing sugar efflux also indicated that the potent toxicity of Cd 2 + to pollen germination and germ tube elongation was not the result of membrane damage...|$|R
40|$|Four {{isolates}} of Rhodococcus equi, from pneumonic foals, and {{containing the}} 85 kb virulence plasmid, a porcine isolate containing an 80 kb plasmid, and their plasmid cured derivatives, were examined for 239 phenotypic properties {{in an attempt}} to find characters other than the virulence-associated protein (VapA) which might be encoded by the virulence plasmid in organisms grown at 37 degrees C. Tests chosen included those which have previously given variable results for R. equi isolates, since such variability might be attributed to plasmid curing, and characteristics which have been described as properties of plasmids of Rhodococcus species other than R. equi. Tests included <b>cadmium</b> resistance, Congo <b>red</b> binding, resistance to 26 antibiotics, conventional clinical microbiological tests, utilization of 95 different carbon sources, enzymatic activities in API ZYM, fluorogenic assays for exo- and endopeptidase, glycosidase activities, and testosterone degradation. Apart from production of VapA by foal isolates, no phenotypic property was identified in the plasmid-positive isolates. Phenotypic characteristics of R. equi that have not been described before, and might be useful in identification were: metabolism of N-acetyl-beta D-glucopyranoside, alpha- and beta-hydroxybutyric, alpha-ketobutyric and N-acetyl-glutamic acids, of methylpyruvate, heptanoate, nonanoate and stearate esters; exopeptidase activity against alanine-alanine-tyrosine, alanine-phenylalanine-lysine, glycine-arginine, lysine-alanine, and valine-glycine-alanine; endopeptidase activity against arginine and methionine; and hydrolysis of bis-phosphate ester...|$|R
