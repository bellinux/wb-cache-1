40|$|Summary: The {{spread of}} {{invasive}} species after their initial introduction is often facilitated by human actions. In some cases, invaders only become established in habitats where dominant native {{species have been}} displaced {{as a result of}} human actions or where humans inadvertently provide essential resources such as food, water or shelter. We investigated if dams that provide water for livestock have facilitated the cane toad 2 ̆ 7 s (Rhinella marina) invasion of a hot semi-arid landscape by providing toads with a resource subsidy and hence refuge from extreme heat and aridity. To determine the relationship between the presence of surface water and habitat occupancy by toads, we surveyed natural and artificial water features for cane toads during the annual dry season. We used radiotracking and acoustic tags to determine whether movement patterns and shelter use of cane toads were focussed around dams. To determine whether dams provide toads with refuge from extreme heat and aridity, we deployed plaster models with internal thermometers to estimate ambient temperatures and toad desiccation rates in shelter sites. To determine whether dams alleviate the stress experienced by toads, we measured plasma corticosterone levels of toads that sheltered in and away from dams. Toads were present in sites with standing water and absent from waterless sites. Most radiotracked toads sheltered within 1 m of <b>water.</b> <b>Toad</b> movements were focussed around <b>water.</b> <b>Toads</b> tracked with passive acoustic telemetry over a 6 -month dry season were highly resident at dams.

40|$|The rate of {{cutaneous}} {{water uptake}} after dehydration was significantly depressed in functionally neurohypophysectomized toads (Bufo marinas), which consequently regained weight {{much more slowly}} than intact toads when returned to <b>water.</b> <b>Toads</b> bearing hypothalamic lesions were able to develop an antidiuresis when removed from water to a saturated atmosphere, but the antidiuresis was solely glomerular in origin and was established more slowly than in intact animals. The fractional reabsorption of filtrate increased significantly and the relative free water clearance decreased significantly in intact toads after removal from water. These changes in tubular function, which were not seen in lesioned toads, {{were responsible for the}} development of a more rapid and effective antidiuresis in intact animals. Injections of iso-osmotic saline, oxytocin (250 mu. / 100 g) and vasopressin (50 mu. / 100 g) had no significant effect on rates of cutaneous water uptake in both intact and lesioned toads. Injections of hyperosmotic saline, however, significantly increased rates of water uptake in both groups of toads, but to a much greater extent in the intact animals. Fluid retention arising from a marked antidiuresis occurred after the injection of vasopressin and hyperosmo-tic saline, and there was some evidence of an antidiuretic effect of oxytocin with the doses used here. These results and their bearing on the question of the functional significance of the neurohypophysis in anuran amphibians are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Little is {{currently}} {{known about the}} biology of the African giant toad. Breeding probably {{takes place in the}} dry season, January to March. Clutches of eggs are laid in streams in areas of relatively calm water, the female probably depositing long strings of eggs wrapped around underwater vegetation. Juveniles have been seen in January in Nigeria, in March in Cameroon, and young toads less than 40 mm long have been observed in February and the months between May and October {{in other parts of the}} range.

40|$|Biological invasions {{often occur}} through {{expansion}} of satellite populations that become established at 2 ̆ 7 invasion hubs 2 ̆ 7. Invasion hubs {{can result from}} random dispersal events, but frequently arise when invading individuals actively choose habitats using cues that signify high-quality environments where the fitness consequences are positive. Theoretical studies suggest that targeted control at invasion hubs can effectively suppress the populations and impacts of invaders. In arid Australia, small dams that provide water for livestock function as invasion hubs by providing an invasive vertebrate, the cane toad Rhinella marina, with refuge from extreme aridity during the annual dry season. Toads are attracted to dams and use them as stepping stone habitats from which they disperse during rainy periods. Here, we ask whether sustained control of this invasive vertebrate {{can be achieved by}} converting invasion hubs into ecological traps. We did this by manipulating invasion hub habitats to induce a mismatch between toads 2 ̆ 7 habitat preference and the fitness consequences of their habitat choice to cause high mortality. We constructed fences to exclude toads from dams and maintained these fences for 1 year. This period encompassed periods of dry and wet seasonal climatic conditions. Our manipulation did not alter the attractive cues for invading toads which died en masse while attempting to settle at fenced dams that prevented <b>toads</b> from reaching <b>water.</b> <b>Toad</b> populations at the fenced dams were suppressed by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude compared to unfenced controls and procedural controls. Toad populations remained suppressed for a year after exclusion. By excluding toads from dams, we converted invasion hubs into ecological traps and effectively thwarted the reinvasion of cane toads. Our research suggests that water exclusion devices could be used to prevent toad invasion or to control cane toad populations in arid landscapes colonized by toads. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that sustained control of invader populations can be achieved by restricting their access to invasion hubs. Control of invasive species via elimination of invasion hubs could be conducted reactively, to control established populations of invaders, or conducted strategically, by rendering invasion hubs unsuitable for colonization ahead of the invasion front to prevent further population spread...|$|R

40|$|Several polycations {{added to}} the luminal {{solution}} were found to inhibit the vasopressin (ADH) -induced <b>water</b> flow in <b>toad</b> urinary bladder but not the ADH-induced increase in sodium transport or in urea permeability. Ultrastructural studies were conducted to evaluate the uptake of cationized ferritin. It was found that endocytosis of cationized ferritin by luminal cells was strikingly enhanced on exposure to ADH; this increased endocytosis was concomitant with inhibition of transepithelial ADH-induced water flow. Various maneuvers preventing endocytosis were also found to counteract the polycation-induced inhibition of the ADH effect. It is suggested that polycations are endocytosed in vesicles whose walls contain the water channels but not the urea or sodium channels. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|The toad's primary {{habitat is}} watercourses, {{irrigation}} ditches, and marshes (grass, sedge, dwarf bulrush, and watercress) formed by waterflow from springs, surrounded by cold desert steppe. Adults are more aquatic than other toad species in California, and breed in shallow marsh and pond <b>waters.</b> The <b>toads</b> retreat to rodent burrows or other refuges in winter. At present, there {{do not appear}} to be any major threats to this species. However, potential future threats might include habitat destruction from changes in irrigation schemes or other factors resulting in water table alteration, well-intentioned but non-scientifically based conservation efforts, changes in water availability, recreational vehicle use, collection by humans, changes in grazing regimes and predation by introduced fish. Other desert toads in nearby areas have done well, and even thrived, with more active management. Black toad adults prefer habitats with short plant cover and unobstructed access to still or slowly flowing water. In recent years, fencing some springs to exclude cattle has resulted in an overgrowth of vegetation requiring hand cutting to keep the habitat accessible for toads. The toads have been able to maintain a fairly stable population regardless of changes in agriculture and grazing practices over the past 20 years.|$|R
5000|$|Breeding occurs after {{heavy rains}} when male frogs congregate at {{temporary}} pools, ditches, cattle tanks and other wet places and call continuously, especially at night. The call {{is described as}} being a [...] "series of explosive trills", each lasting for about {{one and a half}} seconds with intervals of one second. The females seem to be attracted to the largest males with the loudest calls. The eggs are laid in the water, often entangled in submerged vegetation. They hatch in two days and the tadpoles feed on algae growing on underwater plants. They may retreat to deeper water when disturbed. They spend between eighteen and sixty days as tadpoles depending on circumstances such as water temperature, after which time they undergo metamorphosis and leave the <b>water</b> as juvenile <b>toads.</b>|$|R
5|$|The common {{ancestor}} of all present gnathostomes (jawed-vertebrates) lived in freshwater, and later migrated {{back to the}} sea. To deal with the much higher salinity in sea water, they evolved the ability to turn the nitrogen waste product ammonia into harmless urea, storing it in the body to give the blood the same osmolarity as the sea water without poisoning the organism. This is the system currently found in cartilaginous fishes. Ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) later returned to freshwater and lost this ability, while the fleshy-finned fishes (Sarcopterygii) retained it. Since the blood of ray-finned fishes contains more salt than freshwater, they could simply get rid of ammonia through their gills. When they finally returned to the sea again, they did not recover their old trick of turning ammonia to urea, {{and they had to}} evolve salt excreting glands instead. Lungfishes do the same when they are living in water, making ammonia and no urea, but when the water dries up and they are forced to burrow down in the mud, they switch to urea production. Like cartilaginous fishes, the coelacanth can store urea in its blood, as can the only known amphibians that can live {{for long periods of time}} in salt <b>water</b> (the <b>toad</b> Bufo marinus and the frog Rana cancrivora). These are traits they have inherited from their ancestors.|$|R
40|$|Phosphorylation of a {{specific}} protein was decreased in intact toad bladders by exposure to either antidiuretic hormone or monobutyryl cyclic AMP. The decrease in phosphorylation caused by these agents preceded the change in electrical potential difference (an indicator of the rate of sodium ion transport) observed {{in response to the}} same compounds. The addition of cyclic AMP to homogenates of toad bladder led to a decrease in phosphorylation of the same, or a similar, protein. In subcellular fractionation studies, the effect of cyclic AMP on the phosphorylation of this protein was observed in those fractions rich in membrane fragments, but not in the nuclear or cell-sap fractions. These and other results are compatible with the possibility that the regulation by vasopressin and cyclic AMP of sodium and/or <b>water</b> transport in <b>toad</b> bladder may be mediated through regulation of the phosphorylation of this specific protein...|$|R
50|$|Precipitous {{declines in}} {{populations of the}} {{northern}} quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) have been observed after toads have invaded an area. There {{are a number of}} reports of declines in goanna and snake populations after the arrival of toads. For example, local populations of Varanus panoptes dropped by up to 90% when their habitat was invaded by cane toads. The preliminary risk assessment of cane toads in Kakadu National Park stated that the predation of the cane toad by native wildlife is the greatest risk to biodiversity. Other factors, such as competition with native wildlife for resources, and the predation of the cane toad on native wildlife, were considered much lower risk factors but requiring further study. In the Northern Territory, goanna predation on cane toads has been linked to a rise in the amount of undamaged salt <b>water</b> crocodile eggs.Cane <b>toads</b> were present within a few days of the crocodiles hatching in April 2007.|$|R
40|$|Some {{invasive}} species flourish {{in places that}} impose challenges very different from those faced in their native geographic ranges. Cane toads (Rhinella marina) are native to tropical and subtropical habitats of South and Central America, but have colonised extremely arid regions {{over the course of}} their Australian invasion. We radio-tracked 44 adult cane toads at a semi-arid invasion front to investigate how this invasive anuran has managed to expand its geographic range into arid areas that lie outside of its native climatic niche. As predicted from their low physiological control over rates of evaporative <b>water</b> loss, <b>toads</b> selected diurnal shelter sites that were consistently cooler and damper (and thus, conferred lower water loss rates) than nearby random sites. Desiccation risk also had a profound influence on rates of daily movement. Under wet conditions, toads that were far from water moved further between shelter sites than did conspecifics that remained close to water, presumably in an attempt to reach permanent water sources. However, this relationship was reversed under dry conditions, such that only toads that were close to permanent water bodies made substantial daily movements. Toads that were far from water bodies also travelled along straighter paths than did conspecifics that generally remained close to water. Thus, behavioural flexibility [...] in particular, an ability to exploit spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the availability of moist conditions [...] has allowed this invasive anuran to successfully colonize arid habitats in Australia. This finding illustrates that risk assessment protocols need to recognise that under some circumstances an introduced species may be able to thrive in conditions far removed from any that it experiences in its native range...|$|R
