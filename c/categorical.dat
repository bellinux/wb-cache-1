5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the <b>Categorical</b> Imperative because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any outside influence. Kant believed that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest would deny the <b>Categorical</b> Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the <b>categorical</b> imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between <b>categorical</b> and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A <b>categorical</b> imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the <b>categorical</b> imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center issues {{convective}} outlooks (AC), {{consisting of}} <b>categorical</b> and probabilistic forecasts describing the general threat of severe convective storms over the contiguous United States {{for the next}} six to 192 hours (Day 1 through Day 8). These outlooks are labeled and issued by day, and are issued up to five times per day.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, the SPC {{introduced}} a new graphical format for its <b>categorical</b> and probability outlooks, which included the shading of risk areas (with the colors corresponding to each category, as mentioned above, being changed as well) and population, county/parish/borough and interstate overlays. The new shaded maps also incorporated a revised color palette for the shaded probability categories in each outlook.|$|E
5|$|Applying the <b>categorical</b> imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in {{conception}} or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|Day 2 outlooks, issued {{twice daily}} at 0600Z and 1730Z, refer to {{predicted}} risks of convective weather {{for the following}} day (1200Z to 1200Z of the next calendar day; for example, a Day 2 outlook issued on April 12, 2100 would be valid from 1200Z on April 13, 2100 through 1200Z on April 14, 2100) and include only a <b>categorical</b> outline, textual description, and a probability graph for severe convective storms generally. Day 2 moderate risks are fairly uncommon, and a Day 2 high risk has only been issued twice (for April 7, 2006 and for April 14, 2012).|$|E
5|$|Fleiss' kappa (named after Joseph L. Fleiss) is a {{statistical}} measure {{for assessing the}} reliability of agreement between a fixed number of raters when assigning <b>categorical</b> ratings {{to a number of}} items or classifying items. This contrasts with other kappas such as Cohen's kappa, which only work when assessing the agreement between not more than two raters or the interrater reliability for one appraiser versus themself. The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. There is no generally agreed-upon measure of significance, although guidelines have been given.|$|E
25|$|Early {{forms of}} analogical reasoning, {{inductive}} reasoning and <b>categorical</b> syllogism {{were introduced in}} Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Sharia (Islamic law) and Kalam (Islamic theology) from the 7th century {{with the process of}} Qiyas, before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later during the Islamic Golden Age, there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or <b>categorical</b> syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that Qiyas refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that Qiyas does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to <b>categorical</b> syllogism in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and <b>categorical</b> syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term Qiyas refers to both analogical reasoning and <b>categorical</b> syllogism in a real sense.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, {{it turns}} out that {{numerous}} important constructions can be described in a purely <b>categorical</b> way. The central concept which is needed for this purpose is called <b>categorical</b> limit, and can be dualized to yield the notion of a colimit.|$|E
25|$|A {{theory is}} called <b>categorical</b> {{if it has}} only one model, up to isomorphism. This term was {{introduced}} by , and for some time thereafter mathematicians hoped they could put mathematics on a solid foundation by describing a <b>categorical</b> first-order theory of some version of set theory. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem dealt a first blow to this hope, as it implies that a first-order theory which has an infinite model cannot be <b>categorical.</b> Later, in 1931, the hope was shattered completely by Gödel's incompleteness theorem.|$|E
25|$|Morley's categoricity theorem, proved by Michael D. Morley (1965), {{states that}} if a first-order theory in a {{countable}} language is <b>categorical</b> in some uncountable cardinality, i.e. all models of this cardinality are isomorphic, then it is <b>categorical</b> in all uncountable cardinalities.|$|E
25|$|In section one, Kant argues from {{common sense}} {{morality}} {{to the supreme}} principle of morality, which he calls the <b>categorical</b> imperative. Kant thinks that uncontroversial premises from our shared common sense morality, and analysis of common sense concepts such as ‘the good’, ‘duty’, and ‘moral worth’, will yield the supreme principle of morality, namely, the <b>categorical</b> imperative. Kant’s discussion in section one can be roughly divided into four parts: (1) The good will (2) The teleological argument. (3) The three propositions regarding duty and (4) The <b>categorical</b> imperative.|$|E

25|$|When {{equipped}} with all transitive edges, these graphs in turn are just special categories, where elements are objects and {{each set of}} morphisms between two elements is at most singleton. Functions between orders become functors between categories. Interestingly, many ideas of order theory are just concepts of category theory in small. For example, an infimum is just a <b>categorical</b> product. More generally, one can capture infima and suprema under the abstract notion of a <b>categorical</b> limit (or colimit, respectively). Another place where <b>categorical</b> ideas occur {{is the concept of}} a (monotone) Galois connection, which is just the same as a pair of adjoint functors.|$|E
25|$|Speakers' judgements of the well-formedness of {{sentences}} form a continuous spectrum. While many grammaticality judgements are <b>categorical,</b> with a given sentence judged as either 'grammatical' or 'ungrammatical', {{there are many}} sentences that fall in a grey area of partial acceptability. According to Jon Sprouse (2007), the difference between grammaticality and acceptability is that grammatical knowledge is <b>categorical,</b> but acceptability is a gradient scale.|$|E
25|$|Any {{theory with}} a {{countable}} {{language that is}} <b>categorical</b> for some uncountable cardinal is totally transcendental.|$|E
25|$|Because {{variables}} conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements {{cannot be}} reasonably measured numerically, {{sometimes they are}} grouped together as <b>categorical</b> variables, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables, which can be either discrete or continuous, due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science, in that dichotomous <b>categorical</b> variables may be represented with the Boolean data type, polytomous <b>categorical</b> variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type, and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating point computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.|$|E

25|$|Despite caveats in the {{introduction}} to the DSM, it has long been argued that its system of classification makes unjustified <b>categorical</b> distinctions between disorders and uses arbitrary cut-offs between normal and abnormal. A 2009 psychiatric review noted that attempts to demonstrate natural boundaries between related DSM syndromes, or between a common DSM syndrome and normality, have failed. Some argue that rather than a <b>categorical</b> approach, a fully dimensional, spectrum or complaint-oriented approach would better reflect the evidence.|$|E

25|$|O'Connor did, however, {{state that}} the Court accepts certain forms of <b>categorical</b> presumptions of confidentiality. But these <b>categorical</b> presumptions {{are a lot more}} {{narrowly}} defined than what the FBI had previously used. Justice O'Connor gave the scenario of a paid informant as an example of an accepted <b>categorical</b> presumption of confidentiality. She stated that a paid informant can expect that his/her cooperation with the FBI will be kept secret, and that this makes documents related to a paid informant subject to being withheld or redacted in accordance with Exemption 7(D). She also stated that, in murder cases like this one, informants may also expect to have their interactions with the FBI be confidential. Justice O'Connor said that the Court would accept the FBI's presumption of the confidentiality of any documents related to an informant for a murder case.|$|E
25|$|By equivocating certain columns with {{parameters}} to be estimated, Plackett–Burmans {{can also}} be used to construct mixed <b>categorical</b> and numerical designs, with interactions or high order effects, requiring no more than 4 runs more than the number of model parameters to be estimated. Sort by a-1 columns assigned to <b>categorical</b> variable A and following columns, where A=1+int(a'i /(max(i)+0.00001)), i = row number and a = A's number of values. Next sort on columns assigned to any other <b>categorical</b> variables and following columns, repeating as needed. Such designs, if large, may otherwise be incomputable by standard search techniques like D-optimality. For example, 13 variables averaging 3 values each could have well over a million combinations to search. To estimate the 105 parameters in a quadratic model of 13 variables, one must formally exclude from consideration or compute |X'X| for well over 106C102, i.e. 313C105, or roughly 10484 matrices.|$|E
