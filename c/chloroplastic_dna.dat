These polymorphisms serve to distinguish most of the cytoplasmic haplotypes previously recognized.

Although the cave was visited during the Archaic, Southern Paiute, and Euro-American periods, material culture remains and radiocarbon dates indicate the heaviest {{use by the}} Virgin Anasazi (A. D. 1 - 1000). Quids are wads of fiber twisted or knotted into a ball for insertion into the mouth. Ten of the quids examined were clearly made from the fibers of Yucca plants, based on 6 - 7 base pairs identified via analysis of DNA sequences near the trnL gene of <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA.</b> Twenty-seven of thirty quids examined were wrapped around a range of wild tobacco (Nicotiana) plant parts (e. g., capsule, seed, calyx, pedicel, main stem, leaf). Quids have been interpreted as serving various needs (food, ceremonial/ritual, other). The inclusion of tobacco and the diverse recovery contexts suggest the Antelope Cave quids provided occupants with a personal stimulant experience...|$|E

Six chloroplastic fragments were sequenced: trnL-F, matk, two non-overlapping fragments of nadhf, rbcl, and rps 16, and two nuclear fragments: partial ribosomal DNA and a Dead/deah box RNA helicase. We studied 121 populations of Narcissus, representing 55 taxa, collected in Portugal, Spain, Morocco and Andorra. The sequences {{were analyzed using}} maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and bayesian inference. The results were compared with previous taxonomical proposals. This analysis indicated {{that many of the}} species proposed in the literature are not valid and that the subgenus Narcissus suffered an intense taxonomic inflation as result of the overemphasis of small morphological differences. In other cases, the results validated some taxa as true species. Our data also indicate the hybrid origin of some taxa and, in some cases, permitted the identification of the putative ancestral species. The analysis of <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences through a haplotype network indicated that most of the lineages were differentiated in Southern Iberia and thereafter migrated north or east. We also {{analyzed the}} floral morphology of the sections Juncifolii and Jonquillae, and discussed the identification problem...|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} the evolutionary history of the poorly studied genus Sebaea {{and its relationship to}} other genera of tribe Exaceae (Gentianaceae), intensive morphological and karyological character optimization based on robust molecular phylogeny was performed. Phylogenetic reconstructions support the monophyly of Exaceae, and further reveal a polyphyletic Sebaea, including four well-supported clades, hereafter treated as separate genera, based on non-molecular synapomorphies. The first clade contains the single species Lagenias pusillus, characterized by its medifix anthers, inserted {{at the base of the}} corolla tube and its seed testa cells (polygonal). The second clade, Sebaea s. str., contains most of the South African species having secondary stigmas and bilateral seeds, with rectangular testa cell. The third clade, Exochaenium, contains exclusively tropical African species, characterized by a stylar polymorphism and a papillose clavate stigma (versus smooth and bilobed). Finally the fourth clade, Klackenbergia, contains two species characterized by inflorescences with axillary subsessile flowers. Based on these results, the taxonomic reinstatement of Exochaenium (23 species) and Lagenias (1 species), along with the establishment of a new genus Klackenbergia (2 species), are proposed. In the light of the new phylogenetic relationships found within the Exaceae, new views on the evolution of (1) karyological and (2) morphological characters are proposed. Finally, the historical biogeography of the tribe is reevaluated (3). 1. Intensive chromosome counts based on material collected and fixed in the field (157 population and c. 60 species), and exhaustive literature survey, reveal a broad set of chromosome numbers (2 n = 18, 28, 32, 34, 36, 42, 52, 54, 56, 60, 62, 64, 68), and the occurrence of polyploid systems within Exacum and Sebaea. These results allow us to postulate x = 7, 8, or 9 as the possible base chromosome numbers for the Exaceae. Karyological reconstruction, based on the molecular phylogeny, suggest a basic number of x= 7 for the Exaceae, followed by dysploidy event leading to secondary base number of x= 8 and x= 9, and several polyploidization events. 2. Optimization of morphological characters suggests that the most recent common ancestor of Exaceae (MRCA) was similar to Lagenias pusillus by having pentamerous yellow actinomorphic flowers, with anthers included in the corolla tube and dehiscing by longitudinal slits, a bilobed stigma, and the absence of secondary stigmas, and cubical seeds with polygonal testa cells. This MRCA might have then developed particular floral syndromes as indicated by long corolla tubes or presence of enantiostyly in the tribe. 3. Dating analyses and dispersal-vicariance reconstructions suggest that the Exaceae evolved c. 32 million years ago in Africa and subsequently spread to Madagascar. The colonization of Australia, New-Zealand, and Asia involved at least three long-distance dispersals. Early diversification of Exaceae in Africa might be the consequence of the development of a temperate with dry summer climate, in the Cape region (South Africa), while the Quaternary climatic variation might explain most of the species diversity of Sebaea and Exochaenium. At the generic level, molecular phylogenies of Sebaea, based on <b>chloroplastic</b> and nuclear <b>DNA</b> markers, reveals five well-supported clades. Sebaea sulphurea seems to have evolved early, and is distinct from all the remaining extant species. Each clade is supported by several characters (morphological, vegetative, phenological or geographical), and a preliminary infrageneric classification is proposed...|$|R
40|$|With the {{objective}} of clarifying {{some aspects of the}} biogeography, phylogeny, and taxonomy of the genus Androcymbium, we sequenced three <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA</b> noncoding regions (trnL intron, trnL-trnF IGS, and trnY-trnD IGS). These data were analyzed with maximum parsimony and the ancestral areas methods following Bremer. Results show that Androcymbium is not monophyletic and that the origin of its distribution and speciation is situated in western South Africa. Later, it dispersed to North Africa, going first to eastern South Africa. Androcymbium austrocapense and A. roseum allow us to phylogenetically connect the species of western with eastern South Africa, and the southern species with the northern, respectively. The formation of an arid track in Africa {{at the end of the}} Miocene explains the colonization of Androcymbium in the Mediterranean basin. Androcymbium wyssianum is a key element in understanding colonization of the Canary Islands. The biogeographical pattern of distribution of Androcymbium fits with many other genera with similar disjunct distributions. This indicates the importance of the Miocene arid track in understanding the floristic connections between northern and southern Africa. Because of the close relationships of Bulbocodium, Colchicum, and Merendera, with Androcymbium inferred from the chloroplast data, restructuring the taxonomy and nomenclature of the tribe Colchiceae may be required...|$|E
40|$|Summary Unlike {{maternal}} inheritance in sexual hybridiza-tion, plant somatic hybridization allows transfer, mixing and recombination of cytoplasmic genomes. In {{addition to the}} use of somatic hybridization in plant breeding programs, applica-tion of this unique tool should lead {{to a better understanding of}} the roles played by the chloroplastic and mitochondrial genomes in determining agronomically important traits. The nucleotide sequences of cytoplasmic genomes are much more conserved than those of nuclear genomes. Cytoplasmic DNA composition in somatic hybrids is commonly elucidated either by length polymorphism analysis of restricted genome regions amplified with universal primers (PCR-RF) or by hybridiza-tion of total DNA using universal cytoplasmic probes. In this study, we demonstrate that single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis is a powerful, quick and easy alternative method for cytoplasmic DNA characterization of somatic hybrids, especially for mitochondrial DNA. The tech-nique allows detection of polymorphisms based on both size and sequence of amplified targets. Twenty-two species of the subfamily Aurantioideae were analyzed with eight universal primers (four from chloroplastic and four from mitochondrial regions). Differences in <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA</b> composition were scored in 98 % of all possible two-parent combinations, and dif-ferent mitochondrial DNA profiles were found in 87 % of them. Analysis by SSCP was also successfully used to characterize somatic hybrids and cybrids obtained by fusion of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. and C. excelsa Wester protoplasts...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear genome of eukaryotes {{contains}} {{large amounts}} of cytoplasmic organelle DNA (nuclear integrants of organelle DNA [norgs]). The recent sequencing of many mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes has enabled investigation of the potential role of norgs in endosymbiotic evolution. In this article, we describe a new polymerase chain reaction-based method that allows the identification and evolutionary study of recent and older norgs {{in a range of}} eukaryotes. We tested this method in the genus Nicotiana and obtained sequences from seven nuclear integrants of plastid DNA (nupts) totaling 25 kb in length. These nupts were estimated to have been transferred 0. 033 to 5. 81 million years ago. The spectrum of mutations present in the potential protein-coding sequences compared with the noncoding sequences of each nupt revealed that nupts evolve in a nuclear-specific manner and are under neutral evolution. Indels were more frequent in noncoding regions than in potential coding sequences of former <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA,</b> most probably due to the presence of a higher number of homopolymeric sequences. Unexpectedly, some potential protein-coding sequences within the nupts still contained intact open reading frames for up to 5. 81 million years. These results suggest that chloroplast genes transferred to the nucleus have in some cases several millions of years to acquire nuclear regulatory elements and become functional. The different factors influencing this time frame and the potential role of nupts in endosymbiotic gene transfer are discussed. Mathieu Rousseau-Gueutin, Michael A. Ayliffe, and Jeremy N.

40|$|International audienceDue to its {{beneficial}} effects on river ecosystems, black alder (Alnus glutinosa) {{is one of}} the tree species selected for planting on riverbanks in the cross-border area encompassing Wallonia in Belgium, Lorraine in France, and Luxembourg. The preservation of this species, however, is threatened by an invasive pathogen that particularly targets and kills young alder individuals. The objectives of this study were to characterize the genetic diversity and the genetic structure of A. glutinosa at this local level with the aim of assisting the conservation and replanting strategies and to determine if a germplasm collection comprising individuals from the same cross-border area captures the diversity present in the region. Nuclear simple sequence repeat (SSR) and <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA</b> (cpDNA) markers were used to analyze four local wild populations and the germplasm collection which is representative of two river catchments and six legal provenance regions. Three populations distant from the studied area were also included. A panel of 14 nuclear SSR loci revealed high allelic diversity and very low differentiation among wild populations (mean F-ST = 0. 014). The germplasm collection displayed a range of alleles that were representative of the different populations, and no significant differentiation between the germplasm collection and the local wild populations was observed, making this collection, as far as allelic diversity is concerned, suitable for providing trees for riverbank replanting programs. Using SSR markers, various statistical approaches consistently indicated the lack of a significant geographical structure {{at the level of the}} river catchments or provenance regions. In contrast, two cpDNA haplotypes were detected and displayed a cross-border geographically structured distribution that could be taken into account in defining new cross-border provenance regions...|$|E
40|$|Brown algae of {{the order}} Laminariales, {{commonly}} referred to as kelps, are the largest and most productive primary producers in the coastal inshore environment. Three genera of kelps are present on the southern African coast: Ecklonia, Laminaria and Macrocystis, of which the first two are ecologically and economically important and the focus of this study. The taxonomy of the genus Ecklonia is investigated. The genus Ecklonia (Phaeophyceae, Lessoniaceae) consists of seven species with four species in the Northern Hemisphere and three in the southern Hemisphere. Ecklonia was recently transferred to the family Lessoniaceae based on phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and chloroplastic markers, though the type of the genus was not included, and its relationship to the allied genera Eckloniopsis and Eisenia remained unresolved. The present study is the first to produce a phylogeny focussed on the genus Ecklonia. It included sequences from nuclear, mitochondrial and <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA,</b> for most of the distribution range of the three current Southern Hemisphere species (E. radiata, E. maxima and a sample of a putative E. brevipes specimen), sequences for East Asiatic species (E. cava, E. kurome and E. stolonifera), as well as the closely related genera Eckloniopsis and Eisenia. Results confirmed E. radiata and E. maxima as two distinct species in South Africa, E. radiata as a single species throughout the Southern Hemisphere (in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand) and East Asiatic species as a distinct lineage from the Southern Hemisphere clade. Results further indicated a close sister relationship between Eckloniopsis radicosa and two Eisenia species (including the type species: Eisenia arborea), and the genus Ecklonia, suggesting that the genera Eckloniopsis and Eisenia are superfluous...|$|E

One of the major consequences of forecasted future climate change is the redistribution of plant life due to species migrations and extinctions in response to these changes. This has caused many scientists to {{look at the history of}} vegetation migrations to help understand future vegetation management strategies and biodiversity concerns. Our knowledge and understanding of past long-term species range changes is best understood from interpretations of the palynological record. This study reexamines paleopollen data from the World Data Center in conjunction with a recent <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA</b> study of one temperate woody vegetation species, Fagus grandifolia. The pollen percentage level of 0. 5 percent of total pollen is used to infer the presence of Fagus grandifolia at palynological sites. When assumptions about the suitability of this threshold are challenged, a different late-Pleistocene geography emerges for Fagus grandifolia. A survey of all palynological sites in the North American pollen database for Fagus grandifolia pollen, in conjunction with supporting DNA evidence, indicates consistent patterns of more northerly refugial locations and different migration routes for Fagus grandifolia than currently accepted. Patterns of pollen deposition and DNA evidence reveal a possible refuge in the area of the northern Mississippi Embayment. There is as well evidence of refugia for and expansion of Fagus grandifolia mixed with boreal forest elements along the Appalachian Plateau, closer to the ice sheet margin than the Gulf Coastal Plain...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{both the}} {{morphological}} and molecular characteristics of Malaysian rice cultivars {{are not well}} documented resulting in difficulty to identify cultivars with specific origin or traits. Although some rice information are available, the information are mostly not systematically organized with limited accessibility. Thus in this work, a <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA</b> (cpDNA) marker gene, the large subunit of ribulose- 1, 5 - bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) gene were used to construct a phylogenetic tree of eleven Malaysian rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars. cpDNA is most commonly used in phylogenetic and barcoding study for plant species because of its high success rate in PCR amplification, appropiate length and a base substitution rate for inferring phylogeny at higher levels. The rbcL gene was amplified from genomic DNA of the 11 rice cultivars, cloned and sequenced. The sequences obtained was analyzed and aligned using software MEGA 6. Then, the phylogenetic analysis was constructed by using method Maximum Parsimony. The result revealed that rbcL gene of eleven Malaysian rice cultivars are ~ 1400 bp in size. Based on the tree constructed, the eleven Malaysian rice cultivars studied can be classified into two major clades. The first clade consists of MR 220 CL 2, MR 219, Putih and Wai while MR 269, MR 263, MR 220, Merah Udang, Pulut Bukit, MR Q 76 and Bukit Hitam falled into the second clade. Bootstrap support (BS) value {{in some of the}} branches were a bit low and these value is reflected by the small number of informative character (844 were conserved and 319 were potentially informative) to design the tree. The formation of several subclades in the tree is due to its similar genetic pattern and thus support the system classification. In overall, this study suggested that rbcL gene can serve as a good candidate gene to distinguish the phylogenetic relationship in Malaysian rice cultivar...|$|E
40|$|Delimitating species {{boundaries}} {{could be}} of critical importance when evaluating the species’ evolving process and providing guidelines for conservation genetics. Here, species delimitation was carried out on three endemic and endangered Cycas species with resembling morphology and overlapped distribution range along the Red River (Yuanjiang) in China: Cycas diananensis Z. T. Guan et G. D. Tao, Cycas parvula S. L. Yang and Cycas multiovula D. Y. Wang. A total of 137 individuals from 15 populations were genotyped by using three chloroplastic (psbA-trnH, atpI-atpH and trnL-rps 4) and two single copy nuclear (RPB 1 and SmHP) DNA sequences. Basing on the carefully morphological comparison and cladistic haplotype aggregation (CHA) analysis, we propose all the populations as one species, with the rest two incorporated into C. diannanensis. Genetic diversity and structure analysis of the conflated C. diannanensis revealed this species possessed a relative lower genetic diversity than estimates of other Cycas species. The higher genetic diversity among populations and relative lower genetic diversity within populations, as well as obvious genetic differentiation among populations inferred from <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA</b> (cpDNA) suggested a recent genetic loss within this protected species. Additionally, a clear genetic structure of C. diannanensis corresponding with geography was detected based on cpDNA, dividing its population ranges into Yuanjiang-Nanhun basin and Ejia-Jiepai basin groups. Demographical history analyses based on combined cpDNA and one nuclear DNA (nDNA) SmHP both showed the population size of C. diannanensis began to decrease in Quaternary glaciation with no subsequent expansion, while another nDNA RPB 1 revealed a more recent sudden expansion after long-term population size contraction, suggesting its probable bottleneck events in history. Our findings offer grounded views for clarifying species boundaries of C. diannanensis when determining the conservation objectives. For operational guidelines, the downstream populations which occupy high and peculiar haplotypes should be given prior in-situ conservation. In addition, ex-situ conservation and reintroduction measures for decades of generations are supplemented for improving the population size and genetic diversity of the endemic and endangered species...|$|E
40|$|The genus Taophila Heller, 1916 was {{considered}} a monotypic taxon until the recent addition of 11 new species. We examined the recent revision of this genus to evaluate these new taxonomic considerations {{in the light of}} molecular data for a sample of 85 individuals in 8 out of 12 Taophila species, and to provide characters for a phylogenetic systematic analysis of the genus. These data include two mitochondrial DNA markers (cox 1 and rrnS) and one nuclear DNA marker (wingless) to infer the species phylogeny, and one gene from the <b>chloroplastic</b> <b>DNA</b> (psbA-trnH) of putatively ingested plant tissue for diet inference. Molecular data support the monophyly of the species studied, except for T. subsericea Heller, 1916, which possibly represents an ancient genetic polymorphism. The molecular phylogeny and a reassessment of morphological characters are used to propose several taxonomic changes that will achieve stable systematics in Taophila, including: (i) description of two new species, T. aphrodita sp. n. and T. gaea sp. n., both related to T. mars Samuelson, 2010; (ii) removal of T. cancellata Samuelson, 2010 from Taophila and its new combination with Dematochroma Baly, 1864; (iii) proposal of two new subgenera in Taophila to reflect deep phylogenetic divergence and profound morphological discrepancies with the anatomy of the generic type and relatives, Jolivetiana subgen. n. (type: Taophila mantillerii Jolivet, Verma & Mille, 2007) and Lapita subgen. n. (type: Taophila mars Samuelson, 2010).
