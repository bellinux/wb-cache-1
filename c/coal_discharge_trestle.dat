30|$|Top <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> method {{involves}} {{the combination of}} sequence of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> the times of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> at each discharge window and the quantity of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> {{as well as the}} number of discharge window opened in the same time along the face. The sequence of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> can be categorized as sequential <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> and alternated <b>coal</b> <b>discharge.</b> The times of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> at each discharge window can be categorized as single, double and multiple <b>coal</b> <b>discharges.</b> The number of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> window opened in the same time can be categorized as single window discharge and multiple window discharge. The number of simultaneously opened discharge window can be categorized as single <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> and multiple <b>coal</b> <b>discharge.</b> The quantity of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> can be categorized as equal quantity and non-equal quantity. Because it is difficult to manage equal or non-equal quantity <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> in operation, and single or multiple <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> can be managed in labor planning, however the determination of the <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> method is mainly based on the sequence of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> and the times of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> at each discharge window. There are four main alternative methods including single sequential <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> single alternated <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> multi-round sequential <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> and multi-round alternated <b>coal</b> <b>discharge.</b> The geological conditions for different coal seams are different, and their capabilities are also different, thus, different <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> methods must be used, and the recovery of top coal is also varied.|$|R
30|$|Because the <b>discharged</b> <b>coal</b> {{quantity}} in {{a unit of}} time at a discharge window {{cannot be}} calculated, the control of <b>discharged</b> <b>coal</b> quantity each time at a support is to control the time. After {{the start of a}} LLTCC operation, the <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> time at a discharge window should be calculated through several rounds of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> operation. The time from the start of discharge until the gangue occurring in the discharge flow is the time of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> in a round. When using two rounds of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> the time spent on one round of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> should be half of the total <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> time, and 1 / 3 of the total <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> time for three rounds of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} {{multiple}} <b>coal</b> <b>discharges</b> {{is to provide}} time and space for the top coals and the immediate roof to fracture and cave. Therefore, the delay time of the second <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> cannot be too short. Generally, the second <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> should be more than 10  m away from the first <b>coal</b> <b>discharge.</b> It should be adjusted according to the movement of top coals and the roof.|$|R
30|$|A {{numerical}} {{analysis was conducted}} to simulate the top-coal caving and discharge by using the geological parameters of coal seams and the technical parameters of hydraulic supports at Tashan coal mine. In addition, the simulated loose thickness of the top coal was 10.50 – 11.17  m, and the simulated cutting heights were 4, 4.5 and 5  m. The top-coal caving and discharge operation was simulated including single sequential <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> single alternated <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> and multiple alternated <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> method. The numerical {{results showed that the}} recovery of <b>coal</b> cutted and <b>discharged</b> was the lowest using single-time alternated multiple windows <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> and highest using discharge in multi-round & multiple windows sequence alternately. In order to increase the recovery of top coal, the method of multiple-time alternated multiple window <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> was selected in the LLTCC operation at the No. 8105 face, Tashan coal mine in Datong, China.|$|R
30|$|During {{the process}} of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> the size of caved coal is {{suitable}} at the initial stage and the <b>discharged</b> <b>coal</b> flow is smooth. With the <b>discharge</b> of top <b>coals,</b> the large-size coals increase and form a balanced arch above the discharge window to block the coal flow. In this case, {{the base of the}} balanced arch should be broken using a <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> device. In addition, the large coal blocks should be crushed to enable the continuity of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge.</b> Therefore, the tail beam should be continuously swung up and down during {{the process of}} <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> to disturb the awaited top coals. The upswing of the tail beam can crush large coal blocks and the down swing can loosen the coal flow.|$|R
30|$|Under {{the ground}} pressure, the top coal is {{fractured}} and caved. The size of coal is different {{depending on the}} coal hardness. During the process of top <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> the increase in large coals causes a balanced arch above the support discharge window and blocks the coal flow. In this case, {{the base of the}} balanced arch should be fractured using the <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> device. In addition, the large coal blocks should be crushed to enable the continuity of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge.</b> Therefore, a high efficient and high recovery <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> device was developed with a strong disturbance capacity. Two jacks with a cylinder diameter of ϕ 180  mm were installed on the tail beam for operation. The force of a single jack was 1000 kN (P =  39  MPa) and 2000 kN with both. In order to increase the disturbance to top coals, the upswing of the tail beam can reach 19.5 ° to crush top coals, and the down swing can reach 41 ° to loosen coal flow. During the process of top <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> the tail beam was swung continuously to disturb the awaited top coals and to achieve a high efficient and high recovery <b>coal</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|R
30|$|The time of {{multiple}} <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> {{and the control}} of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> quantity: In respect of the LLTCC mining operation at Tashan coal mine, because the ply of the top coal is very thick and the top coal is very hard, after top coal caving, the upper top coals cannot fully break due to limited caving space. Some of top coals close to the roof cannot even cave. In this case, if the caved <b>coals</b> are <b>discharged</b> completely, there will be losses of large coal blocks and uncaved top coals. As a result, there should be multiple <b>coal</b> <b>discharges,</b> e.g., two or three times. The multiple <b>coal</b> <b>discharges</b> will provide time and space for the fracturing and caving of top coals, and enable the boundary of caved top coals and immediate roof gangue to be evenly subsided.|$|R
30|$|When {{the drawing}} {{interval}} is too large, {{at the beginning}} of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> top <b>coals</b> caved reach the discharge window earlier than gangue in the goaf. Before <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> the boundary between coal and gangue is obviously behind the lower boundary of the tail beam, and the gangue in the goaf cannot reach the discharge window. With a LLTCC operation, the angle of the shield beam becomes larger, and the height of the discharge window becomes higher. During the process of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> the top <b>coal</b> above the <b>discharge</b> window can be discharged quickly and the gangue above the top coal also caves quickly. In this case, the coal and gangue in the goaf near the discharge window with natural angle of depose cannot flow toward the discharge window and be <b>discharged,</b> resulting in <b>coal</b> losses and low coal recovery.|$|R
30|$|A {{new type}} of <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> device with double front and rear link bars, middle passage and {{observation}} window.|$|R
30|$|The {{control of}} the size of the <b>coal</b> <b>{{discharge}}</b> window: The {{control of the}} discharge window is to control the <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> quantity at a single discharge window. Under the same flowability of caved top <b>coals,</b> the <b>discharged</b> quantity in a unit time is in proportion with the size of the discharge window. As a result, the centerline spacing of supports was modified from 1.5  m to 1.75  m to increase the size of discharge window along the inclined direction of the face (size in transverse direction). Simultaneously, the size of the discharge window in the longitudinal direction (along the strike direction of the face) was controlled.|$|R
30|$|The <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> {{device of}} the tail beam-sliding plate was easily jammed and hard to slide. Because the sliding plate was not slid back, the sliding plate {{occasionally}} cut the chain of the rear scraper conveyor when the tail beam swung.|$|R
30|$|Hydraulic {{support is}} one of key {{equipment}} for a LLTCC coal mining operation. The requirements for hydraulic support consist of rational structure, sufficient support resistance force, stable and shock resistance, sustainability of high efficient <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> and high <b>coal</b> recovery.|$|R
30|$|With a {{rational}} top-coal drawing interval, at initial <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> the gangue in the goaf and top coal {{will reach the}} discharge window of the support at the same time. Before the <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> the boundary between coal and gangue is behind the lower boundary of the tail beam, thus the horizontal movement of gangue in the goaf is small. In the process of top-coal caving and <b>discharge,</b> the <b>coals</b> can smoothly reach the discharge window. With the caving of the lower and middle part of the coals, the gangue above the coal seam caves as well, {{then there will be}} some mixture of coal and gangue during the discharge of the upper layer of top coal. The mixture gangue is mainly from the roof above the seam that enters the discharge window with the <b>discharge</b> of top <b>coals.</b>|$|R

30|$|When {{the drawing}} {{interval}} is small, the gangue {{in the direction}} of the goaf reaches the discharge window earlier than the top coals do, and the <b>discharged</b> <b>coals</b> mix with gangue. Before <b>coal</b> <b>discharge,</b> the boundary between coal and gangue near the discharge window is beyond the lower boundary of the tail beam. Therefore, it results in the part of middle to top coals being unable to be discharged due to the enclosure of gangue and the tail beam. In this case, the gauge might enter the discharge window from the bottom of the window, and increase the percentage of gangue in the coals obtained.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{presence}} of the coal power plant, Sual port was established close to the power plant in 2012. Sual Port a large port for the cargo of coal, and among the largest and most important <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> ports of The Philippines. Sual port is located close to Sual power plant, and caters mainly to the thermal power plant. It can accommodate ships with a maximum draft of 13.3 metres and a maximum LOA of 225 metres.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  35, with the {{increase}} in the top coal drawing interval, there were some variations in the boundary shape of coal and gangue before and after top coal caving. In other words, the initial caving point of top coal shifted forward, the distance between start line and finish line of top coal caving increased with the drawing interval. This indicated that the amount of <b>coal</b> <b>discharged</b> at each discharge circle increased {{with the increase}} of the drawing interval.|$|R
30|$|A large-diameter double {{telescopic}} shock-resistance prop and a 1000  min− 1 large flow {{safety valve}} quick unloading device have been developed, which improve the shock-resistance of hydraulic support; an articulated front beam and high reliable telescopic beam with a secondary wall protection structure have been developed, which overcomes the wall spalling problem at LLTCC coalfaces; {{and a strong}} disturbance-type top <b>coal</b> <b>discharge</b> device with high efficiency and high top coal recovery has been developed, which improves coal recovery. On {{the basis of the}} developments presented above, a 5.2  m cutting height LLTCC hydraulic support has been developed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Predicting {{short-term}} {{wind speed}} {{is essential in}} order to model a system of prevention of environmental contamination produced by the effects of strong winds acting on goods (mainly crushed <b>coal)</b> <b>discharged</b> at a dock. The wind speed in a near future depends on the values of other meteorological variables in previous times. The values are obtained from a meteorological station with several sensors: wind speed, temperature, humidity, pressure [...] . We have used the SNNS simulator to obtain a neural network able to predict the wind speed 20 min. in advance, with the minimum possible error.

30|$|It is {{important}} to select a rational top-coal drawing interval to improve coal recovery and reduce the percentage of gangue. If the drawing interval is too large, the top coals might be caved into the goaf, resulting in a coal loss. On the other hand, if the drawing interval is too small, the gangue might be mixed with coals and cave into the discharge window, which may not only affect the coal quality, but also be mistaken for top coal exhaustion and result in coal loss. The factors for determining the drawing interval consists of {{the thickness of the}} top <b>coal,</b> the <b>discharge</b> window length of support, the center height of the discharge window and the shearer’s cutting depth. The principal for determining the drawing interval is to fracture and loosen the top coal in the range of the <b>discharged</b> <b>coal,</b> increase top coal recovery and reduce the percentage of gangue. In addition, the rational drawing interval should match the coal mining process and form an integer-times relationship with the shearer’s cutting depth.|$|R
