Also encountered were other bivalves, bryozoans, brachiopods and tunicates. Many of the tubes made by the worms were unoccupied and other organisms overgrew living and dead calcareous tubes. On the lower, left valve, <b>cyclostome</b> and cheilostome bryozoans predominated. Starfish seem equally able to force open the valves of a scallop with barnacles on it as one with none.|$|E
60|$|Professor Haeckel {{proposes to}} break up the {{vertebrate}} sub-kingdom, first, into the two provinces of Leptocardia and Pachycardia; Amphioxus being in the former, and all other vertebrates in the latter division. The Pachycardia are then divided into Monorhina, which contains the <b>Cyclostome</b> fishes, distinguished by their single nasal aperture; and Amphirhina, comprising the other Vertebrata, which have two nasal apertures. These are further subdivided into Anamnia (Pisces, Dipneusta, Amphibia) and Amniota (Reptilia, Aves, Mammalia). This classification undoubtedly expresses many of the most important facts in vertebrate structure in a clear and compendious way; whether it is the best that can he adopted remains to be seen.|$|E

In free-walled (or double-walled) <b>cyclostomes,</b> the exterior frontal walls of the zooids are uncalcified; autozooids have either a polygonal aperture bounded by vertical interior walls, or alternatively a subcircular aperture in species with kenozooids filling the spaces between the autozooids. By contrast, fixed-walled (or single-walled) <b>cyclostomes</b> have much of the exterior frontal wall calcified; autozooids normally have a subcircular aperture located at or close to the frontal wall.|$|R

Cope (1889) coined the name Agnatha ("jawless") for a group that included the <b>cyclostomes</b> {{and a number of}} fossil groups in which jaws could not be observed. Vertebrates were subsequently divided into two major sister-groups: the Agnatha and the Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates). Stensiö (1927) suggested that the two groups of living agnathans (i.e. the <b>cyclostomes)</b> arose independently from different groups of fossil agnathans.|$|R

However, these proteins are not similar to mammalian immunoglobulins but have some characteristics common to complements C 3, C 4 and C 5 in higher vertebrates.

40|$|Pharyngeal gills are a {{fundamental}} {{feature of the}} vertebrate body plan [1]. However, the evolutionary history of vertebrate gills {{has been the subject}} of a long-standing controversy [2 - 8]. It is thought that gills evolved independently in <b>cyclostomes</b> (jawless vertebrates-lampreys and hagfish) and gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates-cartilaginous and bony fishes), based on their distinct embryonic origins: the gills of <b>cyclostomes</b> derive from endoderm [9 - 12], while gnathostome gills were classically thought to derive from ectoderm [10, 13]. Here, we demonstrate by cell lineage tracing that the gills of a cartilaginous fish, the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), are in fact endodermally derived. This finding supports the homology of gills in <b>cyclostomes</b> and gnathostomes, and a single origin of pharyngeal gills prior to the divergence of these two ancient vertebrate lineages.

50|$|As clearly {{seen in the}} lamprey, <b>Cyclostome</b> {{also has}} a pair of {{cartilaginous}} rods in the embryonic head {{which is similar to}} the trabecular cartilages in jawed vertebrates.However, in 1916, Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, Alf Johnels reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal cartilages in jawed vertebrates. Recent experimental studies also showed that the cartilages are derived from the head mesoderm. Today, the “trabecular cartilages” in the <b>Cyclostome</b> is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular cartilages were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.|$|E
