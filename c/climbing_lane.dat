5|$|An {{engineering}} report {{dating back}} to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels {{was the best way}} to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a <b>climbing</b> <b>lane</b> going uphill).|$|E
5|$|East of Middletown, US40Alternate {{passes through}} a {{suburban}} area then begins to ascend Braddock Mountain. The highway gains a <b>climbing</b> <b>lane</b> eastbound {{to the top of}} the mountain, which contains the community of Braddock Heights. On the descent of Braddock Mountain, US40Alternate expands to a four-lane road, with one lane eastbound, two lanes westbound, and a center turn lane. At the base of the mountain, the alternate route temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway through its half-diamond interchange with I-70, which has ramps to and from the direction of Frederick. East of I-70, US40Alternate reduces to two lanes and passes the Highland Lodge. The alternate route reaches its eastern terminus at a partial intersection with US40 (Patrick Street) at the western edge of Frederick and the Frederick Golden Mile, a heavily commercialized area east to US15 (Frederick Freeway). There is no direct access from eastbound US40Alternate to westbound US40 or from eastbound US40 to the westbound alternate route; those movements are made by using Old Camp Road.|$|E
40|$|Speed {{of heavy}} {{vehicles}} is greatly reduced on upgrade sections {{due to their}} insufficient climbing capability, thus having great impact on traffic safety. Setting <b>climbing</b> <b>lanes</b> can solve this problem effectively. Considering China’s traffic composition and operational status, this paper proposed the traffic conflict technique-based setting method of freeway <b>climbing</b> <b>lanes</b> in order to set foundations for <b>climbing</b> <b>lanes</b> {{with the goal of}} promoting traffic safety. Based on large freeway upgrade section data and actual traffic characteristics, the paper built simulation models with VISSIM. 220 schemes were simulated by setting different road and traffic conditions of models. The paper then used Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) to calculate traffic conflict, analyzed the influence of slope, slope length and mixed rate of heavy vehicles on traffic safety on upgrade sections. Finally, taking the reduction extent of the collision rate after setting <b>climbing</b> <b>lanes</b> as an indicator, this paper used K-means to classify the effectiveness level of the <b>climbing</b> <b>lanes.</b> The paper found the setting position and basis of the <b>climbing</b> <b>lanes.</b> The findings of this paper can provide support to effective decision making with regards to constructing future <b>climbing</b> <b>lanes...</b>|$|R

The highway descends from a high bluff to the Susquehanna River, during which southbound MD 222 has a <b>climbing</b> <b>lane.</b> Upon entering the town limits of Port Deposit, MD222's name changes to Main Street and the highway makes a sharp turn to the north to parallel the river and Norfolk Southern Railway's Port Road Branch.

MD222 passes the Paw Paw Building and intersects Granite Avenue before crossing Rock Run and passing under a low railroad bridge to {{the west side of the}} tracks. The highway leaves the town of Port Deposit and continues north as Susquehanna River Road, closely paralleling the river and passing through a unit of Susquehanna State Park along the river. Soon after crossing Octoraro Creek, MD222 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with US1 (Conowingo Road) at the eastern end of Conowingo Dam. Following US1 northeast to the community of Conowingo leads to the southern terminus of US222 and the northern terminus of MD222Truck.|$|E

25|$|Running {{approximately}} parallel both to {{the coast}} of the Solent and to the A27, the M27 starts as an eastwards continuation of the A31 from Bournemouth and Poole, meets the A36 from Salisbury, crosses the Wessex Main Line railway, and then meets the M271 to central Southampton. After the M271, the road becomes a dual four lane motorway and passes Rownhams services, it then meets the M3, (two lanes going off, two lanes continuing {{to the other side of}} the junction) reverting to a dual three lane motorway as it passes to the north of Southampton, passes Southampton Airport, meeting Junction 7 and becoming dual four lanes again, then becoming dual three lanes after Junction 8, it then runs alongside the West Coastway Line as it heads south-east towards Fareham. It then runs alongside the northern outskirts of Fareham, briefly with a fourth <b>climbing</b> <b>lane</b> in either direction, before its junction with the M275 to Portsmouth. Very shortly after this point the motorway ends, becoming the A27, a four lane dual carriageway almost to motorway standards until the junction with the A3 (M) Motorway. The official reason for this section of road not being a continuation of the motorway is the hard shoulders being too narrow. Although the M275 which the M27 junctions with, has no official hard shoulders throughout its entire length.|$|E
