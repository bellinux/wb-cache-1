50|$|<b>Atomic</b> <b>Age</b> {{in design}} {{refers to the}} period roughly {{corresponding}} to 1940-1960, when concerns about nuclear war dominated Western society during the Cold War. Architecture, industrial design, commercial design (including advertising), interior design, and fine arts were all influenced by the themes of atomic science, {{as well as the}} Space Age, which coincided with that period. <b>Atomic</b> <b>Age</b> design became popular and instantly recognizable, with a use of atomic motifs and space age symbols. Retrofuturism is a current resurgence of interest in <b>Atomic</b> <b>Age</b> design.|$|R

5000|$|Atomic {{particles}} {{themselves were}} reproduced in visual design, in areas ranging from architecture to barkcloth patterns. The geometric atomic patterns that were produced in textiles, industrial materials, melamine counter tops, dishware and wallpaper, {{and many other}} items, are emblematic of <b>Atomic</b> <b>Age</b> design. The Space Age interests of the public also began showing up in <b>Atomic</b> <b>Age</b> designs, with star and galaxy motifs appearing with the atomic graphics.Free-form organic shapes also appear as a recurring theme in <b>Atomic</b> <b>Age</b> design. British designers at the Council of Industrial Design (CoID) produced fabrics in the early 1950s that showed [...] "skeletal plant forms, drawn in a delicate, spidery graphic form", reflecting x-ray technology that was becoming more widespread and familiar in pop culture. These botanic designs influenced later <b>Atomic</b> <b>Age</b> patterns that included repeating organic shapes similar to cells and organisms viewed through a microscope.|$|R

50|$|There are {{similarities}} between many <b>Atomic</b> <b>Age</b> designs and the mid-century modern {{trend of the}} same time. Elements of <b>Atomic</b> <b>Age</b> and Space Age design were dominant in the Googie design movement in commercial buildings in the United States. Some streamlined industrial designs also echoed the influence of futurism that had been seen much earlier in Art Deco design.|$|R

It held great promise of technological solutions for the problems facing an increasingly complex world; at the same time, people were fearful of a nuclear armageddon, after {{the use of the}} atomic bomb at the end of World War II. People were ever-aware of the potential good, and lurking menace, in technology. Science became more visible in the mainstream culture through <b>Atomic</b> <b>Age</b> design.|$|R
