The <b>composite</b> <b>powders</b> {{were characterized by}} XRD, EDX and SEM. The bioactivity of the synthesized powders was analyzed by immersion studies in simulated body fluid (SBF). The {{results show that the}} <b>composite</b> <b>powders</b> are made up of good crystalline β-TCP and amorphous bioglass, and it was conformed that the material had good osteoproduction and bioactivities, that is an indication of bioactive potential in vivo. It is believed that the β-TCP / Na-doped 58 S bioglass (58 SN) composite by sol-gel technique in situ could be a desirable biomaterial for preparing scaffold of bone tissue engineering. ...|$|R

The exothermal behavior of C 3 S determined by isothermal conduction calorimetry {{indicated that the}} ACP could be synthesis by chemical precipitation method during the induction period (stage II) of C 3 S. The <b>composite</b> <b>powders</b> were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicated that nanosized ACP particles deposited {{on the surface of}} C 3 S particles to form core-shell structure at pH= 10. 5, and the nCa/nP of ACP could be controlled between 1. 0 and 1. 5. The core-shell structure is stable after sintered at 500 oC for 3 h to remove the β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). As compared with the irregular C 3 S particles (1 ~ 5 µm), the <b>composite</b> <b>powders</b> particles are spherical with a diameter of 40 ~ 150 µm. Therefore, to obtain the smaller size of <b>composite</b> <b>powders,</b> it is expected to avoid the aggregate of C 3 S particles in the aqueous solution by addition of dispersant. As compared with C 3 S, the <b>composite</b> <b>powders</b> may contribute better injectability, strength and biocompatibility. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{preparing}} <b>composite</b> <b>powders</b> {{of the three}} coating components was developed and a procedure {{that can be used}} in applying uniform coatings of the <b>composite</b> <b>powders</b> was demonstrated. <b>Composite</b> <b>powders</b> were prepared by adjusting particle sizes of the components and employing a small amount of monoaluminum phosphate as an inorganic binder. Quantitative microscopy (image analysis) was found to be a convenient method of characterizing the composition of the multiphase plasma-sprayed coatings. Area percentages and distribution of the components were readily obtained by this method. The adhesive strength of the coating to a nickel-chromium alloy substrate was increased by about 40 percent by a heat treatment of 20 hours at 650 C...|$|R
