40|$|<b>Circumferential</b> actin <b>belts</b> {{underlying}} the adherens junctions of columnar epithelial cell monolayers control intercellular surface tension and cell shape to maintain tissue integrity. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog TAZ are proliferation-activating transcriptional coactivators that shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Previous studies suggest {{the importance of}} stress fibers in the actin cytoskeleton for regulation of YAP nuclear localization; however, {{the role of the}} <b>circumferential</b> actin <b>belt</b> on YAP localization remains unclarified. By manipulating actin tension, we demonstrate that <b>circumferential</b> actin <b>belt</b> tension suppresses YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. This suppression requires Merlin, an F-actin binding protein associated with adherens junctions. Merlin physically interacts with YAP/TAZ, and nuclear export sequences of Merlin are required for suppression. Together, with the observation that the association between E-cadherin and Merlin was diminished by tension in <b>circumferential</b> actin <b>belts,</b> our results suggest that released Merlin undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shutting and mediates export of YAP/TAZ from the nucleus...|$|R

There {{has been much}} interest recently in monitoring {{the integrity of the}} pipe structures. Ultrasonic guided waves provide a highly efficient technique for rapid pipe inspection because they can be made to propagate significant distances in pitch-catch configurations. Crosshole tomographic geometry is formed in such pitch-catch configurations when transmits and receivers are respectively laid along two parallel <b>circumferential</b> <b>belts</b> around the pipe. Considering the pipe as an unwrapped plate, we investigate the adapation of the tomographic reconstruction in seismology to the guided wave inspection of a pipe. Various effects such as transducer arrangement, mesh precision, sampling interval and iterative algorithm on tomographic reconstruction are analyzed. The results provide a theoretical basis for quantitative detection of pipeline flaw using guided wave tomography. 1...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{ability of}} {{epithelial}} cells to assemble into sheets relies on their zonula adherens (ZA), a <b>circumferential</b> <b>belt</b> of adherens junction (AJ) material, {{which can be}} remodeled during development to shape organs. Here, we show that during ZA remodeling in a model neuroepithelial cell, the Cdc 42 effector P 21 -activated kinase 4 (Pak 4 /Mbt) regulates AJ morphogenesis and stability through β-catenin (β-cat/Arm) phosphorylation. We find that β-catenin phosphorylation by Mbt, and associated AJ morphogenesis, is needed for the retention of the apical determinant Par 3 /Bazooka at the remodeling ZA. Importantly, this retention mechanism functions together with Par 1 -dependent lateral exclusion of Par 3 /Bazooka to regulate apical membrane differentiation. Our results reveal an important functional link between Pak 4, AJ material morphogenesis, and polarity remodeling during organogenesis downstream of Par 3...|$|E
40|$|PLEKHA 7 is a {{junctional}} protein, which {{participates in}} a complex that stabilizes E-cadherin at the zonula adhaerens. Since E-cadherin is involved in epithelial morphogenesis, signaling, and tumor progression, we explored PLEKHA 7 expression in cancer. PLEKHA 7 expression was assessed in invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas of the breast by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. PLEKHA 7 was detected at epithelial junctions of normal mammary ducts and lobules, and of tubular and micropapillary structures within G 1 and G 2 ductal carcinomas. At these junctions, the localization of PLEKHA 7 was along the <b>circumferential</b> <b>belt</b> (zonula adhaerens), and only partially overlapping with that of E-cadherin, p 120 ctn and ZO- 1, as shown previously in rodent tissues. PLEKHA 7 immunolabeling was strongly decreased in G 3 ductal carcinomas and undetectable in lobular carcinomas. PLEKHA 7 mRNA was detected in both ductal and lobular carcinomas, with no observed correlation between mRNA levels and tumor type or grade. In summary, PLEKHA 7 is a junctional marker of epithelial cells within tubular structures both in normal breast tissue and ductal carcinomas, and since PLEKHA 7 protein but not mRNA expression is strongly decreased or lost in high grade ductal carcinomas and in lobular carcinomas, loss of PLEKHA 7 is a newly characterized feature of these carcinomas...|$|E
40|$|Microfilaments (MFs) play an {{important}} role in wound healing and other regenerative events. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in the distribution of MFs in traumatized auditory epithelia and compare these changes between avian (regenerating) and mammalian (nonregenerating) ears. Chicks and guinea pigs were acoustically overstimulated and their auditory epithelia analyzed using fluorescence microscopy with phalloidin as a MF-specific marker. Immediately or several hours after overstimulation, we observed a substantial reduction of MFs in stereocilia and the cuticular plate. The <b>circumferential</b> <b>belt</b> of MF which is associated with the adherens junctional complex was constricted in damaged hair cells (HCs) as early as 1 day after the exposure. Concomitant with the junctional constriction, the apical surface area of supporting cells was increased relative to normal, whereas the surface area of HCs was decreased. We conclude that changes in the amount and distribution of MFs which characterize early responses to acoustic damage are similar in avian (regenerating) and mammalian (nonregenerating) auditory epithelia. We hypothesize that changes in MF-mediated tensile forces trigger the process of tissue repair in auditory epithelia in response to insult. In mammals the reorganization of MFs may help maintain the integrity of the reticular lamina and thereby prevent further damage. In contrast, early changes in MFs in chicks may play a role in regulating regenerative tissue responses...|$|E
40|$|The ultrastructural {{organization}} of the proboscis in two species of free-living Platyhelminthes, Psammorhynchus tubulipenis and Cytocystis clitellatus is very alike but differs from previously described species. Both sheath and cone epithelium are composed of two <b>circumferential</b> <b>belts.</b> Only the basal cone epithelium is syncytial, while no nuclei {{were found in the}} distal belt of the sheath epithelium. The sheath epithelium is characterized by numerous infoldings of the basal plasma membrane. The nuclei present in the bulb belong to the proximal belt of the sheath epithelium and the apical cone epithelium. Nuclei of the basal cone epithelium are located insunk behind the proboscis bulb. The insunk cell parts pierce the septum of the bulb laterally near the proximal end. Different types of gland necks and sensory cells pierce the epithelia. Associated with the distal belt of the sheath epithelium, two sensory organs are found, containing multiciliary receptors with modified axonemata. Differences in {{organization of}} the proboscis musculature are described and compared with the organization in other species.

In this paper, we characterize Lulu 2, a FERM (4. 1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain– containing molecule homologous to Drosophila melanogaster Yurt, as an important regulator.

The constricting cells have an actin meshwork directly beneath the apical membrane as well as <b>circumferential</b> actin <b>belts</b> lining the adherens junctions between cells. Pulsed contractions of the actin meshwork are believed to be primarily responsible for reducing the apical surface area.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} how cells differentially use {{the dozens of}} myosin isozymes present in each genome, we examined the distribution of four unconventional myosin isozymes in the inner ear, a tissue that is particularly reliant on actin-rich structures and unconventional myosin isozymes. Of the four isozymes, each from a different class, three are expressed in the hair cells of amphibia and mammals. In stereocilia, constructed of cross-linked F-actin filaments, myosin-Iβ is found mostly near stereociliary tips, myosin-VI is largely absent, and myosin-VIIa colocalizes with crosslinks that connect adjacent stereocilia. In the cuticular plate, a meshwork of actin filaments, myosin-Iβ is excluded, myosin-VI is concentrated, and modest amounts of myosin-VIIa are present. These three myosin isozymes are excluded from other actin-rich domains, including the circumferential actin belt and the cortical actin network. A member of a fourth class, myosin-V, is not expressed in hair cells but is present at high levels in afferent nerve cells that innervate hair cells. Substantial amounts of myosins-Iβ, -VI, and -VIIa are located in a pericuticular necklace that is largely free of F-actin, squeezed between (but not associated with) actin of the cuticular plate and the <b>circumferential</b> <b>belt.</b> Our localization results suggest specific functions for three hair-cell myosin isozymes. As suggested previously, myosin-Iβ probably {{plays a role in}} adaptation; concentration of myosin-VI in cuticular plates and association with stereociliary rootlets suggest that this isozyme participates in rigidly anchoring stereocilia; and finally, colocalization with cross-links between adjacent stereocilia indicates that myosin-VIIa is required for the structural integrity of hair bundles...|$|E
40|$|Whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical {{resonators}} {{of a type}} {{now under}} development are designed to support few well-defined waveguide modes. In the simplest case, a resonator of this type would support one equatorial family of WGMs; in a more complex case, such a resonator would be made to support two, three, or some other specified finite number of modes. Such a resonator can be made of almost any transparent material commonly used in optics. The nature of the supported modes {{does not depend on}} which material is used, and the geometrical dispersion of this resonator is much smaller than that of a typical prior WGM resonator. Moreover, in principle, many such resonators could be fabricated as integral parts of a single chip. Basically, a resonator of this type consists of a rod, made of a suitable transparent material, from which protrudes a thin <b>circumferential</b> <b>belt</b> of the same material. The belt is integral {{with the rest of the}} rod (see figure) and acts as a circumferential waveguide. If the depth (d) and width (w) of the belt are made appropriately small, then the belt acts as though it were the core of a single-mode optical fiber: the belt and its adjacent supporting rod material support a single, circumferentially propagating mode or family of modes. It has been shown theoretically that the fiber-optic-like behavior of the belton- rod resonator structure can be summarized, in part, by the difference, Dn, between (1) an effective index of refraction of an imaginary fiber core and (2) the index of refraction (n) of the transparent rod/belt material. It has also been shown theoretically that for a given required value of Dn, the required depth of the belt can be estimated as d R Dn, where R is the radius of the rod. It must be emphasized that this estimated depth is independent of n and, hence, is independent of the choice of rod material. As in the cases of prior WGM resonators, input/output optical coupling involves utilization of evanescent fields. In the present case, there are two evanescent fields: one at the belt/air interface and one in the boundary region between the belt and the rest of the rod...|$|E
40|$|A diamond {{turning process}} has made {{possible}} a significant {{advance in the}} art of whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical resonators. By use of this process, it is possible to fashion crystalline materials into WGM resonators that have ultrahigh resonance quality factors (high Q values), are compact (ranging in size from millimeters down to tens of microns), and support single electromagnetic modes. This development combines and extends the developments reported in "Few- Mode Whispering-Gallery-Mode Resonators" (NPO- 41256), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 30, No. 1 (January 2006), page 16 a and "Fabrication of Submillimeter Axisymmetric Optical Components" (NPO- 42056), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 31, No. 5 (May 2007), page 10 a. To recapitulate from the first cited prior article: A WGM resonator of this special type consists of a rod, made of a suitable transparent material, from which protrudes a thin <b>circumferential</b> <b>belt</b> of the same material. The belt is integral {{with the rest of the}} rod and acts as a circumferential waveguide. If the depth and width of the belt are made appropriately small, then the belt acts as though it were the core of a single-mode optical fiber: the belt and the rod material adjacent to it support a single, circumferentially propagating mode or family of modes. To recapitulate from the second cited prior article: A major step in the fabrication of a WGM resonator of this special type is diamond turning or computer numerically controlled machining of a rod of a suitable transparent crystalline material on an ultrahigh-precision lathe. During the rotation of a spindle in which the rod is mounted, a diamond tool is used to cut the rod. A computer program is used to control stepping motors that move the diamond tool, thereby controlling the shape cut by the tool. Because the shape can be controlled via software, it is possible to choose a shape designed to optimize a resonator spectrum, including, if desired, to limit the resonator to supporting a single mode. After diamond turning, a resonator can be polished to increase its Q. By virtue of its largely automated, computer-controlled nature, the process is suitable for mass production of nominally identical single-mode WGM resonators. In a demonstration of the capabilities afforded by this development, a number of WGM resonators of various designs were fabricated side by side on the surface of a single CaF 2 rod (see figure) ...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{junctions}} between ependymal cells, between astrocytes, {{and between}} some electrically coupled neurons have heretofore {{been regarded as}} tight, pentalaminar occlusions of the intercellular cleft. These junctions are now redefined {{in terms of their}} configuration after treatment of brain tissue in uranyl acetate before dehydration. Instead of a median dense lamina, they are bisected by a median gap 20 – 30 A wide which is continuous {{with the rest of the}} interspace. The patency of these "gap junctions" is further demonstrated by the penetration of horseradish peroxidase or lanthanum into the median gap, the latter tracer delineating there a polygonal substructure. However, either tracer can circumvent gap junctions because they are plaque-shaped rather than complete, <b>circumferential</b> <b>belts.</b> Tight junctions, which retain a pentalaminar appearance after uranyl acetate block treatment, are restricted primarily to the endothelium of parenchymal capillaries and the epithelium of the choroid plexus. They form rows of extensive, overlapping occlusions of the interspace and are neither circumvented nor penetrated by peroxidase and lanthanum. These junctions are morphologically distinguishable from the "labile" pentalaminar appositions which appear or disappear according to the preparative method and which do not interfere with the intercellular movement of tracers. Therefore, the interspaces of the brain are generally patent, allowing intercellular movement of colloidal materials. Endothelial and epithelial tight junctions occlude the interspaces between blood and parenchyma or cerebral ventricles, thereby constituting a structural basis for the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers...|$|R
40|$|The widely {{accepted}} theory of buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial compressive loading emphasises {{the sensitivity of}} the buckling load to the presence of initial imperfections. These imperfections are conven-tionally taken to be minor geometric perturbations of a shell which is initially stress-free. The original aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the e!ect on the buckling load of imperfections in the form of local initial stress, which are probably more typical of practice than purely geometric ones. Experiments were performed on a vertical `melinexa cylinder of diameter & 0. 9 m and height & 0. 7 m, with radius/thickness ratio & 1800. The upper and lower edges of the cylinder were clamped to end discs by means of <b>circumferential</b> <b>belts</b> * an arrangement that allowed states of self-stress to be introduced to the shell readily by means of local `uplifta at the base. The upper disc was made su$ciently heavy to buckle the shell, and it was supported by a vertical central rod under screw control. Many buckling tests were performed. Surprisingly, the buckling loads were generally at the upper end of the range of fractions of the classical buckling load that have been found in many previous experimental studies. Even when the local uplift at the base caused a local `dimplea to be formed before the shell was loaded, the buckling load was relatively high. A surface-scanning apparatus allowed the geometric form of the shell to be monitored, and the progress of such a dimple to be followed; and it was foun...|$|R

For example, the <b>circumferential</b> contractile actin <b>belts</b> of adherens junctions contribute to cellular morphogenesis.

40|$|Cdc 42 {{is a key}} {{regulator}} {{of dynamic}} actin organization. However, {{little is known about}} how Cdc 42 -dependent actin regulation influences steady-state actin structures in differentiated epithelia. We employed inner ear hair-cell-specific conditional knockout to analyze the role of Cdc 42 in hair cells possessing highly elaborate stable actin protrusions (stereocilia). Hair cells of Atoh 1 -Cre;Cdc 42 flox/flox mice developed normally but progressively degenerated after maturation, resulting in progressive hearing loss particularly at high frequencies. Cochlear hair cell degeneration was more robust in inner hair cells than in outer hair cells, and began as stereocilia fusion and depletion, accompanied by a thinning and waving <b>circumferential</b> actin <b>belt</b> at apical junctional complexes (AJCs). Adenovirus-encoded GFP-Cdc 42 expression in hair cells and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging of hair cells from transgenicmice expressing a Cdc 42 -FRET biosensor indicated Cdc 42 presence and activation at stereociliary membranes and AJCs in cochlear hair cells. Cdc 42 -knockdown in MDCK cells produced phenotypes similar to those of Cdc 42 -deleted hair cells, including abnormal microvilli and disrupted AJCs, and downregulated actin turnover represented by enhanced levels of phosphorylated cofilin.

We report here that IP 3 /Ca 2 + signaling {{is involved in the}} let- 413 /dlg- 1 pathway for the establishment of epithelial cell polarity during the development in C. elegans. Using RNAi to interfere with let- 413 and dlg- 1 gene functions during post-embryogenesis, we discovered a requirement for LET- 413 and DLG- 1 in the polarization of the spermathecal cells. The spermatheca forms an accordion-like organ through which eggs must enter to complete the ovulation process. LET- 413 - and DLG- 1 -depleted animals exhibit failure of ovulation. Consistent with this phenotype, the assembly of the apical junction into a continuous belt fails and the PAR- 3 protein and microfilaments are no longer localized asymmetrically. All these defects can be suppressed by mutations in IPP- 5, an inositol polyphosphate 5 -phosphatase and in ITR- 1, an inositol triphosphate receptor, which both are supposed to increase the intracellular Ca 2 + level.
