5|$|Lee's audio cables met {{resistance}} at first, {{because most}} audio <b>cabling</b> {{at the time}} was zip cord provided by audio vendors for free.

5|$|There {{are several}} types of USB connector, {{including}} some that have been added while the specification progressed.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Noel Lee wanted {{to improve the}} sound quality from his home audio equipment. He didn't have very much money, so Lee experimented with ways to create a better sound by {{improving}} inexpensive <b>cabling.</b> At first he worked out of his family's apartment and later in his in-laws' garage, which they rented from family after moving to the Richmond district in 1978. Lee experimented with different widths, winding methods, and qualities of copper and insulation in audio cables to find {{an alternative to the}} zip cord audio vendors gave out for free. He compared different wire constructs, while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.|$|E
5|$|Lee was {{met with}} resistance, because the audio {{industry}} at the time didn't believe cables made an audible difference in the sound and wire {{was something that was}} normally provided for free. Lee did demonstrations at retailers comparing Monster cables to zip cord to convince consumers that expensive equipment was wasted on cheap wiring. Sales picked up as retailers saw the wiring as an opportunity for higher profit margins. This led Lee to provide incentives to retail salespeople to sell the <b>cabling,</b> rather than spend money on advertising. This led to criticisms that his business model creates aggressive salespeople.|$|E
5|$|The multi-coloured {{platform}} tiles on the Northern line were reconstructed in the 1920s {{in conjunction}} with an extension to Morden station. The tiles were carefully replicated in 2006 to replace the originals, which were in poor condition. The original C tiles dating from 1890 remain on the tunnel roofs of the Northern line platforms, albeit now covered over by the new cable-management system. The station was refurbished in 2007. The original maroon and cream tiling on the Bakerloo line platforms has been covered over. Because of {{the arrangement of the}} lighting, <b>cabling</b> and public address loudspeakers, {{it was not possible to}} arrange the new roundels at alternate ‘low’ and ‘high’ positions, all being at the lower level.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{there are}} three basic formats of USB connectors: the default or {{standard}} format intended for desktop or portable equipment (for example, on USB flash drives), the mini intended for mobile equipment (now deprecated except the Mini-B, which is used on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for low-profile mobile equipment (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and <b>cabling</b> requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical <b>cabling</b> in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the <b>cabling</b> to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|E

50|$|Breakout-style fiberoptic <b>cable</b> (also called {{breakout}} <b>cable</b> or fanout <b>cable),</b> is {{an optical}} fiber <b>cable</b> containing several jacketed simplex optical fibers packaged together inside an outer jacket.

5|$|Filming resumed {{two days}} later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences. The {{steamship}} fight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-forty-feet deck built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks—each holding three hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000lb.) of water—were used in the scene. Henry's house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice {{in front of a}} ship's propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they really were. Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first <b>cabling</b> the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana's college (as it had in Raiders of the Lost Ark).|$|E

40|$|Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is an {{advanced}} composite material with advantages of high strength and light weight, giving it great {{potential to be}} a new, reliable <b>cable</b> material. Ideal structures for CFRP <b>cables</b> are orthogonally loaded <b>cable</b> structures, where <b>cables</b> are loaded orthogonally or approximately orthogonally by external loads. Using CFRP <b>cables</b> in such structures, e. g. <b>cable</b> roofs and <b>cable</b> facades, has advantages over traditional steel <b>cable</b> structures. In order to demonstrate this point, two typical orthogonally loaded <b>cable</b> structures, i. e. a CFRP spoked wheel <b>cable</b> roof and a CFRP <b>cable</b> net façade, were investigated in a case study. Their mechanical properties and economies are compared with that of the steel counterparts. Results show that CFRP <b>cables</b> can effectively improve the mechanical and economical performances of orthogonally loaded <b>cable</b> structures; furthermore, the advantages of applying CFRP <b>cables</b> for <b>cable</b> net facade are more obvious than that for spoked wheel <b>cable</b> roof...|$|R
