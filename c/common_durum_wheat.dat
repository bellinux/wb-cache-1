40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) is a {{multifaceted}} disease caused by some species of Fusarium spp. A huge production of mycotoxins, mostly trichothecenes, often accompanied this disease. Amongst these toxic compounds, deoxynivalenol (DON) and its derivatives represent {{a major issue}} for human {{as well as for}} animal health and farming. <b>Common</b> and <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> are amongst the hosts of trichothecene-producing Fusaria. Differences in susceptibility to fungal infection and toxin accumulation occur in wheat cultivars. Recently, increasing incidence and severity of Fusarium infection and a higher DON accumulation in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> were observed in Italy, especially in Northern regions. In this study, we analyzed wheat yield, technological parameters, the incidence of Fusarium infection and DON content in kernel samples of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> coming from three locations of Southern Italy with different climatic conditions and grown during two seasons, with two methods of cultivation. Four different <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars prevalently cultivated in Southern Italian areas were chosen for this study. Our analysis showed the effects of environment and cultivar types on wheat productivity and key technological parameters for the quality level of the end-product, namely pasta. Notably, although a low rate of mycotoxin contamination in all study sites was assessed, an inverse relation emerged between fungal infection/DON production and <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> yield. Further, our study pinpoints the importance of environment conditions on several quality traits of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> grown under Mediterranean climate.

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum {{is one of}} the most {{dangerous}} disease of wheat crops worldwide. Trichothecene toxins are virulence factors during spike infection and degradation of plant cell wall components are visible at early stages of infection. In order to understand the contribution of cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) to virulence, we are following two approaches: the production of deletion mutants of some fungal CWDEs, and the production of transgenic wheat plants expressing inhibitors of CWDEs. By these approaches we obtained some fungal mutants knocked out for pectin methyl esterase (PME) activity and, on the other side, transgenic <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> plants expressing a PME inhibitor (PMEI) able to reduce the plant PME activity and to increase the methylesterification degree of cell wall pectins.

40|$|Grain protein {{concentration}} (GPC) affects wheat {{nutritional value}} and several critical parameters for bread and pasta quality. A gene designated Gpc-B 1, {{which is not}} functional in <b>common</b> and <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars, was recently identified in Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides. The functional allele of Gpc-B 1 improves nitrogen remobilization from the straw increasing GPC, but also shortens the grain filling period resulting in reduced grain weight in some genetic backgrounds. We developed isogenic lines for the Gpc-B 1 introgression in six hexaploid and two tetraploid wheat genotypes to evaluate its effects on bread-making and pasta quality. In common wheat, the functional Gpc-B 1 introgression was associated with significantly higher GPC, water absorption, mixing time and loaf volume, whereas in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat,</b> the introgression resulted in significant increases in GPC, wet gluten, mixing time, and spaghetti firmness, {{as well as a}} decrease in cooking loss. On the negative side, the functional Gpc-B 1 introgression was associated in some varieties with a significant reduction in grain weight, test weight, and flour yield and significant increases in ash concentration.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{information}} available in September 2002 this update seeks to incorporate the anticipated effects of the US Farm Bill {{on the development of}} agricultural markets in the EU, Eastern Europe and internationally for meat, cereals (including rice) and dairy products. The market situation for EU cereals is projected to continue to be favourable, with the exception of rye and barley. Severe drops in production levels - mainly driven by unfavourable climatic conditions in North America and Australia - have triggered a strong rally in market prices in the cereals sector. The impact of this however will be short term. An expansion of EU production of <b>common</b> <b>wheat,</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> and maize is projected, with increased yields more than off-setting the decline in area under cereals. EU cereal production is expected to reach 224. 7 million tonnes in 2009 (up from 213. 3 million tonnes in 2000 and a peak of 180 million tonnes in the pre CAP reform period). EU cereal exports are expected to rise above 30 million tonnes by 2005, reaching 32. 5 million tonnes in 2009. This export level will exceed the annual limit on subsidised exports {{largely as a result of}} unsubsidised exports of both <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> and <b>common</b> wheat. EU wheat exports in 2009 are expected to be around 33 % higher than in 2000 (19. 6 million tonnes compared to 14. 3 million tonnes). A steady growth in domestic and international demand for both <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> and <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> is anticipated over the next seven years, with the EU market situation therefore remaining tight. The EU's expansion of cereals production will largely be taken up by the domestic animal-feed industry. With reference to the impact of the US Farm Bill the potentially negative impact on wheat prices will, it is felt, be off-set in the medium term by more favourable market conditions than previously expected, although the price-depressing impact will be more marked for maize. A continued imbalance in the rice sector is anticipated, with the situation becoming critical after 2006. Comment: The figures contained in the report clearly show the extent to which CAP reform in the cereals sector is allowing an expansion of EU production and a resurgence in EU exports. It also shows the extent to which cereals-sector reform is enhancing the competitiveness of those meat-product exports which make extensive use of cereal-based animal feed. For example poultry exports are projected to peak and remain at around 1 million tonnes throughout the period from 2003 to 2009, a sharp increase from around 400, 000 tonnes in the pre-cereal-sector reform period. This highlights how the move to 'less trade-distorting' forms of support is having some rather strange trade effects. On {{the basis of}} information available in September [...] ...|$|R

Common wheats contained, on average, the highest level of dietary fiber [11. 5 - 18. 3 % of dry matter (dm) ], whereas einkorn and emmer wheats contained the lowest level (7. 2 - 12. 8 % of dm). Intermediate levels were measured in <b>durum</b> and spelt <b>wheats</b> (10. 7 - 15. 5 % of dm). Also, {{on the basis of the}} arabinoxylan levels in bran, the different wheat types could be divided this way, with ranges of 12. 7 - 22. 1 % of dm for common wheats, 6. 1 - 14. 4 % of dm for einkorn and emmer wheats, and 10. 9 - 13. 9 % of dm for <b>durum</b> and spelt <b>wheats.</b> On average, bran arabinoxylan made up ca. 29 % of the total dietary fiber content of wheat. In contrast to what was the case for bran, the arabinoxylan levels in flour were comparable between the different types of wheat. For wheat, in general, they varied between 1. 35 and 2. 75 % of dm. Einkorn, emmer, and <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> contained about half the level of mixed-linkage beta-glucan (0. 25 - 0. 45 % of dm) present in winter, spring, and spelt wheats (0. 50 - 0. 95 % of dm). All wheat types had Klason lignin, the levels of which varied from 1. 40 to 3. 25 % of dm. The arabinoxylan contents in bran and the dietary fiber contents in wholemeal were inversely and positively related with bran yield, respectively. Aqueous wholemeal extract viscosity, a measure for the level of soluble dietary fiber, was determined to large extent by the level of water-extractable arabinoxylan.

This work aims to studying a novel diagnostic technique for early detecting P. nodorum attack and infection progression in three Italian commercial varieties of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> Plants of these wheat varieties were inoculated in field with a spore suspension of P. nodorum. Different experimental conditions were used: P. nodorum was inoculated in plants at different growth stage (GS); GS 32 (Inf A) and GS 73 (milk development - Inf B). To consider natural contaminating mycoflora interference for the subsequent analysis, noninoculated controls, fungicide-treated (T) or non-treated (NT) were used.

The NE ToxA is produced by both pathogens and {{has been associated with}} the development of both tan spot and SNB when recognized by the wheat Tsn 1 gene. Most work to study these interactions has been conducted in common wheat, but little has been done in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> Here, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of a segregating biparental population indicated that the Tsc 2 -Ptr ToxB interaction plays a prominent {{role in the development of}} tan spot in durum. However, analysis of two biparental populations indicated that the Tsn 1 -ToxA interaction was not associated with the development of tan spot, but was strongly associated with the development of SNB. Pa. nodorum expressed ToxA at high levels in infected Tsn 1 plants, whereas ToxA expression in P. tritici-repentis was barely detectable, suggesting that the differences in disease levels associated with the Tsn 1 -ToxA interaction were due to differences in pathogen expression of ToxA. These and previous results together indicate that: (1) the effects of Tsn 1 -ToxA on tan spot in common wheat can range from nonsignificant to highly significant depending on the host genetic background; (2) Tsn 1 -ToxA is not a significant factor for tan spot development in durum wheat; and (3) Tsn 1 -ToxA plays a major role in SNB development in both <b>common</b> and <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> <b>Durum</b> and <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> breeders alike should strive to remove both Tsc 2 and Tsn 1 from their materials to achieve disease resistance...|$|R

Seventeen advanced <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> genotypes, two bread wheat cultivars and one <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivar (i. e. 20 genotypes and cultivars) were evaluated in two separate experiments (normal and limited irrigation) based on a randomized complete block design with four replications.

40|$|The {{phytic acid}} (PA), {{inorganic}} phosphorus (Pi), yellow pigment (YP), water soluble phenolics (WSPH) and free protein sulfhydryl groups (PSH) of 15 Triticum aestivum and 15 Triticum <b>durum</b> <b>wheats</b> grown at six different environments were evaluated for variability, intra- and inter- relations with agronomic traits. The most variable properties in bread wheat were YP and WSPH with coefficients of variation (CV) amounting to 14. 59 % and 14. 10 %, respectively, while in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> those were PSH and YP with CV of 17. 59 % and 15. 02 %, respectively. PA in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> showed the least variability (CV 3. 61 %). Among others, positive associations were obtained between WSPH and YP in bread and <b>durum</b> <b>wheat,</b> YP and PSH, WSPH and PSH, yield (YLD) and WSPH, YLD and PSH in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat,</b> while negative associations were recorded for PA and YP, PA and WSPH, YLD and antioxidants (YP and WSPH) in bread wheat, PA and antioxidants, PA and YLD in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat...</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite {{efforts at}} {{development}} and extension, the <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> industry in Western Australia remains small. In this study, {{data from a}} survey of Western Australian grain growers are used to characterise the use and perceptions of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> The main objective was to identify opportunities for extension to increase the level of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> adoption throughout the grain growing regions of Western Australia. Perceptions of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> characteristics were elicited along with other variables used to model the economic value of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> in the local cropping system. Logistic regression analysis found that perceptions of the yield potential were most influential, with almost half of respondents believing current <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties were unsuitable for Western Australian conditions. Perceptions of durum rust resistance were also significant in the adoption decision. Informational variables were shown to be of influence; however, critically, past use {{was not a significant}} predictor of future use. Before broad extension and promotion of the trialing of durum can be successful, efforts in Western Australia will need to focus on research to ensure that early adopters of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> can generate positive messages relating to yield and profitability. 2...|$|R
40|$|<b>Durum</b> <b>wheat</b> quality {{criteria}} continually evolve {{in response to}} market pressure and consumer preference. Increasing demand for specific <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> quality attributes for different endproducts requires development of more rapid objective means to grade and classify wheat parcels {{on the basis of}} processing potential. Near-infrared spectroscopy and image analysis have considerable potential for rapid objective wheat grading and classification. Preprocessing (debranning before milling) enhances <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> milling performance. Surface discolourations, major factors in grading <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> because of negative impact on semolina colour and presence of visible specks, will become less important if preprocessing becomes more accepted by <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> millers. Semolina granulation has become finer to accommodate large high capacity pasta presses and Polymatik presses. The move to finer granulation, particularly when protein content is specified, makes hard vitreous kernel content of less importance to <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> millers. Intense competition in the pasta industry has made pasta colour, an important aesthetic factor in consumer choice, more universally important. That, combined with a trend to higher semolina extraction rates, will require plant breeders to develop <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties with higher levels of yellow pigment and lowe...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{experiment was}} carried out with five Bulgarian and five foreign <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars. The aim of the experiment {{was to determine the}} chemical content and grain technological quality of some Bulgarian and foreign <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars grown under the agriecological conditions of Southern Bulgaria. The Vazhod cultivar proved to give the highest <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> grain yield, followed by Beloslava cultivar. Out of the foreign <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars the Durumko was notable for its higher productivity. The crude protein content in the grain was highest in Zagorka, Yavor and Yukon.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Previous {{research}} on <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> es-tablished {{the relationships between}} kernel shape and semolina yield and classified <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> growing areas as agroclimatic areas. The aim of this work was to check whether kernel shape and semolina yield were modified when <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties were grown in different agroclimatic areas. METHODS. Grain samples (n = 240) were analysed of 15 <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties grown in trials conducted by the Rome Experimental Institute for Cereal Re-search during 1998 and 1999; trial locations were grouped in 8 agroclimatic areas. For each sample dif-ferent measurements for describing kernel shape were determined by image analysis procedures, plu...|$|R
40|$|Puroindolines A (Pin-A) and B (Pin-B) are the {{principal}} determinant factors of endosperm texture in common wheat and, as a consequence, a main determinant in end product quality. They are encoded by the Pina-D 1 and Pinb-D 1 loci on chromosome 5 DS and, therefore, are absent in <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum). In order to introduce puroindolines A and B into <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> through allosyndetic recombination, the 5 D(5 B) substitution line of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> cv. Langdon was crossed with <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> line Cappelli M lacking the Ph 1 locus on chromosome 5 BL. Amongst the resulting progeny, 11 F 6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) with soft kernels were crossed as the male parent with <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> cv.

30|$|Being Italy one of {{the leading}} <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> {{producers}} in the EU, as well as a substantial user of raw <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> for transformation into products (semolina and, above all, pasta) which represent a major component of traditional Italian food exports, the assessment of the consequences for the <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> sector is of particular interest. EU interventions for <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> have always been associated with and strongly oriented towards “traditional” production areas. However, with the new reform, the direct support will completely change. Consequently, there is an urgent need to understand how firms working in these production systems can keep maintaining their activity and the present working levels.|$|R
