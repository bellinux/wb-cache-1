5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a <b>check-in</b> <b>staff</b> doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E

50|$|In June 2006, {{a survey}} by market {{researchers}} islandopinion.com showed that Aurigny {{was the most popular}} airline which served Guernsey. On 21 June 2007, Aurigny got permission from its sole shareholder, the States of Guernsey, to raise a private loan to purchase two new ATR 72-500 aircraft which entered service in March 2009. Aurigny celebrated 40 years in operation in 2008. It was voted 4th-best short-haul airline in a poll published in the consumer magazine Which?. In a survey of 30,000 members the magazine examined 71 airlines and asked readers to rate each carrier for standards of <b>check-in,</b> cabin <b>staff,</b> cleanliness, food and entertainment. It has been rated the world's best short-haul airline in more recent surveys.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{increasing}} trend towards more streamlined checking-in processes, whereby passengers can bypass or reduce the time in queues at the <b>staffed</b> <b>check-in</b> counters. This may involve passengers checking in online before arriving at the airport or using an airline's self-service check-in kiosks at the airport. Some airports have curbside check-in, where passengers can check in their bags to an airline representative before entering the terminal and then proceeding directly to security.|$|R

50|$|The Compass Centre was {{originally}} conceived as speculative offices for Lynton plc, {{which was the}} property development division of Heathrow Airport Ltd. British Airways was a prospective but not necessarily a sole tenant. The airline decided to consolidate its scattered operations into the Compass Centre. In August 1992 on-site construction began. The building was completed 15 months later. When London Heathrow Terminal 5 opened on 27 March 2008, British Airways staff, including crew <b>check-in</b> <b>staff,</b> relocated from the Compass Centre to Terminal 5. A refurbishment of the head office was completed in September 2009, after Heathrow Airport Limited (then BAA) moved into the building.|$|E
50|$|The {{check-in}} {{process at}} airports enables passengers {{to check in}} luggage onto a plane and to obtain a boarding pass. When presenting at the check-in counter, a passenger will provide evidence of right to travel, such as a ticket, visa or electronic means. Each airline provides facilities for passengers to check in their luggage, except their carry-on bags. This may be {{by way of a}}irline-employed staff at check-in counters at airports or through an agency arrangement or by way of a self-service kiosk. The luggage is weighed and tagged, and then placed on a conveyor that usually feeds the luggage into the main baggage handling system. The luggage goes into the aircraft's cargo hold. The <b>check-in</b> <b>staff</b> then issues each passenger with a boarding pass.|$|E
40|$|Smart {{lighting}} {{for commercial}} buildings should consider both the overall energy usage and the occupants' individual lighting preferences. This paper describes a study of using data mining techniques to attain this goal. The lighting application embraces the concept of Office Hotelling, where employees are not assigned permanent office spaces, but instead a temporary workplace is selected for each <b>check-in</b> <b>staff.</b> Specifically, taking check-in workers' light requirements as inputs, a collective classification strategy was deployed, aiming at simultaneously predicting the dimming levels of the shared luminaries in an open office sharing light. This classification information, together with the energy usages for possible office plans, provides us with lighting scenarios that can both meet users' lighting comfort and save energy consumption. We compare our approach with four other commonly used lighting control strategies. Our experimental study shows that the developed learning model can generate lighting policies that not only maximize the occupants' lighting satisfaction, but also substantially improve energy savings. Importantly, our data driven method is able to create an optimal lighting scenario with execution time that is suitable for a real-time responding system. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Abstract/ Summary Customer {{self-service}} technology such as self-check-in kiosks {{has been}} implemented successfully at airports. Travellers {{seem to have}} accepted this technology and have {{become familiar with the}} concept. Self-service kiosks are currently also introduced in some American, European and Asian hotels. However, New Zealand hotels have not yet generally taken advantage of this technology. This study researches hotel managers’ views on the advantages and concerns of these self-service kiosks and their impact on customers and the hotel’s front-office operations. In addition, the managers’ concerns, related to introducing the kiosks are discussed. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain the perspectives of managers from New Zealand’s four and five star hotels regarding the impacts of self-service technologies (SSTs) on the hotel’s front-office operations and guests. A qualitative, case study research methodology was used in this research, to understand the managers’ perceptions and impacts of the self-service technologies. The research was conducted through ten semi-structured interviews and common themes which were found to be important to these participants were discussed. The research highlighted that managers had certain reservations towards SSTs, which may explain why they have not yet been implemented in New Zealand. The main reasons expressed were that personal service is vital in four and five star hotels, especially for leisure guests who like the friendly interactions with employees. Additionally, the costs to implement and interface the kiosks are significant and need adequate justification either through adding value for the guests or reducing costs for the hotel. There also may be some difficulty in interfacing the kiosks with each hotel property’s front-office system and the local New Zealand banking system. Finding the appropriate kiosks for each property would be imperative for SSTs to be a success. Managers believed that there are significant benefits associated with introducing SSTs in hotels. For the customer, managers felt that kiosks enabled benefits such as allowing check-in efficiency, additional guest-control, customised service interactions, choice of communication language for foreign travellers and easy, standardised service interactions. Managers felt that kiosks would predominantly benefit corporate and regular travellers, due to the efficiency and speedy self-check-in process. For the hotel, managers viewed kiosks as being able to lower labour costs, alleviating pressure on <b>check-in</b> <b>staff</b> during busy periods, enabling easier data access for customer-profiling and improving revenues through customised up-selling. Also the introduction of kiosks is predicted by some managers to revolutionise the hotel lobby and evolve employee roles, where service staff may greet guests on the lobby floor rather than from behind the reception desk, and spend more time creating closer relationships, adding to the guests’ hotel experience and being more customer-orientated. This study in New Zealand found that the majority of managers supported the introduction of self-check-in kiosks as an alternative value offering, as long as the kiosks were introduced as complimentary to service staff. Well-trained and friendly staff, in their opinion, would always be vital for guest satisfaction and reducing staff numbers would lower the hotel’s service standards...|$|E
