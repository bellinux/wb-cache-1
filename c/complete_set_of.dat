5|$|The set was Haydn's first <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> quartets {{since the}} Opus 33 set of 1781. While the Opus 33 set was apt for broad public consumption, the Opus 50 set is more serious and experimental. It is {{perhaps because of}} the Opus 50's {{intellectual}} character that other sets among Haydn's mature quartets have received more attention from performers.|$|E

40|$|Mutually {{unbiased}} bases (MUBs) {{are important}} in quantum information theory. While constructions <b>of</b> <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> d + 1 MUBs in C-d are known when d is a prime power, it is unknown if such <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> exist in non-prime power dimensions. It has been conjectured that <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> MUBs only exist in if a maximal <b>set</b> <b>of</b> mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) of side length d also exists. There are several constructions (Roy and Scott 2007 J. Math. Phys. 48 072110; Paterek, Daki? and Brukner 2009 Phys. Rev. A 79 012109) <b>of</b> <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> MUBs from specific types of MOLS, which use Galois fields to construct the vectors of the MUBs. In this paper, two known constructions of MUBs (Alltop 1980 IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 26 350 - 354; Wootters and Fields 1989 Ann. Phys. 191 363 - 381), both of which use polynomials over a Galois field, are used to construct <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> MOLS in the odd prime case. The MOLS come from the inner products of pairs of vectors in the MUBs...|$|R

5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> these molecules is called the metabolome.
