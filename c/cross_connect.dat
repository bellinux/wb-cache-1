50|$|An {{outgoing}} marker, being {{a complex}} control instrument {{with a short}} holding time, had the additional task of decoding the first three digits of the seven-digit telephone number to determine the routing to a distant exchange. A <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> field had a terminal for each office code, which was cross connected to the coil of a route relay. When the office code point was grounded, it operated the route relay, whose contacts were wired in another <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> or data field. Thus, the outgoing marker could select two office frames to search for idle trunks to the destination, and had pulsing information for the sender. The sender sent the telephone number to the distant terminating office. When one office was constructed, retired, or changed, staff in other offices received a Routing Letter, ordering the <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> fields to be changed at a particular date and time, usually after midnight, to accommodate {{the change in the}} network. Translation <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> fields such as these {{were among the first to}} be converted from soldered terminals to wire wrap.|$|E
