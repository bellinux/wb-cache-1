40|$|Issues with fiber {{fault in}} fiber {{to the home}} (FTTH) <b>customer</b> <b>access</b> <b>network</b> often become a {{challenge}} to the network service providers. The most important issues troubled the service providers and customer premises are regarding the service reliability and safety. Conventionally, optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) is used to detect the fiber fault and address the failure location in FTTH upwardly from customer sides toward central office (CO). However, OTDR can only display a measurement result of a testing line in a time and also time and cost misspend. By looking at the stated issues, a simple, attractive and user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) is developed for Centralized Failure Detection System (CFDS) based on MATLAB programming in this study. The developed program will be installed with optical line terminal (OLT) at the CO to centralized monitoring each optical fiber line’s status and identifying the failure location that occurs in the drop region of FTTH downwardly from CO towards customer sides. CFDS is interfaced with OTDR to accumulate every network testing result to be displayed on a single computer screen for further data analyzing.

40|$|Overview: Since {{the early}} 2000 s and the rapid {{rise of the}} Internet and {{broadband}} as platforms for the digital economy and online society, successive Australian Governments have grappled {{with the issue of}} how to achieve investment in next generation broadband networks capable of supporting future user needs. In parallel with this question, they have had to grapple with how this can be done in a manner that maximises competition recognising that much of the telecommunications <b>customer</b> <b>access</b> <b>network,</b> the last mile connection to individual customers which needed to be upgraded, has strong monopoly characteristics. This means that the firm controlling that network has significant market power, in terms of denying access to would-be competitors and potentially favouring its downstream operations over those of would-be competitors who gained access but had to compete with it. In Australia this meant Telstra, which owns the majority of access infrastructure. These issues would be compounded in the rollout of next generation broadband because if the logical upgrade path was followed, to fibre-to-the-node (FTTN), Telstra’s market power would be further enhanced. This is because if FTTN is to operate at optimal levels it eliminates the ability of competitors to operate their own DSLAM equipment from Telstra’s exchanges and it would generally not be cost-effective to install competing equipment in suburban nodes. This issue has been further compounded by the introduction of vectored VDSL 2 for use with FTTN networks as optimal performance from vectoring can only be achieved if the lines servicing customers are operated by a single provider, who can manage interference problems.

40|$|Wireline {{telecommunications}} infrastructure in the <b>customer</b> <b>access</b> <b>network</b> or CAN {{is undergoing a}} veritable technological and commercial revolution. The paired-copper CAN is being modernised with optical fibre deployed ever closer to customers, culminating soon with fibre-to-the-home networks or some variant thereof. Although bandwidth ceases to be a scarce commodity, the underlying natural monopoly {{will most likely be}} strengthened. National competition policy desires open access to multiple service providers yet commercial pressure calls for closure. This has been the recent experience with the hybrid fibre coaxial networks delivering pay television and Internet access. This research asks the question: What are the factors that prevent open access to the broadband services of next generation wireline infrastructure? How can these obstacles be overcome? A particular focus is given to non-price considerations which come to the fore due to the unique strategic and technological characteristics of optical fibre in the access network. The methodological approach involves data gathering via three case studies - that of the Telstra/Foxtel pay television network, the TransACT broadband network and fibre-to-the-home networks in general. Although the ultimate focus is on the research question above, these cases are discussed in a holistic way with consideration of a number of contextual factors. The research also examines the relationship between the concepts of ‘open access’ and ‘network neutrality’, visiting the concept of ‘common carriage’ in doing so. Several findings are reached that illuminate the field of telecommunications access regulation as applied to infrastructure capable of delivering truly next generation broadband services. Since 1993, our politicians have only paid lip service to the importance of competition and have deferred {{to the demands of the}} dominant builder of {{telecommunications infrastructure}}. From the viewpoints of end-users and access seekers, the access regime is found to be incapable of dealing with the technical and commercial bottlenecks arising from optical fibre in the CAN. It is concluded that communication between users should be recognised as the prime purpose of telecommunications and that the regulatory regime should not reward discriminatory practices detracting from the development of a networked information economy. It is also concluded that dominant players should never be rewarded with access holidays which could otherwise entrench market dominance through the creation of new bottlenecks. Access regulation is ill-equipped to cope with optical fibre in the CAN until it also recognizes the strategic potential of such infrastructure...|$|E

This set up {{will be used to}} conduct user identity traffic interception tests. In real-world Point-to-Point (PPP) dial-up connections customers use modems to dial-in to their Internet Service provider (ISP) and <b>access</b> <b>network</b> resources. To initiate dial-up a customer enters their username and password then dials-in to their ISP via a specified telephone number. The dial-up request is directed to an ISP's <b>Network</b> <b>Access</b> Server (NAS). The NAS will not allow the <b>customer</b> to <b>access</b> <b>network</b> resources until they confirm the customer has an account. The NAS contacts a RADIUS server to request authentication of the customer and upon confirming the customer username and password are valid, the customer is allowed to complete their PPP connection. Typically the customer is also allocated an IP address by the RADIUS server. In this report we simulate a user machine initiating a PPP connection to an ISP NAS and having their username and password authenticated by a RADIUS server, upon which they are allowed to <b>access</b> <b>network</b> resources through the NAS. The configuration and set up were kept simple and the accounting feature of RADIUS was not used as it is not important to our aim...|$|R

40|$|Termination of a {{telephone}} call can only be realized by the network operator of the receiving party. For this reason, the markets for fixed and mobile call termination are regulated ex-ante including price control. To determine the costs of call termination the current regulatory regime considers only {{those parts of the}} network where customers compete for jointly used resources (mainly bandwidth). Therefore, the critical border is the "demarcation point" between the end <b>customer</b> dedicated <b>access</b> <b>network</b> and the aggregation network where customers compete for bandwidth. In addition to the extent of the overall network cost to be considered (depending on the location of the demarcation point) the traffic share of the voice termination service (which determines how much of the relevant cost is borne by voice termination) compared to all the other services sharing the same NGN/ NGA network needs to be taken into account. We analyse the cost effects with a cost model, which considers the part of the <b>access</b> <b>network</b> from the MPoP to the demarcation point, where the dedicated (<b>access)</b> <b>network</b> begins, in detail. This allows us to compare the impact of different demarcation points and service scenarios on the level of voice termination rates for three NGA architectures (FTTH/P 2 P, FTTH/PON and FTTC). We considered double and triple play service packages and ran sensitivities on data usage. In addition, we calculated termination cost for three different demarcation point locations in the case of FTTH/PON.

40|$|The {{provision}} of Internet access to large numbers {{has traditionally been}} {{under the control of}} operators, who have built closed <b>access</b> <b>networks</b> for connecting <b>customers.</b> As the <b>access</b> <b>network</b> (i. e. the last mile to the customer) is generally the most expensive part of the network because of the vast amount of cable required, many operators have been reluctant to build <b>access</b> <b>networks</b> in rural areas. There are problems also in urban areas, as incumbent operators may use various tactics to make it difficult for competitors to enter the market. Open access networking, where the goal is to connect multiple operators and other types of service providers to a shared network, changes the way in which networks are used.
