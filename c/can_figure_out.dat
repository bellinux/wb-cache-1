In addition, Zoo Atlanta has a touch-screen computer where their two Sumatran orangutans play games. Scientists hope the data they collect will help researchers learn about socialising patterns, such as whether the apes learn behaviours through trial and error or by mimicry, and point to new conservation strategies.|$|E

An out of control Mulder demands to know how she got there, and is escorted out by security but later calms down and meets with Dr. Daly (Jay Brazeau), who reveals that no one <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how she got there or what's wrong with her. He tells Mulder and Mrs. Scully that she has a living will that dictates she be taken off of life support when her condition falls to specific criteria. At Scully's bedside, Mulder meets her older sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw). Scully has a vision of sitting in a boat, attached by rope to a dock where Mulder and Melissa stand, and nurse Owens behind them. Frohike visits Scully and sneaks out her medical chart, which the Lone Gunmen later investigate. Byers finds that Scully's blood contains branched DNA that may have been used for identification but now is inactive and nothing more than a poisonous waste product in her system.|$|E

When Blue Beetle is in captivity, Max injects him with an unknown substance. Tortured, he remembers Max's existence as the man who killed Ted Kord and destroyed his legacy. Jaime eventually manages to send a signal {{to the rest of the}} JLI to lead them to Max's headquarters. He breaks out of the laboratory and attacks Max, who, having discovered the weaknesses of the Blue Scarab, zaps Jaime with a special beam and, just as the JLI arrives, shoots him in the head with a blaster, apparently killing him in the same manner as his predecessor.|$|E

And legions of undead will be re-killed in surprisingly easy fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was critical of}} the episode's intricacy, writing, [...] "'The Amazing Maleeni' is a convoluted episode that ultimately lacks verve and excitement. Even if one <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what is going on, there remains {{the question of how}} much, or even whether, to care." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two stars out of five. The two noted that, had the episode used real magic tricks instead of [...] "resort to CGI, the episode would have been much more than a simple [...] "cheat". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the fact that the explanation behind Maleeni turning his head around 360 degrees was never satisfactorily explained. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris compared the episode's plot to the 1999 movie Arlington Road, noting that while [...] "the scheme is fun to watch while it unfolds, [...] in the end, it's not credible; too much is left open to chance for it really to happen." ...|$|E

500|$|Scott {{noted that}} {{it was easier to}} reach correct puzzle solutions, with clues being given out [...] "at a very {{reasonable}} rate". He saw this as the game's largest improvement upon previous Ace Attorney titles, which he said relied on trial and error; he had considered this the weakest point in the series, and something that needed to be changed. On the other hand, Walker said that the player often <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what a contradiction is going to be before the game lets them prove it, and the player might come up with legitimate ideas that the game does not accept. He also wished that the life bar could be filled up in court. Cole criticized how relevant evidence sometimes is not accepted, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a certain order, but appreciated the game's larger focus on courtroom sessions over investigations. Thomas and the reviewers at Famitsu criticized the lack of new gameplay features, although the former thought that fans of the series would be fine with it. Scott acknowledged that the gameplay only is what is expected from the series, but did not find a problem with it due to the focus on narrative over gameplay. Moriarty said that while Trials and Tribulations is a good game in its own right, he wished that Capcom would make some changes to the gameplay or presentation, to avoid the series becoming [...] "overdone, played-out, and tired".|$|E

[...] But on his first drive, Grogan could only lead them to the 37-yard line, and they decided to punt rather than risk a 55-yard field goal attempt. The Bears then marched 72 yards in 11 plays, moving the ball inside the Patriots' 10-yard line. New England kept them out of the end zone, but Butler kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half to give Chicago a 23–3 halftime lead.|$|E

According to the press cuttings that I am currently looking at, he was the Captain of the Empire XI in 1941 and C.B. Clarke, the West Indies Test bowler was also in the team, along with H.P.
