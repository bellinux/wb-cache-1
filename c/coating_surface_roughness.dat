The TiN coatings were formed using Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) sputtering process. N 2 pressure, Argon pressure and turntable speed were selected as process variables. <b>Coating</b> <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> {{as an important}} coating characteristic was characterized using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) equipment. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is {{used to determine the}} significant factors influencing resultant TiN coating roughness. Based on that, a quadratic polynomial model equation represented the process variables and coating roughness was developed. The result indicated that the actual coating roughness of validation runs data fell within the 90 % prediction interval (PI) and the residual errors were very low. The findings from this study suggested that Argon pressure, quadratic term of N 2 pressure, quadratic term of turntable speed, interaction between N 2 pressure and turntable speed, and interaction between Argon pressure and turntable speed influenced the TiN <b>coating</b> <b>surface</b> <b>roughness...</b>|$|E

R Courtenay (New Zealand). The effects of dipping time, preheat temperature and particle size distribution on coating thickness and surface finish were investigated. Consistent trends in coating thickness growth with dipping time were obtained for both nylon- 11 and polyethylene powders with increases in coating thickness with preheat temperature. For the same preheat temperature, the lower melting point of polyethylene results in thicker coatings compared to those of nylon- 11. There is a negligible change in the coating thickness for sieved powders compared to that for unsieved powders. A pre-heat temperatures of between 240 degrees C and 300 degrees C is necessary to achieve an acceptable surface finish with both nylon- 11 and polyethylene powders. To minimize errors in achieving the desired coating thickness, dipping times shorter than 2 s are not recommended. The use of graphs of coating thickness versus dipping time in combination with the <b>coating</b> <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> plots presented in this paper enable the optimal choice of pre-heat temperature and dipping time to achieve acceptable surface finish.

TMP paper dried in {{superheated steam}} has a slightly higher surface roughness, by about 0. 5 $ mu$m at a roughness around 8 $ mu$m. This difference decreases with drying fluid temperature.

Superheated steam drying reduces substantially the linting propensity of TMP paper, by about 30 %- 60 % depending on the criteria used. Improved lignin softening by higher web temperature from the beginning of drying in superheated steam drying is believed an important mechanism in improving bonding of surface fines and short fibre fragments. The Z-direction bond strength of TMP paper after surface treatment with water is about 20 % higher for sheets dried in steam. Time for water absorption is 100 %- 150 % longer for superheated steam dried TMP paper and contact angle of water is also substantially increased. Superheated steam drying substantially reduces the volume of micropores of diameter 0. 2 - 0. 6 $ mu$m while having no significant effect on larger pores. Thus superheated steam drying affects only the pore structure of the micronetwork. The decrease of micropore volume in superheated steam drying is associated with an increase of Z-direction bond strength and a decrease of light scattering coefficient...|$|E

Here we investigate {{the influence of}} surface roughness and local turbulence on coated-wall flow tube experiments for gas uptake and kinetic studies. According to laminar boundary theory and considering the specific flow conditions in a coated-wall flow tube, we suggest using a critical height δc to evaluate turbulence effects {{in the design and}} analysis of coated-wall flow tube experiments. When a coating thickness εmax is larger than δc, the roughness elements of the coating may cause local turbulence and result in overestimation of the real uptake coefficient (γ). We collect εmax values in previous coated-wall flow tube studies and evaluate their roughness effects using the criterion of δc. In most cases, the roughness doesn't generate turbulence and has negligible effects. When turbulence is generated, the calculated effective uptake coefficient (γeff) can bear large difference compared to the real uptake coefficient (γ). Their difference becomes less for gas reactants with lower uptake (i. e., smaller γ), or/and for a smaller ratio of the coating thickness εmax/R 0 to the flow tube radius R 0, (εmax/R 0). On the other hand, the critical height δc can also be adjusted by optimizing flow tube configurations and operating conditions (i. e., tube diameter, length and flow velocity), to ensure not only an unaffected laminar flow pattern but also a flexible residence time of gas reactants in flow tube reactors...|$|E

The surfaceswith a specific amount of UV coatings showed a new formed topography which influences the reflection of light. The changes in topography were evaluated through <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> parameters which showed a decline of surfaceroughness with tht additional ammount of glossy and matte coatings. The obtained and calculated correlations showthere is a high correlation between <b>coating</b> ammount and <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> change and gloss for the glossy UVcoating. The results for the matte UV coatings showed lower correlation for the gloss and <b>surface</b> <b>roughness...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an attempt to coat optical flats and replace echelle {{gratings}} with ion-deposited SiC are reported. Deposition was performed by bombarding a SiC target with an ion beam angled 45 deg relative to the target. Half the target was covered with stainless steel to furnish a comparison opportunity. After precleaning SiC coatings of 300 - 2200 A thickness were deposited. The specimens had previously been coated with either Au or Al or were left blank. Reflectance and diffraction data were taken of the finished flats and gratings. The SiC-coated flats performed as well as uncoated flats while the echelles exhibited deteriorating performance with increasing coating thickness. Further studies are indicated on the effect of <b>coating</b> thickness on <b>surface</b> <b>roughness...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} be able to design medical {{implants}} that elicit a specific tissue response, extensive knowledge of the interaction of an implant material with its surrounding tissue is essential. The surface characteristics of the material, as well as the cellular characteristics of the tissue govern the precise interaction of a material with the tissue. Although many implant materials show a favorable bone response, the mechanisms involved in this bone response are still poorly understood. The studies described in this thesis are aimed at elucidating the mechanisms by which RF magnetron sputtered calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings and implant <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> affect the bone response. The studies showed that CaP coating crystallinity has a clear effect on osteogenic cell growth and differentiation. Amorphous CaP coatings inhibited cell growth and differentiation. This was probably due to the extensive dissolution shown by these coatings. On the other hand, crystalline CaP coatings enhanced osteogenic cell growth and differentiation compared to titanium substrates. <b>Surface</b> <b>roughness</b> also affected the osteogenic cells, but not as much as the effect of the presence of a crystalline coating. In subsequent studies, the effect of crystalline CaP <b>coating</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> on osteogenic cell attachment, spreading and integrin expression was studied. We found that differences in substrate characteristics can affect cell attachment and spreading, although the precise effect was cell-type dependent. Integrin expression was also influenced by the substrate surface, but the effect was limited. We have to notice that different methods to generate CaP coatings will lead to coatings with completely different characteristics, which can markedly influence the tissue reaction. Further, different methods of measuring <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> can result in different data. A standardized method for measuring and describing <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> will have to be developed. Also, complete characterization in terms of chemical composition, crystallinity, but also method of manufacturing is very important when developing and reporting about CaP coated implants. The goal of these and subsequent studies is to get more insight into the bone-biomaterial response. This will enable the manufacturing of tailor-made implants that generate a predicted tissue respons...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} total joint {{arthroplasty}} {{is to reduce}} pain and restore function. Its success depends on {{the formation of a}} new bone that stabilizes the prosthesis. The proposed solution for this important problem is to have bio-coated implant surfaces which are more conductive to bone growth. Additionally, collagen has long been used as a matrix for medical applications, because of its biocompatibility and adaptability. In this study, a test method for measuring the tensile adhesion strength of collagen to titanium alloy and calcium phosphate <b>coated</b> <b>surfaces</b> with different <b>roughness</b> values was developed, in order to evaluate how well the collagen adheres to the metallic and bio-coated surfaces. A precision motion system was used to stretch gels that were adherent to the plate surfaces. The tests were done in DMEM solution. The adhesive strength between the collagen gel and plate was significantly higher for calcium phosphate <b>coated</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Adhesive strength was highest in the sample with the highest roughness value...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{commercially pure}} {{titanium}} (Cp-Ti) was micro arc oxidized in an alkaline solution {{by using a}} bipolar power supply capable of applying square voltage pulses. In the oxidation process, voltage level and numbers {{of positive and negative}} pulses were varied, and the effect of such parameters on surface and cross sectional morphology of the coatings were evaluated. In characterization works, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), coating thickness measurements and <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> measurements were employed. Results generally showed that <b>coating</b> thickness and <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> greatly depend on the voltage level in that higher voltage levels give thicker coatings and rougher surfaces. When the number of successive positive voltage pulses is increased, more uniform surface appearance with well distributed and equal sized micro pores are obtained up to 400 V of positive voltage. When the oxidation is performed for positive and negative pulse numbers of 10 - 1 at higher voltage levels, the average pore size of the coating thickness increased and the number of pores decreased...|$|R
40|$|Porous and nanostructured TiO 2 {{coatings}} {{with different}} Ca, P contents were prepared on titanium by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in a Ca and P containing electrolyte at different current densities. The surface morphologies and microstructure of the coatings were observed by {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). Phase compositions of the coatings were characterized using X―ray diffraction (XRD). Simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion tests were conducted to evaluate the apatite forming ability and bioactivity of coatings. The results reveal that the PEO coatings mainly consist of anatase and rutile phases, their surfaces exhibit grains of about 10 ― 100 nm in size and pores less than 10 &mu;m in diameter. The <b>surface</b> grains, <b>coating</b> thicknesses, <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> and Ca, P contents of the coatings all increase {{with the increase of}} the applied current density during PEO process. The as―prepared PEO coatings with high Ca and P contents could induce apatite formation after immersed in SBF for 14 d, indicating its good bioactivity. However, PEO coatings with low Ca and P contents or heat―treated coatings are bio―inert. The Ca, P contents of the PEO coatings and its crystallization state play key roles in inducing apatite formation in SBF...|$|R
