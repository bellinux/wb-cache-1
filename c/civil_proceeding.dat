25|$|The Waite Court {{was several}} times {{called upon to}} decide {{issues related to the}} {{interaction}} of the state and federal criminal systems. In Coleman v. Tennessee (1878), the Court held that a state court had no jurisdiction to try a Civil War-era murder by a soldier, which at the time was subject to courts martial jurisdiction (and where in fact the defendant had previously been tried and convicted). But, in Robb v. Connolly (1884), the Court permitted a state court to issue a writ of habeas corpus against the state officer who administers extradition to the state from other states. And, in Kurtz v. Moffitt (1885), the Court held that—as habeas is a <b>civil</b> <b>proceeding</b> and the federal diversity jurisdiction removal statute required an amount in controversy—state habeas proceedings could not be removed to federal court under this provision. Natal v. Louisiana (1887) declined to issue a writ of supersedes, finding that the state's initiation of a civil suit while a writ of error was pending before the Supreme Court was not contemptuous.|$|E

40|$|This thesis named "The {{costs of}} civil dispute proceeding" {{focuses on the}} costs of <b>civil</b> dispute <b>proceeding.</b> After a general {{introduction}} of the topic, the costs of <b>civil</b> dispute <b>proceeding</b> are divided into two chapters - the costs that arise prior {{to the beginning of}} the proceeding and the costs that arise after the proceeding begins. The main chapters of the first part of this thesis are chapters dealing with court fee and lawyer fee. The second part of this thesis concentrates on the difference between paying and compensating the costs of proceeding, the issue of deciding on costs, together with the right of court not to compensate the costs of proceeding as they should be compensated under normal circumstances. The final chapter gives a comparison of the costs of <b>civil</b> dispute <b>proceeding</b> between Czech legislation and the legislation of the states that share borders with the Czech Republic and finally it describes shortly the costs of proceeding at the European Court of Justice...|$|R

CDL's lawyer advised against attempting to prosecute Penthouse for obscenity and instead recommended a <b>civil</b> <b>proceeding,</b> because the film would not be placed against the Miller test.

The government {{argued that the}} issue is not the court's business and that courts could consider individual habeas corpus petitions from prisoners who have been detained. [...] "That argument is without merit and, indeed, dangerous," [...] wrote Judge Forrest. [...] "Habeas petitions (which take years to be resolved following initial detention) are reviewed under a 'preponderance of the evidence' standard (versus the criminal standard of `beyond a reasonable doubt') by a single judge in a <b>civil</b> <b>proceeding,</b> not a jury of twelve citizens in a criminal proceeding which can only return a guilty verdict if unanimous." [...] "If only habeas review is available to those detained…even U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, core constitutional rights available in criminal matters would simply be eliminated," [...] she wrote.

2500|$|Second, was the {{relevance}} of Mitchell's reliance on a criminal statute in a <b>civil</b> <b>proceeding</b> seeking prior restraint. There was Supreme Court precedent that lent support {{to the idea that}} bans on the publication of information by the press to be unconstitutional. [...] In 1907 Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the [...] "main purpose" [...] of the First Amendment" [...] was [...] "to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments". In 1931 the Court wrote that only the narrowest circumstances—such as publication of the dates of departure of ships during wartime—were permissibly restrained. [...] In 1969 John Marshall Harlan II wrote the Supreme Court [...] "rejected all manner of prior restraint on publication". [...] This second line of reasoning made it seem the statute should only be dealt with in passing, making the case a First Amendment one and the relief the government wanted—a bar on publication—unavailable.|$|E
