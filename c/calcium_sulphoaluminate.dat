40|$|This paper reviews {{progresses}} {{on the use}} of alkali-activated cements for stabilization/solidification {{of hazardous}} and radioactive wastes. Alkali-activated cements consist of an alkaline activator and cementing components, such as blast furnace slag, coal fly ash, phosphorus slag, steel slag, metakaolin, etc., or a combination of two or more of them. Properly designed alkali-activated cements can exhibit both higher early and later strengths than conventional portland cement. The main hydration product of alkali-activated cements is calcium silicate hydrate (Csingle bondSsingle bondH) with low Ca/Si ratios or aluminosilicate gel at room temperature; Csingle bondSsingle bondH, tobmorite, xonotlite and/or zeolites under hydrothermal condition, no metastable crystalline compounds such as Ca(OH) 2 and <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminates</b> exist. Alkali-activated cements also exhibit excellent resistance to corrosive environments. The leachability of contaminants from alkali-activated cement stabilized hazardous and radioactive wastes is lower than that from hardened portland cement stabilized wastes. From all these aspects, it is concluded that alkali-activated cements are better matrix for solidification/stabilization of hazardous and radioactive wastes than Portland cement. Peer reviewe...|$|R

By looking into the development of these properties, the exact effect of the chemical activator could be elucidated, but furthermore a first approximation of the durability efficiency of the examined systems could be obtained. In the frame of this second part, it was demonstrated that, apart from portlandite, <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminates</b> (ettringite and monosulfoaluminate) along with some gismondine and gehlenite hydrate (C(2) ASH(8)) crystals are formed in activated fly ash-cement pastes from the first week of hydration. Mercury intrusion porosimetry data confirmed the beneficial action of quicklime, towards decreasing the total pore volume (and concurrent increase in the volume occupied by fine pores) in high-lime ash blends. Gel/space ratios were estimated for each blended paste, and fine, almost linear, correlation was established with total porosity values. Microscopical observations revealed that the critical contribution of quicklime in the production of secondary C-S-H nearby the ash particles. The flocculent-like gel collaborates smoothly with needle-like products and finely-dispersed crystals towards the gradual impletion of the pores and strengthening of the paste. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Special cements are {{obtained}} from non-portland clinkers. In particular applications, when rapid hardening and high chemical resistance are required, they behave better than ordinary cements [1 - 4]. The peculiar composition of special cements {{can also be}} exploited for giving a more pronounced environment-friendly character to their manufacturing process. In this regard important features are: a) low synthesis temperatures; b) reduced thermal input and CO 2 generation; c) easy grindability; d) possibility of using hardly recoverable wastes and by-products. All the above mentioned features are present in <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> cements [5 - 14] based on 4 CaOּ 3 Al 2 O 3 ּ SO 3 (C 4 A 3 S, according to the cement chemistry notation under which C=CaO; A=Al 2 O 3; S =SO 3; S=SiO 2, H=H 2 O). <b>Calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> is able to generate, upon hydration, ettringite (C 6 AS 3 H 32), a compound which regulates all the technical properties of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> cements. When C 4 A 3 S reacts with calcium sulphate and water, {{in the absence of}} lime, a non-expansive ettringite is rapidly formed together with aluminium hydroxide, thus giving a high mechanical strength at early ages [4, 15 - 17]. Among the other phases present in C 4 A 3 S-based cements, dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) can play an important role because it is able to add strength and durability at later ages. Secondary constituents, such as gehlenite (C 2 AS), calcium sulphosilicate (C S S 5 2) and various calcium aluminates, have generally a poor hydraulic behaviour and provide a small contribution to the technical properties. Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) waste, mainly composed by exhausted sulphur sorbent and coal ash, contains CaO, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and SO 3 as major oxides, thus representing a potential raw material for the manufacture of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> cements [18]. Both disposal in landfill and re-use of FBC waste is generally made difficult by its chemical and mineralogical composition. Upon hydration, exothermal and expansive phenomena occur due to the relatively high content of lime and calcium sulphate [13]. Moreover the utilization of FBC ash in the ordinary cement and concrete industry is hindered by its poor pozzolanic activity due to the reduced glass content related to combustion temperatures which are significantly lower than those of traditional pulverized coal combustors [14]. The identification of suitable application fields for such waste is therefore of critical importance. This paper is focused on the use of a CFBC (circulating fluidized bed combustion) fly ash as raw mix component for the synthesis of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> cements.

The composition, structure and performance of the clinker were analyzed by the means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy and metallographic microscope. The results show that C 2. 75 B 1. 25 A 3 S mineral and alite can coexist in one clinker system.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{influence}} of the types and addition dose of MgO expanding agent and the age of cement on expansion value and expansion performance of cement based material added with MgO expanding agent was systematically studied. The expansion characteristics of cement based material added with MgO expanding agent or <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> expanding agent were compared. The expansion of such material increases with the addition dose of MgO expanding agent and cement mortar age. During the test period, the expansion of cement based material increases continuously. The light-burned MgO expanding agent modified by CaO expanding agent is able to increase the 28 d expansion of such material effectively. The temperature of calcination for the heavy-burned MgO expanding agent is higher than that of light-burned one, thus the heavy-burned MgO expanding agent has a rather dense structure with slow hydration rate and gives a small expansion of the cement based material at early age, showing an obvious expansion delay.

40|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> cement (CSA) {{has become}} {{in recent years}} a popular and environmental-friendly {{alternative}} to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). A great deal of knowledge has been gained on the microstructure, hydration mechanism, and environmental performance of this innovative binder {{but there is still}} lack of knowledge on durability issues related to the use of CSA-concrete. Taking into account that the pore solution of concrete with sulphoaluminate cement has a different alkalinity than that obtained using ordinary portland cement, the protection capacity of such concrete in relation to the corrosion of embedded steel reinforcement needs to be studied.

The results show that 1 - 5 wt. % content of MgO can stabilize crystal types of M 3 -C 3 S, R-C 3 S and β-C 2 S. Moreover, MgO can promote the formation of C 3 S and C 4 AF, but has little effect on the formation of C 2. 75 B 1. 25 A 3 $ and C 3 A. The C 3 A/C 4 AF ratio is reduced by 22 % at 5 wt. % MgO, which indicates that appropriate MgO can decrease the liquid viscosity. In the presence of Na 2 O and K 2 O, the highest limit of incorporated amount of MgO is about 3 wt. %, which is higher than that in Portland cement clinker of 2 wt. %. Besides, MgO favors the formation of small C 3 S crystals in size of 4 - 20 μm.

This product, normally formed during the hydration of cement, presents an acicular morphology (needles) that can be observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). However, DEF can also be formed after the setting of the cement causing, in this case, a deleterious expansion of the concrete. This secondary ettringite can also be produced after an excessive heating of the concrete, caused by a high amount of cement or by the use of heat cure. SEM has been used to distinguish between expansive and non expansive ettringite based normally in morphology analysis, since the former is characterized by a compressed or compact nature where the needle shapes disappear or are welded together. Furthermore, the use of other techniques, like X-ray diffraction or micro-XRF, has been limited because the compressed or compact ettringite is badly crystallized or even amorphous and the elemental composition is similar and therefore it is difficult to detect. This article presents a methodology for the diagnosis of DEF using polished concrete thin sections and combining polarised and fluorescence light optical microscopy with SEM-EDS...|$|E
40|$|Large {{amounts of}} waste wood {{formwork}} from construction sites {{end up with}} landfill disposal every day. This study aims to develop a practicable technology for recycling construction waste wood into formaldehyde-free cement-bonded particleboards that have value-added features of high strength, light weight, and thermal/noise insulation for reuse in building and construction applications. The mineralogy and microstructure of particleboards were characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, and mercury intrusion porosimetry analyses. Among the mineral admixtures, chloride accelerated precipitation of oxychlorides while sulphate produced <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> for promoting early strength development. The use of 2 % CaCl 2 proved to be sufficient for improving the wood-cement compatibility. At wood-to-cement ratio of 3 : 7 by weight (i. e., 3 : 1 by volume), cement hydrates in the porous structure ensured acceptable dimensional stability (< 2 % swelling). By adjusting the water-to-cement ratio to 0. 3 and density of the particleboards to 1. 54  g cm− 3, the volume of capillary pores was effectively reduced from 0. 16  mL g− 1 to 0. 02  mL g− 1. The more compact microstructure contributed to high fracture energy at 6. 57  N mm− 1 and flexural strength of 12. 9  MPa. Using the above optimal production conditions, the particleboards complied with the International Standard (9  MPa) while enabling reuse as light-weight structure. The particleboards also manifested outstanding structure-borne noise reduction (at 32 – 100  Hz) and low thermal conductivity (0. 29  W m− 1  K− 1), suggesting potential application as acoustic and thermal insulating materials. Preliminary cost-benefit analysis illustrated economic viability of the proposed approach. Therefore, technological innovation is crucial for delivering an eco-friendly solution to waste wood recycling for the building and construction industry.

40|$|Cement based binders are {{building}} materials of worldwide importance. Since these samples are very complex, the knowledge/control of their mineralogical composition {{are essential to}} design and predict materials with specific/improved performance. Rietveld quantitative phase analysis (RQPA) allows the quantification of crystalline phases and, when combined with specific methodologies, as the addition of an internal standard or the external standard approach (G-factor), amorphous and non-crystalline phases can also be quantified. However, {{to carry out a}} proper RQPA in hydrated cementitious-materials, a good powder diffraction pattern is necessary. In this work, synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRPD) has been used, allowing in-situ measurements during the early-age hydration process. 	This work deals with the early hydration study of cement-based materials. The studied samples were: a laboratory-prepared belite <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> (BCSAF) clinker (non-active) mixed with 10 wt% gypsum, labelled G 10 B 0; two active laboratory-prepared BCSAF clinkers (activated with 2 wt% borax), one mixed with 10 wt% gypsum and the other one with 10 wt% monoclinic-bassanite, hereafter named G 10 B 2 and B 10 B 2, respectively; and an environmentally-friendly cement sample from Henkel, composed of bassanite mixed with 15 wt% Portland cement and 10 wt% Metakaolin, labelled H 1. 	Anhydrous G 10 B 0 contains beta-belite and orthorhombic-ye'elimite as main phases, while alpha'H-belite and pseudo-cubic-ye'elimite are stabilized in G 10 B 2 and B 10 B 2, with the corresponding sulphate source. Anhydrous H 1 contains monoclinic and hexagonal bassanite and alite as main phases. 	Ye'elimite, in the non-active BCSAF cement pastes, dissolves at a higher pace than in the active one (degree of reaction is α~ 25 % and α~ 10 % at 1 h, respectively) (both prepared with gypsum), with the corresponding differences in ettringite crystallisation (degree of precipitation is α~ 30 % and α~ 5 %, respectively). 	Moreover, the type of sulphate source has important consequences on the hydration of the active BCSAF cement pastes. Bassanite is quickly dissolved and it precipitates as gypsum within the first hour of hydration (in B 10 B 2). At that time, ettringite starts to crystallize, and after 12 hours is almost fully crystallized, similar to G 10 B 2. 	In H 1, bassanite transforms into gypsum within the first hour, being the principal hydration product; ettringite starts to be formed just after few hydration minutes. 	These results are crucial in the understanding and development of improved cement materials. Universidad de Málaga. Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{identify}} the conditions of formation of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> (3 CaO· 3 Al 2 O 3 ·CaSO 4) by the sintering of a limestone (CaCO 3) and alunite [K 2 SO 4 ·Al 2 (SO 4) 3 · 4 Al(OH) 3] mixture with the following reagents: K 2 SO 4, CaCO 3, Al(OH) 3, CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O, and SiO 2. When K 2 SO 4, CaCO 3, Al(OH) 3, CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O were mixed in molar ratios of 1 : 3 : 6 : 3 and sintered at 1, 200 ~ 1, 300 °C, only 3 CaO· 3 Al 2 O 3 ·CaSO 4 and calcium langbeinite (2 CaSO 4 ·K 2 SO 4) were generated. With an amount of CaO that {{is less than the}} stoichiometric molar ratio, 3 CaO· 3 Al 2 O 3 ·CaSO 4 was formed and anhydrite (CaSO 4) did not react and remained behind. With the amount of CaSO 4 that is less than the stoichiometric molar ratio, the amounts of 3 CaO· 3 Al 2 O 3 ·CaSO 4 and 2 CaSO 4 ·K 2 SO 4 decreased, and that of CaO·Al 2 O 3 increased. In the K 2 SO 4 -CaO-Al 2 O 3 -CaSO 4 -SiO 2 system, to stabilize the formation of 3 CaO· 3 Al 2 O 3 ·CaSO 4, 2 CaSO 4 ·K 2 SO 4, and β- 2 CaO·SiO 2, the molar ratios of CaO: Al 2 O 3 : CaSO 4 must be kept at 3 : 3 : 1 and that of CaO/SiO 2, over 2. 0; otherwise, the generated amount of 3 CaO· 3 Al 2 O 3 ·CaSO 4 decreased and that of gehlenite (2 CaO·Al 2 O 3 ·SiO 2) with no hydration increased quantitatively. Therefore, if all SO 3 (g) generated by the thermal decomposition of alunite reacts with CaCO 3 (or CaO, the thermal decomposition product of limestone) to form CaSO 4 in an alunite- limestone system, 1 mol of pure alunite reacts with 6 mol of limestone to form 1 mol of 3 CaO· 3 Al 2 O 3 ·CaSO 4 and 1 mol of 2 CaSO 4 ·K 2 SO 4...|$|E
40|$|Climate change {{mitigation}} {{usually involves}} {{the reduction of}} greenhouse gases emissions, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2). Every tonne of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) produces about one tonne of CO 2. Consequently, OPC accounts for 5 - 6 % of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions and for 4 % of total global warming. Due to these environmental problems the industry of building materials is under increasing pressure to reduce the energy used {{in the production of}} OPC and the greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, there is a growing interest in developing alternatives to OPC, such as, <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphoaluminate</b> cements (CSA), that will release 0. 25 - 0. 40 tons of CO 2 less than OPC per tonne of clinker, depending on their composition. Although CSA cements are very promising, their use is strongly limited in Europe. At the present state of European standard, CSA cements cannot be used in structural concrete according to the EN 206 - 1; only three formulations,produced by Buzzi Unicemin Trino (Italy), obtained in 2013 a CE mark, also allowing the use for structural application. Hence, the general aim of this PhD Thesis is to better understand the behaviour of these eco-cement during their hydration. Moreover, I am a member of a working group which has a large experience in anhydrous cements and clinkers characterisation by X-Ray powder diffraction combined with Rietveld methodology, and in the processing of materials. So, I would like to highlight my contribution in the processing and characterisation of hydrated CSA pastes, including the quantification of ACn (Amorphous and Crystalline not-quantified) content through laboratory X-ray powder diffraction (LXRPD), and the measurement of mechanical properties of the corresponding mortars. Moreover, another objective was to establish a methodology to prepare, store and stop the hydration of cement pastes and mortars. Although anhydrous cements are mainly crystalline materials, they may contain a non-negligible amount of ACn; in addition part of the hydration products can be amorphous. This is the reason why the quantification of the ACn is an important issue. In previous studies, we used the internal standard methodology, measuring the sample in reflection geometry, to calculate the ACn content with quite accurate results. However, the addition of an internal standard may alter the cement hydration, dilute the phases in the pastes, and produce microabsorption problems. Hence, both external standard in reflection geometry and internal standard in transmission geometry methodologies have been compared. With that study, we can conclude that the ACn content in a mixture of powders can be calculated using both, internal and external standard, where the latter is of even greater utility in the study of hydration of cement pastes. That methodology has the inherent benefit of using common experimental requirements of LXRPD (knowing the diffractometer constant) and moreover, the sample is not altered/diluted. Moreover, the internal standard method is useful to corroborate the obtained values. However, the transmission approach is not very suitable for following ACn evolution in a process because it is experimentally tedious. Once we trust the methodology to control the hydration phases including ACn content, the effect of the following parameters on the hydration of CSA pastes and mortars was studied: gypsum content, sulfate source, water/cement (w/c) ratio, superplasticizer and the possible addition of fly ash (FA). The optimum w/c ratio must be high enough to have a high degree hydration of cement phases, and to provide workability, but in turn, it should be low enough to yield good mechanical strengths. The use of the optimum type and amount of additives improves the workability of cement pastes, allowing the use of lower w/c ratios and, consequently, higher compressive strength values. The optimised amount of gypsum to prepare CSA cements has been determined to be close to 25 wt%. Therefore, we were able to correlate the phase assemblage of CSA pastes with compressive strength values of corresponding mortars. Another aim was the cost reduction of CSA cement and the study of the possible pozzolanic effect when the cement is partially replaced by FA. Although the hydration did not show enough evidences of pozzolanic effect even after 6 months of study, we found that the partial substitution produces: i) filling and ii) diluting effects. And we concluded that the partial substitution of cement (15 wt% of FA) involves economic and environmental benefits. Moreover, the phase assemblage evolution is the same in the presence or not of FA, suggesting that durability is not compromised. Furthermore, the construction industry often requires cements with tailored properties. The knowledge and control of CSA hydration and properties of their mortars make possible the production of tailored cements and in the future, to comply all European standards. Through the use of different kinds of sulphate sources, w/c ratio and additives, the rheological behaviour and setting time of cement pastes have been controlled and modified while high compressive strength values were achieved. Each sulphate source (gypsum, bassanite or anhydrite) provides mortars with different setting times, as a consequence of their different rate of solubility. Hence, the use of different sulphate sources is a key point to control the rate of cement hydration. Bassanite solubility in water is very high thus, when added to cements/mortars it yields to short setting times ( 20 min) that produces heterogeneous mortars with low mechanical strengths. However, the use of the optimum amount and type of additive, delays the setting time and allows the preparation of mortars with compressive strength values up to 80 MPa at 7 days of hydration. Anhydrite dissolves slowly so, at 1 hydration-day, the amount of ettringite formed (~ 20 wt%) is lower than that in gypsum pastes (~ 26 wt%), producing mortars with lower compressive strengths (40. 7 and 21. 2 MPa, respectively). However, after 3 hydration-days, similar ettringite contents are produced but mechanical strengths of anhydrite-pastes are slightly higher. This behaviour is mainly due to a higher plasticity of anhydrite-paste. Moreover, {{it must be noted that}} mortars with gypsum-w/c 0. 50 or anhydrite-w/c 0. 50 gave compressive strengths higher than OPC mortars at early ages. At this point, we are able to obtain tailored CSA eco-cements and mortars for diverse applications through the control of their hydration and also with the consequent economic and environmental benefits...|$|E
