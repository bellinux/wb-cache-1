Our approach was aimed at improving the quality of a digital elevation model (DEM) and ortho images generated from <b>colored</b> <b>point</b> cloud data. Our inpainting procedure consisted of base patch extraction, matching point detection, and image reconstruction steps. These steps were iterated for the reconstruction of a natural image. We selected two places for our study areas, an indoor and an outdoor environment. We have developed an inpainting approach for colored DEM generation using a <b>colored</b> <b>point</b> cloud. Moreover, we conducted two experiments using a terrestrial laser scanner and an indoor mobile mapping system.

VCSH is trained using partial-view object <b>color</b> <b>point</b> clouds generated from different synthetic viewpoints.

The estimated closest viewpoint provides a good initialization for object pose estimation optimization us-ing the iterative closest point strategy. Finally, objects in real scene are recognized and their accurate poses are retrieved. A set of experiments is realized where our proposed approach is proven to outperform other existing methods by guaranteeing highly accurate object recognition, fast and accurate pose es-timation as well as exhibiting the capability of dealing with environmental illumination changes.

40|$|Abstract. A fuzzy c-means {{algorithm}} {{incorporating the}} notion of dom-inant colors and spatial homogeneity is proposed for the color cluster-ing problem. The proposed algorithm extracts the most vivid and dis-tinguishable colors, {{referred to as the}} dominant colors, and then used these colors as the initial centroids in the clustering calculations. This is achieved by introducing reference colors and defining a fuzzy member-ship model between a <b>color</b> <b>point</b> and each reference color. The objective function of the proposed algorithm incorporates the spatial homogeneity, which reflects the uniformity of a region. The homogeneity is quantified in terms of the variance and discontinuity of the spatial neighborhood around a <b>color</b> <b>point.</b> The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method is demonstrated through various color clustering examples. ...|$|E

30|$|In Fig.   4, {{the colored}} {{values in the}} U matrix {{represent}} workflows relatedness between various data of different domains. The greater length of the U matrix in Fig.   4 represents the more varied data being examined. Non-zero values are shown with warmer <b>color</b> <b>points.</b> The zero values represent the hidden data that are dropped by threshold because of their different mechanism. These values indicate {{that there is a}} relationship between the data obtained from the source and target domains. Therefore, as the number of <b>color</b> <b>points</b> and <b>colors</b> are more varied, more data can be distinguished. As can be seen in Fig.   4, in the U matrices (a) (b), and (d), the matrix length is shorter than other matrices. This shows that the matrix can scan a small range of data. Also, the non-zero values of the matrices (a) (b), and (d), are centered around and nearby one segment. Although in Fig.   4 c has studied more data, but still non-zero values are concentrated around one segment. So, based on that, we will have almost the same behavior. The best output about the data distinction is related to (e) and (f) matrices. Both matrices of (e) and (f) cover a larger field of values. This is caused by the <b>color</b> <b>points</b> that are scattered uniformly.|$|R
