5000|$|The <b>clamshells</b> proceed {{into the}} final scene of the attraction, where King Triton, Sebastian, Flounder, and several sea creatures {{celebrate}} the wedding of Ariel and Eric. The couple waves goodbye from a gazebo on the ocean's edge. Fireworks explode in the sky overhead.

5000|$|At both parks, guests board Omnimover {{vehicles}} themed as large, colorful <b>clamshells.</b> These proceed {{through an}} opening in the broken hull of Prince Eric's ship. Scuttle greets the guests and makes a muddled attempt to tell them Ariel's story. The <b>clamshells</b> then rotate backwards as they make their way along the beach and descend [...] "underwater" [...] (an effect achieved through projections and blasts of cold air). As they continue their descent, the <b>clamshells</b> travel through rocky underwater passages filled with seaweed and coral (in Disney California Adventure, clams, fish, seahorses, and starfish {{can be seen in the}} passages as well.) Ariel and Flounder can be seen briefly through an opening overhead.|$|R

5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} <b>clamshell</b> style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast are Goat Cave and <b>Clamshell</b> Cave. The latter is 10m high, about 6m wide at the entrance, and some 45m long, and {{on one side of}} it the ridges of basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the {{pyramidal}} rock islet of Am Buachaille ('The Herdsman'), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at low tide. Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon's Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh at low tide. In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to the cliff face which is still visible. Mackinnon's Cave is 107 metres long.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>clamshells</b> ascend among {{projected}} {{bubbles and}} splash onto {{the shore of}} a lagoon. Sebastian sings [...] "Kiss the Girl" [...] while Eric and Ariel sit together in a boat, leaning in to kiss each other before backing away sheepishly. After leaving the lagoon, the <b>clamshells</b> pass before a doorway to Prince Eric's castle, where silhouettes of Ariel and Eric are seen finally kissing. A golden orb glows from within Ariel's neck, signifying that she has regained her voice. The orb proceeds to encircle the two, creating a heart shape as Ariel and Eric kiss. The smoking silhouette of a giant, defeated Ursula is visible on the horizon.|$|R
