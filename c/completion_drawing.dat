Using the Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 2002, 2002 - 2004 follow up survey, this study examines the differential in the dropout rate among black and Latino students compared to whites. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine how socioeconomic status (SES), family structure, school population size, paid employment, and school location contribute to the dropout process for black and Latino students.

40|$|Tuberculosis and {{substance}} use frequently intertwine, especially when people live in conditions of poverty. Consequently, public health care workers seeking to respond to either may find themselves needing to respond to both. In Cape Town, South Africa, in a context where treatment success rates are lower than required to contain the tuberculosis epidemic and resistance to medication is increasing, this is particularly problematic. Public health providers identify substance use as a key "barrier" to treatment inception and <b>completion.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on research in two sites, an inpatient tuberculosis hospital and a substance use treatment centre affiliated to a tuberculosis clinic, I examine the dynamics of tuberculosis {{and substance}} use as they manifest in life and care. I develop an ethnographically grounded concept, "intra-occurrence". This describes the synergistic (and often symbiotic) interaction between at least two "health impactors". The latter are factors, conditions and contexts that shape health experiences, understandings and responses. Building on arguments that intra-occurrences form {{more than the sum}} of their constituent parts, I argue that institutions and systems designed to deal with one or the other of the constituent parts are ill-equipped to deal with the actual whole because the relationships between constituent parts and their products are not recognised. Intra-occurrences occlude or mask symptoms and obfuscate clear lines of cause and effect. This means that sufferers may not recognise their own poor health, and health providers are required to make decisions in and through doubt. Social interpretations thus become particularly important in determining what is noticed and draws attention and what slips from view. I demonstrate the need for awareness of how moral frameworks (that are by nature "sticky", or hard to shift) materialise and take on explanatory force. By showing how intra-occurrences overspill existing categories and modes of treatment, this ethnographic account challenges contemporary health care provision...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the lived experiences of women in Ethiopian higher education (HE) as a counterpoint to understandings of gender equity informed only by data on admission, progression and <b>completions</b> rates. <b>Drawing</b> on a critical qualitative inquiry approach, we analyse and interpret data drawn from focus group discussions with female students and academic women in two public universities in Ethiopia. Individual accounts and shared experiences of women in HE revealed that despite affirmative action policies that slightly benefit females at entry point, gender inequality persists in qualitative forms. Prejudice against women and sexual violence are highlighted as key expressions of qualitative gender inequalities in the two universities. It is argued that HE institutions in Ethiopia are male-dominated, hierarchical and hostile to women. Furthermore, taken-for-granted gender assumptions and beliefs at institutional, social relational and individual levels operate to make women conform to structures of disadvantage and in effect sustain the repressive gender relations...|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} study, a complex neural circuit was shown to be involved in human males during sexual arousal [A. Ferretti et al. (2005) Neuroimage, 26, 1086]. At group level, there was a specific correlation between penile erection and activations in anterior cingulate, insula, amygdala, hypothalamus and secondary somatosensory regions. However, {{it is well known that}} there are remarkable inter-individual differences in the psychological view and attitude to sex of human males. Therefore, a crucial issue is the relationship among cerebral responses, sexual arousal and psychosexual identity at individual level. To address this issue, 18 healthy male subjects were recruited. Their deep sexual identity (DSI) was assessed following the construct revalidation by M. Olivetti Belardinelli [(1994) Sci. Contrib. Gen. Psychol., 11, 131] of the Franck <b>drawing</b> <b>completion</b> test, a projective test providing, according to this revalidation, quantitative scores on ‘accordance/non-accordance’ between self-reported and psychological sexual identity. Cerebral activity was evaluated by means of {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} during hard-core erotic movies and sport movies. Results showed a statistically significant positive correlation between the blood oxygen level-dependent signal in bilateral hypothalamus and the Franck <b>drawing</b> <b>completion</b> test score during erotic movies. The higher the blood oxygen level-dependent activation in bilateral hypothalamus, the higher the male DSI profile. These results suggest that, in male subjects, inter-individual differences in the DSI are strongly correlated with blood flow to the bilateral hypothalamus, a dimorphic brain region deeply implicated in instinctual drives including reproduction...|$|R
