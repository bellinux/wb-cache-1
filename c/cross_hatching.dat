The nativity is recurrent, while several panels depict the Virgin and Child, often {{surrounded by a}} chorus of angels, or in earlier panels, blessed by a hovering representation of God or a dove (representing the Holy Ghost). In many instances Mary is enclosed in her usual enclosed garden. Several reveal {{the work of a}} number of hands, with weaker and less confident passages attributed to workshop members. The figures of Mary and Gabriel on the reverse of the Dombild were drawn more rapidly and with less skill than the figures on the main panels, and their drapery is modelled with, according to the art historian Julien Chapuis, a certain [...] "stiffness", while the <b>cross</b> <b>hatching</b> [...] "achieves no clear definition of relief".

2500|$|Shading {{refers to}} [...] depth in 3D models or {{illustrations}} by {{varying levels of}} darkness. It is a process used in drawing for depicting levels of darkness on paper by applying media more densely or with a darker shade for darker areas, and less densely or with a lighter shade for lighter areas. There are various techniques of shading including <b>cross</b> <b>hatching</b> where perpendicular lines of varying closeness are drawn in a grid pattern to shade an area. The closer the lines are together, the darker the area appears. Likewise, the farther apart the lines are, the lighter the area appears. The term has been recently generalized to mean that shaders are applied.|$|E

6000|$|... 164. Also {{this study}} will be useful to you, in showing how entirely effects of light depend on delineation, and {{gradation}} of spaces, and not on methods of shading. And {{this is the second}} great practical matter I want you to remember to-day. All effects of light and shade depend not on the method or execution of shadows, but on their rightness of place, form, and depth. There is indeed a loveliness of execution added to the rightness, by the great masters, but you cannot obtain that unless you become one of them. Shadow cannot be laid thoroughly well, any more than lines can be drawn steadily, but by a long-practised hand, and the attempts to imitate the shading of fine draughtsmen, by dotting and hatching, are just as ridiculous as it would be to endeavour to imitate their instantaneous lines by a series of re-touchings. You will often indeed see in Lionardo's work, and in Michael Angelo's, shadow wrought laboriously to an extreme of fineness; but when you look into it, you will find that they have always been drawing more and more form within the space, and never finishing for the sake of added texture, but of added fact. And all those effects of transparency and reflected light, aimed at in common chalk drawings, are wholly spurious. For since, as I told you, all lights are shades compared to higher lights, and lights only as compared to lower ones, it follows {{that there can be no}} difference in their quality as such; but that light is opaque when it expresses substance, and transparent when it expresses space; and shade is also opaque when it expresses substance, and transparent when it expresses space. But it is not, even then, transparent in the common sense of that word; nor is its appearance to be obtained by dotting or <b>cross</b> <b>hatching,</b> but by touches so tender as to look like mist. And now we find the use of having Lionardo for our guide. He is supreme in all questions of execution, and in his 28th chapter, you will find that shadows are to be [...] "dolce e sfumose," [...] to be tender, and look as if they were exhaled, or breathed on the paper. Then, look at any of Michael Angelo's finished drawings, or of Correggio's sketches, and you will see that the true nurse of light is in art, as in nature, the cloud; a misty and tender darkness, made lovely by gradation.|$|E

"The {{aircraft}} descended continuously at {{a steady}} rate {{over a period of}} 13½ minutes and the pointers would have been in continuous motion throughout, increasing the likelihood of misreading. The <b>cross</b> <b>hatching</b> in this type of altimeter first appears in a window in the 10,000ft disc at an indicated altitude of 26,666ft and the edge of the <b>cross</b> <b>hatching</b> would have been visible within 2 minutes of the aircraft beginning its descent. At 10,000ft the <b>cross</b> <b>hatching</b> completely fills the window and it remains filled as long as the aircraft is below 10,000ft. Thus the <b>cross</b> <b>hatching</b> would have been visible to the crew for a period of about 9½ minutes before the aircraft passed through FL60 and {{it is a matter of}} conjecture whether it was still an effective warning to them at that stage of the descent."With this type of altimeter it is not difficult to read an indication of 6,000ft as 16,000ft if particular note is not made of the position of the 10,000ft pointer. Evidence against the possibility of simple misreading of this sort is the message from the aircraft to ATC reporting passing FL145, indicating at this time the crew knew that they were below 16,000ft.

30|$|The {{next two}} higher-energy PL peaks at 1.344 and 1.377 eV {{originate}} from the WL and the CHP, respectively. The highest-energy PL peak at 1.42 eV {{is the second}} WL formed in the denuded zones between the <b>cross</b> <b>hatches.</b> The second WL {{is different from the}} first WL that gives rise to the 1.344 -eV PL peak. The first WL is the WL between the over-critical InAs 3 D dots and the underlying InGaAs CHP layer which exists only above the MDs. The second WL is the thin InAs 2 D film between the InGaAs CHP layer and the overlying GaAs capping layer which exists only in the denuded zones between the <b>cross</b> <b>hatches.</b> This peak is absent in sample C because there are no denuded zones: the critical thickness for QD formation has been reached across the surface, including the areas between the <b>cross</b> <b>hatches.</b> The presence of two WLs is thus unique to sample D, but we believe that it is a general phenomenon for all Stranski-Krastanow QDs grown on cross-hatch patterns. Their existence which has not been identified until now possibly explains the more complex carrier dynamics than those exhibited in conventional QDs [32, 33]. Sample D is subject to ex situ annealing, and the results are reported in the last subsection.|$|R
