5|$|The Spanish left a deep mark on Texas. Their European {{livestock}} caused mesquite {{to spread}} inland while farmers tilled and irrigated the land, changing the landscape forever. The Spanish language provided the names {{for many of}} the rivers, towns, and counties that currently exist, and Spanish architectural concepts still flourish. Although Texas eventually adopted much of the Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal practices were retained, including the concept of a homestead exemption and <b>community</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal {{practices were}} retained. Among these was the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the profits of marriage, and, like many other former Spanish provinces, Texas retained the idea of <b>community</b> <b>property</b> rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who {{is not required to}} gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E

Exclusion of livestock grazing {{is one of}} the main management practices used to protect grasslands. However, it is not known if long-term exclusion of livestock grazing has positive effect on above-and belowground <b>community</b> <b>properties</b> in typical steppe of the Loess Plateau. We studied the long-term (20 -year) cumulative effects of exclusion of livestock grazing on above-and belowground <b>community</b> <b>properties</b> compared with that before exclusion of livestock grazing in a typical steppe of the Loess Plateau, NW China. Our results show that twenty-year exclusion of livestock grazing significantly increased above-and belowground biomass, species richness, cover and height for five different communities. Most of belowground biomass was in the 0 - 20 cm horizon and grazing exclusion increased biomass especially at the depth of 0 - 10 cm.

40|$|LLM (Estate Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The study commences {{with a brief}} {{overview}} of the history of marriage and specifically of marriage in <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> with reference to marital power. The unique ex lege consequences of marriage in <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> is comprehensively discussed. The Constitutional Court decision in Harksen v Lane determined the test for unconstitutionality. The test for unconstitutionality is discussed with specific reference to the Bill of Rights. The Constitutional Court's decision in Volks v Robinson is critically evaluated as the Court propounded the so-called "choice argument" in terms of which people purposefully decide to marry instead of cohabiting and therefore the law may accord certain benefits to married people which are not available to unmarried life partners. The Constitutional Court decisions in Van der Merwe v RAF as well as its consequences are discussed. It concluded that section 18 (b) of the Matrimonial Property Act constituted unjustifiable discrimination between spouses married in <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> and those married out of <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> and the said section was therefore declared unconstitutional. The law of insolvency in respect of the joint estate of spouses married in <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> is investigated. Freedom of testation and case law relating thereto is considered briefly. The study concludes with the submission that the common law provision that separate assets of a spouse in a marriage in <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> form part of the joint insolvent estate even if a testator expressly determined in his will that a bequest will not form part of the joint estate of a beneficiary, amounts to unfair discrimination and is unconstitutional. t is submitted that the principle unfairly discriminates between spouses married in <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> and those married out of <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> on the ground of marital status.

500|$|Republic of Texas {{policies}} {{changed the}} status of many living in the region. [...] The constitution forbade free blacks from living in Texas permanently.

500|$|While the Tehcir law {{was being}} carried out, the Directorate for the Settlement of Tribes and Refugees (Turkish: Iskan-i Asairin Muhacirin Muduriyeti), under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was tasked in June 1915 {{to deal with}} the {{property}} left behind by deported or killed Armenians. This commission, whose salaries were provided by property confiscated by Armenians, produced the [...] "Temporary Law of Expropriation and Confiscation ("Abandoned Properties" [...] law) and published in the official register on 27 September (13 September according to the Islamic calendar) and passed a further directive for implementation of the law on 8 November. The objectives of the laws were simultaneously to reduce Armenian property ownership, enrich national politicians, and to resettle Turkish Muslim refugees in property which was seized. The property confiscated included personal property (including land, buildings, and bank accounts), businesses, and also <b>community</b> <b>property</b> (e.g. churches). Items that were considered useful for the immediacy of the war effort were prioritized and immediately confiscated with a separate decree. Under the law, property and asset transactions were forbidden prior to the deportation thereby preventing the owners from having the opportunity to keep his or her property. Although the law was called [...] "Temporary", the provisions within it seemed to aim toward the permanent transformation of the ethnicity of communities from Armenian to Turkish Muslim.|$|E

[...] The trial court granted Dixie's trust's claim. [...] The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim.
