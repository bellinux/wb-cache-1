500|$|After {{returning}} to England in May 1968, Lennon suggested that Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, Boyd, and her sister. Lennon {{said that he}} would be very busy recording what would become The White Album and that it would do her some good to take a break with Mardas, his girlfriend Jenny Boyd, and others. Cynthia arrived home one day early from Greece on 22 May 1968. She and Mardas discovered Lennon and Ono sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> staring into each other's eyes, and found Ono's slippers outside the Lennons' marital bedroom door. Cynthia asked Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but Mardas got Cynthia drunk and tried to convince her that they should both run away together. After Cynthia had vomited in the bathroom she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, but Mardas joined her and tried to kiss her until she (in her words) [...] "pushed him away". Brian Epstein's personal assistant, Peter Brown, maintains that Cynthia did sleep with Mardas, saying: [...] "She knew it was a mistake the moment it happened, especially with Alex , whom she had never trusted, nor even liked".|$|E
500|$|During {{the flight}} back to England, Lennon got very drunk on Scotch and confessed {{that he had been}} {{involved}} with other women during their marriage. He went on to detail his liaisons with groupies, friends (such as Joan Baez, actress Eleanor Bron, journalist Cleave) and [...] "thousands" [...] of women around the globe. Although not wanting to hear Lennon's confession, she knew women were attracted to him, [...] "like moths to a flame". Two weeks later, in May 1968, Lennon suggested Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, and two friends, as he would be very busy recording songs for what would become The White Album. She arrived back at Kenwood from Greece earlier than expected, at 4 o'clock on 22 May 1968, to discover Lennon and Ono sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in matching white robes, staring into each other's eyes, and then found Ono's slippers outside the Lennons' bedroom door. Shocked, she asked Jenny Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but she and Mardas drank more alcohol, with Mardas trying to convince her to run away together. After she had vomited in the bathroom, she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, with Mardas joining her and trying to kiss her until she pushed him away.|$|E

In 1978, one of these bait acts, two teenage girls referring to themselves as [...] "Have You Got a Nickel", made it onto the show. Their act consisted of <b>the</b> girls sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage <b>floor</b> and they began silently eating popsicles {{in a manner that}} suggested they were performing fellatio <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frozen treats.

At rituals such as circumcisions or at government ceremonies, the ensemble plays while seated (“duduak”) <b>cross-legged</b> or kneeling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and it is therefore called a “Talempong Duduak”. Because musicians are stationary in “Talempong Duduak” performances, their interlocking patterns are more intricate than those achieved in the processional “Talempong Pacik” ensembles. The excerpt presented here {{is based on a}} selection of four rhythmic patterns played by a “Talempong Duduak” ensemble led by Ibu Nasrul and recorded in October 1982. The third pattern in the excerpt is the popular “Tak Tontong” (or ‘Tak Tuntuang”), of which there are several musical variants.

500|$|In 1968, Cynthia went on {{vacation}} to Greece, leaving Lennon at Kenwood with Shotton. After {{several days of}} taking LSD and smoking marijuana, Lennon convened {{a meeting at the}} Beatles' business HQ to inform the others that he felt he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Later that day he phoned Ono, whose own husband Tony (Anthony Cox) was in Paris on business, and invited her to Kenwood. Shotton left the two alone, whereupon Lennon invited Ono (who had also taken LSD) up to the attic to hear his largely experimental non-Beatles' recordings. For the rest of the night, the two collaborated on what became the [...] album, and then [...] "made love at dawn", according to Lennon. Cynthia returned early from her vacation, and discovered Lennon and Ono sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and staring intently into each other's eyes (Ono was wearing one of Cynthia's bathrobes). In a state of shock, Cynthia then left to stay with friends for a few days, although Lennon and Cynthia were reconciled for a time upon her return to Kenwood. It was during Cynthia's next holiday in Italy that Lennon and Ono finally entered into a permanent relationship, and Lennon asked for a divorce. Cynthia, together with Julian and her mother, moved back into Kenwood for the summer, where Paul McCartney visited her to offer his support. On the journey to Kenwood he composed the song [...] "Hey Jude", which eventually became The Beatles' biggest selling single. Lennon and Ono, meanwhile, were without a permanent address for a time. They stayed with McCartney at his house in Cavendish Avenue (where it is alleged that a further breach occurred in the Lennon–McCartney relationship when Lennon discovered a derogatory note written by McCartney) and with Peter Brown and then Neil Aspinall, before moving into an apartment leased by Starr at 34 Montagu Square, Marylebone in London. They were evicted from this flat by the owner following a raid by the drug squad on 18 October 1968, and subsequent November trial, and so moved back into Kenwood for a short time, which had been vacated by Cynthia. In the new year Ono and Lennon moved into the Dorchester Hotel in London, leaving Kenwood for the last time.|$|E

There they studied, read, and wrote, the walls of their schoolroom lined with computers protected by cloth dust covers, its big ceiling fans scarcely disturbing the heavy heat of early March. On this afternoon, they bent over notebooks, writing in fits and starts, stopping to whisper and laugh with each other, then returning to the task at hand, which was a summary of their initial thoughts of what to share about themselves {{as well as what}} they would like to ask of youth in the United States and South Africa. “How do boys treat girls there? ” one young woman ventured. “What subjects do students study in school? ” queried another. They wrote notes and ques-tions in Davangari script, and they chatted with each other and their teacher in Hindi, but they spoke and wrote passably, if haltingly, in English when prompted to interact with their American visitors. These adolescent girls were preparing to partic-ipate in an international exchange project with youth in other countries, in effect a multimedia pen pal activity, made prescient and possible by the social networking capabilities of our digital age and our global world (Hull & Nelson, in press).

60|$|Before eleven a third reef {{was taken}} in the mainsail, and Johnson filled the cabin with a storm-sail of No. 1 duck, and sat <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{streaming}} <b>floor,</b> vigorously putting it to rights {{with a couple of}} the hands. By dinner I had fled the deck, and sat in the bench corner, giddy, dumb, and stupefied with terror. The frightened leaps of the poor Norah Creina, spanking like a stag for bare existence, bruised me between the table and the berths. Overhead, the wild huntsman of the storm passed continuously in one blare of mingled noises; screaming wind, straining timber, lashing rope's-end, pounding block and bursting sea contributed; and I could have thought there was at times another, a more piercing, a more human note, that dominated all, like the wailing of an angel; I could have thought I knew the angel's name, and that his wings were black. It seemed incredible that any creature of man's art could long endure the barbarous mishandling of the seas, kicked as the schooner was from mountain-side to mountain-side, beaten and blown upon and wrenched in every joint and sinew, like a child upon the rack. There was not a plank of her that did not cry aloud for mercy; and as she continued to hold together, I became conscious of a growing sympathy with her endeavours, a growing admiration for her gallant staunchness, that amused and at times obliterated my terrors for myself. God bless every man that swung a mallet on that tiny and strong hull! It was not for wages only that he laboured, but to save men's lives.|$|R
40|$|Background: The low {{contact stress}} {{rotating}} platform (LCS RP) knee (DePuy Orthopedics, Inc, Warsaw, Indiana), in use for last four decades in Western population, {{is reported to}} have a survival of more than 95 % at 15 to 20 years. The reported Indian experience of this knee is limited to 5 years. Our aim was to report the clinical and radiological results of the LCS RP TKA design in the Indian population with a minimum followup of 10 years. Materials and Methods: Fifty-five LCS knees (45 patients) operated between February 1997 and October 2001 were evaluated retrospectively. LCS design was generally selected if the patient was young (≤ 65 years of age), active and had no severe deformity. There were 40 female (88. 9 %) and 5 male (11. 1 %) patients; 47 knees had osteoarthritis (85. 5 %) and 8 knees had rheumatoid arthritis (14. 5 %). Knee Society Scores (KSS) and outcome questionnaire were filled at followup and radiographs were analyzed using Knee Society radiographic evaluation and scoring system. Results: Of 45 patients (55 knees) enrolled, 37 patients (44 knees; 80 %) were available for followup at 10 years. Average age was 59. 6 years (range 40 to 77). Minimum followup was 10 years (average 12. 3 years; range 10 to 15. 3 years.). Three knees (6. 8 %) had been revised, one each for aseptic loosening, bearing dislocation and infection. Mean preoperative KSS of 33 improved to 91 postoperatively. Mean preoperative functional score of 45 improved to 76 postoperatively. Mean preoperative flexion of 113 ° (90 °- 140 °) reduced to 102 ° (80 °- 135 °) postoperatively. Erratic femoral rollback and tighter flexion gap to prevent spin out are the probable factors for decreased postoperative range of motion. Five (12 %) patients could sit <b>cross-legged</b> and sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Anterior knee pain was present in 4. 6 % (2 / 44 knees). The survival was 93. 2 % at 12. 3 years. One patient (1. 8 %) had spin-out of the rotating bearing. No knee had osteolysis or progressive radiolucent lines on X-rays. Conclusion: LCS implant has given good survival (93. 2 % at 12. 3 years) with low rates of spin-out and anterior knee pain and no incidence of osteolysis. Limited flexion post surgery (104 °) with only 12 % managing to sit cross legged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> is a drawback...|$|R

60|$|Followed by Benjy {{with the}} saddle-bags, {{we went down}} the steps set in the levee into this strange, foreign city. It was like unto nothing we had ever seen, nor can I give an {{adequate}} notion of how it affected us,--such a mixture it seemed of dirt and poverty and wealth and romance. The narrow, muddy streets ran with filth, and on each side along the houses was a sun-baked walk held up by the curved sides of broken flatboats, where two men might scarcely pass. The houses, too, had an odd and foreign look, some of wood, some of upright logs and plaster, and newer ones, Spanish in style, of adobe, with curving roofs of red tiles and strong eaves spreading over the banquette (as the sidewalk was called), casting shadows on lemon-colored walls. Since New Orleans was in a swamp, the older houses {{for the most part}} were lifted some seven feet above the ground, and many of these houses had wide galleries on the street side. Here and there a shop was set in the wall; a watchmaker was to be seen poring over his work at a tiny window, a shoemaker <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Again, at an open wicket, we caught a glimpse through a cool archway into a flowering court-yard. Stalwart negresses with bright kerchiefs made way for us on the banquette.

6000|$|His relish for an odd flavor in {{his friends}} had led {{him to make the}} {{acquaintance}} of a number of people outside of Rowland's well-ordered circle, and he made no secret of their being very queer fish. He formed an intimacy, among others, with a crazy fellow who had come to Rome as an emissary of one of the Central American republics, to drive some ecclesiastical bargain with the papal government. The Pope had given him the cold shoulder, but since he had not prospered as a diplomatist, he had sought compensation as a man of the world, and his great flamboyant curricle and negro lackeys were for several weeks one of the striking ornaments of the Pincian. He spoke a queer jargon of Italian, Spanish, French, and English, humorously relieved with scraps of ecclesiastical Latin, and to those who inquired of Roderick what he found to interest him in such a fantastic jackanapes, the latter would reply, looking at his interlocutor with his lucid blue eyes, that it was worth any sacrifice to hear him talk nonsense! The two had gone together one night to a ball given by a lady of some renown in the Spanish colony, and very late, on his way home, Roderick came up to Rowland's rooms, in whose windows he had seen a light. Rowland was going to bed, but Roderick flung himself into an armchair and chattered for an hour. The friends of the Costa Rican envoy were as amusing as himself, and in very much the same line. The mistress of the house had worn a yellow satin dress, and gold heels to her slippers, and {{at the close of the}} entertainment had sent for a pair of castanets, tucked up her petticoats, and danced a fandango, while the gentlemen sat <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> [...] "It was awfully low," [...] Roderick said; [...] "all of a sudden I perceived it, and bolted. Nothing of that kind ever amuses me to the end: before it 's half over it bores me to death; it makes me sick. Hang it, why can't a poor fellow enjoy things in peace? My illusions are all broken-winded; they won't carry me twenty paces! I can't laugh and forget; my laugh dies away before it begins. Your friend Stendhal writes on his book-covers (I never got farther) that he has seen too early in life la beaute parfaite. I don't know how early he saw it; I saw it before I was born--in another state of being! I can't describe it positively; I can only say I don't find it anywhere now. Not at the bottom of champagne glasses; not, strange as it may seem, in that extra half-yard or so of shoulder that some women have their ball-dresses cut to expose. I don't find it at merry supper-tables, where half a dozen ugly men with pomatumed heads are rapidly growing uglier still with heat and wine; not when I come away and walk through these squalid black streets, and go out into the Forum and see a few old battered stone posts standing there like gnawed bones stuck into the earth. Everything is mean and dusky and shabby, and the men and women who make up this so-called brilliant society are the meanest and shabbiest of all. They have no real spontaneity; they are all cowards and popinjays. They have no more dignity than so many grasshoppers. Nothing is good but one!"
