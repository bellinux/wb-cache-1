His friend, Julian, a special newspaper correspondent, is {{mistaken for a}} spy and dragged to the camp, but Wladimir defuses the situation. Julian and Wladimir reminisce about his Fatinitza disguise, which eventually leads the soldiers to <b>consider</b> <b>some</b> amateur theatre, to relieve the boredom. As no women are present, Wladimir resumes his Fatinitza disguise.|$|E

The most basic preparation {{is that people who}} have body hair on the chest {{may want to}} remove the hair by clipping just prior to surgery or using a depilatory agent (preoperative shaving has been on the decline as it can cause skin breakage and increase infection risk of any surgical procedure) as the surgery will involve bandages and monitoring equipment to be affixed to the body.|$|E
25|$|Some {{skills are}} {{generally}} accepted by recreational diver certification agencies as necessary for any scuba diver {{to be considered}} competent to dive without direct supervision, and others are more advanced, though some diver certification and accreditation organizations may <b>consider</b> <b>some</b> of these to also be essential for minimum acceptable entry level competence. Divers are instructed and assessed on these skills during basic and advanced training, {{and are expected to}} remain competent at their level of certification, either by practice or refresher courses.|$|E

A second concept launched optical trackers into space {{in the path of}} the incoming missiles, and used their data to fine-tune the launch of unguided rockets that would work at longer ranges. As this had no radar component, it would bypass provisions in the ABM treaty over the number and placement of radar sites.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} basic {{areas of concern}} to various groups. The first set of {{concerns}} surround relatively common rodeo practices, {{such as the use}} of bucking straps, also known as flank straps, the use of metal or electric cattle prods, and tail-twisting. The second set of concerns surround non-traditional rodeo events that operate outside the rules of sanctioning organizations. These are usually amateur events such as mutton busting, calf dressing, wild cow milking, calf riding, chuck wagon races, and other events designed primarily for publicity, half-time entertainment or crowd participation. Finally, some groups <b>consider</b> <b>some</b> or all rodeo events themselves to be cruel.|$|E
25|$|After {{staying on}} during the fifteenth season under Williams for a brief {{handover}} period, Holmes also left the programme, and his replacement, Anthony Read, worked with Williams, who was told to create a less violent and more humour-based approach, much to Baker's liking. The actor now felt very possessive of the part and frequently argued with directors over his inclusion of ad-libbed lines, but he was extremely pleased when the levity of the show increased even further after the departure of Read and the hiring of Douglas Adams as script editor for season seventeen in 1979. Some fans have criticised Adams for introducing {{too much of the}} sort of humorous content that served him well in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. However, others <b>consider</b> <b>some</b> of Adams' scripts to be among the series' high points, with City of Death (1979) being the primary example.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{production dates}} {{of some of}} Euripides' plays are known from ancient records, such as lists of prize-winners at the Dionysia, and approximations are obtained for the remainder by various means. Both the playwright and his work were travestied by comic poets such as Aristophanes, the known dates of whose own plays thus serve as a terminus ad quem for those of Euripides, though sometimes the gap can be considerable (e.g. twenty-seven years separate Telephus, {{known to have been}} produced in 438 BC, from its parody in Thesmophoriazusae in 411 BC.) References in Euripides' plays to contemporary events provide a terminus a quo, though sometimes the references might even precede a datable event (e.g. lines 1074–89 in Ion describe a procession to Eleusis, which was probably written before the Spartans occupied it during the Peloponnesian War). Other indications of dating are obtained by stylometry and this section therefore is an appropriate place to <b>consider</b> <b>some</b> aspects of his style as a Greek poet.|$|E

500|$|At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010, Konami {{displayed}} a technical demo for the Nintendo 3DS entitled Metal Gear Solid 3D: Snake Eater – The Naked Sample. The demo's subtitle [...] "The Naked Sample" [...] {{was meant to}} convey its purpose as just {{a sample of the}} 3DS hardware, with no plans to bring a game to production at that point. Series producer Hideo Kojima stated at the time that if a Metal Gear game for the 3DS was actually made they would <b>consider</b> <b>some</b> elements from the PlayStation Portable title , including the game's cooperative gameplay system. Later in 2010, Konami announced a full Metal Gear title for release on the 3DS, which was revealed at Nintendo World 2011 to be Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D. It was released on February 21, 2012 in North America and March 8, 2012 worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The {{association}} with a proven and popular children's brand focusing on potentially sensitive subjects enabled the TV series to deflect any serious controversy regarding the same subjects, {{as they had}} demonstrably already been presented to children without any ill effects. Senior writer Steve Punt {{said that there were}} in fact very few complaints regarding the initial series' content, adding that [...] "everyone was very relieved". The producers did <b>consider</b> <b>some</b> topics intrinsically unsuited for an irreverent comic treatment, as for instance the Holocaust or the harsher details of slavery, and avoided them accordingly. Norris has described her personal criteria for age suitability as whether she would be nervous watching it with a ten-year-old. While BBC executives in large part were willing to concede the requirements of reflecting historical realities, some topics, notably suicide, needed careful handling to avoid potentially negative impact on younger viewers. The show sometimes acknowledged particularly emotive subject matter (the World War I Christmas truce, for example) by following up the sketch not with a joke, but a more sombre elaboration of the less comedic details.|$|E
500|$|Fundamental in {{this view}} of {{conscience}} is that humans <b>consider</b> <b>some</b> [...] "other" [...] as being in a social relationship. Thus, nationalism is invoked in conscience to quell tribal conflict {{and the notion of}} a Brotherhood of Man is invoked to quell national conflicts. Yet such crowd drives may not only overwhelm but redefine individual conscience. Friedrich Nietzsche stated: [...] "communal solidarity is annihilated by the highest and strongest drives that, when they break out passionately, whip the individual far past the average low level of the 'herd-conscience.' Jeremy Bentham noted that: [...] "fanaticism never sleeps... it is never stopped by conscience; for it has pressed conscience into its service." [...] Hannah Arendt in her study of the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem, notes that the accused, as with almost all his fellow Germans, had lost track of his conscience {{to the point where they}} hardly remembered it; this wasn't caused by familiarity with atrocities or by psychologically redirecting any resultant natural pity to themselves for having to bear such an unpleasant duty, so much as by the fact that anyone whose conscience did develop doubts could see no one who shared them: [...] "Eichmann did not need to close his ears to the voice of conscience... not because he had none, but because his conscience spoke with a [...] "respectable voice", with the voice of the respectable society around him".|$|E
