40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} concept of employee well-being, {{with a view to}} uncover additional and useful ways in which it can be enhanced in individuals. Previous literature in this area had primarily focused on ways in which to enhance the mental health of the general adult population, and had thus remained relatively silent about work specific types of interventions. Preliminary findings have suggested, however, that various forms of activities may form the basis for an effective intervention aimed at working populations. Specifically, previous research suggests that the practice of job crafting may provide employees with an effective way in which to enhance their engagement and job satisfaction. Hence, the research conducted in this dissertation addresses two primary questions: (1) : How do researchers empirically measure job crafting, and are job <b>crafting</b> <b>activities</b> empirically distinguishable along the three dimensions of task, relational, and cognitive forms of job crafting?; (2) Does job crafting yield a significant relationship with employee well-being, and if so, what are the theoretical mechanisms that explain this relationship? A scale validation study was conducted to examine the subcomponents of job crafting and whether job <b>crafting</b> <b>activities</b> are empirically distinguishable along the task, relational, and cognitive forms of crafting. The Job Crafting Questionnaire was the outcome of this study and it provides researchers with a new and theoretically driven tool that they can continue to validate and progress job crafting research. A model is then proposed and tested which suggests that job <b>crafting</b> <b>activities</b> predict the three intrinsic employee needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which, in turn, predict employee well-being. This empirical model was supported in a sample of 253 working adults and hence provides some of the first empirical insights as to the efficacy of job <b>crafting</b> <b>activities</b> in enhancing employee mental health. This research offers practitioners a useful underpinning to guide the development of interventions aimed at enhancing employee mental health and well-being...|$|R
