The first-best cannot be achieved whenever constitutional rules cannot be made contingent on {{information about the}} costs and benefits of policy reforms. We characterize and welfare rank four classes of second best constitutions: <b>constitutions</b> <b>that</b> specify one rule for all types of decisions; <b>constitutions</b> <b>that</b> provide incentives for information about costs and benefits to be revealed; <b>constitutions</b> <b>that</b> allow for vetoes from interested parties and <b>constitutions</b> <b>that</b> specify different rules for different policy areas. In addition, we provide conditions for the existence of amendment rules that allow for changes to the original constitutional rules after the constitutional stage. Finally, we provide a new rationale for the existence of checks and balances. constitutions, social contracts, majority rules, bill of rights, vetoes, referenda, amendments, checks and balances...|$|R

We characterise two classes of second-best constitution, both with clear analogues in real world constitutions: i) incentive scheme (IS) <b>constitutions</b> <b>that</b> elicit information about the type of decision through costly decision rule switching procedures, and ii) linking scheme (LS) <b>constitutions</b> <b>that</b> grant limited veto powers to interested parties.

5|$|Mississippi was {{the poorest}} {{state in the}} U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta {{counties}} {{were some of the}} poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 ($ in 2013 dollars). For black families, the figure was $462 ($ in 2013 dollars). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new <b>constitution</b> <b>that</b> raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow laws.|$|E

However, broader considerations were anyway leading the British towards support for an independent Sudan despite attempts by the United States to persuade them to give Egypt a role.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed keyword {{analysis of the}} 142 out of 198 national <b>constitutions</b> <b>that</b> include at least one reference to the environment as of 2010. Out of these 142 constitutions, 125 contain provisions that are explicitly related to environmental human rights, and ten include a direct human right to water. Focusing mostly on {{the language of the}} provisions and the age of the constitutions (not the age of the provision itself), the analysis provides insight into the extent to which countries are taking environmental human rights seriously. The findings note <b>that</b> <b>constitutions</b> <b>that</b> reference the environment are, on average, generally younger in age than those that do not. This is also the case for developing versus developed countries, and Non-OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) versus OECD member countries. <b>Constitutions</b> <b>that</b> have a direct human right to water are, on average, even younger. The paper also develops a simple index of the legal strength of constitutional environmental human rights provisions and offers the data as an alternative, positive (versus subjective) specification to a similar set of data compiled by the Toronto Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (TIESR).

5|$|A popular Congressman {{and former}} Army officer, Hayes was {{considered}} by Ohio Republicans {{to be an}} excellent standard-bearer for the 1867 election campaign. Hayes's political views were more moderate than the Republican party's platform, although he agreed with the proposed amendment to the Ohio state <b>constitution</b> <b>that</b> would guarantee suffrage to black male Ohioans. Hayes's opponent, Allen G. Thurman, made the proposed amendment {{the centerpiece of the}} campaign and opposed black suffrage. Both men campaigned vigorously, making speeches across the state, mostly focusing on the suffrage question. The election was mostly a disappointment to Republicans, as the amendment failed to pass and Democrats gained a majority in the state legislature. Hayes thought at first that he, too, had lost, but the final tally showed that he had won the election by 2,983 votes of 484,603 votes cast.|$|E
