25|$|In Renaissance Europe, {{the arrival}} of {{mechanical}} movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication, which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led {{to the rise of}} proto-nationalism, and accelerated by the development of European vernacular languages, to the detriment of Latin's status as lingua franca. In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale.|$|E
25|$|This {{growth in}} the unofficial, {{alternative}} and uncensored <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> led a group including poet and translator Natalya Gorbanevskaya, writer Ilya Gabay and physicist Pavel Litvinov to consider organising a regular information bulletin. Rather than follow previous samizdat genres, the literary almanac (e.g. Phoenix, Syntaxis) or collections documenting a single trial (e.g. The White Book), the new periodical would process the steady flow of information by circulating regular reports and updates about searches, arrests, trials, conditions in prisons and camps and extrajudicial measures against protest and dissent — {{at least for the}} duration of 1968. That year marked the 20th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights and Nos 1–5 are titled Human Rights Year in the Soviet Union: until 1969 A Chronicle of Current Events was the sub-title of the periodical.|$|E

This also means that false news or rumors can spread speedily through social {{networking}} sites or emails. Being involved in the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> incorrect <b>information</b> is unethical. Mails and pop-ups are commonly used to spread the wrong information or give false alerts with the only intent of selling products. Mails from untrusted sources advertising certain products or spreading some hard-to-believe information, are not uncommon. Direct or indirect involvement in the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> false <b>information</b> is ethically wrong. Giving wrong information can hurt other parties or organizations that are affected by that particular theme.|$|R

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the role of}} the Internet and of the (techno) social networks in the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> political-electoral <b>information</b> and in the processes of influencing political opinion during the Campaign for the 2006 general elections in Italy. The basic hypothesis is that online information, which can strengthen, integrate, replace the information produced by traditional media, reaches some Internet users who then become sources <b>of</b> <b>information</b> for people who don’t use this medium and for other Internet users characterized by a more generic and recreational use of the medium (through the same Internet and computer mediated communication systems -chat, email, forum, instant messaging, blog, etc.). On a theoretical level, this work is rooted in the path undertaken by the recent communication research: careful about the unnumbered everyday possibilities of integration between online and offline experiences, this recent research considers Internet as mature technology of social relation, as well as powerful database <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> This contemporary communication research rethinks the conceptual and methodological instruments developed in order to study “offline” realities, by verifying their descriptive and interpretative potential with the mediated sociality. In fact, our research finds some conceptual and methodological suggestions {{in the tradition of the}} studies on personal influence and social networks in the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> political-electoral <b>information</b> (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, Gaudet, 1948, Katz, Lazarsfeld, 1955). This suggestions are the points of departure of other questions about the actuality of the two-step flow model of communication (developed in a very simple communication setting, characterized by a limited and privileged diffusion of the media) and about the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> political-electoral <b>information</b> through Internet supported and immediate social networks...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe current {{competition}} game implies processes like {{alliances with}} competitors, inclusion of customers and suppliers at {{early stages of}} innovation, relations with States, or anticipation of public acceptance. At the heart of all these processes and many others, information processing has become a key for surviving and competitive advantage reaching. The relevance and use <b>of</b> <b>information</b> {{has not always been}} considered as a relevant question for strategy making. Indeed, in classical economy equilibrium model, information is considered as complete and perfect, which implies that companies cannot get an advantage on information processing. Simon (1947) radically modified this perspective through developing the concept of bounded rationality, which implies that information cannot be complete and perfect at any time of decision-making processes. As information processing is inherent to organizational processes, companies can outperform if they can better process sensitive information. This paper proposes a study <b>of</b> strategic <b>information</b> <b>circulation</b> practices. By drawing from Simon and March's work (Feldman & March, 1981; March & Simon, 1958; Simon, 1947) on information, it positions practices <b>of</b> strategic <b>information</b> <b>circulation</b> as social practices, an approach which mirrors that of Strategy-as-Practice. This focus on social practices gives way to a greater understanding of how people access, collect and use <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> In this paper, we examine how companies organize the processes <b>of</b> strategic <b>information</b> <b>circulation</b> through various practices. By doing so, we propose an integrative metaphorical framework <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>circulation</b> practices consisting <b>of</b> a taxonomy of four modes of practices used in dealing with the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>information.</b> This framework provides a new understanding of the possibilities for companies to develop or enable the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>information.</b> This framework subsequently allows us to extend the current literature on strategic practices related to the use <b>of</b> strategic <b>information...</b>|$|R

P2P human dynamic affords a critical look at current authoritarian and centralized social structures. Peer-to-peer is also a political and social program for those who believe that in many cases, peer-to-peer modes are a preferable option. Anarchist scholar Uri Gordon has said that [...] "the collaborative development of free software like the Linux operating system and applications such as OpenOffice clearly approximate an informational anarchist communism. Moreover, for anarchists it is precisely the logic of expropriation and electronic piracy that enables a radical political extension of the cultural ideals of the free manipulation, <b>circulation</b> and use <b>of</b> <b>information</b> associated with the [...] "hacker ethic" [...] (Himanen 2001).
