5000|$|... #Caption: The {{high wing}} loading of procellariids {{requires}} a <b>high</b> <b>airspeed</b> to remain airborne, {{so in order}} to take off this Christmas shearwater (Puffinus nativitatis) must face into a strong wind. In calm conditions it must run in order to obtain a <b>high</b> <b>airspeed.</b>|$|R

50|$|While a {{helicopter}} accelerates into a <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed,</b> {{more and more}} of the rotor disk will be in clean air and the lift differential will decrease. At some <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed</b> the effect will disappear. In a typical single rotor helicopter, the effect can be felt to start at around 5-10 knots, increases in magnitude to a maximum around 20 knots, and decreases above that until it is almost completely gone by 40-60 knots of airspeed.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 February 1955: VP-22 {{received}} its first jet-assisted P2V-5F Neptune. The new aircraft had improved short field takeoff capability; the jet engines assisted in maintaining <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed</b> and altitude.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} open loop higher {{harmonic}} control (HHC) on rotor hub loads, performance, and push rod loads of a Sikorsky S- 76 helicopter rotor at <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds</b> (up to 200 knots) and moderate lift (10, 000 lbs) were studied analytically. The {{analysis was performed}} {{as part of a}} wind tunnel pre-test prediction and preparation procedure, as well as to provide analytical results for post-test correlation efforts. The test associated with this study is to be concluded in the 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel of the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at the NASA Ames Research Center. The results from this analytical study show that benefits from HHC can be achieved at <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds.</b> These results clear the way for conducting (with the requirement of safe pushrod loads) an open loop HHC test a <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds</b> in the 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel using an S- 76 rotor as the test article...|$|R
50|$|This formula {{shows that}} the radius of turn is {{proportional}} to the square of the aircraft’s true <b>airspeed.</b> With a <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed</b> the radius of turn is larger, and with a lower airspeed the radius is smaller.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{will need}} to achieve a <b>higher</b> true <b>airspeed</b> to attain the same lift - this implies both a longer takeoff roll and a <b>higher</b> true <b>airspeed</b> which must be maintained when airborne to avoid stalling.|$|R
2500|$|This formula {{shows that}} the radius of turn is {{proportional}} to the square of the aircraft’s true airspeed. [...] With a <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed</b> the radius of turn is larger, and with a lower airspeed the radius is smaller.|$|R
50|$|The G103C Twin III {{is a high}} {{performance}} tandem two-seat sailplane made by Grob Aircraft. It replaced the Twin II in production and features a new triple-trapezoidal wing, automatic elevator connection, lower control forces and <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed</b> limitations.|$|R
5000|$|The glider gains {{airspeed}} {{twice during}} the loop, when it pierces the boundary layer at an acute angle. Since the 180° turns retain {{most of the}} airspeed the glider completes the loop within the initial airmass at a <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Chordwise {{twisting}} loads due to {{aerodynamic effects}} at <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds</b> {{often associated with}} washout, {{and the use of}} ailerons resulting in control reversal. Further twisting loads are induced by changes of thrust settings to underwing-mounted engines. The [...] "D" [...] box construction is beneficial to reduce wing twisting.|$|R
40|$|Lewis number {{corrected}} for extremely <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds.</b> Algorithm calculates improved, variable {{value of}} Lewis number, factor in equation for heat-transfer coefficient at stagnation point of body in hypersonic flow mach numbers of approximately 25. New algorithm improves accuracy of calculations of heat generated by hot air acting on moving body...|$|R
25|$|In 1944 Martin was {{approached}} by the Air Staff after a fatal accident with the jet-powered Gloster F.9/40 (Gloster Meteor prototype). They asked for an escape system that forcibly ejected the pilot from an aircraft and was powerful enough to clear the tail surfaces at <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds.</b> German and Swedish engineers were investigating the same problem, but Martin was unaware of this.|$|R
25|$|As {{with other}} bats, the {{metabolism}} of these bats follows a U-shape during flight. This {{means that they}} use the most energy when flying at low and <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds,</b> and use less energy at moderate speeds. Most of their flights to find food are relatively close, because they can bring back smaller fruit to their roosts, but just still eat bigger fruits at the tree.|$|R
25|$|Increases in {{the control}} surface area {{required}} by large aircraft or higher loads caused by <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds</b> in small aircraft lead to a large increase in the forces needed to move them, consequently complicated mechanical gearing arrangements were developed to extract maximum mechanical advantage {{in order to reduce}} the forces required from the pilots. This arrangement can be found on bigger or higher performance propeller aircraft such as the Fokker 50.|$|R
50|$|Balancing lift {{across the}} rotor disc is {{important}} to a helicopter's stability. The amount of lift generated by an airfoil {{is proportional to the}} square of its airspeed. In a zero airspeed hover the rotor blades, regardless of their position in rotation, have equal airspeeds and therefore equal lift. In forward flight the advancing blade has a <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed</b> than the retreating blade, creating unequal lift across the rotor disc.|$|R
5000|$|Lift/drag ratio also {{determines the}} glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is {{based only on}} the {{relationship}} of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. The only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for - a heavier aircraft gliding at a <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed</b> will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time.|$|R
5000|$|The key NTSC {{finding is}} that the {{aircraft}} was flown by the Pilot in Command (PIC) at an excessively steep descent and <b>high</b> <b>airspeed</b> (241 kts rather than the normal 141 kts) during the approach and landing, resulting in unstable flight. The PIC's attention became fixated on {{trying to make the}} first approach work, and he failed to heed the warnings of the copilot and his recommendations to abort the landing and go around, and the repeated warnings from the aircraft flight systems, which were audible in the voice recorder data, e.g. [...] "Sink rate" [...] and ‘Whoop whoop, pull up". The copilot failed {{to take control of the}} aircraft in these extraordinary circumstances, as required by airline policy, apparently due to inadequate training. Wing flaps were not fully extended to the maximum 40°, not even to the 15° repeatedly requested by the captain, but only to 5° because the copilot was aware that this was the recommended maximum for that <b>high</b> <b>airspeed,</b> but he failed to notify the captain.|$|R
50|$|Rocket sleds {{were used}} {{extensively}} {{early in the}} Cold War to accelerate equipment considered too experimental (hazardous) for testing directly in piloted aircraft. The equipment to be tested under high acceleration or <b>high</b> <b>airspeed</b> conditions was installed along with appropriate instrumentation, data recording and telemetry equipment on the sled. The sled was then accelerated according to the experiment's design requirements for data collection along a length of isolated, precisely level and straight test track.|$|R
50|$|Version {{with longer}} {{fuselage}} with greater fuel load and powered by J33 engine. Most re-engined with J42s. F9F-4s {{were the first}} aircraft to successfully employ pressurized bleed air, tapped from the engine's compressor stages, and blown {{across the surface of}} the slot flaps, simulating a <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed</b> across the control surface, and thus achieving a decrease in stalling speed of 9 kn for takeoff and 7 kn on power approach for landing.|$|R
50|$|A spin {{differs from}} a spiral dive in which neither wing is stalled {{and which is}} {{characterized}} by a low angle of attack and <b>high</b> <b>airspeed.</b> A spiral dive is not a type of spin because neither wing is stalled. In a spiral dive, the aircraft will respond conventionally to the pilot's inputs to the flight controls and recovery from a spiral dive requires a different set of actions from those required to recover from a spin.|$|R
50|$|When landing from an autorotation, the {{kinetic energy}} {{stored in the}} {{rotating}} blades is used to decrease the rate of descent and make a soft landing. A greater amount of rotor energy is required to stop a helicopter with {{a high rate of}} descent than is required to stop a helicopter that is descending more slowly. Therefore, autorotative descents at very low or very <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds</b> are more critical than those performed at the minimum rate of descent airspeed.|$|R
25|$|In 1951, the Air Force {{announced}} a competition {{to develop a}} compound helicopter, an aircraft that could take off and land vertically, like a helicopter, but could cruise at <b>higher</b> <b>airspeeds</b> than conventional helicopters. The joint research program was being conducted by the Air Force's Research and Development Command and the Army's Transportation Corps. Bell Aircraft submitted the design for the XV-3, Sikorsky Aircraft submitted the S-57, a retracting rotor design, and McDonnell submitted a design modified from its Model M-28 design.|$|R
2500|$|The Bell 533 was a {{research}} helicopter built by Bell Helicopter under contract with the United States Army during the 1960s, to explore the limits and conditions experienced by helicopter rotors at <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds.</b> The helicopter was a YH-40—a preproduction version of the UH-1 Iroquois—modified and tested in several helicopter and compound helicopter configurations. The Bell 533 {{was referred to as}} the High Performance Helicopter (HPH) by the Army, and reached a top speed of [...] in 1969, before being retired.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the wing}} rotates and the boomerang {{moves through the}} air, this creates airflow over the wings and this creates lift on both [...] "wings". However, during {{one-half}} of each blade's rotation, it sees a <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed,</b> because the rotation tip-speed and the forward speed add, {{and when it is}} in {{the other half of the}} rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed. Thus if thrown nearly upright each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom.|$|R

25|$|Contributing {{factors include}} the following: first, the first officer's {{predisposition}} to overreact to wake turbulence; second, the training provided by American Airlines {{that could have}} encouraged pilots to make large flight control inputs; third, the first officer likely not understanding an airplane's response to large rudder inputs at <b>high</b> <b>airspeeds</b> or the mechanism by which the rudder rolls a transport-category airplane; finally, light rudder pedal forces and small pedal displacement of the A300-600 rudder pedal system increased the airplane's susceptibility to a rudder misuse.|$|R
50|$|Modern gliders {{often use}} water ballast {{carried in the}} wings to {{increase}} wing loading when soaring conditions are strong. By increasing the wing loading the average speed achieved across country can be increased {{to take advantage of}} strong thermals. With a higher wing loading, a given lift-to-drag ratio is achieved at a <b>higher</b> <b>airspeed</b> than with a lower wing loading, and this allows a faster average speed across country. The ballast can be ejected overboard when conditions weaken to maximize glider cross-country speed in gliding competitions.|$|R

25|$|In 1985, {{near the}} Sauk-Prairie airport shortly after takeoff, Alan was {{involved}} in a fatal mid-air collision where his airplane lost a portion of its wing, including half of the aileron. The other plane spun into the ground killing the pilot, but Alan was able to maneuver a landing back on the runway by keeping <b>high</b> <b>airspeed</b> and using full aileron deflection. From surviving this incident, Alan sought to make flying safer—ultimately leading to the brothers' pursuit of implementing a parachute on all their designs starting in the mid-1990s.|$|R
40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{conducted}} in a CV- 990 jet transport with engines at idle power to investigate aircraft airframe noise. Test results showed that airframe noise was measured for the aircraft in the landing configuration. The results agreed well with the expected variation with the fifth power of velocity. For the aircraft in the clean configuraton, {{it was concluded that}} airframe noise was measured only at <b>higher</b> <b>airspeeds</b> with engine idle noise present at lower speeds. The data show that landing gear and flaps make a significant contribution to airframe noise...|$|R
40|$|Sources of {{helicopter}} {{rotor hub}} inplane shears are identified using simplified equations {{and the full}} aeroelastic analysis code, CAMRAD/JA (Johnson, 1988). Analytical results are obtained for an articulated rotor operating at moderate thrust and <b>high</b> <b>airspeed.</b> It is found that the blade chordwise inplane shear, which includes the aerodynamic component, the Coriolis contribution, and the inertial component, and the hub inplane shears are strongly dependent on the out-of-plane response. The sources of helicopter rotor hub inplane shears lie {{not only in the}} inplane response but depend on the flap and elastic flatwise responses/modes...|$|R

50|$|One or more lifting {{surfaces}} can {{be attached}} to a fuselage by means of features called anchors. An anchor {{is a set of}} slender panels that belong to the fuselage and serve as a bridge between the root of a wing and the panels of the fuselage. Anchors are needed to provide a transition in the circulation of both surfaces, i.e., to properly model a physical connection between both of them. Without anchors, the gap between the two surfaces would leak, creating regions of very <b>high</b> <b>airspeed</b> and a consequent wrong prediction of the air-loads.|$|R
40|$|Migrating {{birds are}} {{expected}} to fly at <b>higher</b> <b>airspeeds</b> when minimizing time rather than energy costs of their migratory journeys. Spring migration has often been suggested to be more time selected than autumn migration, because of the advantage of early arrival at breeding sites. We have earlier demonstrated that nocturnal passerine migrants fly at <b>higher</b> <b>airspeeds</b> during spring compared to autumn, supporting time-selected spring migration. In this study, we test the hypothesis that seasonal airspeeds are modulated differently between short- and long-distance migrants, because of a stronger element of time selection for autumn migration over long distances. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that the seasonal difference in airspeed is significantly larger (spring airspeed exceeding autumn airspeed {{by a factor of}} 1. 16 after correcting for the influence of altitude, wind and climb/descent on airspeed) among short-distance compared to long-distance (factor 1. 12) migrants. This result is based on a large sample of tracking radar data from 3 years at Falsterbo, South Sweden. Short-distance migrants also tend to fly with more favourable winds during autumn, indicating relaxed time constraints (being able to afford to wait for favourable winds) compared to long-distance migrants. These results indicate surprisingly fine-tuned seasonal modulation of airspeed and responses to wind, associated with behavioural strategies adapted to different levels of time selection pressures during spring and autumn migration...|$|R
