40|$|Parameterized {{password}} guessability—how many guesses {{a particular}} <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithm</b> with particular training data {{would take to}} guess a password—has become a common metric of password security. Unlike statistical metrics, it aims to model real-world attackers and to provide per-password strength estimates. We investigate how cracking approaches often used by researchers compare to real-world cracking by profes-sionals, {{as well as how}} the choice of approach biases research conclusions. We find that semi-automated cracking by profession-als outperforms popular fully automated approaches, but can be approximated by combining multiple such ap-proaches. These approaches are only effective, however, with careful configuration and tuning; in commonly used default configurations, they underestimate the real-world guessability of passwords. We find that analyses of large password sets are often robust to the algorithm used for guessing {{as long as it is}} configured effectively. However, cracking algorithms differ systematically in their effec-tiveness guessing passwords with certain common fea-tures (e. g., character substitutions). This has important implications for analyzing the security of specific pass-word characteristics or of individual passwords (e. g., in a password meter or security audit). Our results highlight the danger of relying only on a single <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithm</b> as a measure of password strength and constitute the first scientific evidence that automated guessing can often ap-proximate guessing by professionals. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{research on}} passwords, empirical studies of password strength {{have been limited}} by {{lack of access to}} plaintext passwords, small data sets, and password sets specifically collected for a research study or from low-value accounts. Properties of pass-words used for high-value accounts thus remain poorly understood. We fill this gap by studying the single-sign-on passwords used by over 25, 000 faculty, staff, and students at a research university with a complex password policy. Key aspects of our contributions rest on our (indirect) access to plaintext passwords. We describe our data collection methodology, particularly the many precautions we took to minimize risks to users. We then analyze how guessable the collected passwords would be during an offline attack by sub-jecting them to a state-of-the-art password <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithm.</b> We discover significant correlations between a number of demographi...|$|E
40|$|To {{encourage}} strong passwords, system administrators employ password-composition policies, such as {{a traditional}} policy requiring that passwords have at least 8 characters from 4 character classes and pass a dictionary check. Recent research has suggested, however, that policies requiring longer passwords with fewer additional requirements can be more usable {{and in some cases}} more secure than this traditional policy. To explore long passwords in more detail, we conducted an online experiment with 8, 143 participants. Using a <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithm</b> modified for longer passwords, we evaluate eight policies across a variety of metrics for strength and usability. Among the longer policies, we discover new evidence for a security/usability tradeoff, with none being strictly better than another on both dimensions. However, several policies are both more usable and more secure that the traditional policy we tested. Our analyses additionally reveal common patterns and strings found in cracked passwords. We discuss how system administrators can use these results to improve password-composition policies...|$|E
40|$|Database {{cracking}} {{has been}} an area of active research in recent years. The core idea of database cracking is to create indexes adaptively and incrementally as a side product of query processing. Several works have proposed different cracking techniques for different aspects including updates, tuple reconstruction, convergence, concurrency control, and robustness. Our 2014 VLDB paper “The Uncracked Pieces in Database Cracking” (PVLDB 7 : 97 – 108, 2013 /VLDB 2014) was the first comparative study of these different methods by an independent group. In this article, we extend our published experimental study on database cracking {{and bring it to}} an up-to-date state. Our goal is to critically review several aspects, identify the potential, and propose promising directions in database cracking. With this study, we hope to expand the scope of database cracking and possibly leverage cracking in database engines other than MonetDB. We repeat several prior database cracking works including the core <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithms</b> as well as three other works on convergence (hybrid cracking), tuple reconstruction (sideways cracking), and robustness (stochastic cracking), respectively. Additionally to our conference paper, we now also look at a recently published study about CPU efficiency (predication cracking). We evaluate these works and show possible directions to do even better. As a further extension, we evaluate the whole class of parallel <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithms</b> that were proposed in three recent works. Altogether, in this work we revisit 8 papers on database cracking and evaluate in total 18 cracking methods, 6 sorting algorithms, and 3 full index structures. Additionally, we test cracking under a variety of experimental settings, including high selectivity (Low selectivity means that many entries qualify. Consequently, a high selectivity means, that only few entries qualify) queries, low selectivity queries, varying selectivity, and multiple query access patterns. Finally, we compare cracking against different sorting algorithms as well as against different main memory optimized indexes, including the recently proposed adaptive radix tree (ART). Our results show that: (1) the previously proposed <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithms</b> are repeatable, (2) there is still enough room to significantly improve the previously proposed <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithms,</b> (3) parallelizing <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithms</b> efficiently is a hard task, (4) cracking depends heavily on query selectivity, (5) cracking needs to catch up with modern indexing trends, and (6) different indexing algorithms have different indexing signatures.

40|$|Adaptive {{indexing}} is {{a concept}} that considers index creation in databases as a by-product of query processing; as opposed to traditional full index creation where the indexing effort is performed up front before answering any queries. Adaptive indexing has received a considerable amount of attention, and several algorithms have been proposed over the past few years; including a recent experimental study comparing a large number of existing methods. Until now, however, most adaptive indexing algorithms have been designed single-threaded, yet with multi-core systems already well established, the idea of designing parallel algorithms for adaptive indexing is very natural. In this regard only one parallel algorithm for adaptive indexing has recently appeared in the literature: The parallel version of standard cracking. In this paper we describe three alternative parallel algorithms for adaptive indexing, including a second variant of a parallel standard <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithm.</b> Additionally, we describe a hybrid parallel sorting algorithm, and a NUMA-aware method based on sorting. We then thoroughly compare all these algorithms experimentally; along a variant of a recently published parallel version of radix sort. Parallel sorting algorithms serve as a realistic baseline for multi-threaded adaptive indexing techniques. In total we experimentally compare seven parallel algorithms. Additionally, we extensively profile all considered algorithms. The initial set of experiments considered in this paper indicates that our parallel algorithms significantly improve over previously known ones. Our results suggest that, although adaptive indexing algorithms are a good design choice in single-threaded environments, the rules change considerably in the parallel case. That is, in future highly-parallel environments, sorting algorithms could be serious alternatives to adaptive indexing. Comment: 26 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|To keep {{password}} users from creating {{simple and}} common passwords, major websites and applications provide a password-strength measure, namely a password checker that displays instant password strength ratings in levels e. g., “strong”, “mod- erate”, and “weak”. While critical requirements for a password checker to be strin- gent have {{prevailed in the}} study of password security, we find that regardless of the stringency, such static checkers can leak information and actually help the adversary enhance the performance of their attacks. To address this weakness, we propose and devise the Dynamic Password Policy Generator, namely DPPG, to be an effective and usable alternative to the existing password strength checker. DPPG aims to enforce an evenly-distributed password space and generate dynamic policies for users to cre- ate passwords that are diverse and contribute to the overall security of the password database. Since DPPG is modular and can function with different underlying metrics for policy generation, we further introduce a diversity-based password security metric that evaluates the security of a password database in terms of password space and distribution.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} defect detection on complex textural surfaces. In general, whether the texture to be inspected is regular or random, in image terms it is characterized by local variations in pixel grey level values. These normal variations render the problem of texture defect detection extremely difficult as defects are often manifested by grey level changes and their detection requires more than mere pixel comparisons. In the thesis, classical techniques on texture representation are studied and various existing texture defect detection algorithms are reviewed. Three novel algorithms {{have been developed to}} tackle the problem of defect detection on random or regular textures. The first two are devoted to the problem of crack detection and the third algorithm is devoted to the problem of detecting regional defects. For texture crack detection, a cojoint spatial and spatial frequency representation, that is, wigner distribution is proposed to model the inspected texture surface. A detailed analysis of the wigner distribution, its properties and the effect of windowing on its crack detection performance are carried out. Two postprocessing methods, ie, probabilistic relaxation labelling and linear filtering are incorporated into the <b>crack</b> detection <b>algorithm</b> to refine the results. The potential of the Wigner model has also been explored by modifying the <b>crack</b> detection <b>algorithm</b> so as to detect other types of defects. For real world applications, an efficient <b>crack</b> detection <b>algorithm</b> based on a new distribution is proposed. The algorithm is shown to produce comparable results but in much shorter time. For regional defect detection, a hybrid chromato-structural approach to colour texture representation is proposed where combined colour texture information is extracted from various chromatic classes associated with the inspected surface. In the approach, a unified defect detection framework which combines a new colour clustering scheme, morphological smoothing and blob analysis are used to capture the relevant combined colour texture information. With this framework, good defect detection results are obtained and presented in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Variant Stochastic {{cracking}} is {{a significantly}} more resilient approach to adaptive indexing. It showed [1]that Stochastic cracking uses each query as a hint {{on how to}} reorganize data, but not blindly so; it gains resilience and avoids performance bottlenecks by deliberately applying certain arbitrary choices in its decision making. Therefore bring, adaptive indexing forward to a mature formulation that confers the workload-robustness that previous approaches lacked. Original cracking relies on the randomness of the workloads to converge well. [2][3] However, where the workload is non-random, cracking needs to introduce randomness on its own. Stochastic Cracking clearly improves over original cracking by being robust in workload changes while maintaining all original cracking features {{when it comes to}} adaptation. But looking at both types of cracking, it conveyed an incomplete picture as at some point of time it is must to know whether the workload is random or sequential. In this paper our focus is on optimization of variant stochastic cracking, that could be achieved in two ways either by reducing the initialization cost to make stochastic cracking even more transparent to the user, especially for queries that initiate a workload change and hence incur a higher cost or by combining the strengths of the various stochastic <b>cracking</b> <b>algorithms</b> via a dynamic component that decides which algorithm to choose for a query on the fly.
