5|$|France's {{blockade}} {{had lasted}} for two years, and the 'American' government, inspired by 'American' spirit, was facing off with France, European principles, European pretensions. The social {{results of the}} French blockade, however, had been fruitful for the Argentine Republic, and served to demonstrate in all their nakedness {{the current state of}} mind and the new elements of struggle, which were to ignite a fierce war that <b>can</b> <b>end</b> only with the fall of that monstrous government.|$|E
5|$|Every so often, {{the player}} {{will come to}} a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game <b>can</b> <b>end</b> prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E
5|$|Homeworld is a {{real-time}} strategy game set in space. Gameplay, {{as in most}} real-time strategy titles, {{is focused}} on gathering resources, building military forces, and using them to destroy enemy forces and accomplish an objective. The game includes both single-player and multiplayer modes; the single-player mode consists of one story-driven campaign, broken up into levels. In each level, the player has an objective to accomplish before they <b>can</b> <b>end</b> the level, though the ultimate objective of the mission can change as the level's story unfolds. Between each of the 16 levels is a hand-drawn, black-and-white cutscene with narrative voiceovers.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of a high-quality double seam is dependent on several factors, including conformity to the set <b>can</b> and <b>end</b> specifications, {{the quality of the}} seamer tooling used and its compliance with the <b>can</b> and <b>end</b> being used, the condition of the seaming machine and the setup of the seaming rolls, lifter pressure and other components. When the machinery is set up correctly and the incoming materials (<b>cans,</b> <b>ends,</b> tooling, etc.) comply to the set specifications, the result should be ideal first and second operation seams.|$|R

5|$|The game tasks {{the player}} with {{navigating}} a bus through roads filled with alien potato beings. The player's bus holds female {{members of the}} alien race, and the player can shoot the females {{from the front of}} the bus in order to clear the alien potatoes. The aliens come in two colors: red and blue. Aliens are cleared from the road when two like-colored potatoes touch each other, but aliens begin to pile up in the road if two aliens hit each other that are not of the same color. The road is continuously scrolling downwards, forcing the player to make holes in the road wide enough to fit the bus through. The game <b>can</b> <b>end</b> prematurely if the player runs into too many aliens and loses all their lives.|$|E
5|$|The mysterious man {{is named}} Saavedro. Twenty years earlier, Atrus' wayward sons Sirrus and Achenar {{destroyed}} Saavedro's home Age of Narayan and trapped him on J'nanin. Saavedro believes {{his family is}} dead and swears vengeance on Atrus, unaware that Atrus has already imprisoned his sons for their crimes and that Saavedro's family is still alive. The game <b>can</b> <b>end</b> several ways depending on the player's actions. In the most ideal scenario, Saavedro returns to Narayan peacefully after giving back the book of Releeshahn. Other endings result in Saavedro destroying Releeshahn or killing the player; another option allows the player to leave Saavedro trapped forever.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of Alexandria put more trust in Rick's group {{to protect the}} town better. A group known as the Wolves use a zombie horde to attack Alexandria, and many lives are lost before the living regain control. While recovering, they learn of a community called the Hilltop, who offer to help trade supplies if they <b>can</b> <b>end</b> {{the threat of the}} extortionist Saviors led by a man named Negan. Although Rick's group decimate one Savior outpost, they are later caught by Negan, and forced to swear loyalty to him.|$|E

5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} <b>can</b> <b>end</b> the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was oblivious to the mistake or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil <b>can</b> <b>end</b> up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the newer HPRoman-9, HPRoman-8 does not officially provide a codepoint for the euro sign. However, one source recommends to map it to codepoint 186 (as in Roman-9), whereas another recommends codepoint 128 (0x80), which lines up with where the character <b>can</b> <b>end</b> up in the modified HPRoman-8 character set as well.|$|E
25|$|An issue {{related to}} social {{media and the}} riot police {{investigation}} was {{that a number of}} people involved in the rioting were under the age of 18.

He gave the episode a rating of 7.6/10.|$|R
25|$|Due {{to safety}} {{issues such as}} aquaplaning, the race is not held in wet conditions. In {{the event of a}} rain delay, the race will be {{postponed}} until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race, officials <b>can</b> <b>end</b> the race and declare the results official if {{more than half of the}} scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed.|$|E

25|$|A draw is the {{inconclusive}} {{result that}} occurs when the allotted playing time for the game expires without the teams having completed their innings. This is relatively common, occurring in 20–30% of Test matches with a perhaps higher percentage of first-class matches as they are scheduled for four days instead of five. Limited-overs matches cannot be drawn, although they <b>can</b> <b>end</b> with a no result if abandoned because of weather or other factors.|$|E
