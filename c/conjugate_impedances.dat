In Piezoelectric energy Harvesting systems the match is done to increment the energy flows from a vibration energy source to an energy storage electrical circuit. In this article, we compare the power generated using the modulus impedance matching with the power generated using the complex <b>conjugate</b> <b>impedance</b> matching. We present the power ratio between both types of matching methods. The novelty of this article consists of a piezoelectric transducer completely adapted with a complex <b>conjugate</b> <b>impedance</b> match.

40|$|For the {{ultrahigh}} frequency {{radio frequency identification}} (UHF RFID) metal tag, it always has the difficulties of compact designing, especially for the <b>conjugate</b> <b>impedance</b> matching, low antenna gain, and fabrication or environmental detuning. In this paper, a tunable compact UHF RFID metal tag is designed based on CPW open stub feed PIFA antenna.

30|$|The {{magnitudes}} {{shown in}} Figure 2 pose a twofold {{problem in the}} design of NB-PLC systems. The first one is the difficulty of injecting signal levels of up to 5 V, as the ones allowed by the EN 50065 - 1 [13], into such low impedance values. The second one is the minimization of the coupling loss from the transmitter to the PLC network. To this end, the most desirable situation is to make the output impedance of the transmitter negligible with respect to the input impedance of the PLC grid. However, this obliges to make an output impedance on the order of a few m Ω, which is in the range of the resistance of some printed circuit board traces or the transformers wiring. On the other hand, <b>conjugate</b> <b>impedance</b> matching is also technologically difficult because of the aforementioned frequency-selective behavior of the impedance and its large variation between locations.|$|R

Closed-form expressions for the efficiencies of both systems, {{as a function}} of frequency and system (circuit) parameters, are presented. In the frequency-tuned system, the operating frequency is adjusted to compensate for changes in mutual inductance that occur for variations of transmitter and receiver loop positions. Frequency-tuning is employed for a range of distances over which the loops are strongly coupled. In contrast, the impedance-tuned system employs varactor-based matching networks to compensate for changes in mutual inductance and achieve a simultaneous <b>conjugate</b> <b>impedance</b> match over a range of distances. The frequency-tuned system is simpler to implement, while the impedance-tuned system is more complex but can achieve higher efficiencies.

The system {{consists of three}} elements: a transmitter, a receiving loop, and a transponder at a fixed distance from the transmitter. The transmitter and the transponder are made of concentric, reactively loaded wire loops. One loop of the transmitter is directly fed by a power source, while its remaining loops {{and those of the}} transponder act as parasitic loops. The reactive impedances of the parasitic loops comprising the transmitter and transponder are chosen to maximize power transfer from the source to the receiving loop. The equivalence of the system with a two-port network is used to derive the required reactive <b>impedances.</b> A <b>conjugate</b> <b>impedance</b> match is applied to both input and output ports of the equivalent two-port network for maximum power transfer.

40|$|The input {{impedance}} of UHF {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) inlay tags is analyzed when a thin material slab is placed between the antenna and a metal surface. The two-layer slab is made of a thin magneto-dielectric Emerson&Cuming Eccosorb MCS-U layer with high permeability/permittivity and a thin RohacellTM layer. Two common commercial UHF tag antennas are considered: the Alien ALN- 9640 SquiggleVR and the ALN- 9654 G inlays. The antenna impedance is evaluated both numerically and experimentally, and the power transmission coefficient is calculated in the whole UHF RFID frequency band.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this thesis is firstly to improve the collection of vibration energy for piezoelectric cantilever harvesters, by a mechanical technique, so that the devices can harvest energy over a wider bandwidth. Secondly to investigate a new circuit topology for achieving complex conjugate load matching to the piezoelectric harvester. The thesis has been divided into two parts - the mechanical approach and the electrical approach. For the mechanical approach, a novel multiresonant beam, comprising piezoelectric fiber composites on a clamped-clamped beam and side mounted cantilevers, was proposed. The side cantilevers are tuned by tip masses to be resonant at different frequencies. A Rayleigh-Ritz model was developed to predict the vibration response of the proposed model multiresonant beam. This model showed that the bandwidth of the multiresonant beam was increased over that of a single cantilever harvester. A multiresonant beam for energy harvesting was experimentally tested and compared with a single cantilever energy harvester. The transmissibility and voltage responses were investigated, the beam showed a wide frequency response between 14. 5 Hz and 31 Hz, whereas the single cantilever only showed one resonant frequency. Therefore the multiresonant beam system is feasible for wide band energy harvesting. For the electrical approach, the task was to investigate complex <b>conjugate</b> <b>impedance</b> matching for the piezoelectric energy harvesters, so that the output impedance from the piezoelectric harvester can be reduced, and maximum energy extracted from the device with a possibility of frequency tuning. A new amplified inductor circuit was proposed to enable the capacitive output impedance of the piezoelectric device to be cancelled. Experimental and software simulations are provided to verify the theoretical predictions. A prototype amplified inductor circuit was simulated and tested. The results showed that a variable effective inductance was achieved. However the circuit is lossy due to imperfections within the system, and needs further work to eliminate these imperfections.

50|$|Whenever {{a source}} of power with a fixed output {{impedance}} such as an electric signal source, a radio transmitter or a mechanical sound (e.g., a loudspeaker) operates into a load, the maximum possible power is delivered to the load when the impedance of the load (load impedance or input impedance) {{is equal to the}} complex <b>conjugate</b> of the <b>impedance</b> of the source (that is, its internal impedance or output impedance). For two impedances to be complex conjugates their resistances must be equal, and their reactances must be equal in magnitude but of opposite signs. In low-frequency or DC systems (or systems with purely resistive sources and loads) the reactances are zero, or small enough to be ignored. In this case, maximum power transfer occurs when the resistance of the load is equal to the resistance of the source (see maximum power theorem for a mathematical proof).|$|R
5000|$|Maximum power {{transfer}} requires matching {{the impedance of}} an antenna system (as seen looking into the transmission line) to the complex <b>conjugate</b> of the <b>impedance</b> of the receiver or transmitter. In {{the case of a}} transmitter, however, the desired matching impedance might not correspond to the dynamic output impedance of the transmitter as analyzed as a source impedance but rather the design value (typically 50 ohms) required for efficient and safe operation of the transmitting circuitry. The intended impedance is normally resistive but a transmitter (and some receivers) may have additional adjustments to cancel a certain amount of reactance in order to [...] "tweak" [...] the match. When a transmission line is used in between the antenna and the transmitter (or receiver) one generally would like an antenna system whose impedance is resistive and near the characteristic impedance of that transmission line in order to minimize the standing wave ratio (SWR) and the increase in transmission line losses it entails, in addition to supplying a good match at the transmitter or receiver itself.|$|R

We propose {{a low profile}} electrically small antenna for near-field wireless power and data telemetry employing a metamaterial Split Ring Resonator (SRR) antenna. SRRs can be designed for operation over wide frequencies from RF to visible. However, they are inherently narrowband making them sensitive to component mismatch with respect to external transmit antenna. Here we propose an embedding of a non-foster impedance circuitry into the metamaterial SRR structure that imparts <b>conjugate</b> negative complex <b>impedance</b> to this resonator antenna thereby increasing the effective bandwidth and thus overcoming the fundamental limit for efficient signal coupling. We demonstrate the concept through extensive numerical simulations and a prototype system at the board level using discrete off-the-shelf components and printed circuit SRR antenna at 500 MHz. We show that the power transfer between SRR receive antenna and the external transmit loop antenna is broadened by almost 400 MHz which corresponds to increase in Δf/fC from 0. 49 to 1. 65, before and after non-foster circuit activation.

40|$|Low-frequency {{vibrations}} typically {{occur in}} many practical structures and systems when in use, for example, in aerospaces and industrial machines. Piezoelectric materials feature compactness, lightweight, high integration potential, and permit to transduce mechanical energy from vibrations into electrical energy. Because of their properties, piezoelectric materials have been receiving growing interest {{during the last}} decades as potential vibration- harvested energy generators for the proliferating number of embeddable wireless sensor systems in applications such as structural health monitoring (SHM). The basic idea behind piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) powered architectures, or energy harvesting (EH) more in general, is to develop truly “fit and forget” solutions that allow reducing physical installations and burdens to maintenance over battery-powered systems. However, due to the low mechanical energy available under low-frequency conditions and the relatively high power consumption of wireless sensor nodes, PEH from low-frequency vibrations is a challenge {{that needs to be}} addressed for the majority of the practical cases. Simply saying, the energy harvested from low-frequency vibrations is not high enough to power wireless sensor nodes or the power consumption of the wireless sensor nodes is higher than the harvested energy. This represents a main barrier to the widespread use of PEH technology at the current state of the development, despite the advantages it may offer. The main contribution of this research work concerns the proposal of a novel EH circuitry, which is based on a whole-system approach, in order to develop enhanced PEH powered wireless sensor nodes, hence to compensate the existing mismatch between harvested and demanded energy. By whole-system approach, it is meant that this work develops an integrated system-of-systems rather than a single EH unit, thus getting closer to the industrial need of a ready- to-use energy-autonomous solution for wireless sensor applications such as SHM. To achieve so, this work introduces: Novel passive interfaces in connection with the piezoelectric harvester that permit to extract more energy from it (i. e., a complex <b>conjugate</b> <b>impedance</b> matching (CCIM) interface, which uses a PC permalloy toroidal coil to achieve a large inductive reactance with a centimetre- scaled size at low frequency; and interfaces for resonant PEH applications, which exploit the harvester‟s displacement to achieve a mechanical amplification of the input force, a magnetic and a mechanical activation of a synchronised switching harvesting on inductor (SSHI) mechanism). A novel power management approach, which permits to minimise the power consumption for conditioning the transduced signal and optimises the flow of the harvested energy towards a custom-developed wireless sensor communication node (WSCN) through a dedicated energy-aware interface (EAI); where the EAI is based on a voltage sensing device across a capacitive energy storage. Theoretical and experimental analyses of the developed systems are carried in connection with resistive loads and the WSCN under excitations of low frequency and strain/acceleration levels typical of two potential energy- autonomous applications, that are: 1) wireless condition monitoring of commercial aircraft wings through non-resonant PEH based on Macro-Fibre Composite (MFC) material bonded to aluminium and composite substrates; and wireless condition monitoring of large industrial machinery through resonant PEH based on a cantilever structure. shown that under similar testing conditions the developed systems feature a performance in comparison with other architectures reported in the literature or currently available on the market. Power levels up to 12. 16 mW and 116. 6 µW were respectively measured across an optimal resistive load of 66 277 kΩ for an implemented non-resonant MFC energy harvester on aluminium substrate and a resonant cantilever-based structure when no interfaces were added into the circuits. When the WSCN was connected to the harvesters in place of the resistive loads, data transmissions as fast as 0. 4 and s were also respectively measured. By use of the implemented passive interfaces, a maximum power enhancement of around 95 % and 452 % was achieved in the two tested cases and faster data transmissions obtained with a maximum percentage improvement around 36 % and 73 %, respectively. By the use of the EAI in connection with the WSCN, results have also shown that the overall system‟s power consumption is as low as a few microwatts during non- active modes of operation (i. e., before the WSCN starts data acquisition and transmission to a base station). Through the introduction of the developed interfaces, this research work takes a whole-system approach and brings about the capability to continuously power wireless sensor nodes entirely from vibration-harvested energy in time intervals of a few seconds or fractions of a second once they have been firstly activated. Therefore, such an approach has potential to be used for real-world energy- autonomous applications of SHM...|$|R
