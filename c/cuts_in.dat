5|$|By 1950, the {{occupation}} of Japan was winding down, but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander-in-Chief Far East (CINCFE), a post {{to which he had}} been appointed by Truman in 1945. MacArthur had to deal with deep <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> the defense budget that saw his troop numbers decline from 300,000 in 1947 to 142,000 in 1948. Despite his protests, further reductions had followed and, by June 1950, there were only 108,000 troops in his Far East Command. <b>Cuts</b> <b>in</b> funds and personnel produced shortages of serviceable equipment. Of the Far East Command's 18,000 jeeps, 10,000 were unserviceable; of its 113,870 2½-ton 6x6 trucks, only 4,441 were serviceable. On the positive side, the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific. This had not only recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment, it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan. Meanwhile, the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat.|$|E

Aggregate data suggest that employment will generally increase after a small <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> hours for the United Kingdom but the employment effect is ambiguous for Australia.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} was to ensure quality green forage and silage early in the spring on family farms in northern Croatia, through introducing winter cereals and Winter pea mixtures. For that purpose mixtures of Winter pea (cv. Maksimirski visoki) with triticale (cv. Clercal) were <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the beginning of May, while the mixtures of Winter pea with wheat (cv. Sana and cv. Žitarka) were <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the second half of May at family farms: Maletić (Ferdinandovac), Mirović (Višnjevac), Bazić (M. Trojstvo), Mlinar (Kapela Podravska), Mužinić (Križevćec) i Uher (Grabovac). The mixtures were used to feed dairy cows from the beginning of flowering till the full bloom of Winterpea. The green mass yields (GMY) for mixtures of Winter pea with triticale <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the beginning of pea flowering varied from 24. 0 to 52. 7 t/ha, while the GMY of mixtures <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the full bloom of Winter pea were from 46. 7 to 67. 5 t/ha. Average dry matter yields (DMY) for mixtures of Winter pea with triticale <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the beginning of flowering varied from 4. 05 to 12. 2 t/ha, while the DMY of mixtures <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the full bloom of Winter pea were from 8. 98 to 18. 39 t/ha. All mixtures of Winter pea with triticale <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the beginning of flowering had drymatter content (DMC) from 19. 41 % while the DMC of mixtures <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the full bloom of Winter pea were from 23. 56 %. The GMY for mixtures of Winter pea with wheat <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the beginning of pea flowering varied from 23. 2 to 50. 0 t/ha, while the GMY of mixtures <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the full bloom of Winter pea were from 53. 3 to 62. 5 t/ha. The DMY for mixtures of Winter pea with wheat <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the beginning of flowering varied from 4. 39 to 9. 49 t/ha, while the DMY of the same mixture <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the full bloom were from 10. 67 to 15. 59 t/ha. All mixtures of Winter pea with wheat <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the beginning of flowering had DMC from 17. 0 % to 20. 96 %, while the DMC of the same mixtures <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the full bloom were from 20. 00 % to 27. 31 %...|$|R

5|$|Growing {{government}} spending, large wage raises, {{and inefficient}} production created a chronic inflation that {{rose through the}} 1980s, when it briefly exceeded {{an annual rate of}} 1000%.

Ross Garnaut states that full auctioning will provide greater transparency and accountability and lower implementation and transaction costs as governments retain control over the permit revenue.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{economic}} indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education. Treasury officials had advised {{a series of}} tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes {{to the cost of}} posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> November.

5|$|In 1931, the MacDonald Government faced {{a serious}} crisis, as the May Report {{revealed}} that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. As this information became public, there was a run on the pound, depleting the nation's gold reserves. The Labour Party refused to consider the massive <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> unemployment compensation which {{would be needed to}} balance the budget, and Prime Minister MacDonald sought support from outside his party. With Baldwin on holiday in France, Chamberlain negotiated for the Conservatives. Chamberlain told MacDonald that the Conservatives would only join a coalition if the full recommended <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> unemployment compensation were made. Finally, on 24 August 1931, the Labour Government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government, supported by most Conservative and Liberal MPs and a minority of the Labour Party. Chamberlain once more returned to the Ministry of Health. The National Government was intended as only a temporary expedient, but governed Britain until Chamberlain's fall in 1940. In the ensuing General Election, the National Government won 554 of the 615seats in the House of Commons, with 473 of its supporters Conservative MPs.|$|E
