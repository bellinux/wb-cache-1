5|$|On 27 June, the division's {{defensive}} {{positions at}} Minqar Qaim were encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. The battalion {{was the lead}} unit {{of one of the}} columns, numbering 900 vehicles and guns, of the division, in the subsequent breakout that night. In the course of this movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed to capitalise on the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop,</b> was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{found that}} Train 214 had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it {{effectively}} {{invisible to the}} automatic train control system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum {{to make it to}} the next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision.|$|E

25|$|The {{first route}} to be {{introduced}} in 1955 was the 12A from St Marychurch through Babbacombe, Torquay, Paignton and Goodrington to Broadsands. To reach Paignton's sea front at Preston the bus had to pass under a very low railway bridge. A licence for the route was only granted on condition that buses would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> before passing under the bridge, the conductor would then have to instruct passengers on the top deck to remain in their seats and then stand {{at the top of}} the stairs to see that they did.|$|E

The area of Realm of Light is 100 000 square kilometers, it is in other words approximately the size of Iceland. So that Realm of Light wouldn't change for too much dense populated, there is imposed restrictions on number of children. Because of that each family can have just one child.|$|E
25|$|A spinner {{is a type}} of hubcap that spins {{independently}} {{inside of}} a wheel itself when a vehicle is in motion, and continues to spin once the vehicle has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop.</b> As an attachment to the car's wheel, a spinner operates by using one or more roller bearings to isolate the spinner from the wheel, allowing it to turn while the wheel is at rest. The invention of the spinner is credited to James J.D. Gragg of Tulsa, Oklahoma who filed a patent on October 28, 1992 and was issued United States Patent 5,290,094 on March 4, 1994.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy {{to get over the}} top of the hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.|$|E

25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop,</b> and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{aircraft}}'s many faults, {{only two}} {{were lost in}} accidents. The seventh aircraft (38-492) was on its final test flight from the Buffalo factory prior to delivery to the Air Corps when pilot John Strickler, a Bell pilot and engineer/co-pilot Brian Sparks, who was Bell's chief test pilot at the time, encountered problems recovering from a deliberate spin attempt {{which was part of}} the test flight profile. Despite every effort to emerge from the spin, the aircraft would not respond, and it appeared that the rudder had locked. Co-pilot Sparks shut down the engines and waited for the propellers to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> before bailing out. Because of the tandem seating, it was necessary for Sparks to exit the aircraft first, and in doing so he struck the empennage, breaking his legs — and in the process, freeing the rudder. Strickler decided to stay with the aircraft and attempt an emergency landing. By this time, the aircraft had lost sufficient altitude that there was not time to restart the engines. Strickler put the Airacuda down hard in a farmer's field, and walked away unhurt. The Airacuda was so badly damaged it had to be scrapped.|$|E
500|$|Hood {{continued}} on course until 17:40 when gunfire was spotted {{in the direction}} to which his light cruiser [...] had been dispatched to investigate other gunfire flashes. Chester encountered four light cruisers of Hipper's 2nd Scouting Group and was badly damaged before Hood turned to investigate {{and was able to}} drive the German cruisers away from Chester. At 17:53 Invincible opened fire on [...] and the other two Invincibles followed two minutes later. The German ships turned for the south after fruitlessly firing torpedoes at 18:00 and attempted to find shelter in the mist. As they turned Invincible hit Wiesbaden in the engine room and knocked out her engines while Inflexible hit [...] once. The 2nd Scouting Group was escorted by the light cruiser [...] and 31 destroyers of the 2nd and 9th Flotillas and the 12th Half-Flotilla which attacked the 3rd BCS in succession. They were driven off by Hood's remaining light cruiser [...] and the five destroyers of his escort. In a confused action the Germans only launched 12 torpedoes and disabled the destroyer [...] with gunfire. Having turned due west to close on Beatty's ships, the Invincibles were broadside to the oncoming torpedoes, but Invincible turned north, while Inflexible and Indomitable turned south to present their narrowest profile to the torpedoes. All the torpedoes missed, although one passed underneath Inflexible without detonating. As Invincible turned north, her helm jammed and she had to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> to fix the problem, but this was quickly done and the squadron reformed heading west.|$|E

Bible was thrown from the car, killing him instantly. A Pathé newsreel cinema photographer and spectator, Charles Traub, was also killed. Some blame Bible's driving and excessively fast deceleration, others Triplexs lack of stability. There is controversy about both of those deaths, as it is also unclear whether the photographer was in an area expected to be safe, or if he approached the running line too closely in order to get more dramatic footage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{commission}} {{found that}} the approach and landing were normal with natural variations but that the spoilers were not deployed when the pilot pulled the lever. No conclusion to the cause was found, although the commission believed it must either have been a mechanical fault in the spoiler lever mechanism or a fault {{in two of the}} four thrust lever micro switches. The pilots received warning of the failure of deployment and also noticed the lack of sufficient retardation, but failed to connect the two issues, instead focusing on the wheel brakes. This caused the removal of the anti-skid system, which caused hydroplaning and subsequently reduced braking effect. The lack of runway grooving was decisive for the hydroplaning to take place. The aircraft was estimated to travel at [...] {{at the time of the}} overrun. Had optimum braking taken place the aircraft would probably have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> on the runway. The massive damage was not caused by the overrun as such, but rather the steep slopes on the side of the runway.|$|E

The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. [...] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash {{was a result of}} a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather. Additionally, investigators recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by inbound trains. [...] The NTSB also recommended that Metro reinforce the 1000-series cars to help protect them against telescoping in a crash. [...] Metro rejected this recommendation in 2002, saying the modification was impractical and might lead to [...] "higher longitudinal accelerations" [...] and thus greater injuries. [...] The NTSB also advised Metro to install event recorders, similar to airplane black boxes, on all 1000-series cars. [...] This recommendation echoed one made following Metrorail's first fatal accident in 1982, when the NTSB recommended the installation of event recorders in trains, but despite some discussion by WMATA managers, no recorders had been installed by January 1996.|$|E
2500|$|McNamara {{had seen}} enough {{and went to}} the mound.

Stanley had already faced Wilson three times in the series, {{retiring}} him twice. The last time Wilson faced him was in Game 4, and he recorded a single. Stanley got Wilson to keep missing and fouling off pitches, with the count at 2-2 after six pitches. For a second time, the Red Sox were one strike away from victory. [...] But on the seventh pitch, Stanley lost control of a pitch that went inside and nearly hit Wilson. Wilson fell over and waved Mitchell in to score the tying run as Gedman could not field the ball in time, while Knight moved into scoring position with what was now the winning run. [...] Interestingly, Stanley appeared to have balked by failing to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> in his [...] "set" [...] position after starting his motion. [...] Had the apparent balk been called, the result would have been virtually the same (with Mitchell scoring and Knight advancing to second), but with Wilson still facing a 2-2 count.|$|E
