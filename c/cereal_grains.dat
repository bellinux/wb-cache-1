5|$|Common ravens have coexisted {{with humans}} for {{thousands}} of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests.

5|$|The Green Revolution was {{a series}} of research, development, and {{technology}} transfer initiatives, between the 1940s and the late 1970s. It increased agriculture production around the world, especially from the late 1960s. The initiatives, led by Norman Borlaug and credited with saving over a billion people from starvation, involved the development of high-yielding varieties of <b>cereal</b> <b>grains,</b> expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} saltwater marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes in the mud, {{but these are not}} available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, <b>cereal</b> <b>grains,</b> seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands near their eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens nesting near {{sources of}} human garbage {{included}} {{a higher percentage}} of food waste in their diet, birds nesting near roads consumed more road-killed vertebrates, and those nesting far from these sources of food ate more arthropods and plant material. Fledging success was higher for those using human garbage as a food source. In contrast, a 1984–1986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of south-western Idaho found that <b>cereal</b> <b>grains</b> were the principal constituent of pellets, though small mammals, grasshoppers, cattle carrion and birds were also eaten.|$|E

5|$|Aldermaston {{may have}} been {{inhabited}} as early as 1690 BCE; a number of postholes and remains of <b>cereal</b> <b>grains</b> {{have been found in}} the area. Written history of the village is traced back {{at least as far as}} the 9th century CE. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles show that the Ealdorman of Berkshire had his country estate in the village. The manor of Aldermaston was established by the early 11th century, when the village was given to the Achard family by Henry I; the manor is documented in the Domesday survey. The village church was established in the 13th century, and some of the original Norman architecture remains in the building's structure.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from <b>cereal</b> <b>grains</b> — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{cultivated}} emmer and barley, {{and several}} other <b>cereal</b> <b>grains,</b> {{all of which were}} used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer. Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army {{contracted}} the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston, {{who discovered the}} defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to {{study the effects of}} 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on <b>cereal</b> <b>grains</b> (including rice) and broadleaf crops. Galston, then {{a graduate student at the}} University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.|$|E
5|$|In {{some places}} they are mainly scavengers, feeding on carrion {{as well as}} the {{associated}} maggots and carrion beetles. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook-billed vultures, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. Plant food includes <b>cereal</b> <b>grains,</b> berries and fruit. They prey on small invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces, and human food waste. They store surplus food items, especially those containing fat, and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the Arctic fox. They sometimes associate with another canine, the grey wolf, as a kleptoparasite, following to scavenge wolf-kills in winter. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced.|$|E

The Corn Belt extends to North Dakota, but is situated more {{on the edge of}} the region instead of in its center.

5000|$|Korn (from German, [...] "grain", Brit.

In the production of Korn only the <b>cereal</b> <b>grain</b> types rye, wheat, barley, oat and buckwheat are permissible. Most of the production is based on rye or wheat; barley and buckwheat are rarely used. Barley is mainly used to obtain the required malt for the brewing process. The addition of food color, flavorings, or sweeteners is not permitted. Korn differs from vodka {{in that it is}} distilled to lower alcoholic proofs and less rigorously filtered, which leaves more of the <b>cereal</b> <b>grain</b> flavor in the finished spirit.|$|R
