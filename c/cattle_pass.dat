5000|$|Previously called Union Square, Porter Square {{was renamed}} in 1899 for the now-vanished Porter's Hotel, {{operated}} by Zachariah B. Porter, who also left {{his name to}} the hotel's specialty, the cut of steak known as porterhouse. The hotel was demolished in 1909. The square, formerly flanked by cattle yards that used the Porter rail head to transport their beef throughout the US, was an important center for commerce and light industry {{as early as the}} late 18th century. A tunnel for moving cattle to and from the railroad without interfering with street traffic, known as the Walden Street <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass,</b> was built in 1857. The tunnel survives under the nearby Walden Street Bridge, and in 2007-08 was preserved and restored.

5000|$|This {{is another}} {{original}} {{section of the}} old Lincoln Highway from 1913 that {{is now part of}} County Road E53. [...] It runs through 3.6 mi of rolling farmland, and through the Raccoon River Valley. There are 11 contributing resources to this historic district, 10 structures and one site. The roadway is one structure broken into three segments. The first segment is a 1.4 mi section {{on the west side of}} the district. It was paved in 1924 by Empire Construction. The second segment is a 1.3 mi section on the east and west sides of the Eureka Bridge. It includes Danger Hill where the grade was reduced considerably in 1920 and a jog in the highway was replaced with a curve. The C.C. Barnes Company completed the work. Empire Construction also paved this section in 1924. The third segment is a 0.9 mi section on the east side of the district. It was one of the first sections of the Lincoln Highway paved in Greene County in 1920. The work was completed by F.E. Marsh Company of Jefferson, Iowa. The Eureka Bridge is a five-span reinforced concrete arch bridge. Each span is 77 ft wide with an overall length of 422 ft. It replaced an earlier span that was partially washed out by a flood in 1912. Marsh Engineering Company of Des Moines constructed the bridge that was designed by the Iowa Highway Commission. It is one of the earliest arch bridges still standing in Iowa, and one of the first designed by the state highway commission. [...] Because of increased traffic on the span it had to be widened in 1924. Other historic structures include the road drainage system, six culverts, and one <b>cattle</b> <b>pass.</b> The site is 600 ft of abandoned roadway at the top of Danger Hill. This section of roadway appears not to have been paved, and it includes one of the culverts.|$|E
40|$|Due to the generalist {{nature of}} its diet, the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsi) has been thought to be an {{indicator}} of change in ecosystems. By utilizing expected patterns in salmon presence, this study sought to assess the capacity of harbor seal foraging {{to act as an}} accurate proxy for salmon presence and activity in <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass,</b> Washington. Salmon were expected to be present in the channel beginning mid-summer, at which point it should be easier for individual fish to migrate northward through <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass</b> during northward-flowing flooding tides. During the summers of 2010 and 2011, harbor seal presence and foraging was observed with respect to tidal phase and current velocity. Of all salmon captures observed during 2010, 79. 2 % occurred during flooding tides and 65. 81 % occurred during the month of August. During 2010, harbor seal foraging reflected expected seasonal and tidal patterns of salmon presence in the pass. Results support the proposal that with additional data collection, harbor seal foraging has the potential to act as successful indicators of salmon presence and activity in <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass...</b>|$|E

The peak years of the cattle trade in Dodge City were from 1883 to 1884, {{and during that time}} the town grew tremendously. In 1880, Dodge City got a new competitor for the cattle trade from the border town of Caldwell. For a few years, the competition between the towns was fierce, but there were enough cattle for both towns to prosper.|$|R
40|$|Zooplankton in <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass</b> are advected {{from two}} water sources. Water from the Juan de Fuca Strait enters the pass from the South during {{flooding}} tides, while {{water from the}} Strait of Georgia enters from the North during ebbing tides. The questions I am interested in answering are: how does the marine influence of the Juan de Fuca Strait and the estuarine influence of the Strait of Georgia affect the abundance of zooplankton in <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass?</b> Do tidal processes affect the abundances of zooplankton in <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass?</b> Is zooplankton abundance correlated with upper trophic level foraging? I based my hypothesis on several assumptions based on conclusions of a study from 1995 to 1997 by Zamon: water density fluctuations in San Juan Channel are evidence that tidal currents affect the source from which plankton is derived. Flooding tides mix colder, saltier water from Juan de Fuca into San Juan Channel. Tides create predictable patterns of zooplankton availability for planktivorous animals (Zamon 2000). I hypothesized that ebbing tides advect zooplankton from the Strait of Georgia while flooding tides advect zooplankton from the Juan de Fuca Strait. Zooplankton will be more numerous in the more oceanic waters during flood tide. I tested this hypothesis by analyzing zooplankton tows collected during flooding and ebbing tides...|$|E
40|$|The dive {{behavior}} of the Double Crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) and the Pelagic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus) was studied along <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass</b> of San Juan Island, WA, USA. Dive durations and resting periods were measured for consecutive, sequential dives of each type of cormorant. Comparing the two species, mean dive time was greater for the Pelagic Cormorant. Both species exhibited dive to rest time ratios greater than one (> 1) and therefore generate an oxygen debt that must be resupplied after completion of dive bouts. Tidal phase, including tidal height and current speed {{had an effect on}} when both species chose to forage. Further analysis of prey abundance and final resting locations in the <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass</b> region are needed to understand more about the Double Crested and the Pelagic Cormorant’s dive behavior in the San Juan channel...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of Rhinoceros Auklets {{is related to}} the tide cycle. I examined the effects of tidal currents phase on the {{distribution and}} abundance of the Rhinoceros Auklets though land-based surveys of the waters within <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass,</b> Washington. Auklets aggregated in large groups inside <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass</b> during flooding tides. During the slack high tide numbers dropped to intermediate levels, and then declined during ebbing tides and remained very low until the next flooding tide. During flooding tides the birds aggregated in {{the north end of the}} pass where prey availability was highest. Low abundance during the ebbing tide was attributed to high prey concentrations in the south end of the pass outside of the survey area. Auklets strongly preferred the center of the pass, where the main current flowed, over the calmer water closer to shore. This study shows the importance of the tide cycle in influencing the daily movements of Rhinoceros Auklets...|$|E
30|$|Fulani pastoralists {{are widely}} {{distributed}} across West Africa {{and represent the}} largest migratory ethnic group in the world. The origin of the Fulani is obscure (Ibrahim 1966).

It is suggested that they moved eastwards in search of pasture for their <b>cattle,</b> <b>passing</b> through Messina and the Hausa states towards Chad, eventually reaching Sudan (Blench 1994). Stenning (1957) reports that their spread through gradual migratory drift over many centuries was interspersed with periods of intense migration associated with Islamic holy wars (jihad).|$|R

50|$|For centuries a {{large part}} of the economy of the Scottish Highlands {{revolved}} around the breeding and trading of Highland cattle. They were moved along drove roads from all parts of the country, including some of the islands, to trysts or markets held in Crieff and Falkirk. Most of the cattle would then be driven south to feed consumers in England. Several of the drove routes used came together at Mid Calder. Huge herds of cattle would come across fords or bridges over the River Almond before crossing the Pentland Hills to West Linton. The peak year was 1840 when some 150,000 <b>cattle</b> <b>passed</b> through the area over the three months from August to October.

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} at <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass,</b> Washington between 13 - 18 August 2014. The first {{study was conducted}} to determine the relationship between tidal height and the haul-out abundance of Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopias jubatus) at the Whale Rocks of the San Juan Channel. There was a clear diurnal pattern of abundance during both of the days used for data analysis. The abundance was very low in the morning which may be a result of the nighttime/early morning foraging behavior characteristic of Steller Sea Lions. It was determined that this variation in haul-out abundance of Steller Sea Lions did not occur in response to changes in tidal height. The data also suggest that air temperature {{may play a role in}} determining the total abundance of Steller Sea Lions. The second study was done to understand how two unrelated bird species, Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) and Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), compare and contrast in their use of the <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass</b> rocky intertidal habitat post-breeding season. It was found that Black Oystercatchers spend most of their time loafing in the region while Harlequin Ducks spend most of their time swimming and foraging. These data suggest that Black Oystercatchers use the habitat primarily as a resting area between flock feedings while Harlequin Ducks use it primarily as a feeding ground during molting periods that cause them to be temporarily flightless...|$|E
40|$|Large {{populations of}} diving seabirds {{are found in}} the San Juan Archipelago, an {{important}} overwintering region for many seabirds. Previous Pelagic Ecosystem Function Apprenticeships have focused on the relationships of various diving seabirds and tidal conditions. Cormorants are the second most abundant diving seabirds of the San Juan Channel yet their feeding ecology is not commonly investigated. My objectives were to contribute to the long term seabird database by studying the abundance of all seabirds seen in the San Juan Channel during fall 2014 and comparing this information to recent autumns. I also explored cormorants by relating their abundance to previous autumns and distribution along the six zones for fall 2014. I observed their flight direction and water interaction in the most tidally active area (zone 5) to determine during which tidal conditions they flew {{in and out of the}} channel. The population of cormorants increased as the season progressed, likely due to the migration of Brandt’s cormorants to the region, with numbers highest in areas containing rookeries and tidally influenced prey abundance. A significant correlation between cormorant flight direction and fast tidal currents was found at <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass</b> although they flew in the opposite direction of the current flow. I examined cormorant water interactions within the channel and found they were indeed in the water (proxy for foraging) on fast ebbing tides, reinforcing the countercurrent flight direction I observed at <b>Cattle</b> <b>Pass.</b> My results suggest that cormorants are very different from other diving seabirds and must be studied carefully. Additionally, my analyses confirm population declines for gulls and alcids which are likely due to the anomalously warm offshore ocean water...|$|E
40|$|Two {{species of}} {{pinnipeds}} {{were focused on}} in this study, the Harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), and the Steller sea lion (Eumatopias jubatus). In this study the abundance and distribution of Harbor seals and Steller sea lions in the San Juan Channel was studied in fall 2014 using the strip transect method. Results were compared with data collected by previous Pelagic Ecosystem Function Research Apprenticeship students from fall 2007 - 2013. Harbor seal numbers {{were found to be}} stable, but steller sea lion’s numbers have been declining for the past three years. Over the course of fall 2014 harbor seal numbers declined, possibly due to the fall transition, while steller sea lion numbers stayed low throughout the season.
