40|$|Non-Revenue Water (NRW) is {{categorised}} as {{the amount}} of water put into the supply systems that bring no revenue to the supply authority. NRW cannot be totally avoided and understanding its components is crucial before a reduction strategy can be developed and implemented. A comprehensive and flexible web based system has been developed for Felda Chuping NRW water distribution system. Functions that have been built in the system are data recording, NRW estimation and report generati 0 n. As the system covers all aspect of water management the output produced from the system can be used by the management for decision making and planning. Special feature of the system is the identification of the magnitude and source of NRW, which was previously not available through manual operation. This system complies with the NRW definition produced by the International Water Authority. The prototype was developed based on NRW framework and work procedure for NRW analysis. The framework illustrates the treated water distribution system that consists of the configuration for water source, water storage, water network, and the supply area. All the seven NRW components identified by IWA have been grouped/ clustered into four different sections. The sections are between water source and supply tank at supply tank, after supply tank up to <b>consumer</b> <b>area,</b> and <b>consumer</b> <b>area.</b> The working procedure includes determining actual system volume input, revenue water and NRW components, data consolidation as well as the source and magnitude of NRW. This procedure is also able to compare NRW obtained from two different approaches.

A mathematical model has also been produced for re-estimation of the source and magnitude of NRW components.

40|$|Consumers ’ {{attention}} is a scarce resource. It {{is virtually impossible}} for a consumer to keep informed about all the markets he or she visits. This article describes a mechanism {{that is likely to}} evolve in sophisticated societies with multiple complex markets. Since the nature of consumer areas differs substantially and thus requires different kinds of consumer competences, such competences cannot be easily transferred from one <b>consumer</b> <b>area</b> to another. People therefore tend to give their limited attention to consumer areas of similar nature, while neglecting others. This phenomenon is conceptualised as the Consumer Attention Deficit Syndrome (CADS). Empirically, if such a mechanism exists, this will be reflected in consumers ’ tendency to develop specialised consumer competence profiles. In three nationally representative data sets collected in Norway in 2005, 2007 and 2009, specialised consumer competence profiles were dis-tinguished. The following analysis indicates that, on an individual level, CADS is quite widespread. While it cannot be claimed that some social groups are more vulnerable to the syndrome than others, different groups ’ lack of {{attention is}} concentrated on different consumer areas. Leaning on choice and decision-making theories, the implications of CADS for the functioning of markets are discussed...|$|E

This ?semantic turn? in rich-media analysis requires a semantic enrichment of content along the digital content life cycle and value chain: The semantic enrichment of content can be achieved manually (which is expensive) or automatically (which is error-prone). In particular, automatic semantic enrichment must be aware of the gap between meaning that is directly retrievable from the content and meaning that can be inferred within a given interpretative context. Each solution has its benefits and drawbacks. Our paper discusses the relevance of semantic analysis of rich-media in certain application scenarios, compares two possible approaches, a semi-automatic and an automatic approach, and presents a case study for an automatic solution. Following the observations of the case study, we come up with recommendations for the improvement of the semantic enrichment by an manual annotation step...|$|E

The industry related recommendations enhance the importance of increased awareness and education in order to increase enterprises understanding of the benefits that e-business can bring and knowledge in how to use this potential. The lack of standardisation and interoperability between different e-business systems can constitute a barrier for e-business and should be closely monitored. The governments play an important role as a role model in its use of IT and e-commerce and should therefore strive to increase the public use and supply of e-services.

40|$|The Swedish {{consumer}} magazine Råd & Rön (”Advice and Results”) {{has been available}} to Swedish consumers since 1958. For {{a major part of}} this time the Swedish state, represented by Konsumentverket (the Swedish Consumer Agency) and its predecessor, Konsumentinstitutet (the National Institute for Consumer Information), was the owner of the magazine. In 2006 Råd & Rön was sold to the independent organisation, Sveriges konsumenter (the Swedish Consumers’ Association). The aim of this thesis is to describe the development of the magazine Råd & Rön, and why it has taken on the appearance it has. For almost 50 years the magazine was an official publication and functioned, to a great extent, as a vehicle for the ideas of the authorities. An important component of this work is to clarify the relationship between the magazine, the authorities, the state and the reader in different periods and to demonstrate which factors have influenced this relationship. In {{order to be able to}} do this it is necessary to describe and analyse the social and cultural contexts; that is, to not only discuss what has been published in Råd & Rön, bur also why. A part of this work is to study, and relate to, the development that has taken place in consumer policy. The point of departure for the work has been the collected publications of Råd & Rön from 1958 to approximately mid-year 2012. In order to develop the picture of the <b>consumer</b> <b>area</b> and consumer policy other material has also been used: archive material from the authorities, parliamentary publications, government reports, documents that regulate the activity of the authorities, interviews and literature.

Another approach concerns the development of journalism, where I show how the relationship to society and the public as well as the view of news ideals and professional ideals have changed.

40|$|Semiconductor {{integration}} {{technology has}} been widely spread in two-dimensional applicationsover the past three decades. This wide application has been employed {{not only in the}} field of theelectronics industries but also in a lot of related industries such as optoelectronics, bioelectronics,medical systems, electronics analysis, computer systems, military systems, satellite systems,submarine systems, and so on. From the <b>consumer</b> <b>area</b> to ultra-high-end products and militaryusage, almost all industrial products incorporate semiconductor devices. One significant reason forthis rapid progress is the good scalability of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices. However,the scale of materials is limited. Right now, the process capability has arrived at 22 nm using copperinterconnects. Therefore, the development of MOS devices may not follow the Moore law, becausethe Moore law is based on the consideration of 2 -dimensional packaging of IC chip. In order to bring out high performance from VLSI chips while restricting their powerconsumption, there are two approaches. One is to reconsider circuits and system architecture fromview point of power consumption. Another is to construct three-dimensional VLSI structure. Inrecent devices, the signal propagation delay is mainly determined by wiring length and pincapacitance. Three-dimensional very large-scale integration (3 D-VLSI) is the one solution toimprove performance without increase of power consumption. One of the key issues to realize 3 D-VLSI is the method of information transfer and the supply of electric power among stackedchips. There are many methods to connect interchip, such as wire-bonding, edge connect, capacitiveor inductive coupling method, and direct contact using through-silicon via (TSV). According to the current reports, TSV seems to be a good candidate to solve the requirement ofmultifunction, high memory capacity, low power consumption and so on. This process technologyneeds absolutely professional electrochemical deposition (ECD) technique. In this work, wepropose three professional ECD techniques, including three specific copper plating formulas, whichcan meet the current demand for TSV metallization. These three copper ECD formulas can result inbottom-up filling of TSV in a flat plane mode, highly selective copper fill, and direct filling ofthrough silicon hole (TSH). Once these copper ECD techniques are successfully developed, thesteps and cost of the TSV process can be significantly reduced. This plan will take two years tocome true, in which electrochemical analyses, in situ electrochemical scanning tunnelingmicroscopy (EC-STM), electrode kinetics, formulation of copper plating, and processesdevelopment of TSV will be employed in this plan. Therefore, this is a complete plan regarding theTSV copper metallization of 3 D IC. 在過去的 30 年當中，半導體整合技術已經在 2 度空間（ 2 D）構裝中廣泛的應用。這樣的技術不但是在電子工業上被廣泛地應用，也在許多相關工業領域上被廣泛地應用，如光電產業、生物機電產業、生醫系統、電子分析、電腦系統、軍事系統、衛星系統、潛艇系統等。從消費性電子到尖端科技產品以及軍事用途上，幾乎所有的工業產品都結合了半導體元件。半導體製程至所以可以如此快速的進展，主要原因之一是MOS 元件具有良好的可尺寸化能力。但是，材料的尺寸是有限的。目前製程能力已經使用銅內連結技術，到達 22 奈米。因此，MOS 元件的發展可能將無法再遵守Moore 定律，因為Moore 定律是基於IC 晶片二度空間封裝的考量。為了落實超大型積體電路（VLSI）晶片的高性能，同時還必須限制其電力的消耗，有兩個方式可以進行。一是由電力消耗的觀點，重新考慮線路與系統的架構；另一個方式則是去建構三度空間（ 3 D）的VLSI 結構。在最近的發展的元件當中發現，信號傳遞延遲主要是由線路長度以及引腳電流容量所主導。而 3 D-VLSI 的結構設計正好可以在不增加電力消耗的條件之下，解決此問題，同時可以大幅提昇元件性能。關鍵性 3 D-VLSI 的爭議是訊息的傳遞方式與堆疊晶片之間的電力供給，對於此爭議，有許多方法可以來讓晶片互連，例如藉由打線、邊緣連結、電容或電桿結合以及利用穿矽孔（TSV）直接接通等。根據最近的報導，TSV 似乎是很好的候選者，用來解決多功能、高記憶容量以及低耗電量等的需求。這個製程技術需要絕對專業的電化學沈積（ECD）技巧，因此，在此計畫中，吾人提出三個專業的ECD 技術，包含三個特定的電鍍銅配方，這些配方都可以滿足目前TSV金屬化的需求。這三個ECD 銅配方可以產生平面式的孔底上移填充TSV 機制；可以做高度選擇性的填銅以及可以直接填充穿矽通孔（TSH）。一旦這些ECD 銅技術開發成功，TSV 製程的步驟、成本都可以大幅地降低。本計畫預計花兩年的時間來開發，其中會用到電化學分析技術、臨場電化學掃描穿隧顯微鏡、電極動力學、電鍍銅配方開發技術以及TSV 製程技術，對於 3 D IC 的TSV 銅金屬化製程而言，是相當完整的一套研發計畫...|$|E
