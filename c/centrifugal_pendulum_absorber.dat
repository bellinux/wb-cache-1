Systematic measurements of the rotor and absorber responses are taken {{for each type of}} absorber and compared against one another, and against previously obtained theoretical predictions. The dramatic influence of the absorber nonlinearity is demonstrated, and the results allow one to draw conclusions about the selection of absorber parameters. Results for systems with multiple absorbers are also presented, showing how the absorbers may behave in a complicated manner, even when identically tuned...|$|R
30|$|Existing {{studies on}} the {{distinctive}} vibrations are generally based on spur PGT {{with the exception of}} Refs. [3, 8, 17, 21, 24], etc. The results imply that the vibrations can be classified into rotational, translational, and planet modes for spur PGT [5], but for helical one, it can be categorized as in phase, sequential phase, and counter phase [3], or rotational-axial, translational-tilting, and planet modes [8, 19]. As an extended research, Shi et al. [45] identified the typical vibration in <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> vibration <b>absorbers.</b> Qin et al. [20] examined the vibration modes of a horizontal wind turbine drive train, and they also studied the effect of bearing stiffness on these modes. Bu et al. [21] investigated the herringbone PGT and found the rotational and axial modes, translational modes, planet modes, rotational and axial ring modes, and translational ring modes. The above studies are generally based on rigid body assumption.|$|R
40|$|Input torque {{balancing}} is a {{well known}} way to reduce drive speed fluctuations in high speed machinery and combustion engines. This paper introduces a cam-based <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> (CBCP) and a design procedure for it which results in quasi perfect balancing of inertial torques for any drive speed. The CBCP combines the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> vibration <b>absorber,</b> well-known in mechanical vibration literature, with a torque balancing principle well-known in mechanism literature, that is, the use of cams to generate arbitrary torques. For given design parameters (such as the link lengths and link inertial parameters), the cam design is governed by a nonlinear, second-order, explicit differential equation. This differential equation is numerically solved by reformulating it as a nonlinear least squares problem. The design parameters themselves are determined {{by means of an}} optimization problem, the goal of which is to minimize the (constant) equivalent inertia of the combined system, consisting of the original mechanism to be balanced and the CBCP. Application of the CBCP to torque balance a high-speed, purely inertial cam-follower mechanism, driving the sley of a weaving loom, shows that the optimization results in a compact and technologically feasible mechanism. ...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, {{centrifugal}} pendulum absorbers {{following the}} patents of Sarazin and Chilton {{were introduced in}} a BMW 320D. The reason for it was again the increase in torsional vibrations from higher power engines. In this case, the 4-cylinder diesel engine BMW N47. Unlike the previous designs, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> was not attached to the combustion engine but attached to a dual mass flywheel.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> is as with any tuned mass absorbers based on an absorption principle rather than a damping principle. The distinction is significant since dampers reduce the vibration amplitude by converting the vibration energy into heat. Absorbers store the energy {{and return it to}} the vibration system at the appropriate time. Centrifugal pendulum absorbers like tuned mass absorbers {{are not part of the}} force/torque flow.|$|E
50|$|The usual {{design of}} damper on the {{crankshaft}} {{consists of a}} thin band of rubber between {{the hub of the}} pulley and the outer rim. This device, often called a harmonic damper, is located {{on the other end of}} the crankshaft opposite of where the flywheel and the transmission is. An alternative design is the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> which is used to reduce the internal combustion engine's torsional vibrations on a few modern cars.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} the performance of tautochronic <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> vibration <b>absorbers</b> (CPVA’s) for reducing torsional vibration in internal combustion engines. A mathematical model is first built for the torsional dynamics of an in-line, four-stroke, four-cylinder engine, including the consideration of inertia effects of connecting rods and pistons, gas pressure inside the cylinder chambers, and friction in bearings. Three configura-tions of the tautochronic CPVA are applied to the model, including (1) a single CPVA tuned to order 2, (2) a pair of CPVA’s tuned to order 1, (3) two CPVA’s, in which one is tuned to order 2 while the other is tuned to order 4. The moment of inertia for all three con-figurations is kept constant for purposes of comparison. Numerical simulations are accomplished in order to evaluate the performance of each configuration. This preliminary study indicates that Config-uration (3) offers the best result for minimizing the peak value of crankshaft angular acceleration. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} analytically and experimentally {{the effects}} of Coulomb friction {{on the performance of}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> vibration <b>absorbers</b> (CPVAs), which are used to reduce torsional vibrations in rotating machinery. The analysis is based on perturbation methods applied to the non-linear equations of motion for a rotor subjected to an engine order applied torque and equipped with a circular path CPVA with viscous and Coulomb damping. The experimental work is based on quantifying parameters for the damping model using free vibration measurements with a viscous and Coulomb damping identication scheme that is enhanced to better handle measurement noise, and running tests for steady-state operation under a range of loading conditions. The level of Coulomb damping is varied by adjusting the friction of the absorber connection bearing. Good agreement is found between the analytical predictions and the experimental data. It is shown that the absorber sticks up to a level of excitation that allows it to release, after which the Coulomb damping acts in the expected manner, resulting in lowered response amplitudes. The results obtained are of general use in assessing absorber performance when dry friction is present in absorber suspensions. ...|$|R
40|$|The torque {{fluctuation}} {{due to the}} intermittent combustion {{pressure and}} inertia effect of the reciprocating parts generates torsional excitation on the crankshaft of all internal combustion engines. This excitation imposes considerable amount of torsional vibration on the crankshaft. Therefore the torsional vibration modeling and design of an auxiliary absorbing mechanism are very crucial, especially in locomotive diesel engines where the crankshaft is under excitation with high amplitude coupled with large inertia forces due to generators, compressors or fans. In this research, the capability of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> vibration <b>absorbers</b> (CPVA) commonly {{used in rotating machinery}} to attenuate the torsional vibration in a Locomotive V-type diesel engine crankshaft is investigated. First, an advanced torsional modeling of the locomotive crankshaft has been carried out. This is followed by the development of an accurate excitation torque of a real locomotive engine to the 8 th order. The torsional response of the crankshaft under the derived excitation torque has then been investigated. Finally, the model of the crankshaft incorporating the CPVA (auxiliary system) has been developed and then capability of CPVA to attenuate the torsional vibration of the crankshaft (main system) at resonance frequencies has been investigated. Moreover, the effect of pendulum parameters such as length and mass on the torsional vibration response of the crankshaft in both time and frequency domains has been studied. ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> {{was first}} {{patented}} in 1937 by R. Sarazin {{and a different}} version by R. Chilton in 1938. Generally, both Sarazin and Chilton are credited with the invention. Sarazin's work was used during World War II by Pratt & Whitney for aircraft engines with increased power output. The power increase caused an increase in torsional vibrations which threatened the durability. This resulted in the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 engine that used pendulum weights attached to the crank shaft.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{centrifugal}} pendulum absorbers in land vehicles did {{not start}} until later. Although internal combustion engines had always caused torsional vibrations in the drive train, the vibration amplitude was generally not high enough to affect durability or driver comfort. One application existed in tuned racing engines where torsional crank shaft vibrations could cause damage to the cam shaft or valves. In this application, a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber,</b> the Rattler® absorber, is directly attached to the crank shaft. Although the design {{differs from that of}} Sarazin or Chilton, the Rattler® still follows the same physical principle.|$|E
5000|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines follow a development trend towards {{a reduction in}} the number of cylinders, increased energy output per cylinder and driving at lower engine speeds. This leads to an increased engine efficiency but causes the engine's torsional vibrations to increase. The vibrations lead to durability concerns as well as a comfort reduction for the passengers and have to be avoided through the use of torsion dampers and absorbers. This situation moves the balance between the cost of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> technology and the benefit for the drive train efficiency.The following cars use centrifugal pendulum absorbers ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analytical and experimental inves-tigation of the transient dynamics of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> vi-bration <b>absorbers,</b> {{which are used}} for reducing torsional vibra-tions in rotating machines. Recently these absorbers have been proposed for use in automotive engines, to aid with fuel saving technologies such as cylinder deactivation and torque converter lockup. In {{order for them to}} operate effectively with minimal mass, they must be designed to allow for large amplitude, non-linear responses. In this paper we consider the transient dynam-ics of these absorbers, focusing on the response during startup. During these transient events the absorbers experience a beat-ing type motion, resulting in overshoot of the absorber response before reaching steady state conditions. Using a perturbation analysis of the system equations of motion, an approximate ana-lytical expression for nonlinear overshoot is derived, relating the overshoot to the system and excitation parameters. These pre-dictive results are derived for a general class of absorbers, and are verified by simulations of the full equations of motion and by experiments using a fully instrumented spin rig. It is found that the overshoot for absorbers with softening nonlinearity, such as circular path absorbers, can be well over the 100 % upper limit for a linear absorber, and can be as high as 173 %. For absorbers with tautochronic paths, the overshoot remains quite close to that of the linearized system, even for large amplitudes.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The torsional vibration of rotating shafts contributes significantly to machinery vibration and noise but is notoriously difficult to study experimentally. New developments are reported which address the need for appropriate measurement tools, through improved understanding of the laser torsional vibrometer (LTV) {{and the application of}} modal analysis techniques. The LTV was developed previously for non-contact measurement of torsional oscillation. This thesis describes comprehensive theory to account for the sensitivity of its measurements to shaft motion in all degrees of freedom. The significance of this sensitivity is compared with the instrument noise floor and typical torsional and lateral vibration levels. Optimum instrument alignments are thereby specified to ensure immunity to all lateral motion. A new technique is proposed permitting unambiguous measurement in situations where conventional use of an LTV shows unavoidable lateral vibration sensitivity. Simultaneously, a previously unattained measurement of shaft bending vibration is derived. Practical application is demonstrated with measurements from an engine crankshaft, with identification of the first bending mode and estimation of its bending vibration amplitude. Experimental torsional modal analysis on rotating systems has had limited progression due to the absence of a versatile means to apply an instrumented torque. A novel device has been developed to provide a controllable and measurable torsional excitation, based on the principle of eddy current braking. Together with an LTV to measure response, estimation of the torque input permits frequency response functions to be obtained without modification to the system under test. This system achieves full modal analysis from a rotating shaft using conventional techniques for data processing, with derivation of natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping factors. Results from simple shaft systems consider the variation of modal parameters under rotating conditions. Application of this technology is clearly demonstrated in studying the behaviour of a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> vibration <b>absorber</b> (CPV A) used to control the resonant modes of a shaft system. Accurate measurement of each individual pendulum tuning is achieved. with examination of other effects related to successful absorber design. These results are complemented by novel use of the LTV to study the actual pendulum motion. The depth of information obtained underlines the analysis potential made possible by these advances in torsional vibration measurement...|$|R
40|$|When {{environmental}} laws are constricted and downsizing of engines {{has become the}} reality of the vehicle industry, {{there needs to be a}} solution for the rise in torsion vibrations in the drivetrain. These increased levels of torsion vibrations are mostly due to excitations from the firing pulses, which in turn have become increased due to higher cylinder pressures. One of the solutions for further dampening the system is to add a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> to the flywheel, and predicting the behaviour of such a device has become imperative. The intent of this thesis is to create a model that will accurately emulate the effectiveness and functionality of a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber,</b> so that it can be used in simulations to predict vehicle behaviour with its addition. To validate the model, a comparison is made between simulated results, using the model created in Adams/Car and Matlab, and road measurements conducted using a prototype acquired by the industry. The results from the simulations show that, with existing theory on the subject and software provided by Scania, an accurate model can be created. The reduction of torsion vibrations is evident, and the model’s behaviour correlates to that of the prototype. Future work on the subject requires a larger insight into pendulums tuned to multiple orders, and an extension of the model geometry would be advantageous...|$|E
40|$|A <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> for the {{reduction}} of linear vibrations was proposed by F. E. Reed in 1949. This is an analysis of a centrifugal absorber in which the rotating masses are supported by elastic restoring members. Equations for the amplitudes of vibration of the absorber and of the excited mass, and the frequency equation have been expressed in dimensionless quantities to make the results more easily applicable to any physical situation. The number of resonant frequencies {{of the system is}} show to be a function of the ratio W 2 /W 1 – the rotational frequency of the absorber to the exciting frequency. If this ratio is sufficiently large, there is only one resonant frequency and it is less than the resonant frequency of the vibrating body considered as an isolated system. If the resonant frequency of the system is less than the exciting frequency, partial absorption will occur. A nomograph of the frequency equation has been developed and included as an aid in choosing parameters to set the resonant frequency of the system at any desired level. Advisor: Gerald M. Smit...|$|E
40|$|Rotating {{machinery}} systems experience {{torsional vibrations}} with varying frequencies {{to some degree}} during normal operation. These vibrations if not controlled properly may cause severe system performance limitation and reduction of the fatigue life. Attenuation of torsional vibrations in these systems is a challenging engineering problem and raises several important issues in industrial applications. The present research aims at developing a novel hybrid torsional vibration damper incorporating a conventional <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>Pendulum</b> Vibration <b>Absorber</b> (CPVA) with the Magnetorheological (MR) damper capable of suppressing torsional vibrations at different excitation frequencies. In fact, CPVA and torsional MR damper have been investigated separately in previous research, however, {{there has been no}} study reported on integrating the two systems for the attenuation of torsional vibration. In this research study, first, the governing equations of motion for both horizontal and vertical CPVA have been derived using Lagrange’s principle to investigate the effect of gravity on the dynamics and performance of CPVA. Moreover, softening nonlinear behavior of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> and its effect on the natural frequency of the system has been investigated. Next, a rotary MR damper prototype was optimally designed, manufactured and tested. The design process of the rotary MR damper included several critical factors, particularly, analysis and design of the magnetic circuit of the MR damper. In order to ensure efficient design of the proposed damper, a finite element (FE) model of the rotary MR damper was developed to accurately evaluate the magnetic field distribution in the MR fluid and electromagnet core generated by the built-in electromagnet. The developed FE model enables to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design configuration as well as the selected material for the MR damper components. In addition, the equation of transmitted torque has been derived and utilized to evaluate the MR damper performance. In order to obtain the optimum geometric dimensions of the designed MR damper, an optimization problem has been formulated. The combined Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) have been employed to accurately capture the global optimum solution. An experimental test set up has been designed to evaluate the fabricated rotary MR damper performance by measuring the generated damping torque and to validate simulation results obtained from the model. Subsequently, the hybrid torsional MR damper incorporating both conventional CPVA and rotary MR damper has been proposed. The CPVA has been connected to the cylindrical housing of the MR damper. The governing equations of motion of the system consisting of a rotor with attached hybrid torsional dampers have been derived to evaluate the performance of the system under current off and maximum current applied to the MR damper’s electromagnet. The results are also compared with those obtained from rotor systems with only attached CPVA and rotary MR damper. Finally, a feedback control system using the semi-active skyhook control algorithm has been developed to adaptively control the proposed hybrid torsional damper under varying external excitations. It has been shown that the suggested closed-loop feedback control algorithm can significantly improve the damper performance compared with the open-loop (current off and on) system...|$|R

This problem is tackled through addition of an auxiliary, input torque balancing mechanism: a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pendulum,</b> of which the pendulum motion is imposed by an internal cam.

The aim {{of this study is to}} clarify the mechanism of the vibration sup-pression. But, most of the previous studies analyzed its characteristics based on the linear theory and explained focusing on the anti-resonance point. Since the pen-dulum may vibrate with large amplitude, it is expected that the nonlinearity have essential influence on its vi-bration characteristics. Therefore, we investigated the vibration suppression of a <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> consider-ing its nonlinearity. In our first report, we proposed a 2 -degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) model composed of a rigid blade and a <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber.</b> The blade is excited by giving a sinusoidal deflection at its end. In the sec-ond report, we proposed a 3 DOF model by adding the fuselage, where the blade is also considered rigid. The blade is excited by a distributed force which changes sinusoidally. In this paper, a 3 DOF model which is composed of a mass corresponding to a rotor mount on the fuselage, a flexible blade, and a pendulum is discussed. A periodic distributed force is given on the blade. This study clarified the mechanism of the pen-dulum absorbers for suppressing the vibrations of heli-copters based on the nonlinearity theory.

40|$|In {{this work}} we study the {{frequency}} and dynamic response of a damped Duffing system attached to a parametrically excited <b>pendulum</b> vibration <b>absorber.</b> The multiple scales method is applied to get the autoparametric resonance conditions {{and the results are}} compared with a similar application of a <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> for a linear primary system. The approximate frequency analysis reveals that the nonlinear dynamics of the externally excited system are suppressed by the <b>pendulum</b> <b>absorber</b> and, under this condition, the primary Duffing system yields a time response almost equivalent to that obtained for a linear primary system, although the absorber frequency response is drastically modified and affected by the cubic stiffness, thus modifying the jumps defined by the fixed points. In the absorber frequency response can be appreciated a good absorption capability for certain ranges of nonlinear stiffness and the internal coupling is maintained by the existing damping between the pendulum and the primary system. Moreover, the stability of the coupled system is also affected by some extra fixed points introduced by the cubic stiffness, which is illustrated with several amplitude-force responses. Some numerical simulations of the approximate frequency responses and dynamic behavior are performed to show the steady-state and transient responses...|$|R

The leading bending behaviour of a typical truss mast is described by an equivalent beam model whereas the guys are conveniently modeled as equivalent transverse springs whose stiffness comprises the elastic and geometric stiffness. By assuming a mast with an inertially and elastically isotropic crosssection, a planar model of the guyed mast is investigated. The linearization of the equations of motion of the mast subject to a harmonic distributed force leads to the transfer functions of the structure without the dampers and with the dampers. The transfer functions allow to investigate the mitigation effects of the pendula.

The differential equation that governs the CBCP cam design was derived and a methodology for solving it developed. Furthermore, in a de-sign example, the CBCP {{was applied to}} balance the input torque of a high-speed cam-follower mechanism, driving the sley of a weaving loom. The present pa-per rstly shows how the design parameters for this particular design example can be optimized, so as to obtain a compact and technologically feasible mechanism.

Secondly, the CBCP is applied to an industrial case study, that is, a weaving loom. The robustness of the CBCP is illustrated by showing that input torque balancing solely the sley movement enhances the overall dynamic machine behavior, despite the presence of the non-balanced shed motion.
