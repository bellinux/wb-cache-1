The manikin is controlled by a finite-element physiological model of the human thermoregulatory system. ADAM’s thermal response to a baseline LCG was measured. The thermal sensation and comfort followed the expected trends as the LCG inlet fluid temperature was changed. The overall thermal comfort showed less variation than expected when testing points off the NASA <b>comfort</b> <b>curve.</b> These new thermal comfort tools permit detailed, repeatable measurements and evaluation of LCGs. Results can extend to other personal protective clothing, including HAZMAT suits, nuclear / biological / chemical protective suits, and fire protection suits...|$|E
40|$|Staircases {{are one of}} the {{architectural}} history's oldest building elements and over the years they have transported humans comfortably and safely between different altitudes. By measuring the human stride length during the 1600 s a formula could take place to facilitate the work in finding the best relationship between the step depth and step height. It was shown over the years that the formula did not always result in comfortable staircases. Therefore in 1957, Lars Einar Eriksson presented the so-called <b>comfort</b> <b>curve,</b> which is also a tool to facilitate the work of finding the best relationship between step depth and step height. The {{purpose of the study was}} therefore to verify whether these two tools still were two current tools or if these had to be adjusted. Furthermore, the aim for this study has been to find out what determines if a staircase is considered comfortable and safe for the user and if adjustments need to be made regarding the demands of the structures of the staircase. In order to achieve the objectives of the study and answer the research questions a questionnaire was developed and interviews were conducted on five of the largest staircase builders in Sweden. The study's conclusion can be answered through the issues; what is it that determines the comfort and safety of a staircase?, how can a staircase be made as comfortable as possible for as many people as possible?, Are the staircase formula and the <b>comfort</b> <b>curve</b> still relevant, or do they need to be adjusted? And are there any requirements in the Swedish regulatory framework that should be adjusted? The conclusion of what determines the comfort and safety of a staircase is partly individual, but at the same time it depends on several different factors that must be interconnected. In the end it is about a holistic assessment of the individual staircase. There are three factors that are fundamental to construct a staircase that is both comfortable and safe for as many people as possible. These factors are; Step depth, step height and step width. Further, it all comes down to analyze the stair environment and its users. The staircase formula does not necessarily need to be adjusted; it has shown to fulfill its purpose. It is instead about finding additional tools to the staircase formula when it in some cases does not provide comfortable stair conditions. Regarding the <b>comfort</b> <b>curve,</b> it turns out that many of the respondents in the study have not heard of it but still feels that it could be an additional tool to the staircase formula. The study has resulted in a developed area and an updated formula according to 4. 1 H + B = 1025 mm since the current stair formula does not cover the entire developed area. There should be made several adjustments regarding the demands of the staircase structures, particularly around the requirements for the description of the background, contrast marking, handrails and step height.

40|$|Background: Scientific {{evidence}} exists {{to demonstrate that}} glycemic control produces a positive outcome for critically ill patients by decreasing mortality and morbidity. Results of published research have revealed a reduction of mortality in critically ill patients when serum blood glucose levels are maintained {{at a level of}} less than 150 mg/dL. Recommendations from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign for treatment of patients in septic shock include use of intravenous insulin therapy to control hyperglycemia via the use of a validated protocol for insulin dose adjustment. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether glycemic control (less than 150 mg/dL) was attained more effectively using an existing Rochester General Hospital Surgical Intensive Care Unit (RGH SICU) paper-based standardized insulin infusion protocol or a computer-based insulin infusion protocol. A secondary purpose was to determine how the use of each protocol affects the incidence of hypoglycemia. Research Questions: Is there a difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia (3 ̆c 60 mg/dL) between the paper-based protocol and the computer-based protocol? Is there a difference between the paper-based protocol and the computer-based protocol in attaining glycemic control (3 ̆c 150 mg/dL) ? Is there a relationship between clinician adherence and correct insulin dosage? Hypotheses: There will be no relationship between time required to attain glycemic control and protocol used to achieve control. There will be no relationship between the incidence of hypoglycemia and protocol. There will be no relationship between clinician adherence and correct insulin dosage. Method: A quantitative, combined retrospective and prospective design was used to review medical records of 60 patients admitted to the SICU at RGH. For the retrospective part of the study, 30 charts were reviewed from 2006, which was prior to the development of the computerized insulin infusion protocol. The prospective part of the study began after the StatStrip Xpress Glucose Hospital Meters had been implemented by RGH. For the retrospective data collection, patients 2 ̆ 7 blood glucose measurements were monitored via the use of the Roche Advantage Accu-Chek Glucometers and Accu-Chek <b>Comfort</b> <b>Curve</b> test strips. The Pharmacy Department supplied the medical record numbers of these patients (n 30). Data collected included age, gender, weight, prior history of diabetes, presenting illness/surgery, serum glucose on admission to SICU, use ofvasopressors, use of corticosteroids, use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or gastric tube feedings, use of mechanical ventilation and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (Apache II) scores related to illness severity. Analysis: Using SPSS 18. 0, descriptive statistics were calculated, including measures of central tendency, shape of distributions, and measures of variability. Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s correlations were used to determine the relationships between time required to attain glycemic control and protocol used to achieve control, incidence of hypoglycemia. Results: The rate of hypoglycemia for patients receiving the paper-based protocol was 10...|$|E

40|$|The {{trend towards}} low-floor trams which {{appeared}} during the recent decades brought up {{a variety of different}} solutions in vehicle design. Usually the operators preferred the 100 % low-floor vehicles, paying particular respect to disabled passengers. These trams have a constant floor height of not more than 350 mm throughout the whole vehicle. An indispensable precondition for this is to abandon the wheelsets and the principle of placing the drive motors between the wheels. Thus all according vehicle designs have independent wheels instead of the previously used conventional wheelsets. Moreover, the 100 % low-floor design reduces drastically the maximal yaw angle of the bogies. In order to allow appropriate yaw movements within the vehicles, the carbodies had to be split into a number of articulated sections, with the motor and trailer bogies nearly fixed to them. In consequence the different drivetrain solutions became numerous. This thesis analyses and compares characteristic designs of multi-articulated trams that have been acquired by a large number of tram operators: the Combino and Variobahn design. In addition the 70 % low-floor, conventional motor bogie-based tram type Cologne is analysed, which has also been acquired in large numbers. The analyses were mainly performed by means of multibody simulation and were focused on• the running behaviour in tangent track,• the permissibility of the current track design regulations with regard to the derailment safety, and• the passenger <b>comfort</b> in <b>curve</b> entry transitions. For the latter analysis a general distinction was made between two design variants: on the one hand the curve entry for tracks within the street, without transition and superelevation ramp, {{and on the other hand}} the curve entry for autonomous tracks with curve transition and superelevation ramp. The results showed that the running behaviour in tangent track is satisfactory for all vehicles, and there is no increase in the derailment risk, either. However, the analyses showed also that each of the vehicles exceeds the jerk limits defined by the according VDV regulation. It could also be shown that there is an inadequacy in the regulation criterion for the <b>comfort</b> in <b>curve</b> transitions. The latest operational and biomechanical experience demonstrates that the main comfort criterion is not the jerk but rather the frequency of the lateral oscillations, the mean lateral acceleration – considered over a period of 2 s – and the product of the lateral acceleration in the curve at the moment of maximal jerk and the reaction time of the passengers. The consequences which are relevant for the running dynamics are:• The current track design regulations can be retained without exceptions, as long as the vehicle concept and the bogie design are appropriate. • The operators’ guidelines concerning door arrangement and vehicle capacity must not have negative influences on the running dynamics, the derailment safety and the comfort of passengers and staff. • When the choice of the curve radius is restricted by existing buildings then the track design parameters must be chosen in a way that the running safety is not endangered in any operational condition. • The definition of limit values for lateral acceleration, jerk and permissible human exposure to mechanical vibrations should be brought to a safe basis by means of multidisciplinary discussions with experts in medicine, biomechanics, physiology and vehicle design...|$|R
40|$|Introducing spiral curves {{before and}} after {{horizontal}} circular curves has been widely accepted to enhance traffic safety, highway esthetics, sight distance, and driver <b>comfort.</b> Though, vertical <b>curves</b> are still designed as parabolic curves that are connected directly to the tangent (without transitions). In this paper, a cubic polynomial is used to develop a vertical transition curve {{before and after}} the parabolic vertical curve. The resulting curve, called transitioned vertical curve, consists of transition-parabolic-transition segments. Detailed mathematical formulation and derivation of the instantaneous elevation, grade, rate of curvature, and offset from the first tangent at any point are presented. The highest (or lowest) point on a transitioned crest (or sag) vertical curve, where the instantaneous grade equals 0, is determined as it is of particular importance in highway drainage design. The minimum length of a transition curve is derived based on the criterion of driver comfort. In addition, guidelines are provided to identify the conditions where the drainage of surface water on transitioned curves can be a concern. Finally, the layout of the transitioned vertical curve is described and illustrated using two numerical examples. The new transitioned vertical curve, which exhibits striking similarities to the spiraled horizontal curve, should enhance the design of highway vertical alignments. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{main purpose}} of the article is to {{determine}} the permissible speed of the air-cushioned tilting train in curved track and to justify the expediency of operating this type of rolling stock on the railways of Ukraine to increase the speed, improve the passenger comfort and save the energy due to more uniform high-speed train driving. Methodology. The determination of the maximum permissible speed of the tilted train in curved track involves the use of methods of linear and vector algebra and empirical formulas for applied scientific and technical research. The calculation of the maximum speed is based on the principle of calculating centrifugal force for the velocities that meet the safety criteria of movement on the horizontal unbalanced acceleration in the stable radius curve. Findings. The results of the calculations showed that in the 1000 m radius curved track section, provided the passenger comfort, the maximum permissible speed of the train without forced tilt is 132 km/h, and with the forced tilt – 189 km/h. The velocity gain in the curve is about 30 % and up to 10 % on the section (depending on the number of curves). Originality. The method of determining the permissible speed of the tilted train in curved track is improved, which consists in determining the permissible centrifugal force acting on the train in the stable radius curve, taking into account the passenger comfort conditions. Practical value. This method allows accurately determining the permissible speed on the condition of passenger <b>comfort</b> in the <b>curved</b> section and the required additional tilt angle of the train, depending on the speed, curve radius and canting. Enhanced speed and comfort of passenger trains in the future will increase the demand for rail services among the population and strengthen the position of rail transport in Ukraine’s transport system...|$|R
