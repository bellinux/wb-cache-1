5|$|Beat 'em ups {{are related}} to—but {{distinct}} from—fighting games, {{which are based}} around one-on-one matches rather than scrolling levels and multiple enemies. Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as some commentators prefer to conflate the two terms. At times, both one-on-one fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> to fans of either genre. Occasionally, a game will feature both kinds of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E
5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E

25|$|<b>CAN</b> <b>appealed</b> the {{decision}} but {{a three-judge panel}} of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the award, {{two of the three}} judges finding against CAN, with the third judge dissenting. The full 9th Circuit court then voted against reconsidering the case. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final <b>appeal</b> by <b>CAN</b> in March 1999.|$|R
50|$|Judgements {{from the}} tier 4 courts <b>can</b> be <b>appealed</b> only to their {{respective}} higher tier 3 courts (e.g. judgements from the English law Magistrates Court <b>can</b> only be <b>appealed</b> to the tier 3 English law court (the High Court of a state/FCT).|$|R
5|$|Alex and {{the group}} {{discover}} Maggie Adler's plan to fix the temporal tears—transposing onto {{the other side and}} tuning within. Alex repeatedly has visions of the past, including talking with Michael. Alex and Jonas head to a lookout post to unlock a bomb shelter to find another way into the cave. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Inside the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, Alex is warned that she will die if the rift is closed, but Clarissa will be kept if she goes through the portal. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the portal herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if she has found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex seen throughout the game is revealed to be Alex from the future. She then loops back to a conversation to Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away from town. Time then corrects.|$|E

25|$|The Ombudsman is {{the final}} appeal {{authority}} in resolving postal service complaints. If a complaint is not resolved to the customer’s satisfaction by Canada Post, the customer <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> to the Ombudsman.

25|$|The Board draws a {{distinction}} between formal and informal settlements, i.e., those that call for issuance of a formal Board order {{and those that do}} not. A party unhappy with the Regional Director's settlement of its unfair labor practice charges <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> a formal settlement to the Board itself, which must approve any formal settlement in any case, but can only appeal an informal settlement to the General Counsel.|$|E
25|$|After the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) {{issues a}} {{decision}} in writing. The decision can be Fully Favorable (the ALJ finds the claimant disabled as of the date that (s) he alleges in the application through the present), Partially Favorable (the ALJ finds the claimant disabled at some point, but not as of the date alleged in the application; OR the ALJ finds that the claimant was disabled but has improved), or Unfavorable (the ALJ finds that the claimant was not disabled at all). Claimants <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> decisions to Social Security's Appeals Council, which is in Virginia. The Appeals Council does not hold hearings; it accepts written briefs. Response time from the Appeals Council can range from 12 weeks to more than 3 years.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to protesting, ACORN also developed and strengthened its {{political action committees}} and encouraged its members to run for office. For the 1984 election ACORN wanted to endorse a candidate, setting a 75% support in polls among members as its requirement. No candidate reached that level, though there was strong support for Jesse Jackson. ACORN also established a legislative office that year in Washington, DC. During this period ACORN also focused on local election reform {{in a number of}} cities, including Pittsburgh, Columbia, South Carolina, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. They encouraged cities to change legislative bodies whose members were elected at-large to electing members by single-member district, which resulted in more participation by minorities, including women. At-large voting tends to favor candidates who <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> to the majority and who can command more campaign funding, reducing participation by a wider variety of citizens.|$|E

25|$|The Court of Appeal only hears appeals from {{decisions}} of the High Court made when the latter is exercising original criminal jurisdiction. In other words, matters heard by the High Court on appeal from the State Courts cannot be further appealed to the Court of Appeal, though questions of law may be reserved for determination by the Court (see below). A person convicted in the High Court <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> against the conviction, the sentence or both, unless he or she pleaded guilty in which case only an appeal against the extent or legality of the sentence is permitted. In the latter situation, the Court of Appeal may nonetheless permit the person who pleaded guilty to appeal against conviction if it believes that {{this is in the}} interests of justice. The Public Prosecutor may appeal against an acquittal or the sentence imposed on an accused person. The Court is entitled to summarily reject an appeal if the grounds of appeal do not involve any question of law, the conviction is supportable by the evidence, and {{there is nothing in the}} circumstances of the case which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the conviction was right or leads the Court to think the sentence should be reduced. The summary rejection of an appeal may only be done upon the unanimous decision of the Judges of Appeal.|$|E

500|$|Bush {{opined that}} this record wasn't very {{different}} from their previous releases. [...] "It's still an Anthrax album with many different parts that <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> to a wide audience. Our sound is recognizable each time you listen {{to one of our}} songs and that's something we really want for our music. You have the fastest rhythms, the more danceable ones, you have everything you can expect from an Anthrax record." [...] Benante said that elements from their earlier albums are still present on the record, though it explores [...] "other territories".|$|E
500|$|Marojejy National Park {{is noted}} for its rich biodiversity, which <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> to both {{scientist}} and ecotourist. [...] There are {{a wide range of}} habitats within the park, and many of its plants and animals are endemic to the area. [...] Scientific expeditions regularly discover species that are either not previously documented in Marojejy, or in some cases, completely new to science. [...] Some new species are highly endangered. [...] In the case of many large groups, such as invertebrates, very little is known and much remains to be discovered.|$|E

Cheese Pizzeria & Games. These locations feature more upscale decor with a [...] "muted" [...] interior color scheme, an open kitchen, the [...] "Play Pass" [...] card system to replace arcade tokens, and the animatronic stage show replaced by a dance floor area. These changes, along with expansions to food offerings, are intended to help the chain provide an experience that <b>can</b> <b>appeal</b> better to adult visitors, and encourage family dining as opposed to primarily parties.|$|E
