First of all, it is to be said that neither the form, nor the <b>card</b> <b>bin</b> of e-journals can be compared to the paper journal every one knows. The paper journal item division doesn't exist in the database, that collects and organizes the full-texts. Actually, the full-texts are available in an easier way than the physical bookcase access (item/volume/year).

In {{the days}} prior to online course registration, each student would come to Barton Hall {{at the start of}} the semester to register for classes. This process would involve placing punched <b>cards</b> into <b>bins</b> for each class positioned on tables throughout the hall. Student organizations would also recruit members at these events. In the first part of the 20th century, [...] "drill" [...] was mandatory for all male students, and it would be conducted in Barton Hall. Also, until 1974, graduation was conducted in Barton Hall, until it was moved outdoors to Schoellkopf Field. For many years, it also hosted graduation ceremonies for Ithaca High School.|$|R
40|$|Lean Production System is a {{manufacturing}} management in which {{time can be}} shortened for customer order and delivery time; and service parts order can be increased through {{the elimination of all}} forms of waste. The main component for “Just-In-Time”, one of the pillars of Lean production System is "Pull System" or Kanban System. Kanban system is a pull system of inventory control that typically uses <b>cards</b> or <b>bins</b> to signal when materials or work-in-process should be moved forward; stock inventory is moved through production stages only when it is needed,and minimizing stock inventories. This is an important revolution in the concept of the Lean Production System. The objective of this research is to simulate Kanban policies for three major materials in warehouse of Proreka (M) Sdn Bhd which is a Malaysia Tier- 1 vendor and manufacturer of automotive components. Another objective is to investigate the stock control efficiencies between Material Requirement Planning and Kanban System. The main target of this research is to implement small lot ordering by using Kanban policy to reduce the stock inventories. A simulation model of delivery frequency was developed for the replenishment process of the selected stocks to analyse the delivery frequency from supplier after Kanban implementation. The average stock holding before and after Kanban implementation was analysed to compare the stock control effectiveness between Material Requirement Planning and Kanban System. Interview session and survey by questionnaire were conducted to analyse the performance of Kanban System in point of view of employees. The result obtained indicated that Kanban policy can reduce stock inventories and improve the efficiency in stock control. Other significant improvements with the implementation of Kanban are such as physical condition of the manufacturing environment, production efficiency, and motivation of workers...|$|R
40|$|Typically, {{fluctuation}} {{correlation spectroscopy}} (FCS) data acquisition cards measure {{the number of}} photon events per time interval (i. e., bin) - time mode. Commercial FCS <b>cards</b> combine the <b>bins</b> through hardware in order to calculate the autocorrelation function. Such a design therefore does not yield the time resolved photon sequence, but only the autocorrelation of that sequence. A different acquisition method which measures the number of time intervals between photon events has been implemented - photon mode. This method {{takes advantage of the}} fact that in FCS the rate of photon counts is much less than the frequency of the clock that is used to determine the temporal location of the photons. By using this new mode of data acquisition, the current card design allows for 25 ns time resolution. The data acquisition card can operate in both time and photon mode and yields the time resolved sequence of photon arrivals in both cases. Therefore, the data is available for analysis by any method(s), such as but not limited to, autocorrelation, photon counting histogram, and higher order autocorrelation. © 2000 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|The {{control and}} {{auditing}} {{of stock in}} any organisation especially a manufacturing outfit such as Nigeria Engineering Works Limited is very vital, and demand management attention. Auditing could be done manually or electronically {{through the use of}} a computer. The study was carried out in four major departments of the company, namely Production, Marketing, Data processing and Internal audit. The study was guided by four research questions and a null/alternate hypothesis to ascertain whether the stock control measures in Nigeria Engineering Works Limited are inadequate and in conflict with specifications. The population and the sample size for the study were 80 and 50 staffers respectively. The data gotten was analysed with the use of mean and chi-square statistical tool tested at 95 % alpha level. The study revealed that Nigeria Engineering Works limited adopted the manual process of auditing as they have their inventory records on <b>bin</b> <b>cards</b> or ledger; this helps the internal audit to conduct their physical perpetual counts. The accountants considered the system tedious and labourious as they opt for innovation. With this method, stock control is affected by the means of computer records kept by the Data processing and Internal audit department in respect of the material stocked. The study also revealed that the company is yet to have central purchasing department...|$|R

The goal of the research is to find out the possible English accounting terminologies at Harris Hotel & Conventions, the writer felt that English language is important to be understood not just for the front office department of a hotel but also in accounting department, and the writer felt that researching about English terminologies in accounting department at a hotel is rarely done especially in Unpas. English terminologies are a set of words that related to a study or a subject while accounting department isa department that handles financial recording and reporting of a hotel, hotel is a business that provides its guests rooms for commercial purpose. In this research, the writer gathered the data with documentation research instrument, where he collected documents from Harris Hotel & Conventions Ciumbuleuit like purchase order, purchase requisition, <b>bin</b> <b>card</b> and chart of accounts, he researched and analyzed the data with qualitative method. After analyzing the research, the writer found many English accounting terminologies, there are around 66 English terminologies gotten from this research, where most of them were alphabetized and their use in accounting were explained, the terminologies were mostly related to administration, purchasing and storage operations. After doing the research, the writer suggests that English language must be considered as an essential language to be learned because it can also be appliable not to front office department but to accounting department as well, because there are many of accounting terminologies are in English, it would help the readers understand the terminologies much easier.

40|$|Background: Inventory {{management}} {{is the important}} pillar of the pharmaceutical supply system. Problems in inventory management system generally features with ad hoc decision about order frequency and quantity, inaccurate stock records and lack of system performance monitoring and consequently shortage of pharmaceuticals in the health facilities. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the pharmaceutical logistics system performance in Pemba public health facilities. Methodology: The study was a cross-sectional survey that involved twenty eight health facilities and two warehouses. Inventory keeping records over a period of one year, from January to December 2012, were reviewed. Data on storage condition and HWs’ knowledge on logistics were collected using storage condition check list and questionnaire respectively. Data on medicine expiry were collected based on recorded data and physical counting. Results: The average percent of time out of stock for all health facilities combined was 31 %, at ZILS department store was 13. 2 % and at the Zonal Central Medical Store was 14. 4 %. Percentage of accurate stock records was 70. 6 % in health facilities that were using pull supply system, 64. 9 % in those facilities which were using push supply system, and 47. 3 % in facilities which were using bulky supply system (DHs). Storage condition in 52. 2 % of the PHCUs was unacceptable. Conclusion: Health facilities in Pemba, within a year, faced stock outs of a number of pharmaceutical products. Stock keeping records were also not perfectly accurate. It is recommended that training should be conducted to all health workers involved in the management of pharmaceuticals, on the basics of pharmaceutical store management with due emphasis on record keeping and specifically the proper use of store ledgers and <b>bin</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of {{minimizing}} utilization of limited financial resources in Tanzania, {{there are still some}} factors that affect the whole system of supply chain of antimalarial medicines. The goals of Integrated Logistic System (ILS) have not been realized since still there is drug shortage and poor stock recording system in the health facilities. Inadequate knowledge of the pharmaceutical management and inappropriate use of antimalarial drugs always contribute to the poor quality and availability of the drugs in the health facilities and irrational use of the antimalarial drugs. Objectives: The main objective {{of the study was to}} assess the knowledge in practice of pharmaceutical management and prescribing pattern of antimalarial drugs in the public health facilities in Dar-es-salaam. Descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study design was used to survey nine (9) public health facilities in Dar-es-salaam region. The health facilities included 4 hospitals and 5 Health Centers. A total of 32 pharmaceutical health workers (drug store managers and drug dispensers) were interviewed using structured questionnaires. Two different structured questionnaires were used to interview drug store managers and drug dispensers separately. Average stock-out time of antimalarial drugs from January to December 2010 was assessed using a designed form. A total of 4320 prescriptions were examined and recorded from all the selected public health facilities. Adequate storage conditions and handling of medicines procedures were also assessed. Since Medical Stores Department (MSD) is the main supplying source of the antimalarial drugs to these facilities, it was also included in this study as the special site for assessing availability of antimalarial medicines from the source. Among all nine (9) drug store managers, six (6) had poor knowledge on quantification concept, and seven (7) did not apply Integrated Logistic System indicating that it is still confusing to be applied. All of drug store managers had inadequate knowledge on the concept of procurement, and there were no effective and efficient procurement systems in all the health facilities. In most of the facilities, <b>BIN</b> <b>Cards</b> and Stock ledger books were the most commonly used stock recording systems.. There are no Electronic Drug Recording systems in these facilities.

Results: Among all nine (9) drug store managers, six (6) had poor knowledge on quantification concept, and seven (7) did not apply Integrated Logistic System indicating 2 that it is still confusing to be applied. All of drug store managers had inadequate knowledge on the concept of procurement, and there were no effective and efficient procurement systems in all the health facilities. In most of the facilities, <b>BIN</b> <b>Cards</b> and Stock ledger books were the most commonly used stock recording systems.. There are no Electronic Drug Recording systems in these facilities. A tedious and bureaurocratic process of expired drug disposal was cited as a reason for pilling up of expired drugs in the health facilities. Percentage time out of stock for the antimalarial drugs were 25 % for Artemether-Lumefantrine (ALU) and 25. 7 % for Quinine tablets and 6. 4 % for injections All drug stores in the health facilities scored satisfactory marks in adequacy storage conditions and handling of antimalarial medicines. However, all facilities had no cold storage facilities with temperature charts; and medicines were kept directly on the floor in seven (7) out of 9 main drug stores and six (6) out of 15 dispensing rooms. Regarding rational dispensing of medicines, only 22 and 12 of all (32) interviewed drug dispensers had good knowledge on recommended doses and dosage regimen of ALU respectively. Regarding dispensing of ALU in pregnancy as special group, 19 drug dispensers were not able to provide correct information for use of ALU during pregnancy. The average number of drugs prescribed per prescriptions was 2. 4 ± 0. 014, and 98 % of prescriptions contained only one antimalarial drug, among them 88. 9 % was ALU. About 96. 9 % of the prescriptions showed wrong prescribing pattern for ALU in terms of its dosage. Conclusion: Despite the government efforts in increasing public awareness of ALU and ensuring constant availability of such drugs at MSD, there is a significant stock-out period due to poor pharmaceutical management of antimalarial medicines in the public health facilities. Although adherence to the national malaria treatment guidelines is satisfactory, there is significant irrational prescribing of antimalarials among the prescribers. Based on these findings, it is proposed that regular on-job training and continuing education should be provided to drug dispensers and prescribers in the public health facilities.
