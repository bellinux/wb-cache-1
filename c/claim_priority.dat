25|$|Texas Instruments v. Fairchild: In {{their legal}} wars, Texas Instruments {{focused on their}} largest and most technologically {{advanced}} competitor, Fairchild Semiconductor. Their cases hindered not the production at Fairchild, but the sale of licenses for their technologies. By 1965, the planar technology of Fairchild became the industry standard, but the license to patents of Hoerni and Noyce was purchased by less than ten manufacturers, {{and there were no}} mechanisms to pursue unlicensed production. Similarly, the key patents of Kilby were bringing no income to Texas Instruments. In 1964, the patent arbitration awarded Texas Instruments the rights to four of the five key provisions of the contested patents, but both companies appealed the decision. The litigation could continue for years, if not the defeat of Texas Instruments in the dispute with Sprague in April 1966. Texas Instruments realized that they could not <b>claim</b> <b>priority</b> for the whole set of key IC patents, and lost interest in the patent war. In the summer of 1966, Texas Instruments and Fairchild agreed on the mutual recognition of patents and cross-licensing of key patents; in 1967 they were joined by Sprague.|$|E
25|$|Having {{set their}} sights on A.C. Milan player Antonio Nocerino, D.C. United found their {{negotiation}} was undermined when Orlando City S.C.'s Kaka apparently convinced his former teammate to reject United's offer and pursue {{a contract with}} Orlando. Fortunately, a plan B quickly emerged. The team filled the holding mid slot by trading for MLS veteran Marcelo Sarvas, and got {{a bit of an}} unexpected boost when the name of a former acquisition target, Boca Junior's midfielder/forward Luciano Acosta suddenly showed up on the transfer rumor wires. Within a week, United had the diminutive midfielder signed and training in their Florida pre-season camp. The next day, Acosta even assisted on the lone goal in a match against Tampa Bay Rowdies. Reportedly, United agreed to a trade of a conditional draft pick to New York Red Bulls, who had gained discovery <b>claim</b> <b>priority</b> on Acosta, after United had relinquished its own. As preseason continued, the team released Conor Doyle {{to make way for a}} trialist from USL side Pittsburgh Riverhounds, winger Rob Vincent. United took to the pitch for the first time in 2016, with a 2015-16 CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinal series against Queretaro FC. In a match in the Mexican mountain city, D.C. United mostly held its own. But, missed chances by the visitors opened the door for the home team, which scored twice in the final 20 minutes, to take a daunting 2-0 lead in the series.|$|E

2500|$|In 1751, Maupertuis' {{priority}} for the principle of least action was challenged in print (Nova Acta Eruditorum of Leipzig) by an old acquaintance, Johann Samuel Koenig, who quoted a 1707 letter purportedly from Leibniz that described results similar to those derived by Euler in 1744. [...] However, Maupertuis and others demanded that Koenig produce the original of the letter to authenticate its having been written by Leibniz. [...] Koenig only had a copy and no clue as to the whereabouts of the original. [...] Consequently, [...] and that its President, Maupertuis, could continue to <b>claim</b> <b>priority</b> for having invented the principle. [...] Koenig continued to fight for Leibniz's priority and soon luminaries such as Voltaire and the King of Prussia, Frederick II were engaged in the quarrel. [...] However, no progress was made until {{the turn of the}} twentieth century, when other independent copies of Leibniz's letter were discovered. [...] The present scholarly consensus seems to be that the quotations from Leibniz are indeed genuine, i.e., that he had invented Maupertuis' principle and applied it to several mechanical problems by 1707 (37 years before Maupertuis and Euler) but did not publish his findings.|$|E
2500|$|Second, {{among those}} who believe in [...] "substantive" [...] fusion, there has been {{intensive}} discussion about the appropriate taxonomy that underlies the law of trusts. A first aspect of this is that, for some, trusts appear to straddle the supposed boundary between [...] "property" [...] and [...] "obligations". When English law was being codified and exported through the British Empire, for example in the Indian Trusts Act 1882, the authors thought it was thought appropriate to describe a trust as [...] "an obligation annexed to the ownership of property", implying a view often restated, that [...] "equity acts in personam". On the other hand, it has been consistently held that the beneficiary of a trust holds a proprietary right. This enables the beneficiary to <b>claim</b> <b>priority</b> over some (but not all) non-proprietary creditors in insolvency, or the beneficiary to bring a direct action in tort against a defendant who has damaged trust property. It is also acknowledged that the beneficiary may trace money that has wrongly been dissipated from the trust, but unlike a legal property owner, perhaps not against a bona fide purchaser. Peter Birks, on this ground, has suggested that beneficial interests trusts are a slightly weaker form of proprietary right. Ben McFarlane and Robert Stevens have alternatively suggested that beneficial interests are neither personal nor proprietary, but instead a [...] "right against a right". One of the difficulties underpinning the debate is that it assumes the distinction between obligations (which operate only between persons) and property (which either operate against a thing, or bind third parties) is a coherent one: [...] "proprietary" [...] rights do not ultimately operate against [...] "things" [...] rather than people, while supposedly [...] "personal" [...] obligations bind third parties who would interfere with them as much as proprietary rights are thought to. It would follow that a [...] "right against a right" [...] is conceptually incomplete, because a right is an abstract thing that cannot bear a duty: a person does. On this view the function of trusts is to form part of a system of priorities among all rights (regardless of their historical status as personal or property right) when faced of conflicts over assets, particularly against other creditors of an insolvent debtor.|$|E
