40|$|In subaerial volcaniclastic sequences, {{structures}} {{formed by}} ice blocks can {{provide information about}} a volcano's history of lahar generation by glacier melt. At Volcán Hudson in Chile, catastrophic lahars were initiated by eruption-induced melting of glacier ice in August and October 1991. They transported large ice blocks 50 ?km down the Rio de los Huemules valley to the sea. Large current crescents with lee-side lenses were formed where ice blocks were deposited during waning stages of the flood. When stranded blocks of ice melted, they left cone-shaped and ring-shaped heaps of ice-rafted debris on the sediment surface. Several hundred ice blocks were completely buried within the aggrading lahar sediment, and when these melted circular collapse pits formed in the sediment. <b>Collapse</b> <b>types</b> included subsided coherent blocks of sediment bounded by an outward-dipping ring-fracture, trapdoor structures with horseshoe-shaped fractures, downsag pits with centroclinal dips locally up to 60 °, pits with peripheral graben and crevasses, piecemeal (highly fragmented) collapse structures and funnel-shaped pits containing disaggregated sediment. A sequence of progressive collapse is inferred in which initial downsag and subsidence on an outward-dipping ring fracture produces a small diameter pit. This is followed by widening of the pit by progressive development of concentric ring fractures and downsag outside the early formed pit, and by collapse of overhanging pit walls to produce vertical to inward-dipping walls and aprons of collapse debris on the pit floor. The various structures have potential for preservation even in regions prone to high rainfall and flooding, {{and they can be}} used to indicate that former lahars contained abundant blocks of ice...|$|E

Researchers can {{contribute}} to rescue operations by investigating different ways of collecting information from the crisis area and delivering it to rescue teams. This project proposes a novel approach for collecting information from disaster areas in relation to building collapses and collapse pattern analysis. Our approach is based on classifying building collapse patterns using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and data-mining algorithms. Classification time and reliability are considered crucial factors, {{and one of the}} main objectives of this research is to improve these elements in order to deliver accurate information to rescue teams regarding building status in a stricken area. WSNs were installed in a simulated building to capture a building‟s motion during an earthquake. Four different types of collapse patterns were simulated: first column (FC), first storey (FS), mid-storey (MS) and pancake (PCK). The captured data was inputted to three different classification algorithms (PCA, VQH and HMM) to classify building <b>collapse</b> <b>types.</b> Two real-life case scenarios were designed to examine the algorithms‟ reliability under sensor failure. The first scenario was sensor failure on impact, which was designed to simulate sensor failure caused by interfering with an object or hitting the ground. The second scenario was the complete failure of random sensors, which was designed to simulate early malfunctioning sensors resulting from a power supply failure, communication problem or manufacture error. Moreover, the second scenario was designed to investigate the limit of each classification algorithm {{in terms of the number}} of failed sensors. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) proved the most robust and achieved 100 % accuracy in least impact on accuracy (LIoA) case scenario and 60 % accuracy as an algorithm limit when 33. 3 % of the sensors failed during a building collapse. By achieving this level of accuracy, the objective of classifying four possible collapse patterns in a short processing time was achieved...|$|E

40|$|Probabilistic topic {{modeling}} is {{a powerful}} tool to uncover hidden thematic structure of documents. These hidden structures are useful for extracting concepts of documents and other data mining tasks, such as information retrieval. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), is a generative probabilistic topic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA represents documents as a bag-of-words, where the important structure of documents is neglected. In this work, we proposed three extended LDA models that incorporates syntactic and semantic structures of text documents into probabilistic topic models. Our first proposed topic model enriches text documents with <b>collapsed</b> <b>typed</b> dependency relations to effectively acquire syntactic and semantic dependencies between consecutive and nonconsecutive words of text documents. This representation has several benefits. It captures relations between consecutive and nonconsecutive words of text documents. In addition, the labels of the <b>collapsed</b> <b>typed</b> dependency relations help to eliminate less important relations, i. e., relations involving prepositions. Moreover, in this thesis, we introduced a method to enforce topic similarity to conceptually similar words. As a result, this algorithm leads to more coherent topic distribution over words. Our second and third proposed generative topic models incorporate term importance into latent topic variables by boosting the probability of important terms and consequently decreasing the probability of less important terms to better reflect the themes of documents. In essence, we assign weights to terms by employing corpus-level and document-level approaches. We incorporate term importance using a nonuniform base measure for an asymmetric prior over topic term distributions in the LDA framework. This leads to better estimates for important terms that occur less frequently in documents. Experimental {{studies have been conducted}} to show the effectiveness of our work across a variety of text mining applications. Furthermore, we employ our topic models to build a personalized content-based news recommender system. Our proposed recommender system eases reading and navigation through online newspapers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Defects {{in protein}} folding {{may lead to}} severe {{degenerative}} diseases characterized {{by the appearance of}} amyloid fibril deposits. Cytotoxicity in amyloidoses has been linked to poration of the cell membrane that may involve interactions with amyloid intermediates of annular shape. Although annular oligomers have been detected in many amyloidogenic systems, their universality, function and molecular mechanisms of appearance are debated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated with high-resolution in situ atomic force microscopy the assembly and disassembly of transthyretin (TTR) amyloid protofibrils formed of the native protein by pH shift. Annular oligomers were the first morphologically distinct intermediates observed in the TTR aggregation pathway. Morphological analysis suggests that they can assemble into a double-stack of octameric rings with a 16 ± 2 nm diameter, and displaying the tendency to form linear structures. According to light scattering data coupled to AFM imaging, annular oligomers appeared to undergo a <b>collapse</b> <b>type</b> of structural transition into spheroid oligomers containing 8 - 16 monomers. Disassembly of TTR amyloid protofibrils also resulted in the rapid appearance of annular oligomers but with a morphology quite distinct from that observed in the assembly pathway. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our observations indicate that annular oligomers are key dynamic intermediates not only in the assembly but also in the disassembly of TTR protofibrils. The balance between annular and more compact forms of aggregation could be relevant for cytotoxicity in amyloidogenic disorders...|$|R
40|$|We study {{analytically}} {{the process}} of a topological texture collapse in the approximation of a scaling ansatz in the nonlinear sigma-model. In this approximation we show that in flat space-time topological texture eventually collapses while {{in the case of}} spatially flat expanding universe its fate depends on the rate of expansion. If the universe is inflationary, then {{there is a possibility that}} texture will expand eternally; in the case of exponential inflation the texture may also shrink or expand eternally to a finite limiting size, although this behavior is degenerate. In the case of power law noninflationary expansion topological texture eventually collapses. In a cold matter dominated universe we find that texture which is formed comoving with the universe expansion starts collapsing when its spatial size becomes comparable to the Hubble size, which result is in agreement with the previous considerations. In the nonlinear sigma-model approximation we consider also the final stage of the collapsing ellipsoidal topological texture. We show that during collapse of such a texture at least two of its principal dimensions shrink to zero in a similar way, so that their ratio remains finite. The third dimension may remain finite (<b>collapse</b> of cigar <b>type),</b> or it may also shrink to zero similar to the other two dimensions (<b>collapse</b> of scaling <b>type),</b> or shrink to zero similar to the product of the remaining two dimensions (<b>collapse</b> of pancake <b>type)</b> ...|$|R
