40|$|<b>Cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> are {{multiphase}} materials {{composed of}} refractory metal carbides e. g. WC, TiC {{embedded in a}} metallic binder (Co, Ni, Fe). Due to their high hardness and superior wear resistance, <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> {{are used in the}} production of tools for cutting, machining and milling. Because <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> are brittle and expensive materials, it can be favourable to join them to steel substrates, e. g. in case of saw blades for wood machining applications, where <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> are used as saw tooth tip. Welding of dissimilar materials such as steel and <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> (hardmetals, cermets) is particularly challenging because mismatches in their thermal expansion coefficients and thermal conductivities result in build-up of residual stress as well as the formation of brittle intermetallic phases (e. g. M 6 C and M 12 C) at the cemented carbide/steel interface due to the diffusion of C from the <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> into the steel [1]. Laser beam welding (LBW) of <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> to steel appears as an attractive technique to conventional brazing processes due to its high precision, high process speed, low heat input and the option of welding without filler. So far exclusively joints between <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> with WC concentrations above 88 wt. -% WC and without mixed carbide additions were studied [2 - 4]...|$|R
50|$|In 1950s, <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> {{industry}} {{grew up in}} China. Since then, <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> {{drawing die}} has been gradually gaining popularity in China. Currently, WC-Co <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> is widely used in China, Japan, Sweden, Italy, etc. In some other counties, rare metal carbides (such as TiC, TaC, NBC, etc.) are added into <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> drawing dies and its manufacturing process is also certainly different.|$|E
50|$|In China, the Cobalt {{content in}} <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> drawing die is {{basically}} {{the same as that}} in the Soviet Union. The traditional grade for <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> drawing dies in China is almost YG8, rarely YG15 and YG6X. Later, in order to obtain better wearing resistance, the Cobalt content has to be decreased. While with the decreasing of the Cobalt content, the impact toughness and flexural strength of the <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> drawing die will dramatically decline. In recent years, the Cobalt content adopted in <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> drawing die area in China is the same as that in Sweden Sandvik which is the leader of <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> industry in the world. At the same time, researchers are trying to improve the performance of <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> by adding rare metal carbides. For example, researchers in Tianjin <b>Cemented</b> <b>Carbide</b> Research Institute add 1% TaC into <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> drawing dies to inhibit grain growth and refine grain size in the sintering process. In result, the service life of this kind of drawing dies is greatly longer than the general grade YG8. In Shanghai Material Factory, the Cobalt content is declined to 6% and a few TaC are added into <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> drawing dies in the sintering process so that the production volume is two times of that of general grade when stretching A3 steel, YIF steel, copper, etc.|$|E

This thesis is a computational study of interfaces in WC [...] Co, WC [...] Fe, and WC [...] Ni <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides.</b> Density functional theory is used to calculate interface energies and the local chemistry of interfaces is varied by altering the termination of WC planes and by substitution of W and C atoms for binder phase atoms.

Additionally, the wetting of WC surfaces is better in W-rich alloys compared to C-rich alloys regardless of binder, which is in agreement with experiments on wetting in WC [...] Co <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides.</b> In paper II the segregation to WC/WC grain boundaries and its effect on the interface strength is investigated.
