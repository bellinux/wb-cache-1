Following Dworkin's text Law's Empire very closely (while admitting that this particular philosophy of law may be open to challenge), Uchida assumes that the law retains [...] "integrity" [...] (seigosei) {{at the level of}} contract law principles. He then extends six duties emerging through the caselaw on Art 1(2) of the Civil Code, the [...] "principle of good faith" [...] (shingi seijitsu no gensoku): damages for breaking off contractual negotiations, duty to disclose information, duty to renegotiate, duty to mitigate, duty not to terminate contractual relations without good cause, and adjustment in awards of damages. These are seen as expressing an underlying [...] "principle of continuity" [...] in contractual relations that is incompatible with classical or modern contract law.|$|E

40|$|Company {{doctors have}} been criticized for poor {{standards}} of care and bias towards their employers' interests. This paper reports on interviews with 24 company doctors in the province of Ontario, Canada. It uses company doctors' accounts of their work and careers to highlight aspects of corporate medicine which may help to produce questionable standards of care and present obstacles to doctors' attempts to increase their legitimacy. Apparent variations in the quality of care in <b>contract</b> <b>practice</b> and full-time employment in a company are discussed and it is suggested that greater attention may need to be devoted to improving the standards of care in smaller companies. Patterns of recruitment, doctors' beliefs about the changing nature of occupational medicine, as well as contradictory definitions of the proper sphere of occupational medicine may also have an effect on standards of care and the degree of legitimacy accorded to company doctors. The responses of doctors to charges of bias are discussed and it is suggested that they may neglect the major reason for such charges [...] that they are employed by companies and are thereby constrained to favour their employers' interests. The paper proposes the need for further research on standards of occupational medical care, whether these vary with respect to context of practice and whether there are appreciable differences in standards of practice among doctors employed by companies, unions, universities and government. Modest proposals for future health policy are also indicated. ...|$|E

Implicit practices are measured directly with a question about the existence of an “implicit understanding, ” and indirectly with questions about the extent of informal involvement in farm-level decision making. Firms that manufacture processed foods, and that grow in house a portion of their total farm input, are significantly more likely to report use of explicit and implicit <b>contracting</b> <b>practices.</b> Additionally, unobserved factors that influence the use of explicit and implicit contracting are positively correlated.

40|$|Rapidly innovating {{industries}} are not behaving the way theory expects. Conventional industrial organization theory predicts that, when parties in {{a supply chain}} have to make transaction-specific investments, the risk of opportunism will drive them away from contracts and toward vertical integration. Despite the conventional theory, however, contemporary practice {{is moving in the}} other direction. Instead of vertical integration, we observe vertical disintegration in a significant number of industries, as producers recognize that they cannot themselves maintain cutting-edge technology in every field required for the success of their products. In doing this, the parties are developing forms of contracting beyond the reach of contract theory models. In this Article, we connect the emerging <b>contract</b> <b>practice</b> to theory, learning from {{what has happened in the}} real world to frame a theoretical explanation of this cross-organizational innovation and to reconceptualize the boundaries of the firm accordingly. We argue that the vertical disintegration of the supply chain in many industries is mediated neither by fully specified technical interfaces that allow suppliers to produce a modular piece of the ultimate product, nor by entirely implicit relational contracts supported only by norms of reciprocity and the expectation of future dealings. Rather, we suggest that the change in the boundary of the firm has given rise to a new form of contracting between firms [...] what we call "contracting for innovation. " This pattern braids explicit and implicit contracting to support iterative collaborative innovation by raising switching costs. These costs, represented by the parties' parallel transaction-specific investments in knowledge about their collaborators' capacities, deter opportunism under circumstances where explicit contracting, renegotiation, and the anticipation of future dealings cannot...|$|E
40|$|When {{the first}} {{securities}} trading centre was opened in Ho Chi Minh City in 2000, Vietnam {{was only a}} decade away from a command economy. Before 1990, a Soviet-styled command economy existed where the only entities in the economy were state-owned enterprises, cooperatives and household businesses. These entities were prohibited from privatising or going public. When the Vietnamese Government opened one securities trading centre in Ha Noi and another in Ho Chi Minh city in 2000, the Vietnamese securities market was still very premature. The first companies listed in the securities trading centers were state-owned companies chosen by the Government to privatise then to list {{in the stock market}} to provide stocks for the centres. Companies from the private sector were reluctant to seek capitals for their business plans via the securities market. After many decades living under a command economy and poor market institutions, there was a popular business culture in the private sector not to reveal business information to the public to avoid troubles caused by repressive government and unhealthy competition. The confidence of the public in the securities market in Vietnam was low at the beginning. An exchange traded securities market was allowed to develop in Vietnam following the introduction of Western-style securities regulation, which provided the necessary legal and regulatory framework for a functioning securities market. However, securities regulation in the form of company law type regulation explains only half of the regulatory regime in Vietnam. Financial markets in Vietnam continue to be governed by a complex and dynamic contractual system involving mandatory rules and relational contracting behaviour. Indeed, it is argued that contract law and <b>contract</b> <b>practice</b> has an important influence on Vietnam's financial markets, particularly in the development of Vietnam's securities markets. Relational contracting remains at the forefront in contractual dealings in Vietnam, especially in agricultural and primary markets. The game playing behaviour exhibited by primary merchants has spilled over into securities and financial markets, where sellers and dealers jockey for better outcomes. As will be discussed, relational contracting and game theory, which had its genesis in primary produce markets, has become important influences in the development of Vietnam's financial markets. These market practices along with the country's fledgling securities regulation provide the legal and regulatory framework where the rule of law underpins the rules of the game...|$|E
