2500|$|When Loria took control, {{he let it}} {{be known}} that Brochu's low-budget approach—or as he called it, [...] "business as usual"—was over. [...] He promised to rebuild the Expos with [...] "a winning {{attitude}} and winning players" [...] in an effort to bring the team back to where it had been only six years earlier. To that end, he drafted a new partnership agreement that gave him the right to call for cash investments in exchange for team equity—an option that had been unavailable to Brochu. Most of the minority partners, though, continued to treat their participation as a public-relations gesture and remained uninterested in investing additional money. When Loria issued a <b>cash</b> <b>call</b> in May 2000, the only other partners to increase their contributions were Coutu, Loblaw, and Stephen Bronfman. [...] Rather than contribute more money, the minority partners proposed trading Guererro. [...] Loria instantly vetoed this suggestion.|$|E

5000|$|The Los Alamitos Futurity (known as the Los Alamitos <b>Cash</b> <b>Call</b> Futurity due to sponsorship) is an American Thoroughbred {{horse race}} run {{annually}} since 1981, originally at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California {{where it was}} called the Hollywood Futurity and later the <b>Cash</b> <b>Call</b> Futurity.

50|$|In {{the middle}} of the European {{sovereign}} debt crisis, Portugal's largest listed bank Millennium bcp close last year with a core tier of 9,4%, beyond EU/IMF demands for 2011, but it was planning to raise more than that. CEO Nuno Amado told reporters after presenting first-quarter results the bank planned to “reinforce its capital beyond the minimum requirements” via a <b>cash</b> <b>call</b> and by resorting to a recapitalisation line for banks under Portugal's €78-bn EU/IMF bailout. He said the bank would rely more on the recapitalisation line than on <b>cash</b> <b>call,</b> but would not give more details. Analysts have said BCP needs around €3bn in new capital to meet the 9% target set by the European Banking Authority, but the raising rescue value, in line with neighbouring Spain bank Bankia, prompted fears of a deeper crisis in the Portuguese bank. On June 7, 2012, the bank was rescued by the Portuguese Government headed by Pedro Passos Coelho, through 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in state funds it toke from the country's IMF/EU bailout package.|$|E

5000|$|WIP’s best-known contest was <b>Cash</b> <b>Call,</b> a {{call-out}} game {{in which}} the DJs picked numbers out of the phone book or from postcards submitted by listeners. The intro to the contest was the first 10 seconds of a song called [...] "The Sound Of Money" [...] by the J's with Jamie, a vocal group that recorded lots of commercial jingles and three albums. If the person {{at the other end}} of the call could identify the exact amount of money in the “jackpot,” down to the standard 61-cent ending, they won the current jackpot. Players who knew the 61 cents but not the dollar amount typically won a token prize from a sponsor.

40|$|This paper studies how the {{allocation}} of residual losses affects trading and welfare in a central counterparty. I compare loss sharing under two loss-allocation mechanisms - variation margin haircutting and cash calls - and study the privately and socially optimal degree of loss sharing. For losses allocated using variation margin haircuts, I find that trading volume is sensitive {{to the degree of}} loss sharing and to the risk sensitivity of skinin-the-game capital. By contrast, for cash calls, the degree of loss sharing does not affect trading volume but instead affects the chance that a <b>cash</b> <b>call</b> is honoured, which can constrain the recovery of funds. A welfare analysis characterizes the market outcome and compares it with the social optimum...|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} faced by project managers is balancing {{the variables of}} scope, cost, and schedule. Changes in scope usually result in cost/schedule overruns. Variance in either or both of them creates disorder (typically increases) in the estimated or projected time and cost. Therefore, controlling cost and schedule {{are two of the}} most critical aspects of a construction project. This research uses two already existing management theories, specifically Management by Means (MBM) and Management by Results (MBR), and analyzes a case where these two theories are combined with the goal of improving construction practices. This research compares an eight month schedule in a construction project and relates Percentage of Planned activities Completed (PPC) with projected and actual draw (<b>cash)</b> <b>calls.</b> The research analyzes the question of how lean construction PPC captures variance in cost. The research method is based on a literature review, data collection, case study and data interpretation to answer the hypothesis that improvement in PPC over a particular month has a positive correlation with difference between <b>cash</b> <b>calls.</b> Because this research is limited to a time frame of 8 months in a single project, it is not statistically significant. However, this research serves to create a model template or pilot study for a larger study...|$|R
