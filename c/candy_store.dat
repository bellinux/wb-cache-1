500|$|Adam LaClave and Paul Meany {{were the}} primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message. For example, the song [...] "Said the Sun" [...] is an allegory about God telling Christians to be {{carriers}} of light. [...] "Whitehorse" [...] was written to present {{a different view of}} the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, [...] "Most people, when they hear the term [...] "white horse," [...] think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [...]" [...] The men's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write [...] "Gummy Buffalo"; he found himself in a <b>candy</b> <b>store</b> and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in [...] "Foreign" [...] may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records. The lyrics read [...] "There's no place in your world for me / I've been from sea to shining sea / And I can't retain your policies, excuse me / If I'm just hanging around, I'm foreign." ...|$|E
500|$|The entire {{series was}} shot on sound stages. Production {{designers}} Greg Loewen and Graemay Murray designed the medical facility as a [...] "circular hub with offices and rooms radiating outward", and included a second floor in which DeMilla could oversee the entire hospital's operations. Director Joe Napolitano praised the sets while filming the episode [...] "Last Resort", calling the show [...] "a good <b>candy</b> <b>store</b> for a director" [...] {{due to the}} functionality {{and size of the}} hospital. He explained that the set enabled him to direct long takes and walk and talk sequences without much difficulty. The series required extensive prosthetic work for Dr. Batung and the non-human patients. The application of Lund's prosthetic makeup required several hours each day that he was filmed. Napolitano said that he found this to be a challenge to the production schedule, explaining that there would be discussions about the amount of prosthetics necessary for Batung depending on the scene. Batung's prosthetic work included a tail that wrapped around his neck and shoulders; Lund was pushed around the set on a sled to mimic the character's movements as a slug. Napolitano also specified that the patients required a similar amount of time and work for their prosthetic makeup, such as a man who has gills under his chin.|$|E

500|$|Large {{quantities}} of two-cent pieces were withdrawn in the 1870s and after. Approximately 17,000,000 of the some 45,600,000 two-cent pieces issued had been repurchased by the Treasury as of 1909. Withdrawn pieces were melted and recoined into one-cent pieces. [...] A bill for a two-cent piece bearing {{the portrait of}} recently deceased former president Theodore Roosevelt passed the Senate in 1920 and was strongly recommended by a House committee but never enacted. Numismatist S.W. Freeman noted in 1954 that few alive could remember using a two-cent piece, {{but for those who}} did, it was often associated with spending it at a <b>candy</b> <b>store.</b> [...] He recalled that two cents would buy a quantity of sweets, as a dime did in Freeman's day, and, he feared, it would take a quarter to do in the future. Full legal tender status was granted the two-cent piece by the Coinage Act of 1965, long after the coin had passed from circulation, as it made all coins and currency of the United States good for all public and private debts without limit. Nevertheless, numismatist Jack White pointed out in a 1971 column that due to its short lifespan, the piece [...] "hardly got its two cents in".|$|E
