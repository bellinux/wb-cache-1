50|$|In {{order for}} cells to intercalate between one another the adherens {{junctions}} that maintain {{the integrity of}} the epithelial tissue must be dynamically remodeled. Time-lapse microscopy has captured this process of cell neighbor exchange, which is schematically represented to the right. In the type 1 configuration, two cells contact each other along the anterior-posterior axis, whereas two dorsal-ventral cells do not directly contact. Next, the <b>cell</b> <b>boundary</b> between the two anterior-posterior neighbors selectively shrinks, resulting in an obligatory intermediate type 2 junction, where the four cells share a vertex. Upon resolution of the type 2 junction, a new type 3 junctions forms perpendicular to the original type 1 configuration. During this process the two dorsal-ventral cells have become neighbors. When multiple clusters of cells intercalate in the dorsal-ventral axis, through junctional neighbor exchange, the outcome is an extension of germ-band in the anterior-posterior axis.|$|E

Finally, continuous application of stress on the old focal adhesion sites could result in the calcium-induced calpain activation, and consequently the detachment of focal adhesions which completes the cycle.|$|E

We evaluate performances of using relays under these policies by varying parameter values such as the relay station’s position and frequency reuse factor. Through Monte Carlo simulations and mathematical analysis, we also suggest some optimal values of parameters and policies. I...|$|E

Polymerization near leading edges of the cell intercolates MSP dimers onto the tips of growing filament com-plexes, forcing them against the <b>cell</b> <b>boundary,</b> and extending the cytoskeleton in the direction of motion. Strong adhesive forces attach the cell to the substrate in the forward part of the lamellipod, while depolymerization in the rearward part of the cell breaks down the cytoskeleton, contracting the lamellipod and pulling the cell body forward. The movement of these cells, then, is caused by coordinated protrusive, adhesive and contractile forces, spatially separated across the lamelli-pod. This paper considers a phenomenological model that tracks discrete elements of the cytoskeleton in curvilinear coordinates. The pseudo-two dimensional model primarily considers protrusion and rotation of the cell, along with the evolution of the <b>cell</b> <b>boundary.</b> General assumptions are that pH levels within the lamellipod regulate protrusion, contraction and adhesion, and that growth of the cytoskeleton, over time, is perpendicular to the evolving <b>cell</b> <b>boundary.</b> The model follows the growth and contraction of a discrete number of MSP fiber complexes, since they appear to be the principle contributors for force generation in <b>cell</b> <b>boundary</b> pro-trusion and contraction, and the backbone for the dynamic geometry and motion...|$|E

We {{propose a}} method that {{automatically}} tracks and segments living cells in phase-contrast image sequences, especially for cells that deform and {{interact with each other}} or clutter. We formulate the problem as a many-to-one elastic partial matching problem between closed curves. We introduce Double Cyclic Dynamic Time Warping for the scenario where a collision event yields a single boundary that encloses multiple touching cells and that needs to be cut into separate <b>cell</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The resulting individual boundaries may consist of segments to be connected to produce closed curves that match well with the individual <b>cell</b> <b>boundaries</b> before the collision event. We show how to convert this partial-curve matching problem into a shortest path problem that we then solve efficiently by reusing the computed shortest path tree. We also use our shortest path algorithm to fill the gaps between the segments of the target curves. Quantitative results demonstrate the benefit of our method by showing maintained accurate recognition of individual <b>cell</b> <b>boundaries</b> across 8068 images containing multiple cell interactions. ...|$|R

The model resorts to cell-centred techniques, where particles represent cell nuclei, and to vertex models, where the vertices represent <b>cell</b> <b>boundaries.</b> This hybrid approach allows to consider separately intracellular and inter-cellular forces, {{and at the same time}} impose cell incompressibility. In the proposed model, the <b>cell</b> <b>boundaries</b> (defined by vertices) and cell nuclei (or cellcentres) networks are coupled through an interpolation scheme, which is eventually relaxed in order to smooth the <b>cell</b> <b>boundaries.</b> We show that this coupling between the two networks modifies the equilibrium equations and stabilises the vertex network. Incompressibility is implemented through a penalty method. The resulting model can be implemented in two- and three-dimensions, and is complemented with active rheological models.
