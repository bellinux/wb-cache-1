5000|$|Another {{argument}} against the [...] "ethnographic method" [...] {{is that it is}} impossible to prove that there are absolutely no ecological or genetic factors in any behavior. Though culture has long been thought to arise and remain independent of genetics, the constraints on the propagation and innovation of <b>cultural</b> <b>techniques</b> inevitably caused by the genome of each respective animal species has led to the theory of gene-culture coevolution, which asserts that [...] "cognitive, affective, and moral capacities" [...] are the product of an evolutionary dynamic involving interactions between genes and culture over extended periods of time. The concept behind gene-culture coevolution is that, though culture plays a huge role in the progression of animal behavior over time, the genes of a particular species have the ability to affect the details of the corresponding culture and its ability to evolve within that species.|$|E
