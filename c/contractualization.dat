Aside from this indirect effect between cultural traits and economic institutions, the secondary elements of economic institutions are also directly influenced by cultural traits; {{the extent to which}} the goal setting of a society is linked to the per capita product, income or its happiness, depends on its culture.

By studying the practice of Dutch civic integration, we demonstrate the repressive and productive aspects through which migrants and course providers become objects and subjects of the state’s neoliberal citizenship ideology. Our ethnographic data enables us to understand how civic integration is experienced and interpreted by state agents and migrants. Cost optimization and quantitative policy targets have dominated; the quality of Dutch language teaching suffered, leaving the migrants without the power to vocalize and realize their own interests.

40|$|International audienceThe {{types of}} {{contract}} studied here correspond to a formalization of commitments between actors with interdependent activities, {{in a context}} of uncertainty and incomplete information. Based on research on economic mechanisms set up to control coordination between actors in industrial design, we highlight conflict between coordination grounded in a "strictly" contractual approach, on the one hand, and "flexible" types of commitment which take advantage of an increase in information but may have high coordination costs, on the other. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the existence of a dual viewpoint in internal <b>contractualization</b> approaches. Based on this idea, we examine first the impact, on the robustness of contracts, of the allocation of residual rights on interface knowledge and, second, the advantages of a dynamic contract requiring explicit commitment (according to usual transactional criteria) and flexibility (in order to favour mutual access rights to additional competencies) ...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{quantitative}} and qualitative data, this paper attempts to identify the main reasons why cargo dwell time in Durban port has dramatically reduced {{in the past decade}} to a current average of 3 - 4 days. A major customs reform; changes in port storage tariffs coupled with strict enforcement; massive investments in infrastructure and equipment; and changing customer behavior through <b>contractualization</b> between the port operator and shipping lines or between customs, importers, and brokers have all played a major role. The main lesson for Sub-Saharan Africa that can be drawn from Durban is that cargo dwell time is mainly a function of the characteristics of the private sector, but it is the onus of public sector players, such as customs and the port authority, to put pressure on the private sector to make more efficient use of the port and reduce cargo dwell time.

40|$|In this contribution, an {{endogenous}} {{conception of}} law is defended which can be deployed in regard of different scales of time and domains of the law. In this article, the focus is mainly on labor law. In the first part, {{a history of the}} French employment contract law is presented by proposing a grid of its foundations and evolution from the distinction of different principles of justice generating conventions. The change of conventions and its impact on law is precisely treated. In a second part, the recent evolution of this law will be exposed by showing the key role played by legal intermediaries in the <b>contractualization</b> of the working relationship, based on a database of employment contracts. It is shown how lawyers can generate an increasing strategic use of law, disconnected from territorialized conventions, if they do not play their role of mediator between different logics. In the conclusion, the emergence of a transnational law and the transformation of the lawyer profession are questioned. " (author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|The article {{takes into}} account some {{dominant}} theories about the controver­sial concept of post- memory. Post- memory, in fact, as {{the possibility of an}} intergenerational transmission of memory, particularly traumatic, espe­cially for people belonging to the familiar sphere that didn’t live the expe­rience in question but maintain an emotional tie with the direct witnesses, provides the ability to critically review the fixation of memory processes in their tense relationship with the possibility of a <b>contractualization</b> of his­tory. The case associated with such a conceptualization is the Colonial War that Portugal fought in Africa for over a decade (1961 - 1974) and heavily conditioned both the ontology of the country after the Carnation Revolu­tion and the consciousness of the former combatants who lived traumatic experiences projecting the impossibility of their symbolization on family relationships.

On the one hand, STEG has hired numerous new employees; on the other hand, it is under financial pressure due to non-payment and agressions.

40|$|Why do some {{countries}} adopt exogenous rules into their domestic law when those laws do not align with the country’s specific interests? This article {{draws on the}} policy diffusion literature to identify four causal mechanisms that are hypothesized to give rise to those transplants {{in the case of}} asymmetric interests. While the literature presents these mechanisms independently, this article argues that each works in combination with the others to facilitate legal transplantation. The empirical demonstration is based on a quantitative analysis of legal transplants in the field of intellectual property (IP), and incorporates an original index of IP protection in 121 developing countries over 14 years. Our results suggest that, while one mechanism – coercion – is instrumental in initiating the transplantation process, it fades over time and is largely supplanted by three others: <b>contractualization,</b> socialization and regulatory competition acting in a mutually supportive manner. This article concludes with a plea for theoretical eclecticism, acknowledging multi-causality and context-conditionality. Any comprehensive explanation of legal transplantation must include the identification of mutual reinforcement between causal mechanisms, rather than simply ranking their relative contributions. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Focusing on {{environmental}} policies, the article {{deals with the}} relationship between governance and the public. Governance fosters horizontal relations and participation to the policy making. Thus it should strengthen and expand the public sphere. However this happens {{in such a way}} that it contradicts the very notion of publicity. This paradox reproduces in a new form a core antinomy of political modernity. To elaborate on this issue a notion of public is presented first, as a third party implied in social transactions. The last generation of policy instruments, based on voluntary and self-regulation, is then discussed. Their alleged advantages in terms of efficiency and publicity are brought into question by a major problem: the public is privatized within contracts, which represent the currently dominant type of relationship at policy and social level. <b>Contractualization</b> is at odds with publicity. The public space expands only to the extent that two conditions are fulfilled: there is neither a commitment to reciprocation nor relationships are based on closed ties, specified once and for all...|$|E

The present study employs descriptive research design to explain the extent of application of employability skills and contextual performance.   Based on The Conference Board of Canada’s Employability Skills 2000 + and Borman and Motowidlo’s Taxonomy of Contextual Performance, two sets of survey questionnaires were adopted to gather data from 220 respondents representing employers and employees from 25 government institutions. Data analysis showed that novice employees in public institutions applied their employability skills such as fundamental, personal management and teamwork skills to some extent. Moreover, results revealed that employees had satisfactory contextual performance.   Thus, this may suggest that the application of employability skills and contextual behaviors should be enhanced to meet the increasing and complex challenges of their respective government agencies. </p...|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{show that}} the tools being used to recalibrate the {{international}} investment regime, in particular proportionality and corporate social responsibility, constitute continuity rather than rupture with neoliberalism and neoliberal legality. Neoliberalism has been discredited, and few actors suggest a return to self-regulation after the 2008 global economic crisis. This call for regulation, however, finds international economic law scholarship divided between those who claim that standards of review and corporate social responsibility can solve the crisis of neoliberalism, and those who believe that the problem is more profound. In the case of the international investment regime, this article suggests that the current strategy to balance this regime consists only of adjustments to states 2 ̆ 7 regulatory authority, leaving intact the legal techniques that foreign investors use to control local resources. The <b>contractualization</b> of foreign investment relations remains today as important as it was before the 2008 global economic crisis. In this way, this article concludes, the current balancing strategy marginally changes the means and does not change the purpose provided by neoliberalism...|$|E

The longitudinal and in-depth analysis of a project that has experienced rapid success shows how these communities are structured, with the progressive emergence of processes like work division, differentiation of positions, selection of contributions, recruitment of animators, transfer of responsibilities. However, this work organization presents original characteristics, due to the absence of <b>contractualization</b> in terms of relations, financial retribution, subordination rules and eviction procedures.

The topic of urban and local security, although emerging later than in the UK and France (Braccesi 2005 : 25; Selmini 2005 a: 15 – 16), was developed in Italy by institutional reforms in the late 1990 s (Amendola 2003; Mazzette 2003 a; Selmini 2004, 2005 b; Braccesi and Selmini 2005; Pavarini 2006 a). However, since 2005, the relations of cooperation and collaboration between state institutions, regional and local authorities in the field of security have been institutionalized through the signing of new agreements (Calaresu 2012, 2013), designed to overcome the weaknesses of the previous inter-institutional cooperation model as tested during the so-called “first contractual season” (1998 – 2005)d. On March 20 th, 2007 e, a framework agreement on the security of urban areas was signed between the then Minister of Home Affairs Giuliano Amato, ANCI President Leonardo Domenici, and the mayors of the metropolitan cities (Governo Italiano - Ministero dell’Interno 2007)f.

The paper observes that the basic premise of the public enterprise reorganization program in India is the State minimalism in tune with the market economists. As a result, the reorganization strategies adopted were lopsided focussing heavily on the closures, assets sale, and privatization and in the HRM front on labor shedding, casualization and <b>contractualization.</b> Since the State had lost grip on the economic decisions due to the loan conditions, it has ignored the stakeholders concerns and implemented the program as a conspiracy.
