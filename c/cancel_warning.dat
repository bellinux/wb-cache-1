50|$|The inquiry {{made several}} recommendations.

The more extensive use of Automatic Train Control (ATC), then under extended trial on the Great Western Railway, was discussed. This would sound a siren in the cab to alert the crew of a train if they passed a signal at danger or caution and then automatically apply the brakes if they failed to acknowledge and <b>cancel</b> the <b>warning.</b> Signalboxes should be fitted with detonator placers, to alert engine crews who missed signals or were unable to observe them in fog or thick weather.

5000|$|The signals at Norton Fitzwarren {{railway station}} were fitted with the GWR Automatic Train Control (ATC) which alerted the driver, in the cab, audibly that the {{approaching}} distant signal is at [...] "caution".

This would especially happen if the driver is reading the wrong green signal. Although the ATC equipment was working correctly, wartime deferred maintenance had meant that {{in a number of}} cases the ATC ramps were not working correctly and were giving false [...] "caution" [...] alerts when the signals were clear, supposedly a correct failure mode but one which led to crews believing that a warning when they saw clear signals was just another maintenance issue.|$|R

40|$|The growing {{interest}} for integrating agile methodologies and usability has brought various challenges to practitioners.

For this aim, a framework has been developed, conformed first by a well-defined modeling language that aims to formalize previous empirical research in the field, models of the impact of usability mechanisms into user stories, and a tool to help practitioners applying them to user stories. Results show that the use of this framework helps agile developers to think about usability {{from the beginning of the}} development process, without needing to be an expert in the subject. Our proposal can therefore complement other usability practices to improve the quality of use of software developed using agile methodologies...|$|R

Water continued to cover roads in and around Salcha, and water-borne debris accumulated under several local bridges, causing impromptu dams. By August 1, the Salcha River had begun to recede to a noticeable extent. Though some roads remained underwater and falling trees knocked out power to areas of the town, residents began to pump out basements and begin recovery efforts.

50|$|In {{the final}} version of the GWR system, the {{locomotives}} were fitted with a solenoid-operated valve into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the rails. This ramp consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives' contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a sprung contact shoe beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery current holding closed the brake valve was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the brake valve in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. When the signal was at 'danger', the ramp battery was disconnected and so could not replace the locomotive's battery current: the brake valve solenoid would then be released and a horn sounded in the cab. The driver was then expected to <b>cancel</b> the <b>warning</b> and apply the brakes under his own control.|$|R

500|$|In the {{subsequent}} investigation, metal fatigue was ultimately {{blamed for the}} failure of the number five compressor wheel in the number two Rolls-Royce 508 Conway turbofan engine, starting the rapid chain of failures.

40|$|The area of {{products}} liability has been rapidly expanding in recent years. Included in this expansion {{has been an}} increasing tendency to hold manufacturers liable to those injured by using their products. This trend toward strict liability is thought to cause the manufacturers to exercise greater care in their manufacturing processes and to shift the loss due to injury from the injured party to those engaging in the business which has caused the injury. This burden may then be shifted, {{by means of a}} commensurate increase in the price of the product, to the consumers of the product as a whole. While the decision in Love V. Wolf reaches the same result, liability in a case such as this need not be predicated upon the inadequacy of warning or negligence in promotion. Liability in such a situation should be based upon strict liability of the manufacturer or upon breach of warranty, thereby eliminating the burden upon the plaintiff of proving negligence and placing an affirmative duty on the manufacturer to assure that latent defects in their products will not harm consumers. A decision on one of these bases would be more consistent with the current trends in the law {{of products}} liability. The most important aspect of the decision in Love is the holding that a subsequent advertising and promotional campaign may <b>cancel</b> a <b>warning</b> that has been given of dangers inherent in a product.

Student behaviors most frequently reported as uncivil by faculty included making disapproving groans, making sarcastic remarks or gestures, not paying attention in class, dominating class discussions, using cell phones during class, and cheating on examinations. The majority of faculty reported that uncivil student behaviors occurred rarely or sometimes. Examples of faculty behaviors considered uncivil by students included <b>canceling</b> class without <b>warning,</b> being unprepared for class, not allowing open discussion, being disinterested or cold, belittling or taunting students, delivering fast-paced lectures, and not being available outside of class.

50|$|Whilst critics claim TPWS is a cheap {{solution}} and putting lives at risk compared to fitting ATP, {{there have been}} very few fatalities in modern times (since the fitting of AWS) {{that would have been}} prevented had ATP been fitted but would still have occurred despite TPWS. The Southall rail crash would not have been prevented by TPWS yet could have been prevented by ATP (ironically fitted but not in use), yet would almost certainly have been prevented had the AWS been working. A combination of TPWS and AWS is least effective in accidents like that at Purley, where a driver repeatedly <b>cancelled</b> the AWS <b>warning</b> without applying the brakes, passing the danger signal at high speed. In this particular case though, the lower speed of the train and the very effective brakes of the EMU would have meant TPWS would likely have been effective anyway. Supporters of TPWS claim that even where it could not prevent accidents due to SPADs, it would likely reduce the impact and reduce or eliminate fatalities by at least slowing the train down but, in practice, it is likely that in these cases the driver would have already applied the emergency brakes well before the overspeed sensor.|$|R
