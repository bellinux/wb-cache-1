5|$|In 1924, Einstein {{received}} {{a description of}} a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms {{as well as to the}} proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein <b>condensate</b> phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such <b>condensate</b> was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.|$|E

Two e ectively one- and two-dimensional equations based on q-Gaussian functions are derived for the dynamics of cigar- and pancake-shaped <b>condensates.</b> The main result of our symbolic computations is that the variational recipe yields substantially di erent results for cigar- and pancakeshaped <b>condensates,</b> the variational equations for cigar-shaped <b>condensates</b> being considerable simpler than those for pancake-shaped <b>condensates...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} of light with two Bose <b>condensates</b> as an open quantum system. The two overlapping <b>condensates</b> occupy two different Zeeman sublevels and two driving light beams induce a coherent quantum tunneling between the <b>condensates.</b> We derive the master equation for the system. It is shown that stochastic simulations of the measurements of spontaneously scattered photons establish the relative phase between two Bose <b>condensates,</b> even though the <b>condensates</b> are initially in pure number states. These measurements are non-destructive for the <b>condensates,</b> because only light is scattered, but no atoms are removed from the system. Due to the macroscopic quantum interference the detection rate of photons depends substantially on the relative phase between the <b>condensates.</b> This may provide a way to distinguish, whether the <b>condensates</b> are initially in number states or in coherent states.

5|$|When cooled below a point {{called the}} {{critical}} temperature, materials can undergo a phase transition {{in which they}} lose all resistivity to electric current, in {{a process known as}} superconductivity. In BCS theory, this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a Bose–Einstein <b>condensate.</b> These Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance. (Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100nm, so they can overlap each other.) However, the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain.|$|E

25|$|Zone {{distillation}} is a {{distillation process}} in long container with partial melting of refined matter in moving liquid zone and condensation of vapor in the solid phase at <b>condensate</b> pulling in cold area.

40|$|We {{show that}} it is {{possible}} to generate entanglement between two distant Bose-Einstein <b>condensates</b> by detection of Hanbury Brown-Twiss type correlations in photons Bragg-scattered by the <b>condensates.</b> Upon coincident detection of two photons by two detectors, the projected joint state of two <b>condensates</b> is shown to be non-Gaussian. We verify the existence of entanglement by showing that the partially transposed state is negative. Further we use the inequality in terms of higher order moments to confirm entanglement. Our proposed scheme can be generalized for multiple <b>condensates</b> and also for spinor <b>condensates</b> with Bragg scattering of polarized light with the latter capable of producing hyper entanglement.

40|$|Two {{spatially}} separate Bose-Einstein <b>condensates</b> {{were prepared}} in an optical double-well potential. A bidirectional coupling {{between the two}} <b>condensates</b> was established by two pairs of Bragg beams which continuously outcoupled atoms in opposite directions. The atomic currents induced by the optical coupling depend on the relative phase of the two <b>condensates</b> and on an additional controllable coupling phase. This was observed through symmetric and antisymmetric correlations between the two outcoupled atom fluxes. A Josephson optical coupling of two <b>condensates</b> in a ring geometry is proposed. The continuous outcoupling method was used to monitor slow relative motions of two elongated <b>condensates</b> and characterize the trapping potential. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 0 The {{stability}} of peptide DNA <b>condensates</b> was examined after introducing glutaraldehyde to cross-link surface amine groups. A 20 amino acid peptide (CWK 18) {{was used to}} condense DNA into small (70 nm) <b>condensates.</b> The reaction between glutaraldehyde and peptide DNA <b>condensates</b> was indirectly monitored using a fluorescence-based assay to establish reaction completion in 4 − 5 h when using glutaraldehyde-to-peptide ratios of 1 to 4 mol equiv. Higher levels of glutaraldehyde cross-linking led to significant increases in particle size. The improved stability imparted by glutaraldehyde cross-linking was demonstrated by the increased resistance of DNA <b>condensates</b> to shear stress induced fragmentation. The cross-linked <b>condensates</b> were also significantly more resistant to in vitro metabolism by serum endonucleases. A decrease in the magnitude of transient gene expression was determined for cross-linked DNA <b>condensates</b> which also resulted in a 10 -day steady-state expression when cross-linking with 4 mol equiv of glutaraldehyde. The results suggest that cross-linking DNA <b>condensates</b> may provide a means to alter {{the time course of}} transient gene expression by inhibiting DNA metabolism...|$|R
