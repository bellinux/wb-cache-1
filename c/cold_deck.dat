During a Continuous Commissioning (CC) process, the optimal <b>cold</b> and hot <b>deck</b> reset schedules were implemented in 12 dual duct variable air volume systems which serve a 324, 000 ft 2 university building. The improved <b>cold</b> and hot <b>deck</b> reset schedules combined with other CC measures reduced the chilled water energy consumption by 7, 571 MMBtu/yr (18 %) and 303 MWh/yr (18 %) for the fan power.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 In {{order to}} {{appraise}} timber, {{it is necessary}} to estimate logging costs with reasonable accuracy. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a rethod for estimating log loading costs in the Intermountain Region. Nine different log loaders were studied loading from <b>cold</b> <b>decks</b> on six USDA. Forest Service timber sales in the Intermountain Region. Regression analysis indicated that loading time per truck was a linear function of pieces per truck. It also indicated a significant difference in loading times between hydraulic loaders and cable loaders. Regression analysis of sample truck scale data for each sale indicated that both the number of pieces loaded per truck and the volume per truck were functions of average piece size. The results also suggested that timber species affected volume per truck. The time study regression equation and the sample truck scale regression equations were combined to obtain production equations for both cable and hydraulic loaders as a function of average piece size. Then estimated owning and operating costs for a typical hydraulic loader were combined with the production equation to obtain a relationship for loading costs per unit volume a a function of average piece size and hours of annual use. These costs were compared with costs obtained using the USDP Forest Service andbook (Forest Service, 1977). Results of this comparison indicated that the USDA Forest Service appraised loading costs did not vary nearly as much with average piece size as did the cost estimated in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} the structural behaviour of composite slabs. These composite slabs are made of steel and different kinds of concrete. The methodology used in this paper combines experimental studies with advanced techniques of numerical simulations. In this paper, four types of concrete were used in order to study their different structural strengths in composite slabs. The materials used were three lightweight concretes, a normal concrete, and a <b>cold</b> conformed steel <b>deck</b> which has embossments to increase the adherence between concrete and steel. Furthermore, two lengths of slabs were studied to compare structural behaviours between short and long slabs. m-k experimental tests were carried out to obtain the flexural behaviour of the composite slabs. These tests provide dimensionless coefficients to compare different sizes of slabs. Nonlinear numerical simulations were performed by means of the finite element method (FEM). Four different multilinear isotropic hardening laws were used to simulate the four concretes. Coulomb friction contact was used to model the coefficient of friction between steel and concrete. Finally, a chemical bond was included to consider sliding resistance in the contact surface between steel and concrete. Experimental and numerical results are in good agreement; therefore, numerical models can be used to improve and optimize lightweight composite slabs...|$|R

A gloomier interval I never passed. Johnson and Nares steadily relieved each other at the wheel and came below. The first glance of each was at the glass, which he repeatedly knuckled and frowned upon; for it was sagging lower all the time. Then, if Johnson were the visitor, he would pick a snack out of the cupboard, and stand, braced against the table, eating it, and perhaps obliging me with a word or two of his hee-haw conversation: how it was [...] "a son of a gun of a <b>cold</b> night on <b>deck,</b> Mr. Dodd" [...] (with a grin); how [...] "it wasn't no night for pan-jammers, he could tell me"; having transacted all which, he would throw himself down in his bunk and sleep his two hours with compunction.

[...] "Well, my son, we're one hundred and four miles" [...] (or whatever it was) [...] "off the island, and scudding for all we're worth.

And now, Mr. Dodd, I've stretched a point for you; you can see I'm dead tired; so just you stretch away back to your bunk again." [...] And with this attempt at geniality, his teeth would settle hard down on his cigar, and he would pass his spell below staring and blinking at the cabin lamp through a cloud of tobacco-smoke. He has told me since that he was happy, which I should never have divined.

5000|$|In statistics, {{imputation}} is {{the process}} of replacing missing data with substituted values. When substituting for a data point, it is known as [...] "unit imputation"; when substituting for a component of a data point, it is known as [...] "item imputation". There are three main problems that missing data causes: missing data can introduce a substantial amount of bias, make the handling and analysis of the data more arduous, and create reductions in efficiency. Because missing data can create problems for analyzing data, imputation is seen as a way to avoid pitfalls involved with listwise deletion of cases that have missing values. That is to say, when one or more values are missing for a case, most statistical packages default to discarding any case that has a missing value, which may introduce bias or affect the representativeness of the results. Imputation preserves all cases by replacing missing data with an estimated value based on other available information. Once all missing values have been imputed, the data set can then be analysed using standard techniques for complete data. Imputation theory is constantly developing and thus requires consistent attention to new information regarding the subject. There have been many theories embraced by scientists to account for missing data but the majority of them introduce large amounts of bias. A few of the well known attempts to deal with missing data include: hot deck and <b>cold</b> <b>deck</b> imputation; listwise and pairwise deletion; mean imputation; regression imputation; last observation carried forward; stochastic imputation; and multiple imputation.|$|E
