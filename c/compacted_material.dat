The mixture temperature during mixing, resulting from aggregates and foam temperatures, seems being the most influent mixing parameter.

40|$|An {{experimental}} programme {{is presented}} {{with the aim of}} characterising –from physical, microstructural and geotechnical perspectives– the main properties of compacted clay phyllites. These clay phyllites are widely used as waterproofing material for roofs in the Alpujarras (Andalusia, Spain), as sealing liners in irrigation ponds, and as core material of small earthen zoned dams. An exhaustive physical-characterisation programme on the powder fraction has been followed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chemical analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), thermal analysis, particle-size distribution analysis, consistency limits, and density of solid particles. From a microstructural standpoint, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests, as well as nitrogen-adsorption tests, were carried out to characterise the pore network and surface area of the material in both natural and compacted states. The geotechnical characterisation programme on the <b>compacted</b> <b>material</b> was focused on the water-permeability and water-retention properties, the volume change on soaking (swelling or collapse), the compressibility on loading, the shearstrength properties, and the mechanical-penetration properties. In this way, an important physical and hydro-mechanical data base is provided, which could help in evaluating the suitability for using this material {{in a wide range of}} earthen constructions (liners, road subgrades, embankments, core material in zoned dams). It has been found that the material contains illite, chlorite and quartz as the main components, and feldspar, iron oxide and interstratified illite–smectite as minor ones. Despite the presence of active clay minerals, the <b>compacted</b> <b>material</b> did not display an important swelling on soaking at low stresses, as a consequence of its low specific surface and low water-retention ability. The material exhibited good compaction properties and, consequently, low water permeability plus a stiff response on loading.

40|$|Polycarbonate has the {{reputation}} of having a tough breaking behavior, but it is widely unknown that this applies only to special conditions. The impact strength of polycarbonate depends on the temperature, thickness (with a tough brittle transition as thickness increases), contribution of notch tip radius, impact speed, physical blowing agent, molecular weight of the polymer, and processing parameters. Research results indicate that microcellular foams produced by injection molding with physical blowing agent (MuCell TM Technology by Trexel) show a significantly higher notched impact strength than compact polycarbonate if the <b>compact</b> <b>material</b> is brittle under the same testing parameters. However, if the compact polycarbonate breaks toughly, the notched impact strength of the foamed material is always lower. Therefore, it is highly important {{to pay attention to}} the testing parameters and conditions when comparing the toughness of the foam with that of the <b>compact</b> <b>material.</b> The toughness of microcellular foams has similar properties like PC/ABS and PC/PP blend systems, which provides the possibility to combine the higher impact strength with the advantages of microcellular foaming such as weight reduction, lower shrinkage, shorter cycle times, lower clamp forces, and reduced melt viscosity. In order to use technologies and conditions, which are applied in the polymer industry as well, all materials were produced by an injection molding process. Special processing technologies such as gas counter pressure and precision mold opening were used in order to reach microcellular foam structures with cell diameters around 10 μm. These technologies yield exactly adjustable foam morphologies. Special morphologies are required to improve the notched impact strength of the foamed material. Two different equivalent models were extracted from the analyses, which indicate a significantly higher notched impact strength than the <b>compact</b> <b>material</b> under the same testing conditions.
