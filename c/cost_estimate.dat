5|$|According to his biographer Roland Huntford, the {{references}} to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's The Voyage of the Discovery, published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott. He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> of £17,000 (updated value £) for the entire expedition. He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a £7,000 loan guarantee (updated value £). With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) on 12 February 1907. One reason for Shackleton's sense of urgency was {{the knowledge that the}} Polish explorer Henryk Arctowski was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS on the same day as Shackleton's. In the event, Arctowski's plans were stillborn.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the internal costing practices employed by commercial and engineering disciplines of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> for generating estimates at the conceptual design stage of complex hardware products. It examines {{whether there is a}} formal structure in the interaction between the two groups that can be represented within a model. The aim is to develop a framework that will formalise and improve the communication of commercial and engineering disciplines in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating.</b> A literature review examines the role of different costing techniques and the information requirements for generating <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> The review identifies that {{there is a lack of}} research in the information requirements for <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> of specific manufacturing industries, and that the interaction of commercial and engineering disciplines of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> at conceptual design stage is hindered by the different focuses of these groups. By conducting a survey study the author identifies the internal practice in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> for the automotive industry. The survey establishes that in order to improve the internal practice it is essential to establish a data infrastructure that formalises and enables the reuse of the <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> and improves the interaction between the two groups. The author identifies a common <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process for the automotive industry. This study establishes the required data and information elements and information sources that need to be collected in order to have reliable data infrastructure. Using a case study approach, the author also establishes that it is essential to analyse the product functions in such a way that will enable the development of a detailed <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> model at the conceptual design stage, which will improve interaction between the commercial and engineering groups. The function-based <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process becomes the focus of detailed studies using experts from the automotive industry. This results in a generic framework that provides a formalised structure to represent functional requirements in the form of a detailed <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> model. The thesis concludes that product functions need to be captured and analysed during the conceptual development of a product and be associated to <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> The developed results provide both groups of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> a structured, consistent approach to developing <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> at the conceptual design stage. The data infrastructure and the function-based <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> framework is validated through case studies and expert evaluation.

5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} unpublished plan envisaged basing {{himself at}} the old Discovery Expedition headquarters in McMurdo Sound. From there he proposed to launch attempts to reach the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Other journeys would follow, {{and there would be}} a continuous programme of scientific work. This early plan also revealed Shackleton's proposed transport methods, involving a combination of dogs, ponies and a specially designed motor vehicle. Neither ponies nor motor traction had been used in the Antarctic before, although ponies had been used by Frederick Jackson during the Jackson-Harmsworth Arctic expedition of 1894–97. Despite Jackson's confused reports of his ponies' prowess, and contrary to specific advice from Nansen, the renowned Norwegian polar traveller, Shackleton decided he would take 15 ponies, later scaled down to 10. By the time he announced his plans to the RGS in February 1907 Shackleton had revised his <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> to a more realistic £30,000 (updated value £). However, the response of the RGS to Shackleton's proposals was muted; Shackleton would learn later that the Society was by this time aware of Scott's wish to lead a new expedition and that the Society wished to reserve its full approval for Scott.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> of $7.7 billion per year.

More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children.

5|$|The York City War Memorial is a First World War {{memorial}} {{designed by}} Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York {{in the north}} of England. Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location. This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the issues in generating <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> at the conceptual design stage for Embedded Systems Design and Development (ES D&D), based on specifications. The research examines {{if there are any}} relationships between the system’s specifications and the system’s cost, and if these relationships can be formalised. The aim is to develop a framework that will structure, formalise and improve the ES D&D <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimating</b> process. Literature review examines current situation regarding ES D&D <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimating</b> and the information requirements for generating <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> The review identifies that research concentrates on Embedded Systems manufacturing cost estimation, {{there is a lack of}} research regarding D&D cost estimation, as well as on the information requirements for generating D&D <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> By conducting an industrial survey, the author identifies the internal practice on ES D&D <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimating</b> for the automotive and aerospace industries and identifies trends, commonalties and differences within and between them. The survey establishes that in order to improve the ES D&D <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimating</b> process, it is essential to establish a data infrastructure that will avoid issues with shortage of information imposed by suppliers and will link the Embedded System’s specifications with the system’s actual implementation and expected functionality. Using a case study approach, the author also establishes that it is essential to analyse the product functionality in such a way that will enable the development of a detailed <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> framework at the specification’s design stage. The framework is developed in three parts for hardware, software and integration and reuse. The ES hardware design and development effort is predicted using a complexity based <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> approach. The research has demonstrated that Use Case Points can be used to predict software development effort for ES software development when the specification is expressed as use cases. In case of statechart based specifications, the development effort is predicted, like in the case of Hardware, using a complexity based <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> approach. The study then investigates factors that affect Integration and Reuse effort for ES D&D. The Integration and Reuse effort is predicted using a expert judgement based methodology. The developed results provide automotive industry with a structured, consistent approach to develop <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> for the ES D&D Cost at the specifications design stage.
