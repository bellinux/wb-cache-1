5|$|The first {{deceased}} {{artist to}} top the UK Albums Chart was Otis Redding, {{who died in}} a plane crash on 10 December 1967. On 20 May 1968, Redding's sixth studio album, The Dock of the Bay, was released in the UK – three weeks later, it became his first and only UK number-one album. Since Redding, 11 further artists have posthumously topped the albums chart, of which three have done so more than twice. The first of these was American singer Eva Cassidy; after dying in 1996, three posthumous releases from Cassidy reached number one in consecutive years, 2001–03. The second musician to achieve this feat was American entertainer Elvis Presley. Following his death from a heart attack in August 1977, Presley's compilation album 40 Greatest climbed to number one within three weeks. Subsequent compilations ELV1S (2002), The King (2007), If I <b>Can</b> <b>Dream</b> (2015) and The Wonder of You (2016) also topped the chart. With If I <b>Can</b> <b>Dream,</b> Presley achieved his fourth posthumous number one, more than any other artist.|$|E

Russian Okhrana agent Vladimir Obromovich Ignatieff and Sister of the True Dreamers Yasmini {{are on their}} way into the Raj to kill both Athelstane and his sister, Cassandra. On their way there, Yasmini dreams of {{literally}} being the Raj's sacred Mahatma Disraeli. Since she <b>can</b> <b>dream</b> of the future (as well as different outcomes), she is able to dream ways around the Imperial patrols. At the same time, Cassandra Mary Effingham King, devoted Whig and brilliant scientist is on her way home to Oxford from Delhi. She is heavily involved on a project to find ways to deflect another meteor, asteroid, or comet from impacting the earth.|$|E

Of the honor she said, [...] "I am a very, very proud Canadian, I am proud of where I am from, and to be recognized in this nature is surreal. It's not something you <b>can</b> <b>dream</b> about happening to you. I <b>can</b> <b>dream</b> of winning a World Cup or an Olympic gold medal, and that's my job, but to have your country recognize you – I don't even know what to say." ...|$|E

2500|$|The G8 {{summit is}} an {{international}} event which is observed and reported by news media, but the G8's continuing relevance after more than 30 years is somewhat unclear. More than one analyst suggests that a G-8 summit {{is not the place}} to flesh out the details of any difficult or controversial policy issue in the context of a three-day event. Rather, the meeting offers an opportunity to bring a range of complex and sometimes inter-related issues. The G8 summit brings leaders together [...] "not so they <b>can</b> <b>dream</b> up quick fixes, but to talk and think about them together." ...|$|E

The song's vocal sections have {{a structure of}} two verses and a chorus, repeated twice, followed by a final extended and elaborated chorus. The song's lyrics begin by [...] telling people that dreams have to be built up from somewhere. The first chorus makes the statement that [...] "everyone <b>can</b> <b>dream</b> freely," [...] and that [...] "dreams come true, not by magic, but through your own strength." [...] Further lyrics expand on this theme, also telling people to [...] "not forget that they aren't alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two songs {{written by}} Jim Steinman {{were part of}} the soundtrack: [...] "Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young" [...] and [...] "Nowhere Fast," [...] both {{performed}} by [...] "Fire Incorporated", with Holly Sherwood as lead vocal. The title of the former was used as the tagline on some promotional materials for the film. Dan Hartman's selection [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>Dream</b> About You" [...] is the most successful song from the movie, and became a Billboard top 10 hit in 1984 (also from his studio album of the same name). In the movie, the song is performed on stage {{at the end of the}} film by [...] "The Sorels," [...] a fictional doo-wop style group consisting of actors Stoney Jackson, Grand L. Bush, Mykelti Williamson, and Robert Townsend. However, the song was actually sung for the film by Winston Ford, whose vocals were lip-synched by Jackson in the movie. While there are thus two versions of the song, only Hartman's version was released commercially.|$|E
