5|$|The {{school is}} selective; {{admission}} {{is based on}} assessments in English, mathematics and reasoning, an academic reference from the applicant's current school and an interview. The main entry point to enter the Lower School is at age 7 (Year 3), and ages 11 (Year 7), 13 (Year 9) and 16 to enter the Senior School. There are academic, music and other scholarships which reduce school fees by up to one-fifth, as well as means-tested bursaries up to the entirety of school fees. In addition, the charitable trust of the Dyers' provide a bursary to <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> the school fees of one pupil in each academic year. Cathedral choristers also receive bursaries which <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> of school fees through the Norwich Cathedral Choir Endowment Fund. The fees for the 2013/2014 academic year for the Lower School are £11,997 per annum (£3,999 per term), and £13,167 per annum (£4,389 per term) for the Senior School. The school also charges fees for lunches and entries for public examinations.|$|E
5|$|Bellew's Gartership also {{witnessed}} {{changes to}} {{the fabric of the}} College of Arms. Although it had survived the Blitz, structural problems with the roof and brickwork forced the heralds to decide between leaving the College's buildings on Queen Victoria Street or attempting expensive repairs. In 1954, they approached the Ministry of Works to ask for financial assistance in the building work; the Ministry agreed to <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> the cost. A successful public appeal for the remaining funds followed and the restoration work carried out. The College of Arms Trust was established in 1956 to oversee funds for the building's maintenance.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2011, VR {{announced}} it would start a refurbishment of all its Sm3 units to improve the operating conditions during winter. The work will be done between 2012 and 2014 and will cost 10 million Euros. Alstom will <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> of the expenses. The problematic couplers will be changed to allow trains to be coupled on-the-fly again at intermediate stations. Heaters will be installed in the trains' undercarriages to prevent the formation of ice during the winter. In addition to these modifications, the tilt angle of the bogies will be lowered from the current eight degrees. The operating speed of the train will remain the same. , new couplers have been installed in at least Sm3 units 7x12 and 7x18.|$|E

5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ejector pin plate, which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E
25|$|Naples was the most-bombed Italian city during World War II. Much of the city's 20th-century {{periphery}} {{was constructed}} under Benito Mussolini's fascist government, and during reconstruction efforts after World War II. In recent decades, Naples has constructed a large business district, the Centro Direzionale, and {{has developed an}} advanced transport infrastructure, including an Alta Velocità high-speed rail link to Rome and Salerno, and an expanded subway network, which is planned to eventually <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> of the region. The city has experienced significant economic growth in recent decades, and unemployment levels {{in the city and}} surrounding Campania have decreased since 1999.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, the New York State Legislature {{created the}} Brooklyn Grade Crossing Elimination Commission (BGCEC) to {{eliminate}} grade all grade crossings on the Brighton Beach Line and the Bay Ridge Line of the Long Island Rail Road. The city {{was supposed to}} <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> of the costs, not exceeding $1,000,000, while the railroads were to cover {{the other half of}} the costs. The work started on December 30, 1905, and was completed in 1908. A short piece of two-tracked elevated railroad was built from the ramp connecting to the Fulton Street Elevated as far as Park Place, where the original 1878 open cut began. From the end of that original cut south of Church Avenue, the line was wholly rebuilt as a four-track railroad with express and local stations to a point south of Neptune Avenue at the border of Coney Island, continuing along its original right-of-way to Brighton Beach station. The portion from Church Avenue to Avenue H was placed in a depressed open cut, while the portion from Avenue H to south of Sheepshead Bay was raised onto an earthen embankment, primarily with earth excavated from the open-cut portion and from the Bay Ridge Improvement of the Long Island Rail Road. The separation of the railroad grade allowed the line's trolley wire north of Sheepshead Bay to be replaced with ground-level third rail.|$|E

500|$|In March 1986, {{the federal}} {{government}} offered Metro a contract committing $195 million in UMTA funding toward the bus tunnel, requiring that a {{decision on whether to}} move forward with the project be made by December 31. A month later, the King County Council asked Metro to consider delaying construction of the bus tunnel while waiting for assurance on federal funding being able to <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> of the $395 million cost of the project; the council was scheduled to begin awarding contracts for utility relocation along 3rd Avenue and Pine Street in preparation for tunnel construction. On May 15, the Reagan administration signed a contract with Metro to commit $197 million of the $395 million required for the bus tunnel project, assuming re-authorization of a mass transit grant program by Congress, while also extending the deadline for a final decision to September 1987. Hours later, the Metro Council awarded the first construction contract for utility relocation, with construction set to begin in July. The Metro Council accepted the UMTA contract during their June 5 meeting, allowing for bidding on tunnel construction to begin. The tunnel construction contract was awarded to the joint venture of Guy F. Atkinson Construction and Dillingham Construction in late September for $44.16 million, beating seven competing bids with an estimate far lower than the approximately $61 million predicted by Metro engineers. The contract for the dual-mode trolleybuses was awarded by the Metro Council to Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie in October, consisting of an order for 236 buses at a cost of $133 million (equivalent to $million in [...] dollars); it was approved by UMTA in November.|$|E
500|$|The children's book The World's Angriest Boy in the World, {{which appears}} in Haller's {{memories}} of his childhood, was written by Hawley and published {{for use in the}} show. Stevens described it as [...] "the world's most twisted children's book", but useful for him to hold and read while acting. The physical manifestation of the book's title character was inspired by Edward Gorey drawings, with Wylie explaining that he [...] "loved the idea of him wearing a little velvet, Eddie Munster child’s funeral suit. That’s where that dude came from. He’s really scary." [...] Another manifestation of the Shadow King, the Devil with the Yellow Eyes, was inspired by the reality television series My 600-lb Life, with Wylie explaining, [...] "They do this amazing thing at the beginning of every episode of that show where they show the person struggling {{to get out of bed}} or walk down a hallway ... They light it badly just to make the person’s journey seem that much more difficult." [...] Boisclair was cast in the role due to his [...] height and slender frame, with prosthetics used to give him a [...] "gigantic body with no neck [...] really skinny arms and legs". Boisclair was called a [...] "rare and lucky find", akin to Bolaji Badejo, who portrayed the alien in the 1979 film Alien. Boisclair's prosthetics were designed by Sarah Pickersgill, under special effects makeup head Todd Masters, and took four-and-a-half hours to apply. Masters' team were also responsible for creating the body parts that are found sticking out of walls in the pilot, including Lenny's upper body and arm, produced from a silicone copy of Plaza; extensive bruising for Cary and Kerry Loudermilk after a major fight sequence, which was achieved with Pros-Aide transfers that were reduced each day to show the wounds healing; and the burn makeup for Linklater after he is injured in the pilot, which was designed to <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> his face and most of his chest and back, with just the face and neck requiring five separate prosthetics. Marcine Peter at Contour Contact Lens provided hand-painted contact lenses for the production, including for Boisclair to wear as the Devil with the Yellow Eyes.|$|E

[...] Liutprand of Cremona, who was twice an envoy to the Byzantine court (949 and 968), identifies the [...] "Russi" [...] with the Norse ("the Russi, whom we call Norsemen by another name") but explains the name as a Greek term referring to their physical traits ("A certain people made up of a part of the Norse, whom the Greeks call [...] the Russi on account of their physical features, we designate as Norsemen because of the location of their origin."). Leo the Deacon, a 10th-century Byzantine historian and chronicler, refers to the Rus' as [...] "Scythians" [...] and notes that they tended to adopt Greek rituals and customs.|$|E

60|$|Cautiously {{he lowered}} himself {{over the edge}} of the cliff, and with utter {{noiselessness}} commenced the descent toward the bottom of the gulch.

If he could reach the bottom and <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> the distance to the tree that stood in the center of the gulch he would feel comparatively safe for then, even if Numa appeared, he felt that he could beat him either to the cliff or to the tree, but to scale the first thirty feet of the cliff rapidly enough to elude the leaping beast would require a running start of at least twenty feet as there were no very good hand- or footholds close to the bottom--he had had to run up the first twenty feet like a squirrel running up a tree that other time he had beaten an infuriated Numa to it. He had no desire to attempt it again unless the conditions were equally favorable at least, for he had escaped Numa's raking talons by only a matter of inches on the former occasion.|$|E

60|$|During December and January {{when this}} desert world of thistles dead and dry as tinder {{continued}} standing, a menace and danger, the one desire and hope {{of every one}} was for the pampero--the south-west wind, which in hot weather is apt to come with startling suddenness, and to blow with extraordinary violence. And it would come at last, usually in the afternoon of a close hot day, after the north wind had been blowing persistently for days with a breath as from a furnace. At last the hateful wind would drop and a strange gloom that was not from any cloud would cover the sky; and by and by a cloud would rise, a dull dark cloud as of a mountain becoming visible on the plain at an enormous distance. In a little while it would <b>cover</b> <b>half</b> the sky, {{and there would be}} thunder and lightning and a torrent of rain, and at the same moment the wind would strike and roar in the bent-down trees and shake the house. And in an hour or two it would perhaps be all over, and next morning the detested thistles would be gone, or at all events levelled to the ground.|$|E
