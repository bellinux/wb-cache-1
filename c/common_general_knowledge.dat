In this paper we present an approach to specifying agents that takes advantage of the domain expert's knowledge where possible, but still allocates difficult programming tasks to expert programmers. In particular, the task of specifying agent behavior is layered and tasks are allocated according to the relative amounts of programming and domain expertise required for each one. Results are presented for an implementation of the technique for RoboCup players. An interesting benefit of the layered specification we observed was that an efficient, parallel development approach emerged...|$|R
40|$|Humans and {{intelligent}} computer programs must often {{jump to the}} conclusion that the objects they can determine to have certain properties or relations are the only objects that do. Circumscription formalizes such conjectural reasoning. 1 INTRODUCTION. THE QUALIFICATION PROBLEM (McCarthy 1959) 1 proposed a program with "common sense" that would represent what it knows (mainly) by sentences in a suitable logical language. It would decide what to do by deducing a conclusion that it should perform a certain act. Performing the act would create a new situation, and it would 1 [URL] 1 again decide what to do.

40|$|Abstract — Autonomous robots {{often require}} domain knowl-edge to act {{intelligently}} in their environment. This is particu-larly true for robots that use automated planning techniques, which require symbolic {{representations of the}} operating en-vironment and the robot’s capabilities. However, the task of specifying domain knowledge by hand is tedious and prone to error. As a result, we aim to automate the process of acquiring <b>general</b> <b>common</b> sense <b>knowledge</b> of objects, relations, and actions, by extracting such information from large amounts of natural language text, written by humans for human readers. We present two methods for knowledge acquisition, requiring only limited human input, which focus on the inference of spatial relations from text. Although our approach is applicable {{to a range of}} domains and information, we only consider one type of knowledge here, namely object locations in a kitche...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of Article 83 EPC, a European patent application must contain sufficient information to allow a person skilled in the art, using his <b>common</b> <b>general</b> <b>knowledge,</b> to perceive the technical teaching inherent in the claimed invention and to put it into effect accordingly. In other words, the disclosure of the invention must be reproducible without undue burden, and this must be true over the whole scope of the claim. This requirement must be complied with as from the date of filing because a deficiency in a European patent application as filed, consisting in an insufficient identification of the subject-matter claimed, cannot subsequently be cured without offending against Article 123(2) EPC which provides that the subject-matter content of a European patent application as filed may not be extended.|$|E

5000|$|In {{decision}} G 2/10, the Enlarged Board of Appeal further decided that: [...] "1a. An {{amendment to}} a claim by {{the introduction of}} a disclaimer disclaiming from it subject-matter disclosed in the application as filed infringes Article 123(2) EPC if the subject-matter remaining in the claim after the introduction of the disclaimer is not, be it explicitly or implicitly, directly and unambiguously disclosed to the skilled person using <b>common</b> <b>general</b> <b>knowledge,</b> in the application as filed.1b. Determining whether or not that is the case requires a technical assessment of the overall technical circumstances of the individual case under consideration, taking into account {{the nature and extent of}} the disclosure in the application as filed, the nature and extent of the disclaimed subject-matter and its relationship with the subject-matter remaining in the claim after the amendment." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{sufficiency}} of the disclosure, {{with any}} valid amendments made to it, is judged at the patent's claim date. The disclosure must be fair, honest, open and sufficient. If a person skilled {{in the art}} can arrive at the same results only through chance or further long experiments, the disclosure is insufficient and the patent is void. The disclosure must give skilled readers enough information for them to easily use the invention when the patent expires, and for them to try to improve on or experiment with it in the meanwhile. Thus, a patent holder who holds back essential information invalidates the whole patent. The disclosure would also be insufficient if it is simply wrong and a person {{skilled in the art}} cannot use the disclosure or her general ability to replicate the invention. If a person skilled in the art would readily spot the mistake or omission and quickly correct it by using <b>common</b> <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{and the rest of the}} patent, but without [...] "prolonged research, inquiry or experiment" [...] or inventiveness, then this will not invalidate a patent.|$|E
