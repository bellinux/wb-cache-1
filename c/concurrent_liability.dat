There must be a causal connection between the breach and the consequence complained of. In Saamco v York Montague Ltd it was held a bank could not recover damages from property valuer {{for all of the}} difference in what the properties it bought after getting the valuations were assured to be and actual property values, because {{a large part of the}} difference resulted from generally depressed market prices following [...] "Black Wednesday" [...] in 1992. In a business deal, calculation will typically be based on the forgone profits that one could reasonably have expected to make. This could also include the [...] "loss of a chance" [...] to profit, so in Chaplin v Hicks an entrant in a beauty contest wrongfully excluded from the final round was awarded 25% of the final prize money to reflect her 1 in 4 chance of having won. One limit lies at consequential losses that are too [...] "remote", or are not a natural result of the breach, and are not in the parties' contemplation. In Hadley v Baxendale a miller tried to recover damages from Baxendale's delivery company for the lost profits from his mill grinding to a halt, after they were late delivering a crankshaft back from being fixed. But Alderson B held that because millers would usually be expected to keep spare crank shafts, and because he had not informed Baxendale of the importance of the timely delivery, an award for profits could not be compensated. More recently in The Achilleas the majority of the House of Lords preferred to express the remoteness rule as one of construing the contract to reflect the parties' [...] "background of market expectations". Transfield Shipping returned The Achilleas late to its owner, Mercator, which led Mercator to lose a lucrative contract with Cargill that would make over $1.3million, an occurrence that was plainly a natural consequence of the breach and easily foreseeable. Yet because the standard practice and expectation in the shipping industry was that if a ship were returned late only the ordinary sum for hire would be due, this was the limit on recovery. It is also possible to lose one's entitlement to damages if steps are not taken to mitigate further losses, that any prudent person would, rather than sitting back and letting losses run up. But the burden of proof of a failure to mitigate is on a contract breaker, to whom the courts are unlikely to be sympathetic. A contract breaker could may also, if a <b>concurrent</b> <b>liability</b> arises in tort, argue a claimant's damages should be reduced to reflect their contributory fault, and the courts can reduce an award to achieve a just and equitable result. Sometimes potential profits will be too uncertain, or a general fall in market prices means that even claiming damages for the thing itself would leave one in a negative position, and so the courts allow a claimant to choose whether to sue, not for a failure in expectations, but to cover her expenses in preparing for the contract, or the [...] "reliance interest". In Anglia Television Ltd v Reed a TV channel successfully sued Robert Reed for not turning up for shooting a film. It was unclear whether the film would make any profits at all, and so Anglia TV got compensated for its wasted expenses in preparing the set. The level of damages is generally assessed at the date of the breach, but this is variable if the court thinks another time would be fairer.|$|E

40|$|Although {{migration}} is a transnational phenomenon involving {{a plurality of}} states, the state of departure is often unwilling/unable to offer protection. Receiving/transit states can refrain from engaging with the problem until migrants have already entered their territory. With high seas, this can result {{in the deaths of}} people taking the risk of travelling to a new place. The article argues that states have a duty to offer (some) protection even when migrants are not in their territory, based on human rights’ positive effect and the principle of due diligence. Because of the transnational nature of migration, all involved states have the responsibility to offer protection. This may lead to <b>concurrent</b> state <b>liability</b> for failure to protect. The duty to protect may extend to the high seas, even when the traditional links for the establishment of jurisdiction are absent. The duty is not unlimited, it needs to prevail over other considerations...|$|R

International {{responsibility}} of member states for acts of international organizations {{is one of}} the most complex, but also the most controversial issues in the field of international responsibility. Overview of the practice shows us that there is still no unified view on this issue. Unlike judicature where in the majority of judgments the existence of state liability for the acts of international organizations has been rejected, state practice shows different approaches and understandings in respect of the existence of member states 2 ̆ 7 liability for acts of international organizations. On the other hand, in international legal doctrine the view prevails that a separate international legal personality of international organizations from the personality of member states results in separate international {{responsibility of}} international organizations from the responsibility of the member states. International legal personality of international organizations thus represents a shield which provides member states protection from potential international legal responsibility for acts of international organizations. However, aiming to protect the rights and interests of third parties, some authors advocate the view that the member states are, exclusively due to their membership, concurrently or secondarily liable for internationally wrongful acts committed by international organizations. Nevertheless, acceptance of <b>concurrent</b> and secondary <b>liability</b> of member states, based solely on their membership, would result in interference by member states in the activities of international organizations and would thereby bring into question the autonomy and separate international legal personality of international organizations. Although the International Law Commission has rejected the possibility of <b>concurrent</b> and secondary <b>liability</b> of member states, based solely on their membership, the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations from 2011 anticipated international legal responsibility of member states for internationally wrongful acts committed by international organizations. However, it is necessary to further elaborate certain Articles of the Draft in order to create effective mechanisms through which a real connection between member states and acts committed by international organizations could be determined in practice, as otherwise there is a risk of abuse of international organizations and their international legal personality by member states in order to avoid international legal responsibility...|$|R
50|$|The {{primary sources}} of {{obligations}} are contract and delict, {{the latter being}} wrongful and blameworthy conduct that harms a person. There is a close similarity between a breach of contract and a delict, in that both are civil wrongs and may {{give rise to a}} duty to pay damages as compensation. It is unsurprising, then, that certain conduct may constitute both a breach of contract and a delict (as when, in Van Wyk v Lewis, a surgeon negligently left a cotton swab inside a patient’s body), in which case there is <b>concurrent</b> <b>liability,</b> permitting the plaintiff to sue on either basis.|$|E

The central argument that will beadvanced is that the present understanding of the ‘incident rules’ inconcurrent liability in tort and contract, such as the applicable rules ofremoteness or limitation, is inconsistent with the rationale for concurrencelaid down in Henderson v MerrettSyndicates Ltd. Rather than analyse concurrence as a single situation, thatis, conceiving it as a contest between rules of tort or contract rules, we arguethat the better way forward is to differentiate between the differentsituations in which liabilities in tort and contract may arise and to apply thecorrect analysis to each situation accordingly...|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises the {{development}} of liability for medical malpractice in the People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China, beginning {{with the establishment of}} a formal system of administrative liability in 1987, its refinement in 2002, and the broadly contemporaneous judicial recognition of a concurrent tortious liability under general civil law. All these developments may be said to have furthered the interests of patients. The incorporation of liability for medical malpractice into the Tort Liability Law of 2009, however, arguably marks a step backwards, subordinating the interests of patients in favor of the interests of the medical community, and further reforms in the same direction may be apprehended in the future. Yangge Dance, a traditional Chinese folk dance, provides an apt simile for this process of development, with its initial move of three steps forward followed by two steps back. The dance is concluded by two sideways steps - first to the right, then to the left -which may be taken to refer to the constant interplay between the two <b>concurrent</b> <b>liability</b> systems - one administrative, the other tortious - which is explored in its various dimensions in the article [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Chicago Kent Law Review is the property of Chicago Kent Law Review and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder 2 ̆ 7 s express written permission.

40|$|The {{research}} {{objectives were}} {{to build a}} unified equitable estoppel model that simplified the irregularities in the equitable estoppels as identified in England, while consolidating the essential principles to be applied in a unified model, {{with a view to}} potentially applying the model generally. Other jurisdictions which received notable focus were Ireland and Australia, chosen respectively because of the fertile Irish ground for further development, and because the Australian approach diverges significantly from that in England. The model sought to simplify and consolidate equitable estoppel, and to make it generally applicable. The focus on English cases throughout the thesis served to highlight some difficulties within equitable estoppel as it has developed in that jurisdiction in particular and hence identify the most confusing features of the doctrine. Two surveys were conducted, which showed four key issues: an imprecision of terminology, a perception that estoppel is a fallback claim, a possible lack of development of the doctrine, and some welcoming attitudes towards a possible unified doctrine and of fulfilling such missing development. In particular, it was questioned whether these concerns were more broadly indicative of the existence of doctrinal inconsistencies, and whether a unified model could be proposed which would address those inconsistencies. A model was incrementally built by addressing some wider doctrinal concerns in the English law. A conceptual sketch found that there is space for welcome development of a doctrine reddressing detrimental reliance, and that this concept is associated with equitable estoppel. On the basis of the views of McFarlane and Liew respectively, it was, first, found that a possible unified equitable estoppel would be in the nature of a liability, and, it was, secondly, suggested that it would give rise to a reflective remedy {{in the shape of a}} minimum equity. Meanings of unconscionability, a concept in equitable estoppel which has led to a great deal of commentary, were separated and analysed. It was found that unconscionabilty can mean, first, the jurisdiction in the sense of a basis for the existence of equitable estoppel in the first place; secondly, the context in which v the reliance takes place; thirdly, the justifiability of the reliance; fourthly, whether it is unconscionable to move to an inconsistent position; fifthly, whether the court ought to grant a remedy; and, finally, what parameters aid the court in shaping the remedy. Meanwhile, several inconsistencies were found in the processes of shaping a liability and a remedy in English law. English law and doctrinal commentary generally prefers not to view some estoppels as giving rise to a cause of action, and not to accept a unified doctrine: contrasting views were put forward dealing with both matters. The liability-?&# 8208;finding process itself was found to have a simpler basis than it currently has, and the remedy-?&# 8208;finding process tending towards the award of an expectation was compared with similar processes in other jurisdictions. All were viewed as potential barriers to further development of doctrine and thus as having a direct bearing upon the findings in the surveys, and their implications. All of this was argued to be conceivably soluble by building a unified model. Having addressed the main doctrinal questions, the findings were used to begin building some answers. A simplified and unified model was built which established the required steps as follows: (A) proof by the claimant of detriment, (A) (i) proof by the claimant of the relevance of that detriment by reference to a subject-?&# 8208;matter, (B) disproof by the defendant of inducement, (B) (i) a defence of unreasonable reliance ? which, if leading the court to find that a liability had been raised, completed (C) (i). Then, (C) (ii) allowed the court to find that conscience required the granting of a minimum-?&# 8208;equity-?&# 8208;based remedy, and (C) (iii) allowed the court to vary the remedy as found. The steps were built upon distinct findings throughout the thesis: for example, (C) (ii) built upon a combination of meaning five of unconscionability, and an analogy with legitimate expectation. The model was then tested using real-?&# 8208;life cases. Its positive points and limitations were discussed in relation to its possible adoption in England, Australia, and Ireland. Issues relating to <b>concurrent</b> <b>liability</b> were discussed, and possible general weakenesses identified...|$|E
