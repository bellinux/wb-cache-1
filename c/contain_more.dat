There are millions of different types of viruses, although only about 5,000 types have been described in detail. As of September 2015, the NCBI Virus genome database has more than 75,000 complete genome sequences. but there are doubtlessly many more to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters may nest {{as single}} pairs, loose colonies or dense colonies. Smaller species tend to nest solitarily, while {{medium-sized}} bee-eaters have small colonies, and larger and migratory species nest in large colonies that can {{number in the}} thousands. In some instances, colonies may <b>contain</b> <b>more</b> than one species of bee-eater. In species that nest gregariously, breeding pairs may be assisted by up to five helpers, These birds may alternate between breeding themselves and helping in successive years.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The flavoniods and {{polyphenols}} {{were separated}} from Eucommia ulmoids leaves by resin, at last, four components containing different ingredients were gotten. Two components, {{one of which}} <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> polyphenols, and one of which <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> flavoniods (EUII), were chosen for in vivo antioxidation test. The antioxidation activity in vivo was studied by measuring the content of malondialchehyche (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity in mice orally administrated by EUI and EUII. The results showed that 20 % ethanol elution solution (EUI) <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> polyphenols and 60 % ethanol elution solution (EUII) <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> flavoniods; by comparing with negative control (NC) group, EUI, which <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> polyphenols, showed more obvious antioxidation activities in vivo. The results also meant that polyphenols was the leading working material for Eucommia ulmoids leaves in antioxidation in vivo...|$|R

50|$|The {{minerals}} {{are arranged}} into layers that appear as bands in cross section. The appearance of layers, called compositional banding, occurs because the layers, or bands, are of different composition. The darker bands have relatively more mafic minerals (those <b>containing</b> <b>more</b> magnesium and iron). The lighter bands <b>contain</b> relatively <b>more</b> felsic (silicate minerals, <b>containing</b> <b>more</b> of the lighter elements, such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium).|$|R

5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses <b>contain</b> <b>more</b> water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E

5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases {{with thin}} tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood {{flows into the}} capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces <b>contain</b> <b>more</b> capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz.|$|E
5|$|Eremoryzomys polius, {{also known}} as the gray rice rat or the Marañon oryzomys, is a rodent species in the tribe Oryzomyini of the family Cricetidae. Discovered in 1912 and first {{described}} in 1913 by Wilfred Osgood, it was originally placed in Oryzomys and named Oryzomys polius. In 2006, a cladistic analysis found that it was not closely related to Oryzomys in the strict sense or to any other oryzomyine then known, so that it is now placed in its own genus, Eremoryzomys. The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys, named in 2011, is probably the closest relative of Eremoryzomys. Eremoryzomys has a limited distribution in the dry upper valley of the Marañón River in central Peru, but may yet <b>contain</b> <b>more</b> than one species.|$|E
5|$|Fats are catabolised by {{hydrolysis}} to free {{fatty acids}} and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates <b>contain</b> <b>more</b> oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all {{be used by the}} cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.|$|E
40|$|The {{estimation}} of Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn in guinea corn, maize and soil sample from Kaduna metropolis, Nigeria was carried out. The {{objective of the}} study was to determine the bioavailable Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn in guinea corn, maize and soil samples by flame Atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) using sequent extraction techniques. The concentrations of the metals in the cereals and soils vary from one sampling site to another. The t-test p = 0. 000 < 0. 05 for Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb respectively indicated a significant difference between the concentrations of metals in maize and guinea corn for all the four types of metals. It showed that maize <b>contains</b> <b>more</b> Ni than guinea corn <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> Zn than in guinea corn with a mean of 166. 99 mg/kg against 5. 42 mg/kg. Maize <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> than guinea corn with a mean of 37. 62 mg/kg against 3. 17 mg/kg. On the other hand, it showed that guinea corn <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> Cu than maize with a mean of 46. 2 mg/kg aganist 21. 88 mg/kg. Similarly, it showed that maize soil contained about ten times more Ni than guinea corn soil with a mean of 38. 23 mg/kg against 3. 91 mg/kg. It also showed that maize soil <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> Zn than guinea corn soil <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> Pb than guinea corn soil with a mean of 28. 57 mg/kg against 3. 32 mg/kg.

5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute {{the center of}} diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can <b>contain</b> <b>more</b> freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water ice. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may <b>contain</b> <b>more</b> water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Its surface {{is composed}} of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover {{about a third of}} the satellite. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.|$|E
5|$|Ida is {{classified}} as an S-type asteroid based on ground-based spectroscopic measurements. The composition of S-types was uncertain before the Galileo flybys, but was interpreted to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the Earth: ordinary chondrite (OC) and stony-iron. Estimates of Ida's density are constrained to less than 3.2g/cm3 by the long-term stability of Dactyl's orbit. This all but rules out a stony-iron composition; were Ida made of 5g/cm3 iron- and nickel-rich material, {{it would have to}} <b>contain</b> <b>more</b> than 40% empty space.|$|E

5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to Murder on the Orient Express over And Then There Were None. These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers {{to use the same}} animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In And Then There Were None, characters had to rotate their entire bodies to talk to one another, whereas in Murder on the Orient Express, characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models <b>contain</b> <b>more</b> polygons.|$|E
