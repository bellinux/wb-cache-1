Preferential conformations of an isolated molecule, {{a pair of}} molecules {{and a set of}} molecules have been established For butyl and further homologues, hexaesters give irregular columns, resulting in piled pairs, with distances d and d' equal to 3. 75 and 4. 45 Å between neighbouring aromatic cores. On the other hand hexaethers give regular <b>columns</b> (<b>d</b> ≃ 3. 28 Å) of helicoidal type with a pitch equal to 14 Å.

5000|$|In the {{following}} truth table the column labelled [...] "taut" [...] for tautology evaluates logical equivalence (symbolized here by ≡) {{between the two}} <b>columns</b> labelled <b>d.</b> Because all four rows under [...] "taut" [...] are 1's, the equivalence indeed represents a tautology.|$|R
30|$|Consider a {{plaintext}} {{table with}} w columns, {{from which we}} wish to support range predicates on <b>d</b> <b>columns.</b> The plaintext values {{for each of the}} <b>d</b> <b>columns</b> are independently encrypted 2 ^d- 1 times using E_BS and E_RS each, thus creating 2 ^d ciphertext columns. Further, 2 ^d encrypted tables are created by capturing all BS and RS combinations of these columns. The remaining columns in the plaintext table—on which range queries will not be issued—are simply encrypted using an SBC.|$|R
50|$|In {{a matrix}} that is d-separable, the Boolean sum of every <b>d</b> <b>columns</b> is unique. In a matrix that is d-disjunct the Boolean sum of every <b>d</b> <b>columns</b> {{does not contain}} any other column in the matrix. Theoretically, for {{the same number of}} columns (items), one can {{construct}} d-separable matrices with fewer rows (tests) than d-disjunct. However, designs that are based on d-separable are less applicable since the decoding time to identify the special items is exponential. In contrast, the decoding time for d-disjunct matrices is polynomial.|$|R

5000|$|On 1 November 1915 Townshend led the 6th (Poona) Division from Kut-al-Amara {{and marched}} up {{the course of}} the River Tigris. Ctesiphon, some 25 mi south of Baghdad was reached on 20 November 1915. Here they met an Ottoman force of more than twenty {{thousand}} troops that had issued from Baghdad to oppose their approach to the city, giving them a numerical advantage of 2 to 1 over the 6th (Poona) Division, sited within well-prepared defensive trench fortifications. General Nurreddin Pasha had the command of four divisions, namely the 35th, the 38th, the 45th and 51st which he had dug in at trenches built over the ruins of Ctesiphon. At Ctesiphon, Townshend was obsessed with the Arch of Ctesiphon. Strachan stated:"The centre of the battlefield of Ctesiphon is the Arch, and it figures in all of the photographs of the Army when they reached this high point of the advance. And its immensely powerful for Townshend, the student of military history, because this marks the extremity of the Roman Empire, this marks the point where Belisarius, the famous Roman commander, had got to, coming in the other direction, of course. But for those with a classical education, as of course just about every British officer had received before the First World War, then this is a very powerful image indeed". Townshend had divided his division into four columns. To Column A, he assigned the Dorset regiment, the 104th Rifles and the Thirtieth Composite Brigade to which he attached two Gurkha companies. To Column B, Townshend assigned the Norfolk regiment, the 7th Rajputs and the 110th Mahrattas. To Column C went the Oxfordshire Light Infantry, the Twenty-second Punjabi regiment, the 103rd Mahrattas and 119th Infantry. And finally to <b>Column</b> <b>D</b> went the 7th Lancers, the Sixteenth Cavalry, the Thirty-third Cavalry and S battery of the Royal Horse Artillery. Townshend's plans called the Principle Mass [...] "either to throw the Turks into the Tigris or compel them to a disastrous flight across the Diala river, some six miles behind them". Column C was to attack Nureddin Pasha's right flank to distract him while the [...] "Principle Mass" [...] of Columns A and B were to attack the left flank of the Ottoman lines while <b>Column</b> <b>D</b> was to race around the Ottoman positions to attack from the rear. Townshend was in a notably bad mood before the battle and much to the shock of his servant Boggis savagely beat his dog Spot when he found Spot cuddled up next to Boggis asleep. When Boggis asked: [...] "What are you doing that for sir?", he received the reply: [...] "He was sleeping with you! He's my dog and he's got to learn!". Boggis later recalled that Townshend was a [...] "harsh bastard" [...] who treated his men no better than he treated Spot.|$|E
5000|$|The Battle of Ctesiphon that {{followed}} was hard fought {{over two days}} starting on 22 November 1915, with Generals Townshend and Nixon both being personally involved in the fighting. The Ottoman force consisted of about 25, 000 men, but British intelligence had estimated the Ottoman force as about 9, 500. The battle began with Hoghton leading Column C in an attack {{in the early morning}} mist with the men of Column C using the outline of the Arch of Ctesiphon as their guide that quickly brought down murderous Ottoman fire on his men. In the meantime, General Delamain led Column A under heavy Ottoman fire to capture the Vital Point (V.P.) later that morning. After the capture of the V.P, Townshend believed that the battle was won, only to discover much to his shock that the Ottoman Army was much larger than he had thought and his forces were at the receiving end of a vigorous Ottoman counterattack. During the fighting at Ctesiphon, Townshend suddenly demanded a change of uniform, which required his manservant Boggis to run across a mile of battlefield in order to bring Townshend his new uniform. Once Boggis returned, Townshend stripped himself naked in full view of his men before putting on [...] "a silk vest, silk underpants, a khaki shirt, his breeches, boots and sunhelmet and, picking up his binoculars, eating a piece of plum cake passed to him by a junior officer, resumed his inspection of the battle". Amid much heavy fighting, <b>Column</b> <b>D</b> was which to strike the Ottoman lines from the rear was intercepted by an Ottoman cavalry force under Halil Kut, leading to a swirling cavalry action in the desert that ended in a draw, but strategically was a defeat for the British as it ended Townshend's hope of having his cavalry smash into the rear of the Ottoman forces [...] As the Ottoman forces counter-attacked, Townshend was forced to pull back as his forces were outnumbered. Townshend blamed his withdrawal on his Indian troops, whom he claimed had pulled back without permission. Townshend claimed that his Indian troops were too stupid to operate on their own and needed whites to tell them what to do. Townshend maintained that too many British officers had been killed in the battle and so the Indians had retreated. [...] After a hard day's fighting, Townshend ordered what was left of his division to dig in while Nureddin Pasha ordered his men to pull back. The next day, Nureddin Pasha ordered a general attack with the aim of destroying the Anglo-Indian force. Amid the ruins of Ctesiphon, the Ottomans fought the British and Indian soldiers with the fiercest fighting occurring at the Water Redoubt where about 100 men of the Twenty-Second Punjabi regiment and about 300 Gurkhas stood their ground and beat off attacks by the 35th Ottoman division. One of Nureddin Pasha's staff officers, Muhammad Amin later wrote that it was amazing that this [...] "brave and determined little force" [...] had stopped an entire Ottoman division and finally pushed them back to their second line of defence. Townshend, who usually blamed all of his problems on his Indian troops made no mention of the action at the Water Redoubt in his post-war writings. After the second day of fighting, Nureddin Pasha ordered his men to withdraw. The Ottomans had suffered more dead and wounded at Ctesiphon, but greater size of the Ottoman forces meant that Nureddin could afford his losses and continue to fight while the smaller size of Townshend's division meant that his losses at Ctesiphon had proportionally cost him far more.|$|E

40|$|Many {{problems}} in computer vision and recommender systems involve low-rank matrices. In this work, we study {{the problem of}} finding the maximum entry of a stochastic low-rank matrix from sequential observations. At each step, a learning agent chooses pairs of row and column arms, and receives the noisy product of their latent values as a reward. The main challenge is that the latent values are unobserved. We identify a class of non-negative matrices whose maximum entry can be found statistically efficiently and propose an algorithm for finding them, which we call LowRankElim. We derive a O((K + L) (d) Δ^- 1 n) upper bound on its n-step regret, where K {{is the number of}} rows, L is the number of <b>columns,</b> <b>d</b> is the rank of the matrix, and Δ is the minimum gap. The bound depends on other problem-specific constants that clearly do not depend K L. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result in the literature...|$|R

40|$|A bench-scale {{continuous}} flow system, consisting successively of an anaerobic hydrolysis column (column A), an anoxic column (<b>column</b> <b>D)</b> and two aerobic columns (columns B and F), was constructed to remove nitrogen and carbon simultaneously from terramycin crystallization mother solution (TCMS). Columns A and D were sludge-bed reactors, and columns B and F were biofilm reactors packed with polyethylene balls and soft fibers hung on plastic rings, respectively. Approximately 82 % {{of the chemical}} oxygen demand (COD) and 81 % total nitrogen were removed by the system when tap water diluted TCMS was continuously fed (dilution ratio, 1 : 4). Sulfide which was produced during anaerobic hydrolysis was used as part of electron donors for denitrification in <b>column</b> <b>D.</b> Comparison results show that porous polyethylene balls had a better COD and NH(4) (+) -N removal performance than the fiber type biocarrier.

40|$|Microcolumn {{chromatography}} (1. 0 mm to 0. 3 mm <b>column</b> i. <b>d.)</b> of underivatized {{amino acids}} coupled to evaporative light-scattering (ELS) detection demonstrated good baseline stability using perfluorinated carboxylic acid ion-pairing agents of varying alkyl chain lengths (C- 2 -C- 8) and concentrations (1 - 8 mM). Under the gradient elution conditions used, the baseline stability {{and the limits}} of detection for amino acids were better with ELS detection than those obtained with UV absorbance detection. Microcolumn chromatography enabled good mass sensitivity to be achieved with the ELS detector with as little as 0. 5 ng of amino acid being detectable on-column with a 0. 3 mm i. <b>d.</b> <b>column</b> under gradient conditions. Excellent linearity was obtained for calibration standards of four different amino acids over three orders of magnitude (0. 5 - 500 ng on-column; R- 2 = 0. 98 or better). From the data presented it can be concluded that ELS detection can be advantageously linked with microcolumn chromatography to give better sensitivity and improved linearity compared with conventional chromatography.

40|$|A liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric (LC/MS) assay was {{developed}} for the simultaneous determination of a pro-drug (Ro 48 - 3657), its active metabolite (platelet inhibitor, Ro 44 - 3888) and precursor metabolite (Ro 48 - 3656) in human, dog and rat plasma, utilizing on-line column-switching solid-phase extraction (SPE) for clean-up and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for separation of the analytes, with on-line detection by ionspray (pneumatically assisted electrospray) tandem mass spectrometry in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The assay was validated for the quantification of all three analytes. The method involves protein precipitation with perchloric acid, enrichment of the analytes on a standard bore trapping <b>column</b> (i. <b>d.</b> 4. 6 mm) and separation on a narrow-bore analytical <b>column</b> (i. <b>d.</b> 2 mm). Except for the plasma precipitation step, the assay was fully automated, allowing unattended operation. The lower limits of quantification were 0. 20 ng ml- 1 (Ro 48 - 3657, Ro 44 - 3888) and 0. 50 ng ml- 1 (Ro 48 - 3656) using a 0. 5 ml plasma aliquot. The mean inter-assay precision and accuracy derived from quality control samples were 5. 3 % and 101 %, respectively, utilizing the calibration range 0. 2 - 200 ng ml- 1. Using the unique features of column-switching HPLC combined with MS/MS, {{it was possible to}} develop the method {{in a short period of}} time.
