The most devastating example of the Provisionals' commercial bombing campaign was Bloody Friday on 21 July 1972 in Belfast city centre, where 22 bombs were exploded, killing nine people and injuring 130. While most of the IRA's attacks on <b>commercial</b> <b>targets</b> were not designed to cause casualties, on many occasions they killed civilian bystanders.

The effects of short-term changes in fishing effort, were evaluated for an infaunal community from a Mediterranean fishing ground that is characterised by well-defined intra-annual trawl fleet dynamics tightly related to the main target species in the area: Mullus barbatus. Results suggest that, despite chronic trawling clearly modifing the infaunal community structure, changes linked to variability in the effort regime were too small to influence the M. barbatus population at the within-year time scale...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to create a}} {{literature}} review about cosmetotextile. Cosmetotextile is the combination of the cosmetic industry and the textile industry. The future of the textile industry is represented by the progress of new kinds of technical textiles, that are based on revolutionary technologies, innovative materials and utilization. This means developement of new products with high added-value properties, for example application of antimicrobial and UV-protective agents, fragrances, anti-cellulite treatments or skin softeners. Such textile finishes are both important <b>commercial</b> <b>target</b> and challenge for technical developement. This thesis focuses on the field of intelligent textiles and combination of textile and cosmetics.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the development of young children's brand awareness, and the relative influence of environmental factors (e. g., television, parents, peers) on brand awareness. We presented 196 two- to eight-year-olds with 12 brand logos. After exposure to these logos, we asked children to mention the brand name (brand recall), and to choose the right brand from a number of available visual options (brand recognition). Two- to three-year-olds recalled only 1 out of 12 brands, whereas they recognized 8 out of 12 brands. The results showed that exposure to television was significantly related to the brand awareness of even the youngest children. The findings are discussed in terms of contributions to national and international debates about the ethical aspects of a growing trend to consider infants and young preschoolers as a <b>commercial</b> <b>target</b> group...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} children’s Bibles and Bible storybooks as {{vehicles for}} the transfer of God concepts {{from one generation to}} the next – as God is considered central to the portrayal of the confessional attributes of the religious collective. It identifies both the commercial and religious imperatives controlling the prevailing attributes assigned as characteristic of the divine. The presentation of the nature of God is found to align with the <b>commercial</b> <b>target</b> audience for children’s Bibles: mothers and female caregivers who purchase the books on behalf of their charges and read and interpret the Bibles to the child. But it also coincides with the preferred attributes associated with a supernatural being by young children. Ultimately, God is found to be consistently portrayed by means of maternal attributes of love, protection and care in contrast to the more ambivalent portrayal of God in the adult biblical text...|$|E

40|$|Estimates of {{discards}} by the Dutch pelagic freezer-trawler fleet {{were derived}} {{based on data}} from observers on board commercial vessels. In all, 27 fishing trips of duration 2 – 5 weeks each were sampled between 2002 and 2005, covering the North Sea and the western waters of the British Isles. Different methods to estimate discards were compared, and raising these estimates by number of trips or by total landings did not greatly influence the annual estimates of total discards. Some 30 000 t of fish were discarded annually by the fleet, the <b>commercial</b> <b>target</b> species mackerel, herring, and horse mackerel being discarded most, with 41 %, 19 %, and 15 % of the total discards by weight, respectively. The most commonly discarded non-commercial species was boarfish, accounting for 5 % of total discards. Slippage accounts for 10 % of all discards, and the most common species slipped is herring. There is extensive discarding of juvenile mackerel in the horse mackerel fishery, {{and to a lesser extent}} highgrading of mackerel in the same fishery...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of new olive orchards represents the main way {{to renovate the}} olive sector in Italy, because they allow high yields and mechanization of cultural practices, particularly harvesting. The design of an olive orchard implies several important choices (area, cultivar, training system, planting density, orientation of the rows, type of trees) which must be made in relation to several factors, such as farm size, type of product that the grower wants to obtain (<b>commercial</b> <b>target),</b> system to mechanize harvesting, kind of cultivation (conventional, integrated or organic). The application of correct techniques for {{the preparation of the}} site, disposal of excessive water, execution of basal fertilization, kind of breaking ploughing to use, execution of the plantation, along with the application of correct cultural practices in the first year after planting, allow to create the best conditions for a fast and intense growth of the trees. All the choices and techniques related to new olive orchards are here reviewed to provide growers and experts a quick, easy-to-read, guide.

40|$|Background: Human exome re{{sequencing}} using <b>commercial</b> <b>target</b> capture kits {{has been}} and is being used for sequencing large numbers of individuals to search for variants associated with various human diseases. We rigorously evaluated the capabilities of two solution exome capture kits. These analyses help clarify the strengths and limitations of those data as well as systematically identify variables {{that should be considered}} in the use of those data. Results: Each exome kit performed well at capturing the targets they were designed to capture, which mainly corresponds to the consensus coding sequences (CCDS) annotations of the human genome. In addition, based on their respective targets, each capture kit coupled with high coverage Illumina sequencing produced highly accurate nucleotide calls. However, other databases, such as the Reference Sequence collection (RefSeq), define the exome more broadly, and so not surprisingly, the exome kits did not capture these additional regions. Conclusions: Commercial exome capture kits provide a very efficient way to sequence select areas of the genome at very high accuracy. Here we provide the data to help guide critical analyses of sequencing data derived from these products. Background Targeted sequencing of large portions of the genome wit...|$|E

40|$|Vecta {{acquired}} 9 {{square miles}} of 9 -C seismic data in Mountrail County, North Dakota with the Mission Canyon shoreline as a primary target. Vecta contracted the Institute Francais du Petrole in order to co-develop a more rigorous multicomponent seismic interpretation product. The final interpretation was very unique in that it utilized not only the 9 -C seismic data but also the new jointly developed software. A Mission Canyon anomaly was developed in 2006; however, it was of insufficient size to be a <b>commercial</b> <b>target</b> at the time. Therefore, Vecta analyzed the shear data for anisotropy within the Bakken formation and successfully reentered an abandoned producer within the project area and drilled a horizontal leg through the anomalous zones of the middle member of the Bakken formation. The well was open hole completed, swab tested, sand fraced, and swab tested some more. No shows of oil were ever seen from the Bakken formation, but the well yielded considerable amounts of formation water. The well has been abandoned as non-commercial. From the swab tests, one may conclude considerable permeability exists in the formation, thus confirming {{the utility of the}} shear wave to detect fractures within the targeted formation...|$|E
