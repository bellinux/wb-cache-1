5|$|<b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> (born Archibald Alec Leach; January 18, 1904– November 29, 1986) was a British-American actor, {{known as}} one of classic Hollywood's {{definitive}} leading men. He began a career in Hollywood in the early 1930s, and became known for his transatlantic accent, debonair demeanor, and light-hearted approach to acting and sense of comic timing. He became an American citizen in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Bristol is {{the birthplace}} of 18th-century poets Robert Southey and Thomas Chatterton. Southey (born on Wine Street in 1774) and his friend, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, married the Fricker sisters from the city. William Wordsworth spent time in Bristol, where Joseph Cottle {{published}} Lyrical Ballads in 1798. Actor <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> was born in Bristol and comedians from the city include Justin Lee Collins, Lee Evans, Lloyd Langford, Russell Howard and writer-comedian Stephen Merchant.|$|E
5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was Kiss Them for Me. He was {{personally}} asked by <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> to direct and began developing it while still under contract at MGM. With a plot that strongly resembles On the Town, the film features Grant, Ray Walston and Larry Blyden as three navy officers on leave in San Francisco in 1944. Unlike On the Town, Kiss Them for Me {{is a dark}} comedy that contrasts the officers' selfless heroism with their self-absorbed hedonism while on leave. The film was released in 1957 to mostly poor reviews.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the appeal}} was the cars, I'm {{a bit of a}} buff... And I said– jokingly, of course– that I wouldn't be in The 39 Steps unless the action {{included}} the famous chase scene in which Hannay is pursued by a biplane. I've always wanted to be chased by a plane like <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> in the movie North by Northwest and I was just delighted when it happened in our version of Steps.|$|E
5|$|Grandon Productions {{produced}} Donen's next film: The Grass Is Greener, released through Universal Pictures in 1960. <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> and Deborah Kerr {{play the}} earl and countess {{of a large}} estate in England who are forced to permit guided tours of their mansion {{in order to help}} their financial problems. Robert Mitchum plays an American oil tycoon who falls in love with Kerr and Jean Simmons plays an eccentric American heiress who is Grant's former girlfriend. The film was a financial disappointment in the US, but successful in England where the original stage version had been a West End hit.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Hawks made Red River, an epic western {{reminiscent}} of Mutiny on the Bounty starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift {{in his first}} film. Later that year, Hawks remade his earlier film Ball of Fire as A Song Is Born, this time starring Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo. This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular jazz music and includes such jazz legends as Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> in the screwball comedy I Was a Male War Bride, also starring Ann Sheridan.|$|E
50|$|The song {{is covered}} by <b>Cary</b> <b>Grants</b> character, Roger Thornhill, {{whistling}} in the shower, in Alfred Hitchcocks film North by Northwest.|$|R

5|$|In 1962, Hawks made Hatari!, {{again with}} John Wayne, {{who plays a}} big-game hunter in Africa. In 1964, Hawks made his final comedy, Man's Favorite Sport?, {{starring}} Rock Hudson (since <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> felt {{he was too old}} for the role) and Paula Prentiss. Hawks then returned to his childhood passion for car races with Red Line 7000 in 1965, featuring a young James Caan in his first leading role. Hawks's final two films were both Western remakes of Rio Bravo starring John Wayne. In 1966, Hawks directed El Dorado, starring Wayne, Robert Mitchum and Caan, which was released the following year. He then made Rio Lobo, with Wayne in 1970.|$|E
5|$|The Foehls knew {{many in the}} Hollywood film industry, and {{a number}} of film stars stayed at the hotel. In late December 1957, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood celebrated their wedding {{reception}} at the hotel. Bette Davis, Roy Rogers, Bing Crosby, Frankie Avalon, Humphrey Bogart, Betty Grable, Janet Leigh, Marilyn Monroe, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Ingrid Bergman, <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant,</b> and Tony Curtis were known to have stayed there. Sometimes late at night, Jimmy Durante would come down from his room to play the piano in the lounge for other sleepless guests. The Foehls ran the hotel very closely—they lived on the premises.|$|E
5|$|Among {{her most}} famous roles were Anna Leonowens {{in the film}} version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I (1956); and {{opposite}} <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> as his shipboard romantic interest Terri McKay in the bittersweet love story An Affair to Remember (1957). She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, The Grass Is Greener (1960), and then joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, Marriage on the Rocks (1965). In 1966, the producers of Carry On Screaming! offered her a fee comparable to that paid {{to the rest of the}} cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of Flowers for Algernon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story of}} Notorious {{is the old}} {{conflict}} between love and duty. <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant's</b> job—and it's rather an ironic situation—is to push Ingrid Bergman into Claude Rains's bed. One can hardly blame him for seeming bitter throughout the story, whereas Claude Rains is a rather appealing figure, both because his confidence is being betrayed and because his love for Ingrid Bergman is probably deeper than <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant's.</b> All of these elements of psychological drama have been woven into the spy story.|$|R

5|$|Given {{the choice}} of her next feature, Hepburn decided to star in George Cukor's new project, Sylvia Scarlett (1935), which paired {{her for the first}} time with <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant.</b> Her hair was cut short for the part, as her {{character}} masquerades as a boy for much of the film. Critics disliked Sylvia Scarlett and it was unpopular with the public. She next played Mary Stuart in John Ford's Mary of Scotland (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception. A Woman Rebels (1936) followed, a Victorian era drama where Hepburn's character defied convention by having a child out of wedlock. Quality Street (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.|$|E
5|$|Hawks' friend Howard Hughes finally {{suggested}} <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> for the role. Grant {{had just}} finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The Awful Truth, and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film. Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving. Grant was initially concerned {{about being able to}} play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. Grant met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{has long}} been celebrated for its series of musicals {{starring}} Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors Katharine Hepburn and, later, Robert Mitchum had their first major successes at the studio. <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> was a mainstay for years. The work of producer Val Lewton's low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as film noir have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced {{two of the most}} famous films in motion picture history: King Kong and Citizen Kane. RKO was also known for being the distributor to a significant portion of Walt Disney's animated feature films, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 to Peter Pan in 1953.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1972 interview, Arthur remarked of her {{reaction}} to her co-star on Only Angels Have Wings, [...] "I loved sinking my head into <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant's</b> chest".|$|R
5000|$|Saks {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant's</b> last film, the comedy Walk, Don't Run. [...] At {{the time of}} its release, Time said his dialogue on that film [...] "bristles amiably from first to last." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{lives in}} <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant’s</b> old Los Angeles neighborhood, {{in a house}} built in 1919, with his wife of 35 years Shelly (Michelle) Clark, once a member of The Ikettes {{and member of the}} R&B group Honey Cone.|$|R
5|$|The Cal Neva {{was sold}} in 1975 {{alongside}} the Crystal Bay Club to BKJ Corporation, who consisted of Everett Brunzell, Charles Ketchum and Norman Jenson. The two clubs were purchased {{for a total of}} $9 million. But their licensing application for Cal Neva was turned down by the Nevada Gaming Commission due to a their lack of ongoing finances. The First National Bank of Nevada foreclosed on the property in early 1976 before selling it to Kirk Kerkorian, a significant shareholder in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He owned the Cal Neva through his Tracinda Investment Corporation, a different entity than the one through which he owns his MGM shares. As part of the re-launch of the lodge, he convinced Dean Martin to return for a performance, for which <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> was also in attendance.|$|E
5|$|The {{likeness}} of the Captain Scarlet character has, {{since his first}} appearance, been attributed to Francis Matthews, who voiced Scarlet in the series, <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> and Roger Moore. Ed Bishop later claimed that Captain Blue had been modelled on his likeness, but sculptor Terry Curtis states that he made the puppet to resemble himself and simply added a blond wig when he learnt that Bishop was to voice Blue. Curtis, a James Bond fan, based the appearance of Captain Grey on Sean Connery and Destiny Angel on Ursula Andress, Connery's co-star in the 1962 Bond film Dr No. Meanwhile, the character of Lieutenant Green was sculpted on its voice actor, Cy Grant; Rhapsody Angel on model and actress Jean Shrimpton; Melody Angel on singer and actress Eartha Kitt; and Harmony Angel on actress Tsai Chin.|$|E
5|$|While {{continuing}} with a slower work-rate, Lombard {{decided to move}} away from comedies and return to dramatic roles. She appeared in a second David O. Selznick production, Made for Each Other (1939), which paired her with James Stewart to play a couple facing domestic difficulties. Reviews for the film were highly positive, and praised Lombard's dramatic effort; financially, it was a disappointment. Lombard's next appearance came opposite <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> in the John Cromwell romance In Name Only (1939), a credit she personally negotiated with RKO Radio Pictures upon hearing of the script and Grant's involvement. The role mirrored her recent experiences, as she played a woman in love with a married man whose wife refuses to divorce. She was paid $150,000 for the film, continuing her status as one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, and it was a moderate success.|$|E
50|$|Megève is the {{ski resort}} in the {{beginning}} of the 1963 film Charade, where Audrey Hepburn's Regina Lampert meets <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant's</b> character. It is also the title of one of the tracks by composer Henry Mancini on the film's soundtrack.|$|R
50|$|Roth {{lived in}} Whitestone, Queens, {{in the early}} 1970s. He is a devotee of Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest; he {{is alleged to have}} {{revisited}} the various locations shown in the film, e.g., Mount Rushmore and <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant's</b> famous cornfield sequence.|$|R
5000|$|Carter {{also did}} many Lux Radio Theater programs, {{from the age}} of eleven, {{including}} playing <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant's</b> daughter in the radio adaptation of Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. She also [...] "had a disc jockey show on KFWB for a while." ...|$|R
5|$|While {{producers}} Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant</b> for the role, they discarded {{the idea}} as Grant would {{be committed to}} only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who {{could be part of}} a series. Richard Johnson has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave. Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was Patrick McGoohan on the strength of his portrayal of spy John Drake in the television series Danger Man: McGoohan turned down the role. Another potential Bond included David Niven, who would later play the character in the 1967 parody Casino Royale.|$|E
5|$|Hepburn's next feature, Stage Door (1937), paired {{her with}} Ginger Rogers in {{a role that}} {{mirrored}} her own life—that of a wealthy society girl {{trying to make it}} as an actress. Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which gave her top billing over Rogers. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but it was not the box-office hit RKO had hoped for. Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio continued its commitment to resurrecting her popularity. She was cast in Howard Hawks' screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby (1938), where she played a flighty heiress who loses a leopard while trying to woo a palaeontologist (<b>Cary</b> <b>Grant).</b> She approached the physical comedy of the film with confidence, and took tips on comedic timing from her costar Walter Catlett. Bringing Up Baby was acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box office. With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers' rejection of Hepburn.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Hitchcock transitioned to Hollywood productions, {{the first}} of which was the {{psychological}} thriller Rebecca starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. He received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director, and the film won Best Picture. Hitchcock worked with Fontaine again the following year on the film Suspicion which also starred <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant.</b> In 1943 Hitchcock directed another psychological thriller Shadow of a Doubt which starred Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten. Three years later he reunited with Grant on Notorious which also starred Ingrid Bergman. The film included a three-minute intermittent kissing scene between the leads shot specifically to skirt the Motion Picture Production Code which at the time limited such scenes to three seconds. In 1948 Hitchcock directed Rope which starred James Stewart. The film was his first in Technicolor and is remembered for its use of long takes to make the film appear to be a single continuous shot. Three years later he directed Strangers on a Train (1951).|$|E
50|$|This is the Night is <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant's</b> {{feature film}} debut. He disliked his role, believing {{that a man}} {{accepting}} the unfaithfulness of his wife so calmly was unbelievable. After seeing the film, he decided to quit the movie industry; his friend Orry-Kelly talked him out of it.|$|R
50|$|The film's investigative {{trial has}} {{parallels}} {{to the congressional}} hearings by anti-communist crusaders. And just as some refused to name names in such hearings, <b>Cary</b> <b>Grant's</b> lead character declines to clear his own name by revealing the private business of another person, {{in this case a}} convicted murderer.|$|R
