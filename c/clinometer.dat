5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a <b>clinometer.</b>|$|E

30|$|For {{measurement}} of roll error motion of a slide {{table in a}} precision linear slide during its manufacturing process, a new measurement method using a pair of <b>clinometers</b> has been proposed, and its feasibility has been verified in experiments. At first, the sensitivities of the <b>clinometers</b> have been calibrated by using the precision air spindle having a precision rotary encoder. The linearity error of each sensor has been verified to be within 0.001 °. The differential output of the two <b>clinometers</b> has also been calibrated, and the output {{difference between the two}} <b>clinometers</b> has been verified to be within 0.0015 °. Finally, the roll error motion of the slide table has been evaluated by using the proposed method. By taking the differential of the sensor outputs, the roll error motion of the slide has successfully been measured, while eliminating the influence of the external disturbances.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{measurement}} of the roll error motion of a slide table in a precision linear slide. The proposed method utilizes a pair of <b>clinometers</b> in the production process of a precision linear slide, where the roll error motion measurement {{will be carried out}} repeatedly to confirm whether the surface form errors of slide guideways in the linear slide are sufficiently corrected by hand scraping process. In the proposed method, one of the <b>clinometers</b> is mounted on the slide table, while the other is placed on a vibration isolation table, on which the precision linear slide is mounted, so that influences of external disturbances can be cancelled. An experimental setup is built on a vibration isolation table, and some experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.|$|R
2500|$|Originally {{fitted with}} rocking bar open sights {{including}} a deflection scale and a strip elevation, by 1914 the number seven dial sight in carrier number seven dial sight number {{one had been}} introduced. [...] This carrier was reciprocating (i.e. it could be cross-levelled), it had an integral elevation scale drum and a mounting for the sight <b>clinometer</b> (used for the angle of sight). [...] The number seven dial sight was {{a modified version of}} the German Goertz panoramic sight. The only changes to the ordnance, creating the Mark II in 1917, had a reduced twist in the rifling (from 1:15 to 1:20) and changes to correct design defects in the breech to reduce the effect of firing stresses.|$|E
2500|$|Of great {{significance}} to those pioneers working toward powered flight, Hargrave successfully lifted {{himself off the}} ground under a train of four of his box kites at Stanwell Park Beach on 12 November 1894. Aided by James Swain, the caretaker at his property, the kite line was moored via a spring balance to two sandbags (see image). Hargrave carried an anemometer and <b>clinometer</b> aloft to measure windspeed and {{the angle of the}} kite line. He rose 16 feet in a wind speed of 21mph. This experiment was widely reported and established the box kite as a stable aerial platform. Hargrave claimed that [...] "The particular steps gained are the demonstration that an extremely simple apparatus can be made, carried about, and flown by one man; and that a safe means of making an ascent with a flying machine, of trying the same without any risk of accident, and descending, is now at the service of any experimenter who wishes to use it." [...] This was seen by Abbott Lawrence Rotch of the meteorological observatory at Harvard University who constructed a kite from the particulars in Engineering. A modification was adopted by the weather bureau of the United States and the use of box-kites for meteorological observations became widespread. The principle was applied to gliders, and in October 1906 Alberto Santos-Dumont used the box-kite principle in his aeroplane to make his first flight. Until 1909 the box-kite aeroplane was the usual type in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|In mid June Darwin {{returned}} home to Shrewsbury, and continued [...] "working like a tiger" [...] for the Canary scheme, [...] "at present Spanish & Geology, the former I find as intensely stupid, as the latter most interesting". By then his most likely companion on the trip was the tutor Marmaduke Ramsay. Darwin was [...] "trying to make a map" [...] of Shropshire, [...] "but dont find it so easy as I expected." [...] He ordered a <b>clinometer,</b> and on 11 July wrote to tell Henslow that it had arrived and he had tried it out in his bedroom.

[...] In efforts to learn the basics of geology he extended his mapping of strata {{as far away as}} Llanymynech, some [...] from Shrewsbury, using the terminology he had learnt in Edinburgh from Robert Jameson. Already he was anxious that he had not heard from Sedgwick, and when he investigated ship sailings he found that they were only available in certain months. For this reason, the trip to Teneriffe had to be postponed to the following June, and it looked increasingly unlikely that Henslow would come on the trip. Darwin wrote to one of his student friends that he was [...] "at present mad about Geology" [...] and had plans to ride through Wales then meet with other students at Barmouth.|$|E
50|$|Accurately {{measuring}} the statistical properties of leaf angle distributions {{is not a}} trivial matter, especially for small leaves. <b>Clinometers</b> can be used but may be rather bulky or inconvenient.

50|$|Artillery uses angular {{measurement}} in gun laying, the azimuth between {{the gun and}} its target many kilometres away and the elevation angle of the barrel. This means that artillery uses mils to graduate indirect fire azimuth sights (called dial sights or panoramic telescopes), their associated instruments (directors or aiming circles), their elevation sights (<b>clinometers</b> or quadrants), together with their manual plotting devices, firing tables and fire control computers.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{indirect}} fire {{dates from the}} late 19th century. In 1882, Russian Lt Col KG Guk, published Field Artillery Fire from Covered Positions that described a better method of indirect laying (instead of aiming points {{in line with the}} target). In essence, this was the geometry of using angles to aiming points that could be in any direction relative to the target. The problem was the lack of an azimuth instrument to enable it; <b>clinometers</b> for elevation already existed.|$|R
60|$|Carefully noting, by {{the aid of}} his {{compass and}} <b>clinometer,</b> at every point which he visited, the {{direction}} and amount of inclination of the parallel divisions in these rocks, he was led to a very important generalisation-- namely, that over very wide areas the direction (strike) of the planes of cleavage in slates, and of foliation in schists and gneisses, remained constant, though the amount of their inclination (dip) often varied within wide limits. Further than this it appeared that {{there was always a}} close correspondence between the strike of the cleavage and foliation and the direction of the great axes along which elevation had taken place in the district.|$|E

50|$|A {{few years}} later, the Richtfläche (lining-plane) sight {{was invented in}} Germany and {{provided}} a means of indirect laying in azimuth, complementing the <b>clinometers</b> for indirect laying in elevation which already existed. Despite conservative opposition within the German army, indirect fire was adopted as doctrine by the 1890s. In the early 1900s, Goertz in Germany developed an optical sight for azimuth laying. It quickly replaced the lining-plane; in English, it became the 'Dial Sight' (UK) or 'Panoramic Telescope' (US).|$|R

Combined {{with machine guns}} equipped with <b>clinometers</b> that could deliver plunging fire or indirect fire at more than 3000 m, spitzer bullets greatly increased the lethality of the battlefield during World War I. Before, during and after World War I some militaries adopted aerodynamically more refined spitzer boat tail bullet designs with improved maximum ranges of 4115 to 5500 m, though plunging fire or indirect fire methods were not as commonly used by machine gunners during World War II as they were during World War I.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{calibrating}} sights, {{there was}} no significant difference in field artillery laying arrangements for most of the 20th century. However, in the 1990s new or modified guns started adopting digital sights, following their successful use in the multi-launch rocket system developed in the 1970s. In these the azimuth and elevation were entered manually or automatically into a layers computer, then guided the layer's use of horizontal and elevation controls until the barrel was in the required horizontal and vertical alignment. This computed a correction for the cross level of the gun and used feedback from electro-mechanical devices, such as gyroscopes and electronic <b>clinometers,</b> aligned to the axis of the bore. These devices were subsequently replaced by ring laser gyros.|$|R
