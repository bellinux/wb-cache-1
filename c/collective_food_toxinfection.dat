40|$|Abstract. The <b>collective</b> <b>food</b> {{service sector}} is {{composed}} of companies responsible for meal supply to defined clients such as industrial companies, hospitals, public and private organisations. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study of how the contracts between a food service company and its contractors are negotiated, designed and managed. The analytical framework applied is based on transaction cost and contract theories, and outsourcing. During contract negotiation and design, the company makes great efforts ex ante to ensure that the contract does not “congeal the relationship”. The results show that uncertainty regarding the economic environment is the main cause of renegotiation. Opportunism is specifically constrained by additional clauses. The average duration of the contracts is eight years, which indicates a high level of stability in the relationships contracted. These findings demonstrate the importance of the analysis of the ex ante costs when drafting contracts, which in effect minimise the ex post costs...|$|R
40|$|For {{collective}} {{decisions to}} be made, the information acquired by experienced individuals about resources' location {{has to be}} shared with naïve individuals through recruitment. Here, we investigate the properties of collective responses arising from a leader-based recruitment and a self-organized communication by chemical trails. We develop a generalized model based on biological data drawn from Tetramorium caespitum ant species of which collective foraging relies on the coupling of group leading and trail recruitment. We show that for leader-based recruitment, small groups of recruits have to be guided in a very efficient way to allow a <b>collective</b> exploitation of <b>food</b> while large group requires less attention from their leader. In the case of self-organized recruitment through a chemical trail, a critical value of trail amount has to be laid per forager in order to launch <b>collective</b> <b>food</b> exploitation. Thereafter, ants can maintain collective foraging by emitting signal intensity below this threshold. Finally, we demonstrate how the coupling of both recruitment mechanisms may benefit to collectively foraging species. These theoretical results are then compared with experimental data from recruitment by T. caespitum ant colonies performing group-mass recruitment towards a single food source. We evidence the key role of leaders as initiators and catalysts of recruitment before this leader-based process is overtaken by self-organised communication through trails. This model brings new insights {{as well as a}} theoretical background to empirical studies about cooperative foraging in group-living species. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Meanwhile, the People’s Food System was {{becoming}} increasingly politicized and polarized. The various <b>food</b> <b>collectives</b> had been {{meeting in the}} system’s Common Operating Warehouse. The group of representatives meeting was called the “representative body” or RB. The members of the RB were torn between paying attention to <b>food</b> politics and <b>collective</b> <b>food</b> stores as a revolutionary act versus using {{the energy of the}} Food System to participate in the broader counterculture movement of the time. In addition, the adoption of a representative democracy was somewhat at odds with the collective/consensus process of many of the stores. Finally, the RB elected a Steering Committee to organize and facilitate its regular meetings. This committee in turn drafted a “Principles of Unity” statement to which member stores had to ascribe in order to they might retain their membership in the People's Food System. At this point, the workers of the Rainbow Grocery Collective opted to go it on their own, preferring to focus on the issue of food and food access as right livelihood. It turns out that this decision was a smart one. The Warehouse increasingly became embroiled in political infighting which took on a violent character when, as part of its political program, the Warehouse began actively recruiting recently-released prisoners for its workers. Unfortunately it recruited members of rival gangs, which engaged in a gunfight at the warehouse. The final blow to the Warehouse came in 1981 when a flood destroyed much of its stock.|$|R

40|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>food</b> buying groups, such as {{community}} supported agriculture or self-organised citizen groups for delivery of food baskets, have emerged {{throughout the world}} as an important niche innovation for promoting more sustainable agri-food systems. These initiatives seek to bring about societal change. They do so, however, not through protest or interest-based lobbying, but by organising a protected space for learning and experimentation with lifestyle changes for sustainable food consumption and production practices. In particular, they aim to promote social learning on a broad set of sustainability values, beyond a focus on “fresh and healthy food” only, which characterizes many of the individual consumer oriented local food chain initiatives. This paper analyses the governance features of such local food buying groups by comparing 104 groups in five cities in Belgium. We find that the social networking activities of these groups, {{as compared to the}} social enterprise activities, have led to establish specific governance mechanisms. Whereas the main focus of the social enterprise activities is the organisation of the food provisioning logistics, the focus of the social network activities is the sharing of resources with other sustainable food initiatives, dissemination of information and broader discussion on sustainability issues.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop and apply a {{framework}} to explore how moralities of consumption are constituted in and through markets. Using the case of ready-made foods, this paper argues moral economies are comprised through interactions between micro, meso and macro level processes in the form of instituted systems of provision, state regulation, <b>collective</b> <b>food</b> customs promoted though media, NGOs and lifestyle practitioners, and the everyday reflections of consumers. Building on a theoretical framework developed to understand the moral economy of work and employment (Bolton and Laaser, 2013), this paper explores how markets for ready-made food are incessantly negotiated in the context of moral ideas about cooking, femininity and individual responsibility. It focuses on ‘new’ market innovations of fresh ready-to-cook meal solutions and explores how these products are both a response to moralizing discourses about cooking ‘properly’, as well as an intervention into the market that offers opportunities for new moral identities to be performed. Using data gathered from interviews with food manufacturers and consumers, I advocate for a multi-layered perspective that captures the dynamic interplay between consumers, markets and moralities of consumption...|$|R

40|$|In its {{prescription}} of how {{food security}} among rural households can be attained and how {{problems such as}} AIDS can be addressed, the neoclassical utiliarian view envisions individual households making atomistic decisions {{in the use of}} their resources, goods, and services (entitlements). In exploring the effect of illness and death on household food security in rural Malawi amidst the AIDS epidemic, I find that the embeddedness view explains more convincingly how rural households secure their food supply and deal with illness and death. This view suggests that individual households' use of their entitlements indeed contributes to household food security and the fight against illness and death, but that such use is shaped by the entitlement system that embodies collective beliefs, rules, expectations, and obligations. Social and cultural relations between households, anchored in the entitlement system, enable households to share their entitlements through reciprocity and redistribution, thereby contributing to <b>collective</b> <b>food</b> security and diffusing the burden of illness and death across households. Rural Malawians are thus not isolated actors envisioned by the utilitarian view but social actors who constantly engage in negotiations with each other, sharing their entitlements, and thus collectively securing their food supply and diffusing burdens. Food security then gets compromised when burdens reach a threshold that fractures social and cultural ties thus disabling households from sharing entitlements. AIDS is a threat to food security in rural Malawi because of its potential to make the spread of illness and death burdens so extensive that households would be unable to share their entitlements. ...|$|R

The aim of this work was to evaluate the behavior of relevant foodborne and spoilage microbiota in Beira rice morcela (MB) and Monchique rice morcela (MM) in relation to the industrial processing and storage. In order to understand the behavior of foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium sporogenes) in Beira rice morcela paste, two trials were designed. In the first it was studied the effect of thermal process (72 °C in the thermal center), cooling rate (quick and slow) and storage temperature (4 and 15 °C) in the behavior Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Bacillus cereus, previously grown in normal media and under designated stress conditions (modified media supplemented with 1 % NaCl, 0, 75 mg/L NaNO 2 and 5 % of glycerol). With Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium sporogenes it was also studied the effect of high and low inoculum level. Enterococcus faecium was used in the same conditions to validate the thermal processing efficiency. The second trial, design as complementary to the first, it was evaluated the industrial process and recovery ability of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and E. coli O 157 :H 7 survive and outgrown in MM produced under the same conditions as it is in a local industry. Generally, it was observed that the heat treatment used in the industry is enough to ensure a reduction of 5 D in the population of non sporulated pathogens. The designated slow cooling rate (the more similar to that achieved in the industry) revealed to be more effective in the reduction of these pathogens. The sporulated pathogens tested revealed to have a poor ability to outgrowth in the morcela, probably due to the biological state of the spores when the heat treatment was applied. The spoilage microbiota of MM packaged in MAP 60 : 40 was monitored during 49 days of storage in refrigeration temperature and under temperature abuse (15 °C). LAB was the main v specific spoilage microorganism enumerated. Enterococcus spp. and coagulase negative Staphylococcus was also involved. Gram negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp.) associated to spoilage due to its catabolic activities and sensory negative impact decrease during the storage. Aiming to establishment the risk of growth of relevant foodborne pathogens in MB – a ready-to-eat product – a microbial challenge test was designed challenging of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., E. coli O 157 :H 7, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens. The challenge test was performed in morcela slices packaged (MAP 60 : 40, vacuum and aerobic) and stored at refrigeration temperature (4 °C) and under conditions of temperature abuse (15 °C) during 35 days. Independently of the storage conditions the outgrowth of Listeria monocytogenes occurred in the early period of storage, resulting in a hazardous product. The hazard associated to the other pathogens challenged was generally only significative if the samples were stored under temperature abuse. The spoilage microbiota of slices of Monchique morcela was very abundant and composed mainly by LAB, but also by Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp., that have important negative impact in the sensory characteristics of the product. The aerobic package was always the worst solution. Between vacuum and MAP, only slightly differences were observed Briefly, heat treated blood sausages are products potentially hazardous if highly accurate criteria are not applied to the control of processing and storage.
