Eighteen out of 26 positive horses were treated with a combination of ivermectin 18. 7 mg/g and praziquantel 140. 3 mg/g and resulted subsequently negative by coprology and nested PCR performed 2 weeks after treatment. All infected and untreated animals had a high ELISA test optical density indicating high infection intensity and associated risk of colic. However, high optical density values were also obtained in four horses post-treatment and in three horses that were negative on molecular and coprological analysis. The results of the present work indicate that the nested PCR assay represents a valid method for the specific molecular detection of A. perfoliata in faecal samples collected from naturally infected horses and may have advantages over coprological and serological approaches for diagnosing A. perfoliata infection.

However, this method is not effective during the acute phase of the disease and has poor sensitivity during the chronic phase. Serodiagnosis has become an excellent alternative to <b>coprological</b> <b>examination</b> in efforts to combat the effects of fascioliasis on human and animal health. Two novel recombinant Fasciola hepatica proteins, i. e., a ferritin (FhFtn- 1) and a tegu-ment-associated protein (FhTP 16. 5), were used as antigens to develop in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. The assays were optimized and validated using 152 serum samples from humans with a known infection status, includ-ing healthy subjects, patients with chronic fascioliasis, and patients with other parasitic diseases. The FhFtn- 1 ELISA was shown to be 96. 6 % sensitive and 95. 7 % specific; the respective parameters for the FhTP 16. 5 ELISA were 91. 4 % and 92. 4 %. The perfor-mances of the FhFtn- 1 and FhTP 16. 5 ELISAs were compared with that of an available commercial test (the DRG test) using a subset of serum samples.

In addition, the correct interpretation of the results of <b>coprological</b> <b>examinations</b> can prove to be a rather difficult exercise.Ascaris populations are strongly aggregated within the pig population with few pigs carrying the majority of the worms while most of the pigs carry few or even no adult worms at all. Because of this, a large number of pigs need to be investigated since there is a significant possibility to have false positive and false negative egg counts.False positives are the result of coprophagia and/or geophagia and their prevalence and magnitude depends on different management and housing factors. The number and range of false-positive A.suum egg counts in pigs can be considerable, but in general, EPG levels lower than 200 should be considered false-positives. However, for diagnosis on farm level, these false positive samples are not as important as the false negatives. False negative results are possible when only immature worms are present or when only worms of a single sex are present. Boes and colleagues [...] have shown that as much as 23% of the investigated pigs that harboured worms in their intestine did not excrete any eggs. Consequentially, prevalence studies that reveal many low A. suum egg counts in pigs should be interpreted with care. Furthermore, the number of adult worms, and therefore the EPG is not representative of the amount of migrating larvae the pig has been exposed to. Regardless of the dose regimen, the numbers of worms that end up in the small intestine is generally inconsistent and independent of the intake of infective stages. Moreover, there seems to exist an inverse relationship between the number of adults found in the intestine and the amount of eggs given during a single experimental infection dose.|$|R
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the species composition and prevalence of endoparasites of donkeys in Sululta and Gefersa districts of central Oromia from November 2008 to April 2009. For this purpose, a total of 417 faecal samples (209 from Sululta and 208 from Gefersa) were coprologically examined for nematode, cestode and trematode infections. In addition, 9 donkeys that died of various health problems or were euthanized for welfare reasons were necropsied and the parasites were recovered and identified. <b>Coprological</b> <b>examinations</b> showed prevalence of 99. 5 % strongyles, 53 % Parascaris equorum, 9. 8 % Fasciola species, 5. 7 % Gastrodiscus aegypticus and 2. 8 % Anoplocephala species. Significantly (p Parascaris equorum in young donkeys than in both adults and old donkeys. Furthermore, ovaculture revealed 100 % prevalence of strongyles, cyathostomins and Trichostrongylus axei, 73. 8 % Strongylus vulgaris, 42. 8 % Strongyloides westeri and 42. 8 % Dictyocaulus arnfieldi. Postmortem examination revealed the presence of ten different species of parasites. The overall worm counts ranged from 266 - 14112 with a mean of 1597 worms per donkey. All the postmortem examined donkeys were positive for one or more species of endoparasites. The results of the current study demonstrate that a wide range of parasites with high prevalence affect donkeys in Ethiopia...|$|R
40|$|Model-based geostatistics and Bayesian {{approaches}} are appropriate {{in the context}} of Veterinary Epidemiology when point data have been collected by valid study designs. The aim is to predict a continuous infection risk surface. Little work has been done on the use of predictive infection probabilities at farm unit level. In this paper we show how to use predictive infection probability and related uncertainty from a Bayesian kriging model to draw a informative samples from the 8794 geo-referenced sheep farms of the Campania region (southern Italy). Parasitological data come from a first cross-sectional survey carried out to study the spatial distribution of selected helminths in sheep farms. A grid sampling was performed to select the farms for <b>coprological</b> <b>examinations.</b> Faecal samples were collected for 121 sheep farms and the presence of 21 different helminths were investigated using the FLOTAC technique. The 21 responses are very different in terms of geographical distribution and prevalence of infection. The observed prevalence range is from 0. 83 % to 96. 69 %. The distributions of the posterior predictive probabilities for all the 21 parasites are very heterogeneous. We show how the results of the Bayesian kriging model can be used to plan a second wave survey. Several alternatives can be chosen depending on the purposes of the second survey: weight by posterior predictive probabilities, their uncertainty or combining both information. The proposed Bayesian kriging model is simple, and the proposed samping strategy represents a useful tool to address targeted infection control treatments and surbveillance campaigns. It is easily extendable to other fields of research...|$|R
