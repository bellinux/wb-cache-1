40|$|Contemporary {{medical imaging}} technologies, such as {{computed}} tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, play {{a pivotal role}} in medical diagnosis, allowing for a relatively fast and non-invasive examination of the human body. In the field of cancer surgery they allow for preoperative detection of tumorous tissue and aid the surgical planning. However, only recent developments in the imaging field have introduced the possibility for a real-time non-invasive intraoperative detection of tumorous tissue with sufficient margins for radical tumour resection. These imaging technologies are collectively called optical biopsy and besides providing the real-time visualisation of the tumorous tissue on a large scale, e. g. near-infrared fluorescence, they allow for an instant tumour detection and analysis on a small scale, e. g. differential pathlength spectroscopy, ultimately without the need for any pathological analysis. While the optical biopsy provides an answer to the tumour detection, its subsequent accurate resection, or mechanical biopsy, remains a challenge. This challenge is further aggravated with more demanding applications, such as minimally invasive surgery, as compared to open surgery, and accurate resection of organ exterior as compared to organ interior. Yet, as challenges are here to be solved, the aim of this work is to provide an answer to combining the optical and the mechanical biopsies in an accurate manner with the aim to perform safe minimally invasive resection of small tumours at organ and tissue surfaces. Furthermore, as minimally invasive surgical applications pose various spatial restrictions on tissue manipulation, the second objective of this work is to present a reliable joint construction for the envisioned tissue resection instrument, allowing it to attain a proper orientation to the tissue of interest. As the focus of this thesis is twofold, its chapters are grouped into two parts. The first part of this thesis treats the combination of the optical and the mechanical biopsies in a reliable and an effective manner, showing the development of a resection tip, the opto-mechanical biopsy harvester, for a minimally invasive surgical instrument (Chapters 2 - 4). The second part of this thesis addresses the issue of steerable joint constructions in the minimally invasive surgical instruments and their reliable controllability in order to provide both flexibility and stability for the accurate tumour detection and resection (Chapters 5 - 8). With the vision to devise the design of the opto-mechanical biopsy harvester, a review of the state-of-the-art minimally invasive surgical instruments capable of performing the optical and the mechanical biopsies successively and accurately was performed and it is presented in Chapter 2. In addition, the review outlines any and all the minimally invasive surgical devices housing an accessory channel, thus mechanically capable of integrating a fibre optic cable for optical biopsy. As the findings of the aforementioned literature review were rather limited, this gave an opportunity to conceive and develop a novel bio-inspired design of a frontally-acting opto-mechanical biopsy harvester. Its experimental design and prototype are presented in Chapter 3 together with feasibility tests proving the concept. While the instrument steerability was not yet incorporated, the experimental design was created with a great consideration of its ultimate functionality. Chapter 4 concludes {{the first part of this}} thesis with a follow-up optimisation of the biopsy harvester’s collapsible resection device, the crown-cutter, bio-inspired by the sea urchin’s chewing organ Aristotle’s lantern and shaped as a crown of numerous pointy teeth. The study researches the impact of tooth quantity and type of their bevel on the induced tissue deformation, penetration forces and proper tooth collapsibility. Similarly to the first part of this thesis, the second part begins with a review article in Chapter 5 of all the mechanical joint constructions used in the state-of-the-art steerable minimally invasive surgical instruments. By clear categorisation, the aim of this review is to help identify a reliably controllable steerable joint ensuring accurate operation of the envisioned instrument’s tip. The fundamental joint classification can also serve as a design aid for other developments in this field. With the vision to develop a stiff and reliably controllable joint for the envisioned biopsy instrument, a novel steerable laparoscopic instrument prototype DragonFlex was developed. As discussed in Chapter 6, its simple, repetitive and symmetrical design incorporates a rolling joint with a special tight cable guidance. Together they maximise the driving cable lifespan, equalise the forces in both cables and enable control of seven instrument degrees of freedom by only seven structural components. Not only is DragonFlex the world’s first almost entirely additive manufactured steerable laparoscopic instrument prototype, but it also sheds new light on the potential of additive manufacturing in the surgical field. The promisingly high bending stiffness of DragonFlex’s rolling joint is evaluated in Chapter 7, which provides an empirical evidence that this joint construction is indeed superior to the state of the art in this respect. As clarified, the insight into achieving high bending stiffness of cable-driven joint constructions lies in the principle of full actuation of each degree of freedom, as opposed to underactuation. In order to perfect DragonFlex’s already stiff rolling joint Chapter 8 illustrates a way to minimise the small degree of remaining <b>cable</b> <b>slack</b> in the original design. As opposed to the common design practice attempting to eliminate the <b>cable</b> <b>slack</b> by a cable tensioning mechanism, this chapter introduces a more fundamental solution applicable to rolling joints in general. On top of minimising the <b>cable</b> <b>slack,</b> this solution removes the need for a cable tensioning mechanism, hence simplifying the overall design and assembly even further. The thesis is concluded with a discussion section in Chapter 9 outlining the combination of the reliable steering and the accurate harvesting technology developed for the purpose of minimally invasive biopsy. This last chapter presents the envisioned design and the real-scale fully functional prototype of the steerable minimally invasive opto-mechanical biopsy harvester composed of a permanent and a disposable section. The fusion of all the presented insights and designs is addressed in a practical manner, especially with regard to the manufacturability and the proposed usage of the final envisioned instrument.

40|$|Many {{surgical}} robots as well {{as other}} devices like robotic hands and exoskeletons use cable-conduit pairs in pull-pull configuration to actuate the remote instruments. Cable-conduits provide a unique combination of dexterous yet simple and cost-effective design. However, cable compliance and friction between the cable and the conduit makes the system nonlinear and accounts for major losses in tension transmission across the cable. These nonlinearities have prevented wider adoption of cable-conduit actuation despite its potential of simple, dexterous and power dense designs. The objective of this research is to model and control the transmission characteristics in such cable-conduit actuated systems. ^ A continuous domain analytical model has been developed for the transmission characteristics in cable-conduit actuation, and has been discretized to simulate the cable motion. The simulations predict backlash, <b>cable</b> <b>slacking,</b> and other nonlinear behaviors well. The model has also been extended to MR compatible viscoelastic systems using polymeric cables. The simulations results are verified by experiments for both elastic (steel) cables and viscoelastic cables (nylon cables in PEEK tubing), on a setup emulating a typical surgical robot. ^ In surgical devices, traditional sensors like optical encoders cannot be used due to various size and safety constraints and the generally available alternatives have relatively lower sampling rate and accuracy. Therefore, while intermediate state (actuator position) feedback is present, output feedback is limited and the system controller has to be designed utilizing these different types of feedbacks. To fully utilize the available feedback, multi-loop control has been designed with actuator control in the inner loop and compensation of cable dynamics in the slower outer loop. The performance improvements have been presented for a Laprotek robot arm and a motorized gastroscope. ^ Finally, to demonstrate the true potential of cable-conduit actuation, a novel MRI compatible device has been designed and a prototype has been developed using polymeric cable-conduits. The device has been shown to have no image distortation or magnetic effects in MR room, while still avoiding the substantial additional complexity introduced in other MRI compatible counterparts. The device has also been shown to achieve good tracking performance under controller implementation. ...|$|R

Consistently coupled polynomial displacement fields are used to satisfy the membrane locking-free condition and the requirement of being able to recover the inextensible bending modes. Quintic transverse displacement interpolation functions are used to represent the bending deformation of the beam, while the axial and torsional displacement fields are derived by integration of the presumably linear membrane and torsional shear strain fields, which are coupled with the transverse displacement fields. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the superior accuracy and the high convergence rate of the newly developed curved beam element.

This paper addresses these difficulties by modeling the flexural damping of <b>slacking</b> wire <b>cables</b> using homogenized Rayleigh damping. By using the nonlinear finite element method and high-speed imaging technique, three aspects of the work were examined.

Third, the cable was modeled and analyzed using our newly developed nonlinear curved beam element with the Rayleigh damping.

Bending behavior {{can play an important}} role in modeling <b>slack</b> <b>cables</b> and in "critical" regions of flexible ropes, such as in the neighborhood of clamping devices.

In the present work, the critical conditions for the onset of inter-layer sliding are investigated by defining the limit domain for wire slipping (the domain of "admissible values" for the axial force of a generic wire, accounting also for the contribution due to bending of the strand). The special case of uniform bending of the strand is considered and a closed form expression of the limit domain is presented. The non-holonomic nature of the strand mechanical model developed in this work leads to a lacking of symmetry for the tangent stiffness matrix. In the paper it is proved that this condition can be de facto relaxed in practical applications and that an elastic potential function, relating the generalized stress and strain variables of the strand in bending, can be defined only under the limit kinematic hypotheses of "full stick-state" or of "full slip-state". The aforementioned results are used as the starting block from which the strand full mechanical behavior for coupled axial force and bending is derived. Knowledge in closed form of how the limit domain depends upon the strand construction parameters and current stress conditions paves the way to design optimization of the strand...|$|R

With a small [...] delay, {{for one or}} two improvements I had seen to be necessary last [...] night, the engine started, and since that time I do not think there [...] has been half an hour's stoppage. A rope to splice, a block to change, [...] a wheel to oil, an old rusted anchor to disengage from the cable which [...] brought it up, these have been our only obstructions. Sixty, seventy, [...] eighty, a hundred, a hundred and twenty revolutions at last, my little [...] engine tears away. The even black rope comes straight out of the blue [...] heaving water; passes slowly round an open-hearted, [...] good-tempered-looking pulley, five feet diameter; aft past a vicious [...] nipper, to bring all up should anything go wrong; through a gentle [...] guide; on to a huge bluff drum, who wraps him round his body and says, [...] 'Come you must,' as plain as drum can speak: the chattering pauls say, [...] 'I've got him, I've got him, he can't get back': whilst black <b>cable,</b> [...] much <b>slacker</b> and easier in mind and body, is taken by a slim V-pulley [...] and passed down into the huge hold, where half a dozen men put him [...] comfortably to bed after his exertion in rising from his long bath. In [...] good sooth, {{it is one of the}} strangest sights I know to see that black [...] fellow rising up so steadily in the midst of the blue sea. We are more [...] than half way to the place where we expect the fault; and already the [...] one wire, supposed previously to be quite bad near the African coast, [...] can be spoken through. I am very glad I am here, for my machines are [...] my own children, and I look on their little failings with a parent's [...] eye and lead them into the path of duty with gentleness and firmness. [...] I am naturally in good spirits, but keep very quiet, for misfortunes [...] may arise at any instant; moreover, to-morrow my paying-out apparatus [...] will be wanted should all go well, and that will be another nervous [...] operation. Fifteen miles are safely in; but no one knows better than I [...] do that nothing is done till all is done.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} of dynamics of elevator systems {{is important in}} addressing challenges {{in the design of}} elevators. This dissertation is dedicated to the methodologies and applications of the numerical {{simulation of}} the dynamics of elevator cable-car systems, pulley-cable systems, and traveling and compensation cables. A new spatial discretization and substructure method is developed to calculate the dynamic responses of one-dimensional systems, which consist of length-variant distributed-parameter components such as strings, rods, and beams, and lumped-parameter components such as point masses and rigid bodies. This methodology is used to study the longitudinal, transverse, and their coupled dynamics of moving elevator cable-car systems. There are complicated matching conditions between the cable and the car, which cannot be satisfied in traditional methods, but can be satisfied in the current method. Hence not only the displacements, but also the internal forces/moment, such as the axial force, the bending moment, and the shear force, which are related to the spatial derivatives of the longitudinal or transverse displacement, are accurately calculated. The longitudinal-transverse coupled vibrations of a moving cable-car system are also studied using this method, and the results are compared with those from the linear models. While the result from the linear model for the transverse vibration agrees well with that from the nonlinear coupled model, the axial force calculated from the linear model can significantly differ from that from the nonlinear model when the car approaches the top of the hoist way. It is found that a large slope in the transverse vibration can significantly increase the vibratory tension in the cable, and attenuate the safety of the system. These results can be explained by theoretical analysis and verified by the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. The methodology is also used in conjunction with a simple belt creep model to study the dynamics of pulley-cable systems. A nonlinear, planar model of a <b>slack</b> <b>cable</b> with bending stiffness and arbitrarily moving ends is developed, using the slope angle of the centroid line of the cable to describe the motion of the cable, and is applied to elevator traveling and compensation cables. It is found that a vertical motion of the car can introduce a horizontal vibration of a traveling or compensation cable. This model is more efficient than the finite element models as it uses a much smaller number of elements to reach the same accuracy. Moreover, based on the asymptotic analysis of this model, a computationally efficient, linear model is developed for calculating the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and dynamic responses of stationary elevator traveling and compensation cables. The linear cable model consists of two vertical cable segments connected by a half circular loop at the bottom. There is a good agreement between the predictions from the linear and nonlinear models and between the measured natural frequencies from a full-scale experiment and the corresponding calculated ones...|$|R
