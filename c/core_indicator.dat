40|$|ABSTRACT This {{paper has}} two main {{objective}}s. The first {{objective is to}} propose a new indicator of core inflation, which is obtained by idiosyncratic dynamics and cleaning month on month relative price fluctuations from overall price changes. We use a factor model with the subcomponents of CPI inflation to extract this new <b>core</b> <b>indicator.</b> The second objective is to evaluate the performance of this new indicator and two widely used core indicators for Turkey, H and I, by the help of four criteria designed to assess the informativeness and the predictive power of these series {{for the analysis of}} headline inflation. The results suggest that the new indicator, Fcore, is a good measure of core inflation and a useful tool for policy analysis. Moreover, the <b>core</b> <b>indicator</b> H is a more informative measure of core inflation compared to <b>core</b> <b>indicator</b> I. JEL E 31, E 58, C 1...|$|E

40|$|Context: Certain quality {{indicators}} are mandatory {{in the maintenance}} and improvement of quality in blood transfusion. Monitoring of such indicators should be done regularly and deficiencies are to be corrected for effective blood transfusion services. Aims: To study the usefulness of monitoring of the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) <b>core</b> <b>indicators</b> in blood transfusion and in the maintenance of hemovigilance. Settings and Design: Hemovigilance is a "quality process" to improve quality and increase the safety of blood transfusion.

40|$|The CLOSER {{project has}} been set to analyse the {{interfaces}} and interconnections between long distance transport networks and local/regional transport networks of all modes. The project is funded within the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission, under the topic TPT- 2008. 0. 0. 13 “New mobility/organisational schemes: interconnection between short and long-distance transport networks”. The goal of WP 3 of CLOSER {{is to establish a}} set of <b>core</b> <b>indicators</b> that reflect the most crucial issues connected to interfaces between short and long-distance transport networks, both for passenger and freight transport. This includes the creation of a structured representation of these interfaces, determination of <b>core</b> <b>indicators,</b> and the assessment of usability of the <b>core</b> <b>indicators.</b> CLOSER WP 3 has produced two deliverables, of which the current document is the second. The first deliverable “Interconnections between short and long-distance transport networks: Structure of interface and existing indicators” (Andersen et al., 2010) contained a review of existing indicators related to interfaces between long and short-distance freight and passenger transport.

The dominant interest of the consuming stakeholder (student) is effectiveness. The literature review and the research among Canadian colleges provide support for the concept that stakeholder satisfaction is a <b>core</b> <b>indicator</b> of institutional effectiveness and in public colleges students are the primary (customer) stakeholder. The proposed framework combines philosophy, policy and process where the expectation and satisfaction of the primary stakeholders are accommodated.

The paper also suggests an innovative approach for collecting more informative data {{that can be used}} to provide an accurate measure of the UNAIDS’s ‘multiple sexual partners ’ <b>core</b> <b>indicator.</b> Specifically, the paper addresses three major limitations associated with the indicator when it is measured with respondents ’ sexual behaviors. First, the indicator assumes that a person’s risk of contracting HIV/AIDS/STIs is merely a function of his/her own sexual behavior. Second, the indicator does not account for a partner’s sexual history, which is very important in assessing an individual’s risk level. Finally, the 12 -month period used to define a person’s risks can be misleading, especially because HIV/AIDS theoretically has a period of latency longer than a year. The paper concludes that, programmatically, improvements in data collection are a top priority for reducing the observed bias in the ‘multiple sexua...|$|E

40|$|More {{resources}} are being defined as critical, {{which can be}} attributed to the linear economy of ‘take, make and dispose’. An alternative is to implement the circular economy (CE) which could reduce several negative effects, among other things resource depletion. The aim of this thesis is to identify what current sustainability indicators are lacking to assess a resource with the CE concept. This is done by developing CE <b>core</b> <b>indicators,</b> which then are compared with sustainability indicators. The life cycle of rare earth elements (REE) is used as a case study to validate the CE <b>core</b> <b>indicators.</b> To achieve this literature studies and comparative analysis will be performed. Existing definitions and indicators of CE were studied to compile a complete set of <b>core</b> <b>indicators.</b> These compiled CE <b>core</b> <b>indicators</b> were then compared with adapted United Nation (UN) sustainability indicators. The UN indicators were chosen after analysing several different sustainability indicator system and their compatibility with the resource perspective. The main differences between the UN <b>indicators</b> and CE <b>core</b> <b>indicators</b> is that the UN indicators does not include economic aspects such as market diversity and social aspects such as consumption behaviour. However, the UN indicator system includes transportation and governance that could be beneficial to include into the CE concept. The economic viability to perform the CE analysis and non-existing CE indicators for companies and countries were identified as two barriers that could hinder development and efficient use of a CE indicator system. A way to increase the economic viability is to use already generated data for the CE indicator analysis, though the economical aspect has to be studied further. The non-existing CE indicators for companies and countries are counted as a barrier due to the risk of sub-optimisation of one resource. Additionally, the CE indicator results could be misinterpreted to blame a few for the problems of the resource instead of using the results to improve all parts of the life cycle. Further research is also needed to investigate how, or even if, social aspects such as culture and society could be indicated within a CE indicator system. In conclusion, the UN indicator system could be a good baseline to develop a CE indicator system for a resource though further research is needed. ...|$|R

The medium term inflation target of Reserve Bank of New Zealand is used as a guide to define our target measure of core inflation - a centered 2 year moving average of past and future inflation outcomes. We find that our indicator produces relatively good estimates of this characterisation of core inflation when compared with estimates derived from a range of other models.

The present study investigates the factors which influence women’s participation in self-employment. Primary source of data is used for empirical analysis. Logistic regression technique is employed to estimate the women self-employment model. The findings indicate that age and experience positively affects women’s self-employment. Further, it is concluded that education, location and number of dependents significantly reduce the women’s work participation as self-employed worker. It is suggested that the government provide technical and vocational education to the women, and also give old age benefits just to minimize the dependency burden. </p...|$|E

BackgroundThis article describes the changes in four <b>core</b> <b>indicator</b> variables: dialysis adequacy, hematocrit, serum albumin, and blood pressure in peritoneal dialysis CAPD and cycler patients over a three-year period. MethodsA national random sample of adult peritoneal dialysis patients in the United States was drawn each study period. Clinical data abstraction forms were completed by facility staff for patients selected for the sample, returned to the respective network, then forwarded to the Health Care Financing Administration for analysis. ResultsThe mean weekly Kt/V urea for CAPD patients increased from 1. 91 in 1995 to 2. 12 in 1997 (P < 0. 001) and for cycler patients, from 2. 12 in 1996 to 2. 24 in 1997 (P < 0. 05). The mean weekly creatinine clearance for CAPD patients increased from 61. 48 liter/week/ 1. 73 m 2 in 1995 to 65. 84 liter/week/ 1. 73 m 2 in 1997 (P < 0. 05). For cycler patients, it increased from 63. 37 liter/week/ 1. 73 m 2 in 1996 to 67. 45 liter/week/ 1. 73 m 2 in 1997 (P < 0. 05). Despite this increase in adequacy values, less than 40 % of peritoneal dialysis patients in 1997 had weekly Kt/V urea or creatinine clearance values that met subsequently published National Kidney Foundation's Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines. These {{data suggest that the}} dialysis prescription may not be adequately modified to compensate for increased body weight and for decreased residual renal function as years on dialysis increase. The average hematocrit value increased modestly in both CAPD and cycler patients from 1995 to 1997, and the number of patients with a hematocrit of less than 25 % decreased from 6 % in 1995 to 1. 4 % in 1997 (P < 0. 001). Both serum albumin values and systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were essentially unchanged during the three-year period of observation.

40|$|The history {{behind the}} {{evolution}} of the American postsecondary education has imitated the European system {{with the exception of the}} community college. The community college strives to meet the needs of all students with an enrollment open door policy. This study examined relationships between student demographics and the achievement of <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> by Ohio community colleges. The <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> measure technical skill attainment; credential, certificate, or degree achievement; student retention or transfer; student placement; and nontraditional participation and completion. Using archived data from 2007 - 2013 required by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, a linear mixed model analysis was performed discovering significant relationships between the <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> and other demographic factors such as, gender, race, students who meet the definition of students with disabilities, students who are economically disadvantaged, students who are displaced homemakers, students with limited English proficiency, and those students pursuing nontraditional careers for their gender. The linear mixed model was used due to the fixed effects of the student demographics, and the Ohio community colleges as random factors. The cohort years comprised the repeated measure. The results of the LMM indicated that the factor of gender was significant under two of the <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> with positive impact towards achieving the target goal by the community college. Race was found significant under all <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> with positive impact. Students meetings the definition of disabilities, displaced homemakers, and those students seeking nontraditional career paths each had significance under one <b>core</b> performance <b>indicator.</b> Students meeting the definition of economically disadvantaged were found significant under three different <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> with positive impact. Single parent status negatively impacted the achievement of the <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators.</b> Students with limited English proficiency were found to be significant twice under different <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators,</b> once with positive impact and once with negative impact. Understanding the relationships of the effects may enable Ohio community colleges to better use their limited resources based on the needs of the students attending each statewide location.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Information on the {{incidence}} and prevalence of diseases is a <b>core</b> <b>indicator</b> for public health. There {{are several ways}} to estimate morbidity in a population (e. g., surveys, healthcare registers). In this paper, we focus on one particular source: general practice based registers. Dutch general practice is a potentially valid source because nearly all non-institutionalized inhabitants are registered with a general practitioner (GP), and the GP fulfils the role as "gatekeeper". However, there are some unexplained differences among morbidity estimations calculated from the data of various general practice registration networks (GPRNs). OBJECTIVE: To describe and categorize factors that may explain the differences in morbidity rates from different GPRNs, and to provide an overview of these factors in Dutch GPRNs. RESULTS: Four categories of factors are distinguished: "healthcare system", "methodological characteristics", "general practitioner", and "patient". The overview of 11 Dutch GPRNs reveals considerable differences in factors. CONCLUSION: Differences in morbidity estimation depend on factors in the four categories. Most attention is dedicated to the factors in the "methodology characteristics" category, mainly because these factors can be directly influenced by the GPR...|$|E
40|$|Experience {{with the}} {{establishment}} of indicators for sustainable development shows that it is scientifically feasible, most useful for communication with the public and a necessary navigation instrument to establish measures pertaining to the sustainability process objective. Usually, long lists of indicators were established to describe the complexity of sustainable development. More recently, these rather technical lists have been reduced to sets of core indicators. This paper compares the shortlists for the USA, the UK and Sweden, and shows that six indicators (GDP, greenhouse gas emissions, crime rate, employment, education level and life expectancy) are used by each of them. In spite of limitations related to the way the indicators are measured and the phasing out of specific national priorities, these commonly used measures might provide a backbone for other countries to develop their <b>core</b> <b>indicator</b> lists.
