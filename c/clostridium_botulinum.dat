40|$|AbstractBotulism {{caused by}} {{neurotoxins}} of <b>Clostridium</b> (C.) <b>botulinum</b> is a rare, but serious life-threatening disease in humans and animals. Botulism in livestock is usually {{caused by the}} oral uptake of C. botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) via contaminated feed and is characterized by flaccid paralysis. In the recent past a new syndrome caused by BoNT in dairy cattle was postulated. It was supposed that C. botulinum is able to colonize the lower intestine and may subsequently produce neurotoxin. The continuous resorption of small amounts of these BoNT may then provoke the so called syndrome of “chronic” or “visceral” botulism involving unspecific clinical symptoms, reduced performance of dairy cows and massive animal losses in the affected herd. To test this hypothesis a case-control study was conducted involving 92 affected farms and 47 control farms located in Northern Germany. Fecal samples of 1388 animals were investigated {{for the presence of}} BoNT to verify the key requirement of the hypothesis of chronic botulism. BoNT was not detected in any of the fecal samples using the most sensitive standard method for BoNT detection, the mouse bioassay. Therefore, the existence of “chronic” or “visceral” botulism could not be proven...|$|R

Early research on BoNTs has led to their classification into seven serotypes (serotypes A to G) based upon the selective neutralization of their toxicity in mice by homologous antibodies. Recently, a report of a potential eighth serotype of BoNT, designated "type H," has been controversial. This novel BoNT was produced together with BoNT/B 2 in a dual-toxin-producing <b>Clostridium</b> 20 <b>botulinum</b> strain. The data used to designate this novel toxin as a new serotype were derived from culture supernatant containing both BoNT/B 2 and novel toxin and from sequence information, although data from two independent laboratories indicated neutralization by antibodies raised against BoNT/A 1, and classification as BoNT/FA was proposed.

40|$|International audience[Technical Session 7 – Food Processing Technologies]Introduction: The {{high demand}} for {{minimally}} processed food makes high pressure processing (HPP) {{one of the}} most promising non-thermal technologies for food application. While HPP efficiently inactivates vegetative bacteria, bacterial spores show strong resistance, especially at mild temperatures. To ensure spore inactivation in food matrices, the addition of other hurdle(s), such as mild heat or antimicrobial agents, is necessary. Purpose: HPP in combination with nisin was investigated as a non-thermal method for the inactivation of pathogenic and thermoresistant bacterial spores in food matrices. Methods: Six bacterial strains were studied with regard to the diversity of their origins and properties: Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus sporothermodurans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus weihenstephanensis, Bacillus subtilis and <b>Clostridium</b> sp. (<b>botulinum</b> type E-like). Spores were treated in a buffer, skim milk or a liquid medium simulating cooked ham. Pressure levels ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa were applied for 10 min at 20 °C or 50 °C. Nisin was added during and/or after HPP to a final concentrations of 50 or 20 UI/mL. Results: While no significant reduction of spore cultivability was observed at any pressure at 20 °C, the addition of nisin at low concentration (ten times lower than the legal concentration) during and after HPP treatment induced a highly synergistic effect on Bacillus spp. inactivation, with spore count below the detection limit (inactivation > 6 log/mL). Moreover, spores remained sensitive to nisin up to 6 h after HPP. Significance: The food industry usually pressurizes foods at room temperature, resulting in, only, inactivation of vegetative cells. The present work shows that combining HPP with nisin can lead to a synergistic Bacillus spp. spore inactivation, even after treatments at 20 °C. The addition of nisin in foods before their pressurization can, therefore, be an efficient way to ensure the inactivation of bacterial spores...|$|R

High pressure thermal (HPT) processing exploiting the synergistic effect of pressure and temperature {{can be used to}} inactivate bacterial endospores. We investigated the inactivation of C. botulinum type E spores by (near) isothermal HPT treatments at 300 – 1200 MPa at 30 – 75 °C for 1 s – 10 min. The occurrence of heat and lysozyme susceptible spore fractions after such treatments was determined. The experimental data were modeled to obtain kinetic parameters and represented graphically by isoeffect lines. In contrast to findings for spores of other species and within the range of treatment parameters applied, zones of spore stabilization (lower inactivation than heat treatments alone), large heat susceptible (HPT-induced germinated) or lysozyme-dependently germinable (damaged coat layer) spore fractions were not detected. Inactivation followed 1 st order kinetics. DPA release kinetics allowed for insights into possible inactivation mechanisms suggesting a (poorly effective) physiologic-like (similar to nutrient-induced) germination at ≤ 450 MPa/≤ 45 °C and non-physiological germination at > 500 MPa/> 60 – 70 °C. Results of this study support the existence of some commonalities in the HPT inactivation mechanism of C. botulinum type E spores and Bacillus spores although both organisms have significantly different HPT resistance properties. The information presented here contributes to closing the gap in knowledge regarding the HPT inactivation of spore formers relevant to food safety and may help industrial implementation of HPT processing. The markedly lower HPT resistance of C. botulinum type E spores than spores from other C. botulinum types, could allow for the implementation of milder processes without endangering food safety...|$|R

C. botulinum is an intoxication pathogen which can cause primarily foodborne diseases. The disease botulism leads in humans and animals to a symmetrical descending paralysis. Cause of these symptoms are the botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT), which are released into the body.

The standard method for the detection of active toxin is the mouse bioassay, which is very time-consuming and expensive and from animal issues is not always justifiable. The aim of this work was to develop fast and efficient detection methods for the bacteria using molecular and microbiological methods as well as an active toxin detection method in different food matrices. For this reason, various PCR methods were selected for the detection of toxin genes and a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established for the active toxin proof. The ELISA method was used for testing in different food matrices and also studies on the stability of BoNT with different food-relevant temperature-time relations and the stability of the toxins at storage temperatures.
