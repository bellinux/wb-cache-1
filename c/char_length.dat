30|$|The ASTM and UFAC {{tests are}} {{commonly}} used {{in the development and}} quality control assessment of barrier materials. For non-woven, highloft battings, quality control measures generally include the measurement of weight, thickness, uniformity, and a burn test (draft proposed TB 117 (10)). These tests are qualitative, with specific guidelines for assessing fire performance of the barrier materials. Since fire barrier materials are generally expected to be self-extinguishing, other test methods for such materials include measurements of the time of afterflame and afterglow and the extent of fire damage in terms of <b>char</b> <b>length,</b> hole size or weakened sample length.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPower cables {{are one of}} {{the major}} sources of fire in almost every type of {{industry}} including power plants. The present paper discusses an experimental setup fabricated to determine the burning characteristics of powered cables in a compartment of size 4 m × 4 m × 4 m. Power cables having outer layer of PVC and inner layer of insulation of cross linked polyethylene (XLPE) have been laid on a cable tray as per IEEE 383 and burned. An addition tray above the test tray at a distance of 27 cm has been fixed to determine the effect of burning of the lower tray on the upper tray. The measured parameters include heat release rate (HRR), mass loss rate, cable temperature, <b>char</b> <b>length</b> and afterburn time...|$|E
40|$|Laricio pine (Pinus nigra J. F. Arn. ssp. laricio (Poiret) Maire var Corsicana Hyl.) {{is a form}} {{of black}} pine endemic to Corsica, that may now be under threat due to current fire regimes and {{competition}} with maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton). This study aimed to compare postfire mortality in laricio and maritime pine in a mixed stand in northwest Corsica. Diameter at breast height, bark <b>char,</b> bole <b>length</b> <b>charred,</b> and tree mortality were measured in 661 trees 9 months after a severe fire. Logistic regressions were used to determine mortality probabilities which, to compare the two species, were expressed in relation to species, age, and species-independent severity indicators. For all ages considered, laricio pine mortality was up to threefold that of maritime pine. The differences between the species were most significant in pines less than 60 years old and exposed to severe conditions. This was mainly due to differences in growth rate between the two species. Considering life history traits, maritime pine appears to be better adapted than laricio pine to the risk of fire. As the frequency of major fires in Corsica is on the increase, constituting a real threat for endemic species, we provide a few management guidelines for conservation of the laricio pine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} biomass downdraft gasification process has been developed. The model {{was considered to be}} four modules that are drying, pyrolysis, oxidation, and reduction which the products of upper module will be the reactants of the next. The one-dimensional kinetic finite rate models were applied to drying and reduction modules. The pyrolysis model took place when drying temperature reached 473 K. The equilibrium sequence model was used to describe the oxidation process by considering the sequence of order of reaction rates. For the model validation the comparison showed a good agreement. In the parametric study the moisture content increasing affected the height of drying, and pyrolysis zones increasing while the critical <b>char</b> bed <b>length</b> of reduction zone decreased from 0. 53 to 0. 25 m. The height of these zones decreased along A/F increasing. The results of this study can be used in the reactor design evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Co-combustion of {{coal and}} natural gas is a {{promising}} technology {{in the production of}} active lime. For this technology, proper fuel proportion of coal {{and natural gas}} (α) {{is one of the key}} parameters that requires significant thought. By means of numerical simulation, contrast studies on co-combustion with five different fuel proportions were carried out. This paper firstly puts forward the models used to describe the system based on the actual conditions. Then, numerical simulation results were analysed in detail to illustrate the co-combustion process and the velocity and temperature distribution in the kiln. Finally, comparisons of high temperature region, <b>char</b> conversion, <b>length</b> of calcining zone, CO and NOx emission and total heat transfer rate to the material bed were made in order to make a decision on fuel proportion. Synthetically considering, α= 30 % is a balance between benefits and costs for the rotary lime kiln studied...|$|R
30|$|The fire {{performance}} of mattresses is regulated in the United States using {{two types of}} ignition source; smoldering and open flame ignition. The current U.S. mattress flammability standards that have the most significant impact on industry and the consumer are 16 CFR 1632 (16 CFR 1632 Standard for the flammability of mattresses and mattress pads [1991]) and 16 CFR 1633 (16 CFR 1633 [2007]). The two federal flammability regulatory standards (16 CFR 1632 and 16 CFR 1633) are mandatory, and all manufacturers must comply with {{them in order to}} sell residential mattresses in the U.S. (Table 1). The 16 CFR 1632 regulation, introduced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in 1973, defines the fire resistance of mattresses to cigarette ignition, a smoldering source. The smoldering ignition test measures the <b>char</b> <b>length</b> over the mattress surface and the extent of damage to the mattress after a specified time period (Table 1).|$|E
40|$|Flame {{retardant}} and antimicrobial functionalities were imparted in jute textile using {{sodium metasilicate}} nonahydrate (SMSN), {{commonly known as}} “water glass”. Sodium metasilicate nonahydrate (SMSN) was applied in jute fabric in different concentration by padding method followed by drying. Flame retardancy of the fabric was evaluated by Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) and burning behaviour under vertical flammability tester including the <b>char</b> <b>length.</b> Burning rate was found to decrease by almost 10 times after an application of 2 % SMSN compared to the control sample. Thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of both the control and treated jute fabrics were utilized to understand the mechanism of developed flame retardance in jute fabric. It was observed that the SMSN treated samples showed excellent antimicrobial property against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Antimicrobial properties of both the control and treated jute fabrics were also measured quantitatively...|$|E
30|$|A {{practical}} {{approach to}} enhancing the fire retardancy of wood-based materials by adding fire-retardant chemicals to the glue was developed. Plywoods were manufactured using urea melamine formaldehyde resin mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. Treated plywoods had better incombustibility than untreated ones. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis clearly demonstrated {{the distribution of}} boron and phosphorus, which had migrated from the glue to the wood, contributing to better fire retardant properties. The cross-sectional micrographs from scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated specimens exhibited a foamy structure near the interface in the glue layer and the deformed structure of wood cells. The cell structure and cell wall thickness retained intact in the specimens treated with urea melamine formaldehyde resin mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. When observing {{the effect of the}} thickness of overlay veneers on incombustibility, a shorter glowing time was obtained from the specimens with a thicker surface layer when the fire retardant chemical was added at 2 %, but the differences were smaller at the higher chemical retention of 4 %. A similar tendency was observed for the <b>char</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{method for}} classifying fire severity permits managers to predict fire effects with reasonable accuracy and thus assists them in prescription development. The classification described here {{consists of a}} two-dimensional matrix of flame length classes and depth of <b>char</b> classes. Flame <b>length</b> classes are derived from direct observations and reconstruction of the fire environment. Depth of char class is derived from postburn observations {{of the extent to}} which fuels were burned, particularly on the soil surface. The relationship between fire severity and vegetation response is useful in understanding postfire survival and recovery of vegetation...|$|R
30|$|These {{calculations}} assume approximately uniform <b>charring</b> {{over the}} <b>length</b> and circumference of a WD particle. There is likely substantial variation under field conditions. This variation is mostly {{an issue for}} large particles with greater surface area, while smaller particles tend to char rather uniformly. Tinker and Knight (2000) noted that most WD was either nearly completely charred or not charred at all following wildland fire, {{which is consistent with}} our observations. Such assumptions are essentially identical to longstanding (and imperfect) assumptions regarding decay state, particle shape, wood density, etc. (Van Wagner 1982), and are what make the approach easily incorporated into existing techniques. Another consideration is that the above calculations presume consistent char depth in wood regardless of particle diameter, based on our field measurements. If field measurements in a given study area suggest that this varies, the equations here could be easily amended to reflect this variability (e.g., with a function rather than a fixed depth).|$|R
40|$|Among-lake {{variation}} in mercury (Hg) concentrations in landlocked Arctic char was examined in 27 char populations from remote lakes across the Canadian Arctic. A total of 520 landlocked Arctic char {{were collected from}} 27 lakes, as well as sediments and surface water from a subset of lakes in 1999, 2002, and 2005 to 2007. Size, length, age, and trophic position (d 15 N) of individual char were determined and relationships with total Hg (THg) concentrations investigated, to identify a common covariate for adjustment using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). A subset of 216 char from 24 populations was used for spatial comparison, after length-adjustment. The influence of trophic position and food web length and abiotic characteristics such as location, geomorphology, lake area, catchment area, catchment-to-lake area ratio of the lakes on adjusted THg concentrations in char muscle tissue were then evaluated. Arctic char from Amituk Lake (Cornwallis Island) had the highest Hg concentrations (1. 31 µg/g wet wt), while Tessisoak Lake (Labrador, 0. 07 µg/g wet wt) had the lowest. Concentrations of THg were positively correlated with size, d 15 N, and age, respectively, in 88, 71, and 58 % of 24 <b>char</b> populations. <b>Length</b> and d 15 N were correlated in 67 % of 24 char populations. Food chain length did not explain the differences in length-adjusted THg concentrations in char. No relationships between adjusted THg concentrations in char and latitude or longitude were found, however, THg concentrations in char showed a positive correlation with catchment-to-lake area ratio. Furthermore, we conclude that inputs from the surrounding environment may influence THg concentrations, and will ultimately affect THg concentrations in char {{as a result of}} predicted climate-driven changes that may occur in Arctic lake watersheds...|$|R
40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{chemical}} and flame retardant (FR) treatment of woven flax fabric and preparation and characterization of flax reinforced phenolic composites. Sheets of flax fabric were subjected to chemical treatments using NaOH and silane coupling agents. A phosphate-based flame retardant (DAP) was applied to decrease the flammability of the flax fabric. The effect of the chemical treatments and FR treatments on the thermal and flammability properties of the fabric and composites was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vertical flame resistance test and cone calorimeter. The mechanical properties of the flax fabric and composites, before and after environmental ageing, were investigated. Ageing {{studies were carried out}} by exposing the samples in an environmental chamber at specified conditions for two weeks. TGA results showed that the treatment of the fabric with FR shifts the decomposition temperature to lower level and increases the char residue. Vertical flame resistance testing showed that FR treatment of the flax fabric improved the flammability properties. There was no after flame and afterglow observed for FR treated flax fabric due to self-extinguishment after removal of the flame. Flax Fabric without FR burned completely and there was no result for the <b>char</b> <b>length</b> due to the complete destruction of the fabric. The FR treatment, however, seemed to have had a negative effect on the tensile strength of the flax fabric. This was further intensified upon exposure of FR treated flax fabric to high temperatures during ageing studies which drastically reduced the tensile strength by more than 90 %, and the flax fabric were found to be brittle and darker in visual appearance. TGA results of flax/phenolic composites showed that for composites containing chemically treated and FR treated flax fabric the decomposition temperatures shifted to lower temperatures; however {{there was no significant difference}} in the amount of char residue. Untreated flax/phenolic composites exhibited the lowest char residue. Cone calorimeter results showed that the peak heat release rate (PHRR), smoke production rate (SPR) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission rate was reduced for the flax/phenolic composite produced using FR treated flax fabric. The tensile strength of these composites was reduced while there was an increase in modulus value. Exposure of the FR treated composites to high temperatures further reduced the tensile strength and increased the E-modulus. Both FR treated and untreated composites changed in colour and the FR treated composites were found to be brittle after exposure to high temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{grains of}} the {{following}} present-day cereal forms were charred: Secale cereale, Triticum aestivum var. compactum, var. vulgare and Avena sativa. For each caryopsis before and after <b>charring</b> width, thickness, <b>length</b> and weight were determined. The charring caused the increase of the coefficient of variation {{in the majority of}} cases, but proportionally to variation of the characters of the uncharred grains. The second group of anaylsed material were the grains of the present and fossil cereals. In the material six features of grain morphology were investigated. For present and fossil cereals the matrices of simple correlation were calculated. By means of analysis of multiple regression the interdependence of grain weight and its dimensions was investigated. The introduction into the equation of regression of successive independent variable (grain dimensions) causes a progressive exhaustion of the total variability of the regressand (grain weight). The weight of grain is equally a representative trait as well as its dimensions. This feature may serve for comparative studies of populations of fossil grain of the very same species originating from various periods or sites. This type of analysis may illustrate the influence of selection on the size of grain...|$|R
40|$|Summary of Chapter I: 1. We use Samuel's {{theory of}} {{multiplicity}} {{to describe the}} structure of (f) /T [cal Af {{in terms of the}} multiplicity e((f) /T cal Af) and the dimension of the instability locus (this dimension is also the Krull dimension of (f) /T cal Af). 2. We extend the theory of trivial unfoldings of map-germs to the theory of k-trivial unfoldings of k-jets. 3. We develop a method for obtaining normal forms for the (k+ 1) -jets having a given k-jet f by inspection of certain submodules of T cal Af. We give a test for sufficiency of a normal form and a method for constructing a (k+ 1) -trivial unfolding of the normal form. 4. We show that if f is weighted homogeneous and the Krull dimension and multiplicity of (f) /T cal Af are both 1 then f is a weak stem and we can find an integer k and a complete list of normal forms for finitely determined map-germs whose k-jet is f. The list has many similarities with the series found by Arnold and Mond. Summary of Chapter II: We extend Mond's classification of map-germs f:(cal C^ 2,O) (cal C^ 3 ?O) under cal A-equivalence. This chapter also demonstrates the use of the classification theory developed in I. 2 and provides a large number of examples for use {{in the rest of the}} thesis. Summary of Chapter III: 1. We prove that f is a geometric stem if and only if is irreducible and the localised module ((f) /T cal Af) has <b>length</b> <b>char</b> 61 1 (localise with respect to the prime ideal defining). 2. We also prove that if has transversal type A_ 2 n or A_ 2 n+ 1 for some n 1 then char 61 n. This makes it easier to determine n if has transversal type of A_ 2 n or A_ 2 n+ 1 since we shall calculate anyway. 3. If f is a stem we show that is irreducible and give a list of transversal types that may have (although having one of these transversal types does not necessarily indicate that f is a stem). 4. We look at how the numbers C, T and (D_ 2 (f) /cal Z_ 2) behave for the families of map-germs associated with some weak stems. We observe that for a given family (f+p_s) the integer C(f+p_s) +T(f+p_s) +(D 2 (f+ps) /cal Z 2) -cod(cal A,f+ps) appears to be a constant. Appendices A and B contain supplementary calculations. Appendix C is a description of the computer programs written to calculate the modules used in classifying the map-germs of Chapter II...|$|R
40|$|So-called 2 ̆ 7 gogi 2 ̆ 7 (Fig. 1), Salvelinus leucomaenis (Pallas), is a {{non-migratory}} <b>char</b> attaining a <b>length</b> of 30 cm or {{less and}} {{occurs in the}} most upper reaches in the rivers in San-in and Sanyo districts of western Honshu. Because gogi-char has many pale spots on the head unlike other members of this genus and has slightly fewer gill rakers, this fish was described at first {{under the name of}} S. imbrius by Jordan and McGregor (1925). The present author, however, is considering it as one of the local races of S. leucomaenis, for the differences of meristic counts between gogi-char and S. leucomaenis from other districts are not so conspicuous (Table 2). Field o bservations on the spawning behavior and early life history of this char were made in Misaka-dani of Takatsu River system and Haza River of Sufu River system (Fig. 2 A, B, C) both in Shimane Prefecture, mainly in 1962, 1971 and 1974. Spawning season of gogi-char extends from late October to middle November, when the water temperature goes down to 11 ～ 8 °C. The spawning acts by a single female and several males are usually seen in the pool-side (Fig. 5 A, B, C), where the current is very slow or slight counter flow is noticed. In the male group, the hierarchy is recognized according to their body sizes and the largest one succeeds in mating with the female. This male usually darts and drives subordinate males away if they attempt to approach his partner,however, in early period of prespawning he is occasionally turned out from the spawning redd by counterattacks of a smaller male (Fig. 8 B). The female defends her spawning site from other females and digs the bottom. As the female repeats digging action (Fig. 9 A) at the same point at an interval of 1 to 3 minutes, a saucer-shaped depression is gradually formed, in which she takes a feeling or crouch posture (Fig. 10 A, B) after each digging action. These postures cause courtship by attended males (Fig. 10 C, D), especially by the largest one. The prespawning acts by a pair used to continue for half a day or more. The oviposition (Fig. 11 A, B, C) occurs in the center of finished depression and 20 to 100 eggs are shed into the crevices of gravel in it (Fig. 12 A, Table 3). Immeadiately after this, the mated male attacks his partner suddenly (Fig. 11 D). The female not only remains on her redd withstanding his attacks, but she makes violent counterattacks against him (Fig. 11 E). Thus, a series of fierce fight follows about 15 minutes. Soon after, the female starts undulating by swinging her body laterally (Fig. 12 B, C). After a quarter hour of this undulating, the males leave the redd and the female begins to dig the bottom at an area of about 20 cm upstream the eggs. The eggs in the depression are thus filled up gradually with the fine sand and gravel which are stirred up with postspawning digging actions of the female. Such postspawning acts generally continue for 2 to 5 hours. But sometimes, in several hours after the first oviposition the males appear again near the female who is making another depression slightly upstream site from the previous one and they repeat the same acts {{as they did in the}} first prespawning period. The next oviposition is usually seen in 20 to 30 hours after the first. Two or 3 days are necessary for 2 times of oviposition. The eyed eggs of gogi-char we r e obtained on December 15, 1962 from a spawning redd in Inkyo-no-tani, a tributary of Haza River (Fig. 2 C). These eggs were measured 5. 1 to 5. 4 mm in diameter and began to hatch on December 19. The newly hatched alevins (Fig, 13 A) preserving in 70...|$|R
