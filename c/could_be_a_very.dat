The Germans {{felt that it}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> useful crossing point for tanks, and only 35 Dutch soldiers defended it. As the Germans advanced to the bridge, they were briefly held off by the Dutch defenders. A few German soldiers were killed. However, the Dutch soon fell back because of overwhelming numbers. As the Germans began to cross the bridge, the charges were planted and the bridge fell into the river. After all of the bridges over the Maas River were destroyed, the only task that remained was to hold off the Germans {{as long as they}} could.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{technical}} barrier {{in the production}} and use of FDCA {{is the development of}} an effective and selective dehydration process from sugars. The control of sugar dehydration <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> powerful technology, leading {{to a wide range of}} additional, inexpensive building blocks, but it is not yet well understood. Currently, dehydration processes using hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as intermediate are generally non-selective, unless, immediately upon their formation, the unstable intermediate products can be transformed into more stable materials such as methoxymethylfurfural (MMF). Necessary R will include development of selective dehydration systems and catalysts. FDCA formation will require development of cost effective and industrially viable oxidation technology that can operate in concert with the necessary dehydration processes.|$|E
500|$|Chris Willman from Entertainment Weekly {{noted the}} lack of {{traditional}} Aguilera styles on the new songs, stating: [...] "The singer has banished melisma and belting from these electronic confections, and her chops sound just as hot set on simmer." [...] Writing for Sputnikmusic, Nick Butler positively reviewed Aguilera's new material, saying: [...] "Christina the pop singer is dead, long live Electro Christina [...] At any rate, these four tracks are {{more than enough to}} build anticipation for what <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> very good album." [...] In a mixed review, an editor from Rolling Stone said that the album's [...] "ten stellar singles are weighed down by four bland attempts at 2008's trendy, Lady Gaga-jacking electropop." ...|$|E

500|$|Joy Division {{made their}} {{recorded}} debut in June 1978 when the band self-released An Ideal for Living, {{and two weeks}} later a track of theirs, [...] "At a Later Date", was featured on the compilation album [...] (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it [...] "has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors—there {{are a lot of}} good ideas here, and they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> interesting band by now, seven months on". The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band [...] "to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are".|$|E

2500|$|Expanding into {{international}} markets could increase NASCAR's popularity and allow foreign sponsors and manufactures {{to get involved}} in the sport. [...] Some think this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> positive move for NASCAR, which has seen its television ratings drop 21 percent between 2005 and 2007. During the same 2-year period, NASCAR also saw the greatest drop in tickets prices observed in over a decade. In 2010, NASCAR saw television ratings drop 10% from the year before, which was down 33% off its peak in 2005. Some think that an increase in international diversity would translate into growth and generate greater opportunities for NASCAR fans.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1646, Pascal's 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age {{and the state of}} {{medicine}} in the 17th century, a broken hip <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal [...] "would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again..." [...] But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become household guests.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that in late November 2012, Kat's lover would [...] "turn stalker", with Inside Soap saying that [...] "there {{is no way that}} the mystery man is letting her get away so easily [...] That's proved when he ups his game to get Kat to meet with him at their lovenest". An insider told the magazine that Kat's man is [...] "persistent, ruthless and utterly fixated on her. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> dangerous game for Kat to play. Might the man who loves her completely destroy her life?" [...] It was also reported in November that Derek would be killed off from the series at Christmas, and it was speculated that he would be murdered. Alfie and Kat were both named as suspects, amongst many others, with Soaplife saying that if Derek is Kat's lover, he might turn violent if she continues to reject him and she might be forced to kill him, or Alfie might find out that Derek is Kat's lover and murder him in revenge, referring back to Richie's reminders that Alfie had been in jail and would want to harm Kat's lover. In fact, Alfie quickly became the favourite with bookmakers William Hill.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, {{prior to}} 1737 the {{economic}} motivations for dramatists were vast. A playwright received the house take {{of the third}} night of a play. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large amount of money, {{and it would be}} renewed with each season (depending upon arrangements). Thus, John Gay grew wealthy with The Beggar's Opera. In 1726, Leonard Welsted's indifferent success, The Dissembled Woman, was acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields. It netted him £138 for the author's benefit but only £30 for the printing rights. [...] After the Licensing Act closed off hopes for serious authors on the stage, the novel was the next logical path. In particular, Samuel Richardson's Clarissa was published in serial form and made the author a substantial amount of money from subscriptions. The novel became a potentially lucrative form of publishing, and booksellers began to pay more for novels as novels began to sell more. [...] From being a form of exigency, the novel became a form of choice after the stage was shut down by the Licensing Act. [...] Therefore, the Licensing Act had the unintended effect of increasing rather than decreasing the power of dissenting authors, as it put a stop to anti-Walpolean sentiments and anti-ministry arguments on the stage (which could only reach audience members in London) and sent these messages instead to the novel form, where they would remain in print, pass from hand to hand, and spread throughout the kingdom.|$|E

60|$|I was at your lecture[73] this afternoon, and I hope I may {{venture to}} tell you that I was {{extremely}} pleased and interested. Both the matter of the materials and the manner of their arrangement were quite admirable, and a modesty and complete absence of any kind of affectation pervaded the whole discourse, which was quite an example to the many whom it concerns. If you <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> little louder, and would never let a sentence go for the thousandth part of an instant until the last word is out, you would find the audience more responsive.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Samuel Dockwrath was {{a little}} man, with sandy hair, a pale face, and stone-blue eyes. In judging of him by {{appearance}} only and not by the ear, one would be inclined to doubt that he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> sharp attorney abroad and a very persistent tyrant at home. But when Mr. Dockwrath began to talk, one's respect for him began to grow. He talked well and to the point, and with a tone of voice that could command where command was possible, persuade where persuasion was required, mystify when mystification was needed, and express with accuracy the tone of an obedient humble servant when servility {{was thought to be}} expedient. We will now accompany him on his little tour into Yorkshire.|$|E

60|$|Christie {{would rather}} have been left in peace; but fancying {{that he did it}} out of {{kindness}} to her, and that she had done him injustice before, she was grateful now, and exerted herself to seem so; in which endeavor she succeeded so well that Mr. Fletcher proved he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> agreeable companion when he chose. He talked well; and Christie was a good listener. Soon interest conquered her reserve, and she ventured to ask a question, make a criticism, or express an opinion in her own simple way. Unconsciously she piqued the curiosity of the man; for, though he knew many lovely, wise, and witty women, he had never chanced to meet with one like this before; and novelty was the desire of his life. Of course he did not find moonlight, music, and agreeable chat as delightful as she did; but there was something animating in the fresh face opposite, something flattering in the eager interest she showed, and something most attractive in the glimpses unconsciously given him of a nature genuine in its womanly sincerity and strength. Something about this girl seemed to appeal to the old self, so long neglected that he thought it dead. He could not analyze the feeling, but was conscious of a desire to seem better than he was as he looked into those honest eyes; to talk well, that he might bring that frank smile to the lips that grew either sad or scornful when he tried worldly gossip or bitter satire; and to prove himself a man under all the elegance and polish of the gentleman.|$|E
