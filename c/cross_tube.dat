5|$|Charing Cross {{railway station}} (also known as London Charing Cross) {{is a central}} London railway {{terminus}} between the Strand and Hungerford Bridge in the City of Westminster. It is the terminus of the South Eastern main line to Dover via Ashford. All trains are operated by Southeastern, which provides the majority of commuter and regional services to south-east London and Kent. It is connected to Charing <b>Cross</b> <b>tube</b> station on the London Underground, and is near to Embankment tube station and Embankment Pier.|$|E
5|$|London Underground's Charing <b>Cross</b> <b>tube</b> {{station on}} the Northern and Bakerloo lines has an exit in the square. The lines had {{separate}} stations, of which the Bakerloo line one was called Trafalgar Square until they were linked and renamed in 1979 {{as part of the}} construction of the Jubilee line, which was rerouted to Westminster tube station in 1999. Other nearby tube stations are Embankment connecting the District, Circle, Northern and Bakerloo lines, and Leicester Square on the Northern and Piccadilly lines.|$|E
5|$|Originally Embankment tube {{station was}} called Charing Cross, while the present Charing <b>Cross</b> <b>tube</b> station was Trafalgar Square (Bakerloo line) and Strand (Northern line) {{stations}}. The two stations combined {{under the new}} name when connected {{by the development of}} the Jubilee line and an extensive new subway system, and resolved generations of confusion by renaming the tube station to match the mainline station it connected to. The works opened on 1 May 1979. The Jubilee line platforms were closed on 20 November 1999, following the extension of the Jubilee line where it was diverted to Westminster and onwards south of the River Thames.|$|E

A vertical inside <b>tube</b> <b>crossing</b> the opening {{is attached to}} the scaffold by a transom and a <b>crossing</b> horizontal <b>tube</b> on the outside called a bridle tube. The gaps between the tubes and the structure surfaces are packed or wedged with timber sections to ensure a solid fit.|$|R
5|$|Covent Garden {{is served}} by the Piccadilly line at Covent Garden tube station {{on the corner of}} Long Acre and James Street. The station was {{designed}} by Leslie Green and opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway on 11 April 1907, four months after services {{on the rest of the}} line began operating on 15 December 1906. The station is one of the few stations in Central London for which platform access is only by lift or stairs. Until improvements in 2007, due to high passenger numbers (16 million annually), entry to the station was sometimes restricted on busy days to reduce congestion on the platforms. The distance from Covent Garden to Leicester Square at less than 300yards is London's shortest tube journey. Stations just outside the area include the Charing <b>Cross</b> <b>tube</b> station and Charing Cross railway station, Embankment tube station, Leicester Square tube station, and Holborn tube station. While there is only one bus route in Covent Garden itself—the RV1, which uses Catherine Street as a terminus, just to the east of Covent Garden square—there are over 30 routes which pass close by, mostly on the Strand or Kingsway.|$|E
25|$|In addition, two of {{the four}} accused 2005 7/7 suicide bombers, Muhammad Sidique Khan, {{responsible}} for the Edgware Road blast that killed 6 people, and Jamaican-born Briton Germaine Lindsay, responsible for the blast that killed 26 people at King's <b>Cross</b> <b>tube</b> station, were followers of El-Faisal. In an interview with the BBC in June 2008, he admitted knowing Germaine Lindsay but insisted he had not radicalized him.|$|E
2500|$|The Hanriot 1909 {{monoplane}} had an uncovered [...] rectangular-section wire-braced wooden fuselage with deeply cambered parallel-chord wings. The {{main undercarriage}} {{consisted of a}} pair of skids which carried a pair of independently sprung wheels mounted on a steel <b>cross</b> <b>tube,</b> the skids being carried on two pairs of struts which converged inwards, the aft pair being continued above the fuselage to form an inverted V cabane to which the wing bracing and warping wires were attached. The front struts terminated at the engine bearers, which were midway between the upper and lower longerons. Tail surfaces consisted of a tailplane and elevator mounted on top of the fuselage and a fixed fin mounted under the fuselage with the attached rudder underneath the horizontal tail surfaces. The aircraft was controlled with a pair of handwheels {{on either side of the}} cockpit operating wing warping and elevator, and foot-pedals operating the rudder.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H also {{features}} a synchronized elevator on the tail boom, which {{is linked to the}} cyclic control and allows a wider center of gravity range. The standard fuel system consists of five interconnected fuel tanks, three of which are mounted behind the transmission and two of which are under the cabin floor. The landing gear consists of two arched <b>cross</b> <b>tubes</b> joining the skid tubes. The skids have replaceable sacrificial skid shoes to prevent wear of the skid tubes themselves. Skis and inflatable floats may be fitted.|$|R

40|$|A {{complete}} surface reconstruction {{takes place}} after a local connection between two <b>crossed</b> <b>tubes</b> is established, {{leading to the}} creation of an extended X-shaped junction constituted by topological defects with smooth negative curvature. Molecular-dynamics simulations show that the surface reconstructions occur through (1) generalized Stone-Wales transformation and (2) the movement of sp and sp(3) atoms and their transformation to sp(2) atoms by bond rearrangement. Based on both the principle of energy minimization and a generalized Euler's rule, it is demonstrated that the most stable structure for X junctions contains only 12 heptagons. The annealing temperature influences the topological structure and stability of junctions. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

Five metrics to characterize the performance of these tubes are described. The metrics address the spatio-temporal utilization, frequency and angles at which aircraft <b>cross</b> <b>tubes,</b> along with separation of aircraft with and without tubes. All of the designs were incorporated in a common simulation platform for evaluation.

40|$|Ultra-thin single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} can be welded by heating to form molecular multi-terminal junctions at elevated temperatures without initially introducing {{structural defects}} such as vacancies and interstitials. This was demonstrated by classical molecular dynamics simulations with an empirical Brenner II potential and quantum mechanics calculation with PM 3. The dynamic formation pathway of the junctions between crossed nanotube pairs was simulated. Junctions were established by forming intertube sp³-related covalent bonds and breaking of bonds in original nanotubes. The final configuration of junctions {{depends on the}} chirality of the <b>crossed</b> <b>tube</b> pairs and reaction temperature.
