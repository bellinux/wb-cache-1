50|$|It is very {{important}} to have a detailed plan of <b>conducting</b> the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> in an organization (Lee, 2004, Eason, 1988). The most important thing about time planning for a parallel conversion is not to rush things and not be afraid of possible delays in the actual conversion phase. (Lee, 2004). It can be very beneficial also to work with clearly defined milestones (Rooijmans, 2003), similar to the PRINCE2 method. More information on time planning can be found in Planning and Strategic planning.|$|R

EVALS was used as templating agent for 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) water suspension and vapor phase (VPP) polymerization. The obtained conductive systems were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, conductivity measurements, scansion electron (SEM) and optical microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A kind of seam {{tracking}} system for laser-MIG hybrid welding {{has been designed}} to overcome the defects of existing laser-MIG hybrid welding equipments. Laser vision technology based on image processing has been studied. Line/arc fitting algorithm was applied to data construction for seam. Simulation tracking of seam was conducted by the helping of interpolation algorithm. Welding experiment was <b>conducted</b> with this <b>new</b> <b>system.</b> The results show that the clear skeleton of structured light can be get by image filtering and image refining. Fitting accuracy of line/arc fitting is within acceptable limit. Tracking accuracy of simulation tracking based on line interpolation and arc interpolation is high. Appearance of welding seam is well...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach in}} customer management {{is the reason}} why the inefficiency of customer management occurred, as well as the increase of promotion cost and the distance in relationship between the existing customers and the organization. By looking at the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) approach, the customer management can be increased and can reduce the distance relationship between the customers and the organization. Therefore, the purpose of learning CRM approach is to understand in details about CRM, provide the better services, facilitate the maintenance of existing customers in corresponding with the increasing the number of new customers. Based on the research <b>conducted,</b> one <b>new</b> <b>system</b> will be developed for the purpose of creating an electronic-based application system. This system will emphasize on customer profiling. From this system, the selling and marketing operations {{can be used to make}} a customer profile. This system will be developed using object-oriented approach and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) as the core programming language as well as MySQL as the database. This system will be implemented online using Apache Web Server...|$|R
50|$|Voting {{during the}} three shows was <b>conducted</b> under a <b>new</b> <b>system</b> that {{involved}} each country now awarding two sets of points from 1-8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting. Each nation's jury consisted of five music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury judged each entry based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury was permitted to be related {{in any way to}} any of the competing acts {{in such a way that}} they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member as well as the nation's televoting results were released shortly after the grand final.|$|R
40|$|Regulation of lawyer {{conduct in}} the State of Nebraska. Upon the Nebraska Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{adoption}} of the Nebraska Rules of Professional Conduct (2 ̆ 2 Nebraska Rules 2 ̆ 2) through its ruling on In re Petition of the Nebraska State Bar Association to Adopt Rules of Professional Conduct Governing Attorneys, the state shed its distinct position as one of only six jurisdictions not yet utilizing some form of the ABA Model Rules of Professional <b>Conduct.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>system</b> represents the first complete revision of the professional ethical standards to which Nebraska lawyers are held accountable since the {{adoption of the}} Code of Professional Responsibility (2 ̆ 2 Nebraska Code 2 ̆ 2), and embodies a few key departures from the former standards in both substance and structure. While it took the Nebraska Supreme Court more than sixteen months of open consideration and analysis to formulate and formally adopt the new rules once the initiative was raised by the Nebraska State Bar Association, their impact upon practicing lawyers within the state will be immediate and substantial with respect to many of the new provisions. Lawyers familiar with the Nebraska Code will recognize many of the substantive provisions of the former system, which have been carried forward to the Nebraska Rules relatively untouched. There are, however, substantive and structural changes reflected in the new rules which will require the attention of those practicing within this jurisdiction in order to maintain continued compliance with the ethical considerations inherent in the practice of law. What follows is a topical analysis of some of the key substantive changes reflected in the new rules, as well as an introduction to the organizational structure utilized in the <b>new</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|A novel {{absorption}} {{refrigeration system}} is proposed {{in this context}} using R 134 a+R 23 mixed refrigerants and DMF solvent. The <b>new</b> <b>system</b> uses two-staged absorber in series to reduce the evaporation pressure and can obtain a lower refrigeration temperature by the low-grade thermal energy. From thermodynamic analysis, the key factors are discussed on the performances of the <b>new</b> <b>system.</b> Under the same working conditions, comparisons on the performances are also <b>conducted</b> between the <b>new</b> one and an auto-cascade absorption refrigeration system with single-absorber. Experiments are conducted to investigate the key effecting factors on the performances of the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> and a single-absorber auto-cascade absorption refrigeration system. The experimental {{results show that the}} <b>new</b> <b>system</b> can achieve a lower refrigeration temperature under the same working condition. The lowest refrigeration temperature of the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> reaches to - 62. 3 ℃ with a COP of 0. 023 under a generation temperature of 184. 4 ℃, condensing temperature of 18. 8 ℃, and absorption temperatures of 26. 4 ℃ at the low-pressure absorber, and 28. 5 ℃ at the high-pressure absorber...|$|R
