25|$|Cranns: Cranns (or <b>crans)</b> are {{ornaments}} {{borrowed from}} the Uilleann piping tradition. They are similar to rolls except that only cuts are used, not taps or strikes. On the tin whistle they are generally only used for notes where a roll is impossible, such as the lowest note of the instrument.|$|E
25|$|In April 2006 {{the deaths}} of four {{teenagers}} at Pine Bush High School in two separate accidents along the stretch of 302 between Roberson Avenue and <b>Crans</b> Mill Road just north of Bullville led the school district to ask the state Department of Transportation {{to do something about}} what residents considered a deadly stretch of highway. Since all seven of the district's schools are either on or close to the highway, its officials fear that a school bus could be involved in the next fatal accident.|$|E
25|$|In the Dutch fishery, a {{last was}} a {{measurement}} of the fish loaded into {{the various types of}} fishing boat in use (e.g. a bomschuit, buis, sloep or logger). The last of these could take 35 to 40 last of fish, the exact amount depending on the location. In the South Holland fishing villages of Scheveningen and Katwijk, it amounted to 17 <b>crans</b> (kantjes) of herring; in Vlaardingen 14 packed tons. A cran (kantje) held about 900 to 1,000 herring. In Flanders a last was about 1,000kg of herring. The term fell out of use when the herring fishery disappeared.|$|E

Patience, joined by Angel and a massive river woman named Sken, eventually meets Ruin and Reck, twin brother and sister geblings who are together the king of the geblings. All their lives, Ruin and Reck had been repelled from <b>Cranning</b> by the Unwyrm, but the <b>Cranning</b> Call surrounding Patience cancels the repulsion and allows them to travel with her. Will, the silent but strong human who had lived as Reck's slave, joins their party.|$|R
50|$|In 1875, the {{partnership}} with Nixon and Croft, {{the manager of}} Yerra Yerra, was dissolved and Tooth left for England, leaving <b>Cran</b> in charge. Tooth began a new refinery, also called Yengarie, in the Philippines in his own name. The Tooth and <b>Cran</b> partnership was dissolved in 1879 and Robert <b>Cran</b> and Company ran Yengarie. In 1880 <b>Cran</b> {{spent some time in}} Europe arranging for machinery for a new refinery he planned to build in Bundaberg. This was opened in 1883 as Millaquin and <b>Cran</b> provided land at Yengarie for a short branch line and siding to connect the complex to the state railway. In 1885 there were 40 mills and 5 distilleries along the Mary River, although production and sugar prices began to fall. In 1889 <b>Cran</b> and Company opened a crushing mill at Doolbi to provide juice to Yengarie, thereby supporting the development of cane growing in the Isis area.|$|R

40|$|To improve low-latency {{computing}} {{and communication}} services, {{a new type}} of mobile edge computing architecture named multi-layer cloud radio access network (Multi-layer <b>CRAN)</b> is designed in this paper. In Multi-layer <b>CRAN,</b> a high-level edge cloud is deployed next to base band unit pool to handle the computing tasks of user equipment (UE) in centralized way. Meanwhile, a low-level edge cloud is deployed in each remote radio head (RRH) to locally handle UEs’ computing tasks in a distributed way. Based upon Multi-layer <b>CRAN,</b> a cooperative communication and computation resource allocation (3 C-RA) algorithm is further designed for lower service latency and energy cost, and higher network throughput in this paper. 3 C-RA utilizes a distributed RRH cell coloring algorithm to enable each RRH to work out the resource allocation in an efficient and distributed way. 3 C-RA employs a proportional fairness-based approach to allocate communication and computation resource in each RRH cell. A series of simulations on Multi-layer <b>CRAN</b> with 3 C-RA were carried out. The simulation results validate that Multi-layer <b>CRAN</b> is more capable of providing low-latency computing and communication services, and 3 C-RA enables Multi-layer <b>CRAN</b> to have lower service latency and energy cost and higher network throughput...|$|R

40|$|Building on {{scholarship}} from {{folklore and}} literature, everyday autobiography, women's traditional culture, and women's garden history, this thesis examines how Marion <b>Cran</b> documented home and garden experiences in Surrey and Kent {{through a series}} of gardening books she wrote between 1913 and 1941. [...] While providing useful information on plants and gardening practices, Cran's writing was fragmented and tangential: her books were filled with planting references suffused with culinary tips and recipes and traditional lore that evoked meaning and "encoded memories" (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1989). Although <b>Cran</b> was fascinated by garden styles indicative of the period, such as the English cottage garden, she also valued individuality in garden making, and implored her readers to create gardens that fulfilled their own expectations. [...] In her everyday autobiographies, <b>Cran</b> revealed her innermost thoughts based on her own experiences and what she learned through her observations of and interactions with fellow gardeners and homemakers. <b>Cran</b> inspired a predominantly female audience to create and maintain homes and gardens that benefited their own lives {{as well as those of}} their families and members of their communities. In direct correlation, women corresponded with <b>Cran,</b> confiding to her their own home and garden experiences whether they lived in England or South Africa. While exploring Cran's appeal to women readers, this thesis focuses on several themes: community and fellowship in gardening practices, implicit coding, female performativity, and women's sense of empowerment through creating a home and garden. [...] This thesis examines not only how <b>Cran</b> and her books inspired gardeners and homemakers' lives during the interwar period, but also, it recognizes her relevance to contemporary readers and present-day gardeners. Not unlike many gardeners today, <b>Cran</b> was committed to natural gardening practices and growing her own produce. <b>Cran</b> can be found not only between the pages of her books, but through the existence of her former home and garden, "Coggers," in Kent. By preserving Coggers and welcoming visitors, the current residents have fostered a growing community of readers and gardeners whose enthusiasm in <b>Cran</b> and her writings will continue her legacy for future generations. Marion <b>Cran</b> and her garden literature offer folklorists an alternative resource through which to understand and appreciate how women expressed themselves creatively through common, everyday tasks in homes and gardens of the early twentieth century...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{distributed}} power allocation is considered for the downlink of a cloud radio access network (<b>CRAN)</b> that is coexisting with a heterogeneous network. In this multi-tier system, the heterogeneous network base stations (BSs) {{as well as the}} <b>CRAN</b> remote radio heads seek to choose their optimal power to maximize their users' rates. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game in which the players are the <b>CRAN's</b> cloud and the BSs. Given the difference of capabilities between the <b>CRAN</b> and the various BSs, the game is cast within the framework of cognitive hierarchy theory. In this framework, players are organized in a hierarchy {{in such a way that}} a player can choose its strategy while considering players of only similar or lower hierarchies. Using such a hierarchical design, one can reduce the interference caused by the <b>CRAN</b> and high-powered base stations on low-powered BSs. For this game, the properties of the Nash equilibrium and the cognitive hierarchy equilibrium are analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed cognitive hierarchy model yields significant performance gains, in terms of the total rate, reaching up to twice the rate achieved by a classical noncooperative game's Nash equilibrium...|$|R
