40|$|This Bachelor´s Thesis {{presents}} an engineering design of gearing between transmis-sion and alternator for drive of the superstructure {{of the heavy}} truck. The gear ratio from engine to the output of transmission is 0, 432 for normal <b>constant</b> <b>meshing</b> or 0, 538 for reduced <b>constant</b> <b>meshing.</b> The performance of truck is 270 kW at 1800 rpm and torque 1850 N. m at 1000 + 200 rpm. The thesis is focused on engineering design of location change of dynamo and not only to reduce the possibility of collisions between the chassis and the V-belt but also to make the whole construction simpler...|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} obtain a HC License the driver must have held an MR or HR license for at least 12 months. To upgrade to an MC License the driver must have held a HR or HC license for at least 12 months. From {{licenses}} MR and upward {{there is also a}} B Condition which may apply to the license if testing in a synchromesh or automatic transmission vehicle. The B Condition may be removed upon the driver proving the ability to drive a <b>constant</b> <b>mesh</b> transmission using the clutch. <b>Constant</b> <b>mesh</b> transmission refers to crash box transmissions, predominantly Road Ranger eighteen-speed transmissions in Australia.|$|R
50|$|Like its W25 predecessor, the W125 used a 4-speed manual transmission. The gearbox {{design was}} changed to a <b>constant</b> <b>mesh</b> type, which {{provided}} better reliability compared to the sliding mesh transmission of the M25. In a <b>constant</b> <b>mesh</b> gearbox, the transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but the gears are not rigidly connected to the shafts on which they rotate. Instead, the gears can freely rotate or be locked to the shaft on which they are carried. The previous sliding mesh transmission required the gears to be spinning {{at roughly the same}} speed when engaged; otherwise, the teeth would refuse to mesh.|$|R

50|$|Three {{versions}} of the Dennis Loline were built: the Loline with rear entrance, Loline II with front entrance and the later Loline III with a revised front grille {{in front of the}} radiator and a different clutch and <b>constant</b> <b>mesh</b> gearbox.|$|R
30|$|We discretize {{the problem}} by using a finite {{difference}} scheme with a <b>constant</b> <b>mesh</b> step size: h= 1 /m, where m denotes the number of mesh nodes in x- or y-direction. Then Problem  4 can be transformed to a linear mixed complementarity problem.|$|R

50|$|The modern yaw drives, {{even though}} {{electronically}} controlled and equipped with large electric motors and planetary gearboxes have great similarities {{to the old}} windmill concept. They still use a means of mechanical energy “production” (i.e. electric motor), a method to increase the torque (i.e. gearbox) and a gear-rim mounted on the fixed portion of the wind turbine and in <b>constant</b> <b>mesh</b> with the output gear of the said gearbox.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{heavy vehicle}} {{transmission}} condition for a license class HC, HR, or MC test passed in a vehicle fitted with an automatic or synchromesh transmission; a driver's license will be restricted to vehicles of that class fitted with a synchromesh or automatic transmission. To have the condition removed, a person needs to pass a practical driving test in a vehicle with non-synchromesh transmission (<b>constant</b> <b>mesh</b> or crash box).|$|R
5000|$|All Suzuki Intruders are {{powered by}} either a 4 or 5 speed {{transmission}} mated to a shaft drive which delivers {{power to the}} rear wheel. Starting in 1991, the VS1400 platform received the 5 speed transmission in most European countries and by 1995, Canadian models were equipped with the same transmission.

However, the parameter identification (masses, spring <b>constants,</b> <b>mesh</b> topology) still remains a challenge.

50|$|In 1960 {{along with}} the rest of the Claymore range, the Nimbus was uprated {{featuring}} heavier BMC axles and an Albion <b>constant</b> <b>mesh</b> gearbox with either five or six speeds. Vacuum assistance to the brakes was now provided by a Hydrovac system, belt-driven from the engine. Two Nimbus-specific changes were the option of a drop-frame extension at the rear for a luggage boot and the option of a spare wheel mounted on a slide-out carrier, below this extension.|$|R

50|$|They {{were taken}} over in 1961 by AEC parent Associated Commercial Vehicles Ltd, and {{production}} {{was limited to}} Nubians, Big Bens and Antars, although the Thornycroft-designed six-speed <b>constant</b> <b>mesh</b> gearbox was used in AEC and later medium weight Leyland and Albion trucks. ACV was then taken over by Leyland in 1962. They already had a specialist vehicle unit in Scammell, another manufacturer of large haulage vehicles. Thornycroft's Basingstoke factory was closed in 1969 and specialist vehicles transferred to Scammell at Watford.|$|R
