40|$|Although {{more than}} 19 {{years have passed}} since the {{introduction}} of the new concept of ownership of a separate part of real property (<b>condominium)</b> by the <b>Ownership</b> and Other Property Rights Act, there are numerous dilemmas in practice concerning its application, especially in regard to the establishment of ownership of a separate part of real property (condominium). In fact, in judicial practice (and in Croatian legal doctrine) there are different points of view about the question whether it is possible to establish condominium {{at the request of the}} co-owner who has the appropriate co-ownership share even in case of lack of agreement between all co-owners. In this paper the author analyses the legal regulation of establishment of ownership of a separate part of real property (condominium) at the request of the co-owner who has the appropriate co-ownership share with reference to the normative solutions of the 1975 Austrian Condominium Act (Wohnungseigentumsgesetz), which has served as a model for the regulation of condominium in the Republic of Croatia, and aims at giving answers to open controversial questions...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} low income condominiums {{in the city}} of Colombo has {{gradually}} increased {{in the past few decades}} in order to provide accommodation for low income earners and resettlement of shanty dwellers with the upsurge of land values in urban areas. Living in a condominium is considerably different from living in a sovereign house. In a <b>condominium,</b> personal <b>ownership</b> is limited to interior of the unit and requires sharing responsibilities with all the unit owners for the exterior of the complex. Identifying the issues in condominiums which have been designed for the low income community is essential to provide better living environment. Thus, it is vital to identify the satisfaction level of occupants who are settled in low income condominiums with respect to their living condition. Therefore, this study aims to fill the existing research gaps by investigating the existing living condition of condominiums which designed for low income families in terms of user satisfaction. First, a literature survey was carried out. This was followed by a comprehensive questionnaire survey as the data collection technique. Data were collected addressing the satisfaction on living condition under five main areas namely; social condition, facilities availability, management and maintenance of facilities, design and construction, and legal aspects. The results were analysed calculating the percentage values of each aspect. It was identified that 12 % of occupants were only satisfied with the social condition in condominium living. In terms of satisfaction level on facilities availability, electricity, telecommunication and water received the highest percentage that is 65 %, 62 % and 57 % respectively. Moreover, the survey results show that occupants are dissatisfied with quality of construction work, maintenance and management aspects. Less awareness about the legal aspects was another issue among the occupants. Finally, this study suggested conducting post occupancy evaluation will provide stable and sustainable environment for future condominium developments...|$|R

Author: Emilia Bjuvensjö and Emma Davidson Advisor: Sven-Ola Carlsson Examiner: Kent Sahlgren Title: Condominiums – A study of what factors are preventing condominiums from having a breakthrough on the Swedish housing market. Background: In Sweden condominiums have been discussed {{over and over again}} during the past 100 years. The government decided that on the 1 st of May 2009 they would introduce a new kind of housing-form, condominiums. Ever since the new law came into force, no major changes have been done in the Swedish condominium market. The condominiums look like townhouses stacked on top of each other. They major difference between condominiums and apartments is that the owner of a <b>condominium</b> has full <b>ownership</b> while the owner of an apartment has a type of tenancy which allows them to live there, without full ownership. The owner of a condominium may rent it to an outsider without asking the board for permission, compared to an apartment where the owner will need authorization from the housing association and even then only allowed to rent it for a limited time. Today it is still only a fraction of all the apartments built in the Swedish housing market that are condominiums. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to describe and explain the barriers that are preventing condominiums from having a breakthrough on the Swedish housing market. We also want to find out why construction companies decline building condominiums and only build apartments. Method: While looking for an answer to our problem, we have been using substantial and reliable literatures consisting of articles, books and the internet. We have then followed up our theories with visits and telephone interviews. Conclusion: In conclusion, the result of our investigation has shown that the condominiums progress on the housing market has been slowed by the recession we were in when the condominiums first came to the market. The lack of knowledge and information on both the supply side and the consumers is another big reason. A third factor is that the condominiums are not allowed to form in already existing homes, but must be newly produced. There are many companies that feel they can’t build in the bad times that exist and therefore choose to abstain because of the risks and unknown market that the condominiums exist in. ...|$|R

50|$|During {{the first}} few years the Galaxy was open, its 57 {{different}} apartment models, each with an odd-shaped floor plan dictated by its location in the beehive of its tower, rented for an average of $800. However, there was not a sufficient market for luxury apartments in Guttenberg, and by 1979, {{less than half of the}} first two towers had been rented. The interior of the third tower, the last to be built, had not been completed and the building was vacant until demand caught up with supply. That same year, Belfer dissolved his partnership with Prudential, due to differences between the two. Prudential took over the complex and made some improvements, including the installation of new windows, renovation of the lobby and hallways and the purchase of a 17-acre parcel of waterfront land below the Galaxy that had been used for the processing and storage of peanut oil. Rents were restructured between 1979 and 1980, resulting in an increase of more than 300 tenants before approval was granted in 1980 for conversion to <b>condominium</b> <b>ownership.</b>|$|E
50|$|Its {{location}} on the Hudson River in Guttenberg {{was said to be}} both its greatest advantage and its biggest drawback. The fact that the Towers has been likened to a self-contained city within a town that is only four-blocks long has plagued the Galaxy's owners from the building's inception. Its unusual status made it difficult to rent units when they were merely apartments, and then selling them after the conversion to condominiums was approved in 1980. Because the Galaxy began as a rental project that subsequently converted to <b>condominium</b> <b>ownership,</b> the Galaxy has had the marketing problem of tenants who elected not to buy their apartments, but whose occupancy hinders their sale to the public. In addition, environmentalists objected to their construction because they obliterated views of the Hudson Palisades, which they considered a valuable resource.The towers' $3.3 million in real-estate taxes exceeds by more than $1 million what Guttenberg collects {{from the rest of the}} property in town. As of November 2011, one-fifth of the town's population lives in the Towers, though reporter Stephen LaMarca incorrectly stated in the Hudson Reporter that 'most' of the town's population lives in the towers.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (LLD (Private Law)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the significance of introducing and strengthening apartment ownership in China. The research aims to explore and scrutinize various apartment ownership options from selected jurisdictions in order to provide a framework for similar legislation in China. Hence, the research seeks to provide a legislative framework for a uniform condominium statute by closely examining the South African Sectional Titles Act and the American Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act. This comparative study will help to establish a uniform condominium statute suitable to the Chinese national character and compatible with the pace of the country’s economic development. The thesis is organized into seven chapters. The first chapter explains the research topic, theoretical basis of the thesis, and research methodology. Moreover, in this chapter the historical background and status quo of Chinese condominium institution are also illustrated. Following this introduction, Chapter Two explores the theoretical structure of <b>condominium</b> <b>ownership.</b> It depicts the legislative innovation arising from its sui generis features and explains the objects of <b>condominium</b> <b>ownership</b> on the basis of its unique definition. In Chapter Three, a wide spectrum of provisions is identified pertaining to the creation of condominium in China with reference to South African and American acts. Specifically, it observes the requirements for land intended for subdivision and the buildings that comprise a condominium project. It is highlighted that a condominium’s constitutive document is unregulated in China. Moreover, the characteristic Chinese land registration procedure is also presented. Chapter Four demonstrates the significance of the participation quota and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of different participation quota calculating methods. Chapter Five emphasizes that inherent in the condominium living is the interdependence of interests among unit owners. Consequently, this chapter focuses on condominium owners’ use and enjoyment of their apartments and the common property. Chapter Six elaborates on condominium management. This chapter examines the management body, the general meeting, the executive council and the managing agent. It concludes that having a well-structured management body is essential since a condominium community cannot function efficiently without a management association to represent all of the owners and to handle day-to-day operations. The last chapter concludes that China needs to enact a uniform condominium to protect private interests within the condominium context...|$|E
40|$|With {{data from}} the National Survey of Condominium Occupants {{conducted}} by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the relevant differences between a sample of renters who decided to purchase a condominium and a sample of homeowners who decided to sell their dwelling to buy a condominium are described. The subpopulation differed with respect not only to life-cycle stages and household economic resources but also to stated housing preferences and future housing plans. For example, previous renters {{were found to be}} younger households in the earlier stages of the life cycle who purchased lower priced condominiums with more borrowed funds than previous homeowners. A proportion of previous renters, however, were found to be entering the condominium sector late in life. Previous owners, the majority of whom moved from the freehold ownership market, preferred <b>condominium</b> <b>ownership</b> as means of gaining greater physical security and less direct maintenance responsibilities and, therefore, searched for only condominium housing. On the other hand, tenants sought initially to gain entrance into the freehold ownership market before deciding on the purchase of condominiums. Previous tenants are planning to use the equity of their condominiums to move into single detached houses within a short period of time, whereas for previous owners the condominium sector presents a final stage in housing demand. It is concluded that life-cycle stages and household economic resources continue to dominate a household's tenure transition, but this must also be combined with tenure and housing preferences as well as long-term or future housing plans. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{need to set}} up {{condominium}} arose {{with the}} beginning of mass construction of multi-apartment buildings. In Slovenia, condominium has been governed by law since the middle of the 20 th century. The integral system is quite complex and is today regulated within two basic registers i. e. land register and cadaster of buildings. The registration of condominium into public real estate registers in Slovenia has been systematically regulated since 1976, when the E-book i. e. the book of condominium was set up on the basis of The Law on the Rights of parts of buildings (Official Gazette of RS, Nos. 19 / 76). Since 1976 until today, legal changes in this field have been followed and tracked. They have been changing the regulations of data registration into real estate registers on the procedure as well as data level. The aim of these legislation changes was to achieve sufficient legal security of condominium owners and to simplify real estate market service. However, these two aims might also exclude each other. Therefore, each legislation change has brought simplifications for real estate market services on one hand and new demands for higher legal security of condominium owners on the other. In the introductory part of this diploma paper, the concept of condominium is explained. Additionally, the demands which are laid down by laws and executive acts regulating this field since 1976 onward are given. The results of condominium registrations into public registers in the past {{on the basis of the}} then valid legislation are the contents of these public registers still today. Therefore, to understand the data referring to buildings, it is important to know in which time period they were constructed and how these changes are recognized by accessing public real estate registers today. On the basis of the sample of more than a hundred examined buildings, which were registered in public real estate registers in different time periods, the trust rate has been determined for the key data. Additionally, the average trust rate for the data registered on the basis of certain legislation was calculated. The aim of this paper is to establish how the trust rate for certain data changes according to the different time periods of real estate registration and when certain condominium can be considered in compliance with regulations. On the basis of the sample and legislation, the lowest trust rate has been determined, which still provides sufficient legal security to condominium owners as well as simple real estate market service. The percentage shall set the limit which shows whether certain <b>condominium</b> <b>ownership</b> has been finalized...|$|E
40|$|The {{confluence}} of rail transit {{and real estate}} development opportunities in San Juan, Puerto Rico raises {{a number of questions}} related to the future built form of the city and surrounding region. As the construction of Tren Urbano nears completion many advocate transit supportive development that captures the social benefits that results for public investment in Tren Urbano. Private developers have been slow to react to the potential for transit supportive real housing. This research brings together the urban design ideas expressed in New Urbanism and real estate investment decision modeling to forecast the potential for building transit supportive housing at the Martinez Nadal station within the next two years. The analysis shows that market demand for high-density housing in San Juan is strong, a reflection of rising income levels in Puerto Rico and {{an increase in the number}} of households. In addition, recent housing development in the Greater San Juan region has started to shift to mid-rise walk-ups and highrise condominiums. However, the link between high-density housing and rail transit is still not firmly established In terms of the financial decision modeling for future transit supportive housing, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is used to estimate a risk-adjusted discount rate for housing development. The Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) investment decision rules are applied to four stylized housing programs synthesized from recent housing development practice in San Juan. The investment potential of the stylized housing projects is evaluated under different conditions. First, the result from a market development that ignores the impact of the transit system is established. The model then adjusts for reduced parking ratios to account for transit supportive housing. In one case, the results show that the investment will continue to be profitable up to a six percent reduction in the average price for a condominium unit when the parking is reduced from two spaces per dwelling to a more transit friendly ratio of one space. In another case, the size of the public subsidy that is required to develop the housing is estimated to be 15 percent of total development cost. The results show that there is a real opportunity for transit supportive housing in San Juan. However, Tren Urbano will need to play an active role in getting projects such as these off the ground.
