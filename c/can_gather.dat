5|$|In South Africa, ants {{are used}} to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small seeds {{used to make a}} herbal tea. The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual {{collection}} difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other seeds in their nest, where humans <b>can</b> <b>gather</b> them en masse. Up to half a pound (200g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.|$|E
5|$|Should players take damage, {{they lose}} a life. Players can {{recharge}} their health by collecting cookies. Throughout the game, players <b>can</b> <b>gather</b> Specter Coins, {{which can be}} found in hidden locations in each stage. Collecting enough Specter Coins unlocks three bonus mini-games: Ski Kidz Racing, a skiing game in which players race against opponents; Galaxy Monkey, a shoot 'em up where players fight against aliens; and Specter Boxing, a boxing game where players dodge and punch using the analog sticks.|$|E

50|$|The dataset must be initialized, or seeded with an {{original}} batch of images which serve as good exemplars {{of the object}} category to be learned. These <b>can</b> be <b>gathered</b> automatically, using the first page or so of images returned by the search engine (which tend {{to be better than}} the subsequent images). Alternatively, the initial images <b>can</b> be <b>gathered</b> by hand.|$|R
5|$|Nautical units often play a {{secondary}} role, {{but can be}} essential to victory. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they <b>can</b> <b>gather</b> fish. Merchant ships trade resources from the stockpile and exchange it for gold at another player's dock, {{with the amount of}} gold earned being relative to the distance between both docks. Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another. As well as attacking enemy ships, warships can be very effective in attacking land-based units close to the shoreline (because melee units cannot fight back). Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders (very effective against buildings near the shoreline).|$|E
5|$|Other major {{subsystems}} in the E-3 Sentry are navigation, communications, and computers. Fourteen consoles display computer-processed data in graphic and {{tabular format}} on video screens. Console operators perform surveillance, identification, weapons control, battle management and communications functions. The radar and computer subsystems on the E-3 <b>can</b> <b>gather</b> and present broad and detailed battlefield information. This includes position and tracking information on enemy aircraft and ships, and location {{and status of}} friendly aircraft and naval vessels. The information {{can be sent to}} major command and control centers in rear areas or aboard ships. In times of crisis, data can be forwarded to the National Command Authority in the U.S. via RC-135 or naval aircraft carrier task forces.|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees <b>can</b> <b>gather</b> evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} {{must then}} defeat the God Beasts before they <b>can</b> <b>gather</b> {{and destroy the}} world. However, after doing this they realize killing the God Beasts has given more power to their main enemy, who their personal enemies were working for—the Dragon Emperor for Duran and Angela, the Dark Prince for Hawk and Lise, and the Masked Mage for Kevin and Carlie. The already powerful villain absorbs {{the power of the}} Sword of Mana and the God Beasts in order to become a god, but is halted by the Mana Goddess blocking some of its power. After defeating the villain's minions, the characters go and defeat their main enemy, but are unable to stop him from destroying the Mana Tree and eliminating all Mana from the world. The Faerie then fuses with what is left of the Mana Tree; she will be reborn as the Mana Goddess in a thousand years, but until then Mana will not exist in the world. As the game ends, the characters go back to their homelands.|$|E

25|$|Four runs are scored as overthrows if a fielder gathers {{the ball}} and then throws it so that no other fielder <b>can</b> <b>gather</b> it before it reaches the boundary. In this case, the batsman who hit the ball scores however many runs the batsmen had run up to that time, plus four {{additional}} runs, and it is counted as a boundary. If the ball has not come off the bat or hand holding the bat, then the runs are classified as 'extras' and {{are added to the}} team's score but not to the score of any individual batsman.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{starting}} a new character, the player will have only {{a rock and a}} torch, the former of which can be used to cut down trees and break apart stones. In order to survive in the world, the player must gather resources such as wood and stone and use these resources to craft tools, weapons and other gear. The player <b>can</b> <b>gather</b> cloth, food, stone, metal ore, sulfur ore and wood by killing animals, mining rocks and chopping trees. To craft items, players must have all of the required items. Sophisticated items require more materials, alongside consumables called components; items scattered around the map.|$|E
25|$|The diet {{choice that}} the player made in prior stages, whether herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore, determines what food the tribe <b>can</b> <b>gather</b> and eat.

Fruit is {{gathered}} from trees and bushes, and players can also domesticate animals for eggs, which all diet types can eat. Any foreign {{animals in the}} player's pack in the Creature Stage are automatically added to the tribe as farm animals. Epic creatures may threaten nests or tribes. Allied tribes will occasionally bring the player gifts of food. Players can steal food from other tribes (though it angers them), and dead tribes may be pillaged for their food.|$|E
