5|$|The {{magazine}} was bimonthly until the March 1954 issue, which {{was followed by}} April 1954, inaugurating a monthly period that ran until June 1955. This was followed by August 1955, resuming a bimonthly schedule that ran until July 1964, with only one irregularity, when the February 1959 issue was followed by July 1959. After July 1964, If ran a monthly schedule until April 1970, with three omissions: there were no issues dated September 1964, June 1969, or August 1969. From May–June 1970, the issues were bimonthly and bore the names of two months. This bimonthly sequence ran through the last issue {{at the end of}} 1974. The date the magazine printed on the cover reverted to a single month with the June 1971 issue, though the <b>contents</b> <b>page</b> still used two months to identify the issue. The volume numbering began with six issues to a volume: there were three errors on the magazine <b>contents</b> <b>page,</b> with volume 8 number 1 incorrectly printed as volume 7 number 6; volume 9 number 3 printed as volume 8 number 6; and volume 10 number 1 printed as volume 10 number 6. Volume 14, which began in March 1964, ran {{through the end of the}} year, with seven numbers; the remaining volumes had 12 numbers each except for volume 19 which had 10 and volume 22 which had 8.|$|E
25|$|Brodovitch {{released}} {{a book of}} these photographs in 1945, titled simply Ballet, through a small New York publisher. The book contains 104 photographs of several ballets and is divided into eleven segments, one for each ballet performance. On the <b>contents</b> <b>page,</b> Brodovitch introduces each chapter in a typographic style that emulates {{the feel of the}} dance it is describing. He photographed with a Contax 35mm camera, no flash, and with a slow film speed. The blurred figures of the dancers allow the viewer to not only feel the music, but also to follow the line of the dancer's limbs mid-step. The images beautifully capture the atmosphere on-stage, the frenzied behind-the-scenes action backstage, and the magical moments of the ballet. By bleeding the blurred, grainy pictures off the pages and into the gutters, he communicated the emotional impact of the dance without words.|$|E
500|$|With issue 36 (August 1953), {{the cover}} text changed from {{advertising}} a [...] "Full-length Novel" [...] to [...] "Full-length Story"; the [...] "featured story", {{as it was}} called in the <b>contents</b> <b>page,</b> was still the longest piece of fiction in the issue, but was no longer necessarily even close to novel length. Issue 41, for example, ran Richard deMille's [...] "The Phoenix Nest" [...] as the lead story, with fewer than forty pages of text. Finally, in issue 60 (August 1955), the word [...] "feature" [...] was removed from the <b>contents</b> <b>page,</b> and with it the last vestige of the origin of the magazine as a series of novels.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time that Oliphant was {{appointed}} editor, the layout of the magazine was changed to that of a standard pulp. [...] At 160 pages, this offered readers much better value for money than the 48-page dime novel format of the first eight issues, even with a price increase from 10 to 15 cents. [...] A question and answer department, [...] "Cross-Trails", was begun, in imitation of a similar feature in Adventure, the most successful pulp magazine of the day, and the format change may also have been done to increase the resemblance of the two magazines, along with a change to the appearance of The Thrill Books <b>contents</b> <b>page</b> to resemble that of Adventure.|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} {{contained a}} lead novel and three short stories. [...] The novel, The Master of Mars, by James Edison Northford (or Northfield; {{the name is}} spelled one way on the <b>contents</b> <b>page</b> and the other way {{at the head of}} the story), has been described by Bleiler as [...] "moronic". [...] Bleiler also comments that of three short stories, one is dated and another third-rate. [...] Two of the stories were by R.R. Winterbotham; one, [...] "The Saga of the Smokepot", was published under his own name; the other, [...] "The Last War", was published under the pseudonym [...] "R.R. Botham". [...] The other story, [...] "The Man Without a Brain", is a collaboration between R.C. Vance (or R.C. Vane; as with Northford, the magazine is inconsistent in spelling the name) and F.K. Young.|$|E
500|$|Bernhard {{brought in}} Elinor Mavor to edit both Amazing and Fantastic. [...] Mavor had {{previously}} edited Bill of Fare, a restaurant trade journal, {{and was a}} long-time science fiction reader, but she had little knowledge {{of the history of}} the magazines. [...] She was unaware, for example, that she was not the first woman to edit them, and so adopted a male pseudonym—"Omar Gohagen"—for a while. [...] She suggested a campaign to increase circulation, and went so far as to gather information about costs while on a trip to New York in 1979. [...] Bernhard decided instead to merge the two magazines. [...] Circulation was continuing to drop; the figures for the last two years are not available, but sf historian Mike Ashley estimates that Fantastic paid circulation may have been as low as 13,000. [...] Bernhard felt that since Fantastic had never been profitable, whereas Amazing had made money, it was best to keep Amazing. [...] Until the March 1985 issue, Amazing included a mention of Fantastic on the spine and on the <b>contents</b> <b>page.</b> [...] In 1999, the fiction magazine formerly known as Pirate Writings revived the Fantastic title and Cele Goldsmith-era logotype for several issues, ultimately unsuccessfully, though this was not intended as a continuation of the original magazine.|$|E

500|$|By {{the start}} of 1951, Hamilton's science fiction titles were being {{published}} every two weeks. On 1 January 1951, Hamilton published Mushroom Men from Mars, by Lee Stanton, which was a pseudonym for Richard Conroy. A banner {{was added to the}} base of the cover reading [...] "Authentic Science Fiction Series"; the same banner appeared on the 15 January novel, Reconnoitre Krellig II, by Jon J. Deegan, also a pseudonym, this time for Robert G. Sharp. With the next book, Roy Sheldon's Gold Men of Aureus, Landsborough changed the banner to read [...] "Science Fiction Fortnightly No. 3", thinking that the caption might help sales. In addition to the banner, a <b>contents</b> <b>page</b> (including a date and issue number), a letter column, an editorial, and an advertisement for subscriptions were inserted. According to Landsborough, the banner was only intended to indicate the publishing schedule to readers, but combined with the other changes the appearance became much more magazine-like. These changes established the sequence in the minds of readers and collectors, and retroactively determined that Mushroom Men from Mars had been the first in the series: the first two issues had carried no issue number. Issue 3 was also the first issue to carry the editors' names: Landsborough used the pseudonym L.G. Holmes ("Holmes" [...] was his middle name) for his editing role on the magazine.|$|E

In 1983, the magazine introduced a new logo using the ITC Avant Garde font, which it used until late 1995. Within the next 11 years, its font changed 4 times (in 1995, 1997, 2001, and 2002, respectively). In 2009, the magazine used a new font for its logo, which was used until the January 2014 issue.|$|E

But even the Le Tour de monde article was not entirely original; it cites in its bibliography the Nouvelles Annales des Voyages, de la Géographie, de l'Histoire et de l'Archéologie (August, 1869), which also contains the title Around the World in Eighty Days in its <b>contents</b> <b>page.</b> The Nouvelles Annales were written by Conrad Malte-Brun (1775–1826) and his son Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun (1816–1889).

2500|$|Gurdjieff wrote {{a unique}} trilogy with the Series title All and Everything. The first volume, {{finalized}} by Gurdjieff {{shortly before his}} death and first published in 1950, is the First Series and titled An Objectively Impartial Criticism of the Life of Man or Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson. At 1238 pages it is a lengthy allegorical work that recounts the explanations of Beelzebub to his grandson concerning the beings of the planet Earth and laws which govern the universe. It provides a vast platform for Gurdjieff's deeply considered philosophy. A controversial redaction of Beelzebub's Tales was published by some of Gurdjieff's followers as an alternative [...] "edition," [...] in 1992. [...] On his page of Friendly Advice facing the first <b>Contents</b> <b>page</b> of Beelzebub's Tales Gurdjieff lays out his own program of three obligatory initial readings of each of the three series in sequence and concludes, [...] "Only then {{will you be able to}} count upon forming your own impartial judgement, proper to yourself alone, on my writings.

40|$|We explore search {{behaviors}} {{during a}} new kind of search unit – the query reformulation interval (QRI). The QRI is defined as an interval between two consecutive queries in one search session that contains at least two queries. Our controlled, web-based study focused on examining behaviors associated with querying and useful document saving. We compared behavioral variables that characterized QRIs during which useful pages were found with those during which no useful pages were found. Our results demonstrated that the QRI duration and the total time spent on <b>content</b> <b>pages</b> during QRIs with useful pages were significantly longer than during QRIs with no useful pages. Users viewed more <b>content</b> <b>pages</b> and spent more time on <b>content</b> <b>pages</b> than on search result pages during QRIs with useful pages. The findings suggest that user behavior during QRIs can be used as an indicator of QRIs containing useful documents...|$|R
