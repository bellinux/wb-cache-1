5|$|Ibn Batuta, {{during his}} visit in 1344, {{observed}} that the kingdom of Jaffna was a major trading kingdom with extensive overseas contacts. The Kingdom's trades were oriented towards maritime South India, with which it developed a commercial interdependence. The non-agriculture tradition of the kingdom became strong {{as a result of}} large <b>coastal</b> <b>fishing</b> and boating population and growing opportunities for seaborne commerce. Influential commercial groups, drawn mainly from south Indian mercantile groups as well as other, resided in the royal capital, port, and market centers. Artisan settlements were also established and groups of skilled tradesmen—carpenters, stonemasons, wavers, dryers, gold and silver smiths—resided in urban centers. Thus, a pluralistic socio-economic tradition of agriculture marine activities, commerce and handicraft production was well established.|$|E

25|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>fish,</b> {{also called}} inshore fish or neritic fish, inhabit the sea between the {{shoreline}} and {{the edge of}} the continental shelf. Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that pelagic <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> are generally epipelagic fish, inhabiting the sunlit epipelagic zone. <b>Coastal</b> <b>fish</b> can be contrasted with oceanic fish or offshore fish, which inhabit the deep seas beyond the continental shelves.|$|R
25|$|Marine {{pelagic fish}} {{can be divided}} into pelagic <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> and oceanic pelagic <b>fish.</b> <b>Coastal</b> <b>fish</b> inhabit the {{relatively}} shallow and sunlit waters above the continental shelf, while oceanic fish (which may well also swim inshore) inhabit the vast and deep waters beyond the continental shelf.|$|R

25|$|Agriculture {{supplemented}} by fishing and hunting {{has been the}} traditional livelihood among Finns. Slash-and-burn agriculture was practiced in the forest-covered east by Eastern Finns up to the 19th century. Agriculture, along with the language, distinguishes Finns from the Sami, who retained the hunter-gatherer lifestyle longer and moved to <b>coastal</b> <b>fishing</b> and reindeer herding. Following industrialization and modernization of Finland, most Finns were urbanized and employed in modern service and manufacturing occupations, with agriculture becoming a minor employer (see Economy of Finland).|$|E

25|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>fishing</b> fleets that hunt {{dolphins}} use {{many small}} boats in a coordinated effort. The fishermen bang metal poles {{in the water}} in order to frighten and therefore guide noise-sensitive dolphins toward the shore. A series of nets are then used to corral the dolphins in. Divers and fishermen in boats next lance or cut the throats of the dolphins and haul them away to a nearby shore station for processing. A few dolphins are selected for sale to aquariums and spared for the marine aquarium (dolphinarium) entertainment industry.|$|E
25|$|Bill Reynolds was in {{possession}} of a 21.3 metre-long Japanese <b>coastal</b> <b>fishing</b> boat, the Kofuku Maru, which he had used to evacuate refugees out of Singapore. Lyon ordered that the boat be shipped from India to Australia. Upon its arrival, he renamed the vessel MV Krait, after the small but deadly Asian snake. Lieutenant-Colonel G.

Townsville, Queensland was chosen for the location of the attack.|$|E

25|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>fishing</b> {{villages are}} often {{somewhat}} isolated, and sited around a small natural harbour which provides {{safe haven for}} a village fleet of fishing boats. The village needs to provide a safe way of landing fish and securing boats {{when they are not}} in use. Fishing villages may operate from a beach, particularly around lakes. For example, around parts of Lake Malawi, each fishing village has its own beach. If a fisherman from outside the village lands fish on the beach, he gives some of the fish to the village headman. Village fishing boats are usually characteristic of the stretch of coast along which they operate. Traditional fishing boats evolve over time to meet the local conditions, such as the materials available locally for boat building, the type of sea conditions the boats will encounter, and the demands of the local fisheries.|$|E

40|$|Natural Caligus elongatus Nordmann infections of wild <b>coastal</b> <b>fishes</b> on the Norwegian south {{east coast}} were {{monitored}} {{at various times}} of the year from 2002 to 2004. The prevalence for all <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> (n = 4427) pooled was 15 %, and there were great differences between fish species and seasons. Lumpfish Cyclopterus lumpus L. spawners were the most infected fish, with a prevalence of 61 % and a median intensity of 4 lice fish– 1, whereas gadids had a mean prevalence of 19 % and a median infection of 1 to 2 lice fish– 1. Sea trout Salmo trutta L. and herring Clupea harengus L. carried C. elongatus at prevalence values of 29 and 21 %, respectively. The results were compared with infection data for immature North Sea lumpfish. Lumpfish spawners caught on the coast in March to April had fewer lice than North Sea lumpfish in July. Spawners carried mostly adult lice, as did <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> hosts in May to June. The low development rates of lice at low spring temperatures and new genetic data suggest that the May to June adult lice could not have been offspring of the March to April lice, indicating transfer of adult lice to <b>coastal</b> <b>fish.</b> Most <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> species appeared to acquire new C. elongatus infections between May to June and September. The relatively high numbers of chalimii on North Sea lumpfish suggest that offshore fish sustain an oceanic population of this louse species...|$|R
