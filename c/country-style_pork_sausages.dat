40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to optimize the water activity hurdle during the process of development of shelf stable <b>pork</b> <b>sausages</b> using hurdle technology. The humectants used were Skim Milk Powder (SMP) and Textured Soy Protein (TSP). Different parameters evaluated were pH, emulsion stability, cooking yield, moisture, protein and fat contents, water activity, shear force, lovibond tintometer colour scores, texture profiles and sensory attributes. Incorporation of TSP significantly improved the colour and texture profiles of <b>pork</b> <b>sausages,</b> however, above 3 % level it adversely affected different sensory attributes especially flavour. Texture profile analysis and sensory evaluation indicated that SMP at 2 % level had no adverse effect on the texture of <b>pork</b> <b>sausages.</b> Also, addition of 3 % TSP and 2 % SMP together had no significant (p> 0. 05) advantages in improving most of the processing and quality characteristics of <b>pork</b> <b>sausages</b> over 3 % TSP addition alone.

40|$|The {{effects of}} fat, raw pork skin and added {{water on the}} color, yield, texture and {{palatability}} of fresh <b>pork</b> <b>sausage</b> were investigated. Fresh <b>pork</b> <b>sausage</b> was produced to contain 8 percent and 20 percent fat, 10 percent or 20 percent pork skin and zero percent or 10 percent added water. Three controls were produced at 8 percent, 20 percent and 35 percent fat with no added pork skin or water. <b>Sausage</b> with added <b>pork</b> skins had increased pH values. The 8 percent fat sausage and sausage without added water had the greatest cook yields, while the addition of pork skin did not affect cook yield. Pork skins and added water caused sausage to be lighter in color. Redness of the sausage was similar for 20 percent fat/ 20 percent <b>pork</b> skin <b>sausage</b> compared to the 35 percent fat control. Kramer shear values indicated added water made <b>sausage</b> softer. Added <b>pork</b> skin did not affect Kramer shear values. A sensory panel rated 10 percent <b>pork</b> skin <b>sausage</b> more tender than sausage with 20 percent <b>pork</b> skin. <b>Sausage</b> with 8 percent fat and 10 percent pork skin was rated higher for juiciness and overall acceptability when compared to 8 percent fat sausage with 20 percent pork skin and 20 percent fat sausage at both added pork skin levels. Pork skins were successfully incorporated into reduced fat-fresh <b>pork</b> <b>sausage.</b> Production of acceptable reduced-fat <b>pork</b> <b>sausage</b> with added <b>pork</b> skins would increase the demand for this <b>pork</b> <b>sausage</b> and add value to a by-product of the pork industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{optimizing}} the pH hurdle {{during the process of}} development of shelf stable <b>pork</b> <b>sausages</b> using hurdle technology. The acidulants used were 0. 5 N Lactic Acid (LA) and Glucono-Delta-Lactone (GDL). Different parameters evaluated were pH, emulsion stability, cooking yield, moisture, protein and fat contents, shear force, lovibond tintometer colour scores, texture profiles and sensory attributes. Reduction in emulsion pH by the addition of LA and/or GDL significantly (p< 0. 05) influenced the processing and quality parameters of <b>pork</b> <b>sausages.</b> Emulsion pH below 5. 90 (i. e., pH of cooked product ~ 6. 00) by the addition of 0. 5 N LA affected different sensory attributes adversely. Similarly, incorporation of GDL at or above 0. 3 % adversely affected most of the quality and sensory attributes of <b>pork</b> <b>sausages.</b> It was observed that the pH of ~ 5. 90 in emulsion achieved by a combination of LA and GDL resulted in better quality characteristics in <b>pork</b> <b>sausages</b> compared to the same pH level attained by either LA or GDL alone...|$|R
