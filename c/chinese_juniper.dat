40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} the main growth modes of high-elevation conifers, such as typical variations inherent to annual tree growth records, we resolved eigen problems related to intra-record correlation coefficient matrices of several large sample sets for (A) very long-lived <b>Chinese</b> <b>junipers</b> and (B) shorter-lived European pines and larches. Such modes allow for the identification of tree growth variations of different origins, i. e., resulting from climate and/or microenvironments as well as origins that are purely biological in nature. We determined that these modes are universal, namely, that they are identical for both ring width (RW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) records. Certain specific shapes found in these main modes were indicative of anomalous tree growth. Cross-correlations between identical modes related to RW and MXD data were determined to be nonessential. This suggests that RW and MXD data likely represent different aspects of tree growth response to varying climatic and environmental conditions...|$|R

5000|$|This popular {{ornamental}} tree or shrub in gardens and parks {{has more than}} 100 named cultivars selected for various characters, such as yellow foliage (e.g. cvs. 'Aurea', 'Tremonia'), permanently juvenile foliage (e.g. cv.

'Kaizuka'), etc. <b>Chinese</b> <b>juniper,</b> as a non-native species in the U.S., {{should not be used}} there in natural plantings. The cultivar 'Shimpaku' is a very important bonsai subject. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>juniper</b> is widely used in bonsai, both as individual plants, such as the 250-year-old [...] "Omiya tree" [...] in the Birmingham Botanical Gardens in the UK, and in groups, such as the well-known Goshin on display at the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum at the US National Arboretum.|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{earliest}} prehistoric people lived in or near juniper forests which furnished them food, fuel, and wood for shelter or utensils. Many species, such as J. chinensis (<b>Chinese</b> <b>Juniper)</b> from eastern Asia, are extensively used in landscaping and horticulture, and {{as one of the}} most popular species for use in bonsai. It is also a symbol of longevity, strength, athleticism, and fertility.|$|E
50|$|The pea-gravel {{driveway}} {{is lined}} with maturing pin oaks and red maples. The formally landscaped terrace is surrounded by Japanese yew, <b>Chinese</b> <b>juniper,</b> and dwarf hemlock. The trees of The Breakers' grounds act as screens that increase the sense of distance between The Breakers and its Newport neighbors. Among the more unusual imported trees are two examples of the Blue Atlas Cedar, a native of North Africa. Clipped hedges of Japanese yew and Pfitzer juniper line the tree-shaded foot paths that meander about the grounds. Informal plantings of arbor vitae, taxus, <b>Chinese</b> <b>juniper,</b> and dwarf hemlock provide attractive foregrounds for the walls that enclose the formally landscaped terrace. The grounds also contain several varieties of other rare trees, particularly copper and weeping beeches. These were hand-selected by Ernest W. Bowditch, a landscape architect and civil engineer based in the Boston area. Bowditch’s original pattern for the south parterre garden was determined from old photographs and laid out in pink and white alyssum and blue ageratum. The wide borders paralleling the wrought iron fence are planted with rhododendron, mountain laurel, dogwoods, and many other flowering shrubs that effectively screen the grounds from street traffic and give visitors a feeling of seclusion.|$|E
50|$|Other trees include atlas cedar, {{atlantic}} white cedar, beech, cherry tree, Chinese Swamp Cypress, common yew, Chinese Yew Deodar cedar, hawthorn, Japanese red cedar, <b>Chinese</b> <b>Juniper,</b> holly, hornbeam, Irish yew, oak, Scots pine, {{silver birch}} and sycamore which have damaged other trees {{because of their}} fast growth and competition for space. A woodland management program removing diseased and weed trees is in operation. In 2011 the 101st yew tree was planted along with a Ginkgo biloba to commemorate the Wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton.|$|E

Most trees are conifers, and include Blue Pine (Pinus wallichiana), Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus), Pitch Pine, Shortleaf Pine (Pinus echinata), Blue Spruce (Picea pungens), Eastern Arborvitae (Thuja occidentalis), Chinese Arborvitae (Platycladus orientalis), Eastern Juniper (Juniperus virginiana), <b>Chinese</b> <b>Juniper</b> (Juniperus chinensis), Eastern Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), Hinoki Cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) and Sawara Cypress, Mediterranean Cypress (Cupressus sempervirens), and Stone Pine (Pinus pinea).|$|E
50|$|Juniperus chinensis Shimpaku (the shimpaku juniper) is a dwarf, {{irregular}} vase-shaped {{form of the}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>juniper,</b> Juniperus chinensis. Originally {{native to}} Japan, they were first collected in the 1850s in Japan. It is a slow-growing evergreen shrub that typically grows to 3 ft tall and 5 ft wide {{over a period of}} 10 years. Gray-green to dull dark green clusters of soft needles cover them. They are primarily grown and used as decoration, and at one point were a symbol of status in Japan. The Japanese botanical name of the shimpaku juniper is miyama-byakushin. The shimpaku juniper is used as bonsai material and in various gardens, such as rock gardens.|$|E
40|$|To isolate {{potential}} insect biocontrol agents, entomogenous nematodes {{were surveyed}} in Tennessee plant nurseries in 1991. Soil samples from 113 nursery sites were baited with {{greater wax moth}} (Galleria mellonella) larvae, house cricket (Acheta domesticus) adults, lesser mealworm (Alphitobius diaperings) adults, and house fly (Musca domestica) larvae. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema carpocapsae were each recovered from 17 soil samples. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was more common in habitats with crape myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica) and <b>Chinese</b> <b>juniper</b> (Juniperus chinensis) than other nursery plants, and S. carpocapsae was more frequently recovered from habitats with juniper and Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). Bulk density, electrical conductivity, organic matter, pH, temperature, and moisture content of the entomogenous-nematode positive soil samples were compared. Other nematode genera recovered with insect baits included Rhabditis sp., Pelodera sp., Cryptaphelenchoides sp., and Mesodiplogaster sp., which was recovered from {{a greater percentage of}} soil samples than the other five genera...|$|E
