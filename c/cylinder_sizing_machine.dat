50|$|The warp {{needs to}} be taken from a 300 bobbins on V-shaped frame and wound onto a beam. Four or five beams are merged to make the 2000 end beam that is needed, and they are placed in the <b>Cylinder</b> Tape <b>Sizing</b> <b>Machine</b> (made in 1919 by Howard & Bullough Ltd. of Accrington). The threads pass through the size to stiffen them and reduce friction. The size is a mixture of flour soft soap and tallow: {{specific}} to this mill.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects of <b>cylinder</b> <b>size</b> (150 by 300 [*]mm and 100 by 200 [*]mm) on empirical equations that relate static elastic moduli and compressive strength and static and dynamic elastic moduli of concrete. For the purposes, two sets of one hundred and twenty concrete cylinders, 150 by 300 [*]mm and 100 by 200 [*]mm, were prepared from three different mixtures with target compressive strengths of 30, 35, and 40 [*]MPa. Static and dynamic tests were performed at 4, 7, 14, and 28 days to evaluate compressive strength and static and dynamic moduli of cylinders. The effects of the two different <b>cylinder</b> <b>sizes</b> were investigated through experiments in this study and database collected from the literature. For normal strength concrete (≤ 40 [*]MPa), the two different <b>cylinder</b> <b>sizes</b> do not result in significant differences in test results including experimental variability, compressive strength, and static and dynamic elastic moduli. However, it was observed that the size effect became substantial in high strength concrete greater than 40 [*]MPa. Therefore, special care is still needed to compare the static and dynamic properties of high strength concrete from the two different <b>cylinder</b> <b>sizes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{viscosity}} of concentrated {{shear thickening}} dispersions was measured {{as a function}} of shear rate, Couette <b>cylinder</b> <b>size,</b> and time. The level of the low shear rate viscosity, which was found to be independent of system size and time, could be predicted by the equation of Frankel and Acrivos. At shear rates above the critical shear rate for shear thickening in highly concentrated (¿¿ 0. 57) dispersions of monodisperse particles strong viscosity instabilities were detected, together with a dependence on <b>cylinder</b> <b>size.</b> The instabilities are attributed to reversible order–disorder transitions, e. g., from strings to clusters. This dependence on <b>cylinder</b> <b>size</b> is due to wall slip, slipping planes in the dispersion, and even plug flow in the gap. With less concentrated or polydisperse dispersions the effects are much less severe but there is thixotropy, probably due to a reordering of the dispersion...|$|R

Both polarized and depolarized backscattering are computed and their behavior versus the volume fraction, the incidence angle, the frequency, the angular distribution and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>size</b> are illustrated. It is found that both the angular distribution and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>size</b> have significant effects on the backscattered signal. The present theory is compared with measurements from defoliated vegetations...|$|R
40|$|Reports {{from the}} 2000 and 2001 seed corn crop {{indicated}} quality problems after the seed was sized, conditioned and then planted. These problems were not {{predicted by the}} traditional measures of warm and cold germination. We suspect that damage to the seed, especially that of newer, more fragile hybrids, was occurring in the sizing of the corn seed, and that a different sizing method would result in less damage. A seed corn sizing method utilizing a flat screen sizing system was compared to conventional round cylinder precision graders, using production <b>sized</b> <b>machines</b> operating at their rated capacities. Test results showed the flat screen sizing method caused less damage to the seed, {{as measured by the}} fast green dye test, than did <b>cylinder</b> <b>sizing.</b> There were no significant trends between the two in terms of warm and cold germination. This may explain why warm and cold germination tests did not predict quality problems when the seed was planted—seed damaged in the commonly used cylinder graders was more susceptible to conditions that affected actual field germination...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary notes This paper {{analyzes}} theoretically {{the motion}} {{and flow of}} eight fruit types, along rotating <b>sizing</b> <b>machines.</b> It starts from differential equation of fruit motion on a rotating disk of the <b>sizing</b> <b>machine.</b> A universal method that can generally be applied to determine the flow {{of all types of}} rotary <b>sizing</b> <b>machine</b> is developed. Flow analysis comprised sized fruit mass and flow. New empirical coefficients were introduced: extent ratio, feed ratio and distribution ratio. In particular, the influence of the relative speed of fruit on the capacity of <b>sizing</b> <b>machines</b> is researched. The results obtained for the adopted values extend, feed and distribution ratio ke = 0, 7; kf = 1; kd = 0, 5 coincide approximately with those reported to date for fruit flow rate on <b>sizing</b> <b>machines.</b> It was found that flow rates vary considerably, depending on fruit diameter and mass. Fruit numbers flow ranges from 8949 crops/h for apple to 40. 157 crops/h for deep frozen raspberry. Mass flow varies from 229, 1 kg/h for cherry to 2054, 7 kg/h for apple...|$|R
50|$|In North America, local {{delivery}} {{trucks with}} an average <b>cylinder</b> <b>size</b> of 3,000 gal, fill up large cylinders that are permanently installed on the property, or other service trucks exchange empty cylinders of propane with filled cylinders. Large tractor-trailer trucks, {{with an average}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>size</b> of 10,000 gal, transport the propane from the pipeline or refinery to the local bulk plant. The bobtail and transport are not unique to the North American market, though the practice is not as common elsewhere, and the vehicles are generally called tankers. In many countries, propane is delivered to consumers via small or medium-sized individual cylinders, while empty cylinders are removed for refilling at a central location.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{most common}} types of weirs are the broad-crested weir, the sharp-crested weir, the circular-crested weir and {{nowadays}} the ogee crest weir. Advantages of the cylindrical weir shape include the stable overflow pattern, the ease to pass floating debris, {{the simplicity of}} design compared to ogee crest design and the associated lower costs. In this study, the authors describe new experiments of circular weir overflows, with eight <b>cylinder</b> <b>sizes,</b> for several weir heights and for five types of inflow conditions: partially-developed inflow, fully-developed inflow, upstream ramp, upstream undular hydraulic jump and upstream (breaking) hydraulic jump. Within {{the range of the}} experiments, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>size,</b> the weir height D/R and the presence of an upstream ramp had no effect on the discharge coefficient, flow depth at crest and energy dissipation. But the inflow conditions had substantial effects on the discharge characteristics and flow properties at the crest. Practically the results indicate that discharge measurements with circular weirs are significantly affected by the upstream flow conditions...|$|R
50|$|Re-sizing the {{beginning}} of the extended partition (type 0x0F) can only be done manually so {{the beginning}} of the extended partition could not be re-sized beyond cylinder 65535. Take for example a disk (and partition table) that uses a sector size of 512 bytes, a head size of 63 sectors, and the largest (and probably the most common) <b>cylinder</b> <b>size,</b> that is, 255 heads per cylinder. On this disk, Ranish PM could re-size {{the beginning of}} the extended partition, to anywhere less than about 502 GiB from {{the beginning of the}} disk. On a disk that is the same except the <b>cylinder</b> <b>size</b> is 240 heads per cylinder, the maximum location for the start of the extended partition would be roughly 472 GiB. Generally the only time primary partitions are required (as opposed to logical drives) is to install certain operating systems (like Windows). 472 GiB is probably plenty of space for this purpose, even with multi-boot systems.|$|R
40|$|Conventional strain-based {{mechanics}} theory {{does not}} account for contributions from strain gradients. Failure to include the strain gradient contributions can lead to underestimates of stresses and size-dependent behaviors in small-scaled structure [1]. This paper focus on the structural size effects on torsion of cylinders. The torsional stiffness of cylinders can be higher than conventional expectation when the <b>cylinder</b> <b>size</b> is in the nanometer - or micron-scale. Following the Saint-Venant theory of torsion, we established the equation of torsion in terms of the warping function {{on the basis of the}} nano-mechanical theory of elasticity. The torsional equations contain two higher order material length scale parameters and two conventional Lame constants. The equilibrium equation is a fourth order partial differential equation which can be reduced to two second order equations. Two formulations in terms of pseudo warping function and stress function are presented. Closed-form solutions for circular and thin wall section and series solutions for rectangular microbars have been obtained. The total torque depends only on the stresses conjugated to the strain and is only implicitly dependent on the higher order stress metrics. The solution reveals that the torsional rigidity is dependent on the higher order length scale parameters and strain gradients and increases asymptotically upward when the <b>cylinder</b> <b>size</b> is reduced to the size of the higher order length scale material parameters. The increase is most marked for thin walled cylinders, stiffening to more then 10 times the conventional value when the <b>cylinder</b> <b>size</b> is near that of the higher order length scaled parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper was}} {{presented}} on Oct. 10 {{and will be}} published in a special issue of Journal of Cellular Automata. There was some useful discussion following on the presentation, including amazement that I had computed some of the results by hand rather than using a computer. This paper considers binary valued additive cellular automata rules acting on <b>cylinders</b> of <b>size</b> n in terms of circulant matrices and roots of unity. The purpose is to illustrate some of the possibilities of such an approach. Means of determining maximum tree heights and cycle periods are given, together with a method of computing conditions for states to be fixed points or to lie on cycles of given periods. The anomalous shifts that lead to maximum cycle periods being smaller than predicted for certain <b>cylinder</b> <b>sizes</b> are explained and it is shown that the set of all rules on <b>cylinders</b> of odd <b>size</b> n will have specific spectra of cycle periods determined by the prime decomposition of n. Finally, numeric properties of the n-th roots of unity when coupled with mod(2) arithmetic are exploited to group additive rules acting on a <b>cylinder</b> of <b>size</b> n into classes having the same eigenvalues for their circulant matrix representations...|$|R
