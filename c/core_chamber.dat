40|$|Denitrification is {{commonly}} measured using in situ benthic chambers or laboratory incubations of sediment cores. These techniques {{are similar in}} principle but differ considerably in cost and practicality. Despite widespread use of both techniques, it is uncertain whether they give comparable results. We compared <b>cores</b> and <b>chambers</b> for measuring fluxes (dissolved oxygen [DO], N 2, NH 4 +, NO 3 - and NO 2 -) and denitrification efficiency at 2 sites in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia. Overall, denitrification efficiency was not significantly different between <b>cores</b> and <b>chambers,</b> but fluxes of DO, NO 3 - and NO 2 - differed. Chambers demonstrated higher levels of oxygen consumption and net fluxes of NO 3 - and NO 2 - out of the sediment, suggesting that denitrification and nitrification were closely coupled. In contrast, there was a greater relative importance for uncoupled denitrification in cores as indicated by reduced oxygen consumption and net fluxes of NO 3 - into the sediment. We conclude that <b>cores</b> and <b>chambers</b> give different flux results and therefore are not comparable techniques for measuring denitrification. To ascertain the cause of this, we tested the hypothesis that cores failed to adequately incorporate the impacts of macrofauna on fluxes, due to {{the small size of}} <b>cores</b> relative to <b>chambers.</b> However, densities of macrofauna were not significantly different in <b>cores</b> and <b>chambers.</b> We then hypothesised that disturbance during core collection, transportation, and handling may account for differences, but cores deployed in situ and in the laboratory gave similar results.

A detailed description of the prototype instrument is presented with experimental validation of its use and novel ex situ experimental results using the HV-TERS system. The HV-TERS system includes three chambers held under a 10 (- 7) Pa vacuum. The three chambers are an analysis chamber, a sample preparation chamber, and a fast loading chamber. The analysis chamber is the <b>core</b> <b>chamber</b> and contains a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and a Raman detector coupled with a 50 x 0. 5 numerical aperture objective. The sample preparation chamber is used to produce single-crystalline metal and sub-monolayer molecular films by molecular beam epitaxy. The fast loading chamber allows ex situ preparation of samples for HV-TERS analysis. Atomic resolution can be achieved by the STM on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. We demonstrate the measurement of localized temperature using the Stokes and anti-Stokes TERS signals from a monolayer of 1, 2 -benzenedithiol on a gold film using a gold tip. Additionally, plasmonic catalysis can be monitored label-free at the nanoscale using our device. Moreover, the HV-TERS experiments show simultaneously activated infrared and Raman vibrational modes, Fermi resonance, and some other non-linear effects that are not observed in atmospheric TERS experiments. The high spatial and spectral resolution and pure environment of high vacuum are beneficial for basic surface studies. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} acoustic {{testing of}} tuned <b>chamber</b> <b>core</b> panels, {{which can be}} used to supplement the low-frequency performance of conventional acoustic treatment. The tuned <b>chamber</b> <b>core</b> concept incorporates low-frequency noise control directly within the primary structure and is applicable to sandwich constructions with a directional core, including corrugated-, truss-, and fluted-core designs. These types of sandwich structures have long, hollow channels (or <b>chambers)</b> in the <b>core.</b> By adding small holes through one of the facesheets, the hollow chambers can be utilized as an array of low-frequency acoustic resonators. These resonators can then be used to attenuate low-frequency noise (below 400 Hz) inside a vehicle compartment without increasing the weight or size of the structure. The results of this test program demonstrate that the tuned <b>chamber</b> <b>core</b> concept is effective when used in isolation or combined with acoustic foam treatments. Specifically, an array of acoustic resonators integrated within the core of the panels was shown to improve both the low-frequency absorption and transmission loss of the structure in targeted one-third octave bands...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAgrobacterium VirB 7, VirB 9, and VirB 10 form a "core complex" during biogenesis of the VirB/VirD 4 type IV {{secretion}} system (T 4 SS). VirB 10 {{spans the}} cell envelope and, {{in response to}} sensing of ATP energy consumption by the VirB/D 4 ATPases, undergoes a conformational change required for DNA transfer across the outer membrane (OM). Here, we tested a model in which VirB 10 regulates substrate passage by screening for mutations that allow for unregulated release of the VirE 2 secretion substrate to the cell surface independently of target cell contact. One mutation, G 272 R, conferred VirE 2 release and also rendered VirB 10 conformationally insensitive to cellular ATP depletion. Strikingly, G 272 R did not affect substrate transfer to target cells (Tra(+)) but did block pilus production (Pil(-)). The G 272 R mutant strain displayed enhanced sensitivity to vancomycin and SDS but did not nonspecifically release periplasmic proteins or VirE 2 truncated of its secretion signal. G 272 is highly conserved among VirB 10 homologs, including pKM 101 TraF, and in the TraF X-ray structure the corresponding Gly residue is positioned near an Î±-helical domain termed the antenna projection (AP), which is implicated in formation of the OM pore. A partial AP deletion mutation (ÎAP) also confers a Tra(+) Pil(-) phenotype; however, this mutation did not allow VirE 2 surface exposure but instead allowed the release of pilin monomers or short oligomers to the milieu. We propose that (i) G 272 R disrupts a gating mechanism in the <b>core</b> <b>chamber</b> that regulates substrate passage across the OM and (ii) the G 272 R and ÎAP mutations block pilus production at distinct steps of the pilus biogenesis pathway...|$|E

40|$|The Reactivity Initiated Accident Scoping Test (RIA-ST) was {{successfully}} completed August 30, 1978. The test was introductory to the RIA Series 1 tests and {{was designed to}} investigate and resolve several anticipated problem areas prior to performance of the first test of the series, Test RIA 1 - 1. The RIA Scoping Test, as performed, consisted of four separate single-rod experiment phases. The first three phases were performed with shrouded fuel rods of 5. 8 wt. % enrichment. They were subjected to power bursts resulting in total fuel surface energies ranging from 205 to 261 cal/q at the axial peak elevation. The fourth phase consisted of a 20 wt. % enriched, shrouded fuel rod which was subjected to a power hurst that deposited a total radially averaged energy of 527 cal/g. The primary objectives of the Scoping Test were defined as follows: (1) Determine the applicability of extrapolating low-power steady state calorimetric measurements and self-powered neutron detector (SPND) output to determine fuel rod energy depositions during a power burst. (2) Determine the enerqy deposition failure threshold for unirradiated fuel rods at BWR hot-startup coolant conditions. (3) Determine the magnitudes of oossible pressure pulses resulting from rod failure. (4) Determine {{the sensitivity of the}} test instrumentation to high transient radiation exposures. In general, the energy deposition values for the Scoping Test derived from the SPND output were 25 % higher than those obtained from the <b>core</b> ion <b>chamber</b> data. Determining which values are correct will require radiochemical analysis of the fuel rods which will take several months. At present, it apoears that the SPND derived energies are in error because of excellent agreement between the calculated and measured power calibration results and the agreement between the predicted failure threshold and that seen using the <b>core</b> ion <b>chamber</b> derived energies. Meeting the second objective was accomplished during the first three test phases by subjecting the fuel rods to energy depositions which bracketed the failure threshold. The failure threshold in terms of total pellet surface energy at the axial flux peak was found to be between 218 cal/g where no rod failure occurred and 256 cal/g where Â· rod failure did occur. The experiment predictions indicated that the failure threshold would be 262 cal/g at the pellet surface. Only the fourth experiment phase (527 cal/g) resulted in a pressure pulse upon rod failure. The best indication of source pressure was the reading from a 69 MPa EG&G pressure transducer at the flow shroud inlet. This pressure transducer indicated a pressure pulse upon rod failure of 28. 2 MPa with a rise time of 1. 6 ms. The source pressure was attenuated considerably outside the shroud region as indicated by pressure transducers in the upper plenum of the in-pile tube and in the flow bypass region. The maximum pressure indicated outside the flow shroud was 2. 1 MPa. In general, instrumentation sensitivity to radiation was minimal. The most significant instrumentation problem during the power bursts was a false flowrate indication by the flow turbines. This problem is being examined. The Kaman and Bell & Howell pressure transducers showed the least sensitivity to radiation of the pressure measurement devices. The EG&G transducers were most sensitive. The locked linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) gave no indication of radiation sensitivity as its response during the burst was a straight line. The strain gages were very sensitive to radiation, indicating a strain increase of 70 % with the second burst of RIA-ST- 1. The Type S thermocouple did not exhibit significant radiation sensitivity. In addition, the RIA Scoping Test has provided data on the consequences of fuel rod failure during a RIA event at BWR hot startup conditions. Posttest examination of the fuel rods from the first two phases of the test revealed large quantities of UO{sub 2 } fuel missing from the cladding. Fuel rod failures for energy depositions near the failure threshold in previous closed capsule tests without forced coolant flow resulted in only a slight amount of fuel loss...|$|R
