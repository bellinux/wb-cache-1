40|$|ABSTRACT The {{importance}} ofzinc {{for human}} health was first documented in 1963. During the past 25 y, deficiency of zinc in humans due to nutritional factors and several disease states has now been recognized. The high phytate content of <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins</b> is known to decrease the availability of zinc, thus the prevalence of zinc deficiency {{is likely to be}} high in a population consuming large quantities of <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins.</b> Alcoholism, malabsorption, sickle cell anemia, chronic renal disease, and chronically de-bilitating diseases are now known to be predisposing factors for zinc deficiency. A spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild to severe degree have now been recognized in human zinc-deficiency states. Zinc is required for many biological functions including DNA synthesis, cell division, and gene expression. It is required for the activity of many enzymes in biological systems.

50|$|<b>Cereals</b> <b>proteins</b> {{have low}} quality, due to {{deficiencies}} in essential amino acids, mainly lysine. Supplementation of <b>cereals</b> with <b>proteins</b> from other food sources (mainly legumes) {{is commonly used}} to compensate for this deficiency, since the limitation of a single essential amino acid causes the others to break down and become excreted, which is especially important {{during the period of}} growth. In contrast, the proteins of the pseudocereals have a high nutritional value, close to those of casein (the main protein in milk). Quinoa and amaranth are the most nutritious grains due to their high content and quality of proteins, with high levels of lysine and other essential amino acids. Minor cereals and pseudocereals are a good alternative to replace gluten-containing cereals, for people who need to follow a gluten-free diet.|$|R
40|$|Plastics {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used materials today in an immense range of applications. Since plastics originate from petroleum, which is not a renewable resource, we need to find alternatives to achieve environmentally sustainable goals. One of our most abundant renewable resources is cereals; wheat gluten is recognized as a replacement for synthetic plastics. Another <b>cereal</b> <b>protein</b> is pennisetin from pearl millet, which can grow in more arid areas and is therefore an important crop in times of climate change. In contrast to gluten, the material properties of pennisetin have as yet been relatively unexplored. This work evaluated the mechanical and barrier properties of pennisetin films, including three different plasticizers (glycerol only, glycerol/citric acid mixture, and glycerol/lactic acid/polyethylene glycol mixture). The films were cast from ethanol solutions. It was found that all of the three plasticizers resulted in approximately equal thermomechanical properties in the pennisetin films. However, the glycerol/citric acid mixture seemed to give more beneficial tensile and barrier properties. The advantage of this plasticizer mixture was believed to be due to the altered microstructure of the films. The material properties of pennisetin were found to be fully comparable to those of other <b>cereal</b> <b>protein</b> materials...|$|R

40|$|Materials {{that are}} {{renewable}} and biodegradable are demanded for environmental reasons. Biopolymeric materials, such as materials from starch and <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins,</b> are both renewable and biodegradable. However, starch and cereal protein materials are generally rather brittle and therefore {{need to be}} plasticized to become more flexible. Investigations were made of physical properties, such as thermomechanical, tensile and barrier properties, of starch and proteins from maize, oats and sorghum with different levels of plasticizers. Avenin was weaker {{than the other two}} <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins</b> but more extensible at low plasticizer contents. Zein was the most extensible of the films with high plasticizer content. The manufacturing conditions of films made of high amylose maize starch affected the molecular structure of the starch as determined by light microscopy and size exclusion chromatography, which in turn affected the film forming properties. The mechanical properties were not significantly affected by the manufacturing conditions, however, and the films were found to be equally strong and extensible as zein and kafirin films with similar plasticizer contents. The mechanical properties of native starches were highly dependent on their amylose content, and to some extent also on their phosphate content. Films from pure amylose were the strongest, even stronger than cereal protein films at a similar plasticizer content. Films made of potato starch with a low phosphate content seemed to possess an optimal combination of amylose and phosphate content since they displayed superior extensibility and wet resistance. Kafirin and zein exhibited approximately the same barrier properties, whereas avenin was more permeable. Due to the troublesome fragility of <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins,</b> the plasticization effect of water, glycerol and 2 -mercaptoethanol in zein films were investigated in thermomechanical and spectroscopy (infrared and dielectric) studies. It was found that the mechanisms of water and glycerol did not differ significantly from each other by the hydrogen bonding interaction with the protein.

Mice {{raised on the}} maize-based (gluten-free) diet responded well to parenteral immunization with each of six gluten-derived protein preparations (whole gliadin, two omega-gliadin fractions, wheat salt-soluble proteins, a peptic-tryptic digest and a subtilisin digest of gluten), as serum antibody levels increased at least 300 -fold in each case. In contrast, mice raised on the wheat-based diet responded poorly to immunization with either whole gliadin or omega-gliadin and were virtually non-responsive to enzymic digest of gluten. Diet {{had little effect on}} the magnitude of the antibody response to wheat salt-soluble proteins, with both groups showing a 300 -fold increase in titre. Similarly, tolerance to alpha-zeins, the alcohol-soluble proteins of maize, did not occur on either diet. However, some oral tolerance was observed to maize glutelin. The specificity of the various antibody responses was then analysed by immunoblotting. Following immunization with gluten proteins or digests, antibodies from the maize-fed mice bound more or less equally to each of the main gliadin bands and to the glutenins while the mice on the wheat-based diet had antibody specific for omega-gliadin proteins. Serum antibodies from the maize-fed mice, immunized with either alpha-zein or maize glutelin, showed even labelling of the major maize endosperm proteins while antibodies from mice on the wheat diet showed strong labelling of the Mr 27, 000 and 58, 000 bands. These results show that diet influenced the specificity, as well as the magnitude of serum antibody responses to <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins.</b> In addition, oral tolerance appeared to affect the humoral response to some <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins</b> more than others.

At a concentration of 100 mM, other reducing agents (dithiothreitol, sodium bisulfite, and L-cysteine) were equally effective in improving sorghum digestibility. When maize was cooked in the presence of 2 -mercaptoethanol, protein digestibility increased 5 % compared to 25 % for sorghum. Cooking barley, rice, and wheat with 2 -mercaptoethanol had no significant effect on protein digestibility.
