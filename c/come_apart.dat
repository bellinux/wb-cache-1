5|$|The 4th North Korean Division in the {{meantime}} was suffering serious logistical setbacks from lack of food, equipment, ammunition and, weapons. Conscripts from local South Korean villages were brought in to replace mounting losses. There was also virtually no provision for the wounded in the division, and the North Korean forces began to <b>come</b> <b>apart</b> under these stresses. Still, the division's morale remained relatively high and General Lee refused to withdraw.|$|E

The American and South Korean troops finally secured precarious possession of Battle Mountain, mainly because the supporting fire of US mortars targeting the North Korean avenues of approach {{on the western}} slope. During the day the North Koreans counterattacked the hill six times, but were repulsed each time. The 3rd Battalion, 24th Infantry units continued to <b>come</b> <b>apart</b> under fire, {{so much that the}} battalion commander complained to Kean that he needed more officers to keep the men in line. The situation in the Haman area caused Walker to alert the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, a reserve unit, for possible movement to this part of the front. However, it was never dispatched. On August 24, I and L Companies had been so racked by deserters and casualties that they withdrew from the hill. They had suffered 120 casualties during the fight. C Company, along with the ROK police, took charge of the peak.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{that tried to}} explain how prions replicate in a protein-only manner was the heterodimer model. This model assumed that a single PrPSc molecule binds to a single PrPC molecule and catalyzes its conversion into PrPSc. The two PrPSc molecules then <b>come</b> <b>apart</b> and can go on to convert more PrPC. However, a model of prion replication must explain both how prions propagate, and why their spontaneous appearance is so rare. Manfred Eigen showed that the heterodimer model requires PrPSc to be an extraordinarily effective catalyst, increasing {{the rate of the}} conversion reaction by a factor of around 1015. This problem does not arise if PrPSc exists only in aggregated forms such as amyloid, where cooperativity may act as a barrier to spontaneous conversion. What is more, despite considerable effort, infectious monomeric PrPSc has never been isolated.|$|E

25|$|During the Nixon years (and {{through the}} 1970s), the liberal {{consensus}} began to <b>come</b> <b>apart</b> {{with the election}} of Ronald Reagan marking the election of the first non-Keynsian administration and the first application of supply-side economics. The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough {{to make up for the}} loss of some Southern Democrats. A tide of conservatism rose in response to perceived failures of liberal policies. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the US and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it.|$|E

25|$|French arms at Heidelberg, Rosas, Huy, Landen, Charleroi and Marsaglia had {{achieved}} considerable battlefield success, {{but with the}} severe hardships of 1693 continuing through to the summer of 1694 France was unable to expend {{the same level of}} energy and finance for the forthcoming campaign. The crisis reshaped French strategy, forcing commanders to redraft plans to fit the dictates of fiscal shortfalls. In the background Louis XIV's agents were working hard diplomatically to unhinge the coalition but the Emperor, who had secured with the Allies his 'rights' to the Spanish succession should Charles II die during the conflict, did not desire a peace that would not prove personally advantageous. The Grand Alliance would not <b>come</b> <b>apart</b> as long as there was money available and a belief that the growing strength of their armies would soon be much greater than those of France.|$|E
25|$|The World War II era {{also brought}} on rising {{production}} costs {{that resulted in}} a reduced number of elaborate gags and outdoor sequences, Del Lord's stock in trade; as such, the quality of the team's films (particularly those directed by Lord) began to slip after 1942. According to Okuda and Watz, entries such as Loco Boy Makes Good, What's the Matador?, Sock-A-Bye Baby (all 1942), I Can Hardly Wait and A Gem of a Jam (both 1943) are considered to be lesser quality works than previous films. Spook Louder (1943), a remake of Mack Sennett's The Great Pie Mystery (1931), is often cited as the Stooges' worst film because of its repetitious and rehashed jokes. Three Smart Saps (1942), a film considered to be an improvement, features a reworking of a routine from Harold Lloyd's The Freshman (1925), in which Curly's loosely basted suit begins to <b>come</b> <b>apart</b> at the seams while he is on the dance floor.|$|E
25|$|Several early reformers {{presented}} different remedies, which when repeated {{were often}} expressed as general ideologies, e.g., the pan-Islamic, the pan-Arabic, the pan-Turkic, the nationalist. Some Islamic reforms were sourced wholly within Islam and actually pre-dated the modern, making {{no reference to}} it, e.g., wahabism. Yet reformed or not, Muslims were adopting the European inventions one piece at a time, day after day, year after year. If Muslim societies continued to so evolve {{under the influence of}} the modern, yet without a context of understanding, the coherence of tradition might <b>come</b> <b>apart.</b> Christians, too, of Europe and of the Americas, were faced with similar dilemmas, had been for centuries; their various solutions were complex and not always satisfactory, nor for everyone. Yet for Muslims the problem was different. Christians experienced modernity as generated mainly by their own creativity, which gave its possessors an initial edge over others. Muslims noticed in them a widespread increase in non-belief.|$|E

25|$|Admiral Penrose chose Gleaner to {{take the}} dispatches {{concerning}} the operation to create the bridge back to Britain, but asked Branch to wait at Saint-Jean-de-Luz {{for the arrival of}} one of General Lord Wellington's officers with dispatches from the general. The weather worsened on 1 April but Gleaner was well-anchored and prepared and rode out the storm until the morning of 2 April. Unfortunately, the storm drove a merchant sloop across Gleaners bows. Gleaners crew separated the two vessels, and the crew of the sloop was able to take shelter on the ketch before their sloop sank. As the winds worsened they drove Gleaner under the bows of a transport brig, where she became so trapped that she started to <b>come</b> <b>apart</b> from the action of the wind and waves. By 5pm Gleaner was so damaged that her crew and that of the sloop transferred to the transport brig. The combined crews were able to cut Gleaner free. The waves swept her onto the beach and she disappeared within minutes. The brig was able to rid out the storm until the next day, but then her crew was forced to cut her cables and to drive her on to the beach. All the survivors made it safely ashore. In all, the storm wrecked 17 vessels.|$|E
500|$|DNA can be twisted like a rope in {{a process}} called DNA supercoiling. With DNA in its [...] "relaxed" [...] state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound. If the DNA is twisted in the {{direction}} of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases <b>come</b> <b>apart</b> more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called topoisomerases. These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as transcription and DNA replication.|$|E
500|$|By July 30, the 24th Infantry had {{withdrawn}} {{to the last}} defensible high ground west of Sangju, [...] from the town. The North Korean troops hit the regiment with heavy attacks beginning at 05:00 that morning, targeting the 3rd Battalion's forward positions. Overstretched, lacking reserves and plagued by stragglers, the regiment began to <b>come</b> <b>apart</b> and senior commanders had to personally move into the front lines to help resist the Korean advance with their sidearms. The regiment had deteriorated so badly by this time that General Kean recalled the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, {{and placed it in}} defensive positions behind the 24th Infantry, to hold the line when the 24th withdrew. The next day North Koreans again pressed against the regiment's forward line of resistance. First Lieutenant Leon A. Gilbert, commanding A Company, and about 15 men then quit the forward line. White and other ranking officers ordered Gilbert back into position, but he refused to go, saying that he was scared. The senior noncommissioned officer returned to the forward position with the men. After regimental commanders pleaded unsuccessfully with Gilbert to return to his position, he was arrested and tried for desertion under fire, a capital offense, and sentenced to death. His sentence was later reduced to 17 years in prison, but he served only five of them.|$|E
