Construction was slightly stalled due to delays in the delivery of steel flues for the ventilation system.|$|E

In Idaho, otters and beavers were recorded in the same beaver lodge simultaneously on three separate occasions. The otters may <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> American mink (Mustela vison) for resources. In Alaska, the two species living in marine environments indicate niche separation through resource partitioning, probably related to the swimming abilities of these mustelids.|$|E

As of 2010, {{as well as the}} 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer's E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier to the A318/A319.|$|E
5|$|The Original Six era {{ended in}} 1967 when the NHL {{doubled in size}} by adding six new {{expansion}} teams. The six existing teams were formed into the newly created East Division, while the expansion teams were formed into the West Division. The NHL continued to expand, adding another six teams, to total 18 by 1974. This continued expansion was partially {{brought about by the}} NHL's attempts to <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> World Hockey Association, which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought to <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> NHL for markets and players. Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league, signing a $2.75 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets. The NHL became involved in international play in the mid-1970s, starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union, which was won by Canada with four wins, three losses, and a tie. Eventually, Soviet-Bloc players streamed into the NHL with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989.|$|E

5|$|After the lynchings {{of their}} {{prominent}} competitors, the WSGA's {{control over the}} range was undisputed, until a group of smaller ranchers led by a local cowboy named Nate Champion formed the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA) to <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> WSGA. Upon hearing this, the WSGA immediately viewed Champion's association {{as a threat to}} their hold on the stock interests. The WSGA then blacklisted members of the NWFSGA from the round-ups in order to stop their operations. However, the latter refused the orders to disband and instead publicly announced their plans to hold their own round-up in the spring of 1892.|$|E

5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling to <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live.

After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York-Pittsfield round trips with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington-Pittsfield commuter trip operated by a rail bus. After 1935, nonstop New York-Pittsfield weekend trips were added for skiers during the winter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1900 {{baseball}} season, the Western League {{was positioned}} by its president, Ban Johnson, as a new major league that would <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> established National League (NL). The league was reorganized and renamed the American League (AL), and eight cities fielded teams in the 1901 season. A Baltimore team had played in the NL through the 1899 season, after which the club was shut down by the league. Baltimore was one of three former NL cities where the AL placed teams in an effort to reach underserved fans. The new Orioles' first manager was John McGraw, who had held the same position for the previous Baltimore team in 1899; McGraw also held an ownership stake.|$|E
