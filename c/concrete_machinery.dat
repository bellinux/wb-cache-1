40|$|Writing of this {{bachelor}} thesis was {{stimulated by}} {{the construction of a}} new production hall in my hometown. It had been a long time since a similar project was dealt with in this town, and therefore it aroused my interest. The bachelor thesis includes the description and technical documentation for the construction of the reinforced concrete building frame of the production hall of the M&T company in Dobruška. The aim of this thesis is to solve the method and potential problems of the construction. I focused on the ceiling of the administrative part of the building. Contrary to the original technical documentation, I suggested cheaper and more time-saving solution of the ceiling: using the prestressed hollow core slab SPIROLL instead of the reinforced concrete composite floor slab FILIGRAN and concreting of the ceiling. I suggested this solution on the basis of my personal experience with the implementation of various types of the ceiling, and the subsequent analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. My suggested solution of the ceiling caused the reduction of this stage’s costs by 13 % and the time reduction by 71 % of working time. The other aim of this thesis was to solve the problems with the excessive and oversize transportation of the reinforced concrete roof trusses. In the end, these transportation problems together with the financial aspects resulted in the revision of the original technical documentation. The investor decided for the less demanding solution of the construction and for the shorter span of the hall. As for the <b>concreting</b> <b>machinery,</b> I suggested to use the machines (mixer truck and mobile concrete pump) from the nearby concrete plant to reduce the total transportation costs. The main contribution of the bachelor thesis is acquaintance with the construction of the reinforced concrete building frame and with practical verification and comparison of two different solutions of one construction with respect to the financial and time investment...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} the early developmental history of concrete block in America with special attention {{being placed on}} the {{years leading up to}} the St. Louis Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904. In general, the history of concrete block in contemporary building material histories begins with the innovations in block machinery that took place {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century. However, the history of concrete block begins much earlier than these innovations. Harmon S. Palmer invented the first commercially successful concrete block machine in 1900, but there were many reasons why concrete block became widely used during the first half of the 20 th century. The establishments of a domestic Portland cement industry, the innovations in <b>concrete</b> block <b>machinery,</b> and the marketing and promotion of concrete and concrete block at the 1904 St. Louis Louisiana Purchase Exposition, are all major reasons why concrete block began to be widely used in America.

Larsen's Consolidated plant, to the north, is located alongside a large tailings dam site over Tunnel Creek. The area of mill sands extends north for over 200m. The Consolidated plant is centred around a partly intact Huntington mill, which is seated on a heavy concrete base. A suction gas producer is situated alongside. Larsen's Deep shaft, to the east, includes several small <b>concrete</b> <b>machinery</b> mounts around a caved shaft and a vertical boiler and winch.

These foundations are located immediately adjacent to the remains of the former Lahey's railway siding and are interpreted as part of the infrastructure used to load timber onto trains heading from the mill on the government Canungra-Logan Village branch line and also possibly related to the later Standply Timber Company veneer and plywood operations. There are potentially substantial subsurface archaeological deposits located in the vicinity of these surface remains as the area shows little evidence of recent subsurface disturbance though it may have been affected by works associated with the construction of Easement B on RP181573.|$|E

For this reason, systems for the diagnosis of possible failures represent a particularly attractive solution. In this paper a healthmonitoring algorithm for a specific kind of construction <b>machinery</b> (<b>concrete</b> displacing booms) is proposed. It is based on the knowledge of the geometrical and dynamic parameters of the boom, estimated through a stand-alone self-learning procedure. The proposed algorithm is able to signal alarms due to the most common failure conditions, such as overload or crack propagation. In detail, the crack propagation is detected through an Extended Kalman Filter (which identifies the variation of the boom natural frequencies during its lifetime), while the overload is estimated through force sensors mounted on the actuators. The results referred to this algorithm, numerically simulated and experimentally reproduced on a specific test rig, are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{arch bridge}} is very strong. It looks like half a circle. Arch bridges {{used to be}} made of stone. The problem was that until the last block was in place, these bridges were {{unstable}} and could fall down. Construction field in Sri Lanka has lot of arch shape structures such as Buddhist Temples, Muslim mosque etc therefore aesthetic view of arch shape bridges are better than other shapes. Traditionally, arch bridges were constructed of stone, brick or mass concrete since these materials are very strong in compression and the arch could be configured so that tensile stresses did not develop. Contractors are not motivated to construct arch bridges due to difficulties of construction. If there is a simple method to construct an arch bridge it is economical and quick because of flow of the stream or flood will not be disturbed to the construction. Heavy machineries or advanced technology does not matter and local labour force can be utilized. In the locations which are inaccessible to transport material or heavy <b>machineries,</b> <b>concrete</b> arch is a solution with a suitable falsework. Most bridges in Sri Lanka are constructed over water ways therefore during the construction period finding a supporting base to construct an arch structure is very hard. Also river beds are located far below from the deck level of bridge and erection of stable falsework support will be another difficult task. These are the problems in arch bridge construction within the available technology of construction in Sri Lanka and tend to existing arch bridges are limited to short spans. The objective of this research was to obtaining an economical solution for this problem. In point form the scope of this research includes  find the possible methods to construct concrete arch bridges.  materials have to be used for falsework for construction of concrete Arch Bridges.  Types of Trusses possible to use as falsework. At the design stage of concrete arch bridge, suitable falsework truss also should be designed to get the support to construct the bridge. Similar to benefit of scaffoldings to building construction, falsework truss also will be benefited to arch bridge construction. It will facilitate to select different models of falsework truss for construction of various types of concrete arch bridges with higher spans or different curvatures. Steel trusses design for falsework is ideal solution because mainly simplicity of its erection process. Another option is a timber falsework for the construction of concrete arch bridge. Cost of the timber falsework is obviously high where the locations of long span of arch bridges or high level difference between river and deck of bridge. Within the Types of steel trusses economical one also has to be identified because of their cost of material and cost of fabrication. The types of steel trusses commonly used are Howe truss, Modified Howe truss, Pratt Truss or Warren Truss. Structural analysis computer software SAP 2000 was used to analyse trusses to achieve the objectives of the research. Based on the analysis of this research Modified Howe truss fabricated by steel angle iron is successful as economical falsework solution to the construction of concrete arch bridges in Sri Lanka...|$|R
