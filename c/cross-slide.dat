50|$|The <b>cross-slide</b> (3) {{rides on}} the {{carriage}} {{and has a}} feedscrew that travels {{at right angles to}} the main spindle axis. This permits facing operations to be performed, and the depth of cut to be adjusted. This feedscrew can be engaged, through a gear train, to the feed shaft (mentioned previously) to provide automated 'power feed' movement to the <b>cross-slide.</b> On most lathes, only one direction can be engaged at a time as an interlock mechanism will shut out the second gear train.|$|E

50|$|Metalworking lathes have a {{carriage}} (comprising a saddle and apron) {{topped with a}} <b>cross-slide,</b> which is a flat piece that sits crosswise {{on the bed and}} can be cranked at right angles to the bed. Sitting atop the cross slide is usually another slide called a compound rest, which provides 2 additional axes of motion, rotary and linear. Atop that sits a toolpost, which holds a cutting tool, which removes material from the workpiece. There {{may or may not be}} a leadscrew, which moves the <b>cross-slide</b> along the bed.|$|E

50|$|In a single-spindle machine, {{these four}} {{operations}} {{would most likely}} be performed sequentially, with four <b>cross-slides</b> each coming into position in turn to perform their operation. In a multi-spindle machine, each station corresponds to a stage in the production sequence through which each piece is then cycled, all operations occurring simultaneously, but on different pieces of work, {{in the manner of}} an assembly line.|$|R
50|$|In {{robotics}} a manipulator is {{a device}} used to manipulate materials without direct contact. The applications were originally {{for dealing with}} radioactive or biohazardous materials, using robotic arms, or they were used in inaccessible places. In more recent developments they {{have been used in}} diverse range of applications including welding automation, robotically-assisted surgery and in space. It is an arm-like mechanism that consists of a series of segments, usually sliding or jointed called <b>cross-slides,</b> which grasp and move objects with a number of degrees of freedom.|$|R
50|$|In 1927, stereo {{cameras were}} {{developed}} {{and added to}} the slit lamp to further its use and application. In 1930, Rudolf Theil further developed the slit lamp, encouraged by Hans Goldmann. Horizontal and vertical co-ordinate adjustments were performed with three control elements on the <b>cross-slide</b> stage. The common swivel axis for microscope and illumination system {{was connected to the}} <b>cross-slide</b> stage, which allowed it to be brought to any part of the eye to be examined. A further improvement was made in 1938. A control lever or joystick was used {{for the first time to}} allow for horizontal movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} rest (or top slide) (2) is usually where {{the tool post}} is mounted. It provides a smaller amount of movement (less than the <b>cross-slide)</b> along its axis via another feedscrew. The {{compound rest}} axis can be adjusted independently of the carriage or <b>cross-slide.</b> It is used for turning tapers, to control depth of cut when screwcutting or precision facing, or to obtain finer feeds (under manual control) than the feed shaft permits. Usually, the compound rest has a protractor marked in its base (2b), enabling the operator to adjust its axis to precise angles.|$|E

50|$|Woodturning {{and metal}} {{spinning}} lathes {{do not have}} <b>cross-slides,</b> but rather have banjos, which are flat pieces that sit crosswise on the bed. The position of a banjo can be adjusted by hand; no gearing is involved. Ascending vertically from the banjo is a tool-post, {{at the top of}} which is a horizontal tool-rest. In woodturning, hand tools are braced against the tool rest and levered into the workpiece. In metal spinning, the further pin ascends vertically from the tool rest and serves as a fulcrum against which tools may be levered into the workpiece.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} work explores computer-aided {{approach to the}} design of ten different couplings, viz a viz: flange, solid rigid, hollow rigid, old ham / <b>cross-sliding,</b> pin type flexible, sleeve, seller cone/ compression, split muff, pulley flange and fairbian’s lap-box couplings. The approach utilizes standard design equations of these couplings and link them together in computer software to determine the design parameters of the couplings. The work reviews the procedural steps involved in the design of couplings and the development of the software package using java as a tool for the design and dratfting of couplings. The design software named COUPLINGCAD combines with sketch template of a single process so as to generate the required parameters of the couplings. The COUPLINGCAD was tested with a number of case studies and the results obtained therein were quite satisfactory...|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} 1926, the slit lamp {{instrument}} was redesigned. The vertical {{arrangement of the}} projector {{made it easy to}} handle. For the first time, the axis through the patient’s eye was fixed along a common swiveling axis, although the instrument still lacked a coordinate <b>cross-slide</b> stage for instrument adjustment. The importance of focal illumination had not yet been fully recognized.|$|E
50|$|A gang-tool lathe is {{one that}} has a row of tools set up on its <b>cross-slide,</b> which is long and flat and is similar to a milling machine table. The idea is {{essentially}} the same as with turret lathes: to set up multiple tools and then easily index between them for each part-cutting cycle. Instead of being rotary like a turret, the indexable tool group is linear.|$|E
5000|$|Facing in {{the context}} of turning work {{involves}} moving the cutting tool at right angles to the axis of rotation of the rotating workpiece. This can be performed by the operation of the <b>cross-slide,</b> if one is fitted, as distinct from the longitudinal feed (turning). It is frequently the first operation performed in the production of the workpiece, and often the last—hence the phrase [...] "ending up".|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a fast method for {{registration}} of multiple large, digitised whole-slide images (WSIs) of serial histology sections. Through <b>cross-slide</b> WSI registration, it becomes possible to select and analyse a common visual field across images of several serial section stained with different protein markers. It is, therefore, a critical first step for any downstream co-localised <b>cross-slide</b> analysis. The proposed registration method uses a two-stage approach, first estimating a fast initial alignment using the tissue sections’ external boundaries, followed by an efficient refinement process guided by key biological structures within the visual field. We show that this method is able to produce a high quality alignment {{in a variety of}} circumstances, and demonstrate that the refinement is able to quantitatively improve registration quality. In addition, we provide a case study that demonstrates how the proposed method for <b>cross-slide</b> WSI registration could be used as part of a specific co-expression analysis framework. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and manufacture of a fluidic variable event control system for turret lathes, which can be programmed to give any desired tool-slide length of travel in increments of 0. 001 inch. The system consists of pneumatic-hydraulic machine actuating cylinders, fitted with sensors to provide machine information, and a control cabinet containing the logic, counter, address and programme systems. Control of events, such as the engagement of the <b>cross-slide,</b> change of feed etc., have been related to the ram-slide motion; fluid displaced from the ram-slide actuating cylinder is metered into either a storage tank or slave cylinders in the control cabinet which, repeat and amplify the motion. Sensing units fitted to the slave cylinders, are programmed to inform the Logic System when the machine slide has travelled the required distance for an event, which initiates command signals to the address system. Programming a selection of events, their sequence and distance to be travelled by a tooling arrangement is achieved by sing multi-channel selector units. Each unit has six programme channels and controls and event, such as the rate of feed for each turret face. On receipt of a start signal, programme channel number 1 of each selector unit is energised, turret face number 1 is presented to the component material and the events programmed take place. When the sequence of operations for that turret face have been completed, the slides return to their starting point. Indexing of the turret to present face number 2 energises programme channel number 2 to control events for this face. This process is repeated until turret face number 6 and programme channel number 6 has been used; the component has now been completed and the cycle is repeated. The programme is not pre-determined such as when using plug board, punched card or tape, and can be varied by shop floor personnel adjusting the programme selector units while the machine is in operation. This feature not only enables component lengths to be adjusted, but as the choice of such events as speed, feed, or when to start the <b>cross-slide</b> may be varied to suit the actual working conditions, optimum production performance is more readily achieved...|$|E
40|$|DE 102008027524 B 3 UPAB: 20090928 NOVELTY - The {{laser cutting}} unit is moved conventionally, {{relative}} to the workpiece (1. 4). In a novel arrangement, the cutting nozzle (1. 3) fastened to the cutting head (1) can also be moved in two axial directions, parallel {{to the surface of}} the workpiece. This additional movement is caused by a separate drive system. The new arrangement increases the working area of the laser cutter. The focusing optic (1. 2) is a telecentric planar field optic and/or a telecentric F-theta optic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The cutting nozzle rotates about an axis directed at right angles to the workpiece surface. The rotational axis of the nozzle, or of its opening, is located eccentrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the cutting head. An eccentric drive moves the cutting nozzle. A double-eccentric drive is used, with two drive motors. These are independently-controlled. The eccentric drives are connected. They are arranged one inside the other, or one above the other. Through combined nozzle movement and beam (10) deflection, the operational area achieved on the workpiece reaches at least 7 mm 2. The cutting nozzle is alternatively moved by two independently-controlled linear drives. The drives used are: moving coil, pneumatic or hydraulic. The linear drives act on the cutting nozzle from the radial exterior of the unit, and are articulated to it. The laser beam and cutting gas are directed through the nozzle onto the workpiece. The nozzle opening is circular, elliptical or slot-shaped. The nozzle is held by a <b>cross-slide</b> assembly with linear drives to each slide. The beam deflection includes an oscillatory motion. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR the corresponding laser cutting method. USE - Agile laser cutting equipment with a mirror deflecting the focused beam. ADVANTAGE - By superimposing mechanical and optical deflections, variation of cutting direction can be achieved with smaller radii. This accelerates the cutting operation, increasing production and saving cutting gas. At the same time, stressing of the equipment by accelerations and torques is reduced. Wear is reduced and equipment life is extended. Movements of individual drives become smoother. Agility is increased without increase in the size of the gas opening, so cutting gas is conserved. The additional drives permit simpler optics to be used if required. This minimizes cost. Advantages of differing types of nozzle drives are discussed further in the disclosure. Gas flow is readily matched with the cutting requirement and either conical-cylindrical or Laval nozzles can be used...|$|E
