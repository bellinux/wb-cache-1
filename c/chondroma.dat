30|$|Another {{issue to}} {{consider}} when doing a biopsy is that histologically differentiating between <b>chondromas</b> and low-grade chondrosarcomas may be difficult even for experienced pathologists, mainly because differentiation is observer-dependent, especially when only a small tissue sample is available (Evans et al. 1977; Mankin et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Chondromas</b> and chondrosarcomas of the cranial base {{are rare}} {{neoplastic}} diseases. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the diagnosis and microsurgical treatment of these difficult cranial base tumors. A total of 19 patients who underwent microsurgery were pathologically diagnosed with cranial base <b>chondromas</b> or chondrosarcomas and their clinical data was reviewed. The <b>chondromas</b> and chondrosarcomas of the cranial base in the present study commonly originated in the sphenopetrosal, sphenoclival or petroclival junctions, and the majority were located in the parasellar region of the middle cranial base extradurally. The most frequent symptoms were headaches and cranial nerve palsy, and the Karnofsky perfor-mance score (KPS), assessed pre-operatively, averaged at 87. 1. A frontotemporal or preauricular subtemporal‑infratemporal approach was used in 11 cases, a tempo-occipital transtento-rial or presigmoid supratentorial-infratentorial approach was employed in six further cases, and the far-lateral or retrosi-gmoid approach was applied in the remaining two cases. A total or near-total tumor removal was secured in 13 cases, while a subtotal removal was obtained in another five and a partial removal was achieved in one case. The most common post-operative complications included cranial nerve palsy and cerebrospinal fluid leakage, but there were no post‑operative fatalities. A total of 15 patients were followed up for a mean of 67. 2 months (range, 5 ‑ 140 months), and 13 (76. 5 %) of these patients were living normal lives (KPS, 80 ‑ 90). There were two patients with recurrent tumors. The neuroradiological examinations and the presenting symptoms and signs allow the pre-operative diagnosis to be presumed for the majority of cranial base <b>chondromas</b> or chondrosarcomas. Surgical resec-tion is the key treatment for these tumors, and this treatment is known to improve the survival rates...|$|R
40|$|Extraskeletal {{osteochondroma}} is {{a variant}} of extraskeletal <b>chondromas</b> that are uncommon soft-tissue cartilaginous tumors.

50|$|Cartilage tumors form in Cartilage tissue. They can {{be either}} benign (<b>Chondroma)</b> or {{malignant}} (chondrosarcoma). Frequently these tumors appear in bone, and not in pre-existing cartilage tissue. In some cases tumors that formed in other tissues may produce a cartilage-like matrix, {{an example of this}} is the pleomorphic adenoma of the sexual reproduction salivary glands.|$|E
5000|$|Carney triad (CT), {{named for}} J Aidan Carney, is {{considered}} to be a specific type of multiple endocrine neoplasia(MEN). The three classically associated tumors are a subset of gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (it is now known that this subset is actually gastrointestinal stromal tumor arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal), pulmonary <b>chondroma,</b> and extra-adrenal paraganglioma.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{conditions}} may cause symptoms and signs similar to diabetic myonecrosis and include: deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, cellulitis, fasciitis, abscess, haematoma, myositis, pseudothrombophlebitis (ruptured synovial cyst), pyomyositis, parasitic myositis, osteomyelitis, calcific myonecrosis, myositis ossificans, diabetic myotrophy, muscle strain or rupture, bursitis, vasculitis, arterial occlusion, haemangioma, lymphoedema, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease, amyloidosis, as well as tumours of lipoma, <b>chondroma,</b> fibroma, leiomyoma and sarcoma.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} cause to exclude {{is a form}} of lung cancer, including rare forms such as primary pulmonary lymphoma, carcinoid tumor and a solitary metastasis to the lung (common unrecognised primary tumor sites are melanomas, sarcomas or testicular cancer). Benign tumors in the lung include hamartomas and <b>chondromas.</b>|$|R

50|$|Most GISTs are sporadic. Less than 5% {{occur as}} part of {{hereditary}} familial or idiopathic multitumor syndromes. These include, in descending order of frequency, neurofibromatosis Recklinghausen (NF-1), Carney's triad (gastric GIST, pulmonary <b>chondroma</b> and extra-adrenal paraganglioma), germline gain-of-function mutations in c-Kit/PDGFRA, and the Carney-Stratakis syndrome. The Carney-Stratakis syndrome is a dyad of hereditary GIST and paraganglioma, that is caused by germline mutations in the mitochondrial tumor suppressor gene pathway involving the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits SDHD, SDHC and SDHB. Carney's triad does not feature SDH mutations.|$|E
50|$|Fractures and dislocations {{were very}} {{uncommon}} in Pacatnamu, but the archaeologists found {{two examples of}} previously healed fractures, one case of multiple unhealed fractures and one case of a severe spinal injury, it was a skeleton belonging to a middle aged woman whose spine fractured at a 90 degree angle they stabilized the fracture and kept her at that angle {{for the rest of}} her life. Her knees showed some sings of stress and the archaeologists agree she continued to move around and function after the injury. There was also one case of an extensive injury to an adult males left eye; it is likely he lost the use of this eye in response to the injury or infection. (Donnan and Cock 1986)The archaeologists found two cases of tumors both were most likely benign and cartilaginous in nature. The first example was discovered in a young male's femur the second case was found in a male's left thumb, it was growing in the bone shaft, this is known as <b>Chondroma.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Benign {{neoplasms}} {{are typically}} {{but not always}} composed of cells which bear a strong resemblance to a normal cell type in their organ of origin. These tumors are named for the cell or tissue type from which they originate, followed by the suffix [...] "-oma" [...] (but not -carcinoma, -sarcoma, or -blastoma, which are generally cancers). For example, a lipoma is a common benign tumor of fat cells (lipocytes), and a <b>chondroma</b> is a benign tumor of cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). Adenomas are benign tumors of gland-forming cells, and are usually specified further by their cell or organ of origin, as in hepatic adenoma (a benign tumor of hepatocytes, or liver cells). Teratomas contain many cell types such as skin, nerve, brain and thyroid, among others, because they are derived from germ cells. Hamartomas are a group of benign tumors that have relatively normal cellular differentiation but {{the architecture of the}} tissue is disorganised. There are a few cancers with 'benign-sounding' names which have been retained for historical reasons, including melanoma (a cancer of pigmented skin cells, or melanocytes) and seminoma (a cancer of male reproductive cells). Skin tags, vocal chord polyps and hyperplastic polyps of the colon are often referred to as benign but they are actually overgrowths of normal tissue rather than neoplasms.|$|E
30|$|Skeletal {{scintigraphy}} with technetium {{reveals a}} slight increase in concentration in <b>chondromas.</b> The concentration is greater in chondrosarcoma lesions, particularly in the more peripheral areas of an active lesion, which cause erosion and cortical bone reaction. However, because these are slow-growing lesions, even in the case of chondrosarcomas, bone destruction, which causes neogenesis, is small.|$|R
40|$|The Carney triad {{is a rare}} {{syndrome}} {{of unknown}} aetiology, with synchronous or metachronous appearance of rare neoplasms: gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), pulmonary <b>chondromas</b> and extra‐adrenal paragangliomas. In most cases, the Carney triad is incomplete. The combination encountered typically, GISTs and pulmonary <b>chondromas,</b> was also seen in our patient, a 22 ‐year‐old woman. She was diagnosed with the triad after Billroth II gastrectomy for histologically proved gastric GISTs. The diagnosis of pulmonary <b>chondromas</b> was confirmed by transthoracic, computed tomography‐guided needle biopsy. An oesophageal leiomyoma was resected 2  years after the initial diagnosis, on suspicion of paraganglioma. The clinical course of the patient has been uneventful since. The last follow‐up was carried out 6  years after the initial diagnosis. On histological examination, the cells of gastric GIST were partly positive for CD 34, whereas CD 117 was expressed in all areas in variable intensity and S‐ 100 protein was negative. The oesophageal tumour was classified as leiomyoma due to strong immunopositivity for smooth muscle actin and desmin, being negative for CD 34 and CD 117. Two different gastric GIST lesions {{as well as the}} oesophageal leiomyoma and normal tissue were analysed for activating mutations in common hot spots of KIT (exon 9 and 11) and platelet‐derived growth factor receptor α (exon 18), but in all probes wild‐type sequences were found. These results are in accordance with the first published analyses of GIST lesions from Carney patients...|$|R

30|$|Treatment for <b>chondromas</b> is {{different}} from that for chondrosarcomas. Benign cartilaginous lesions can be treated conservatively. When we face a chondrosarcoma, the curettage plus cryotherapy and cementation or wide resection would be the most frequent options of treatment. We have to consider the possibility of the progression of the cancer cells inside the medullary canal and destruction of the cortical bone reaching the soft tissue, with a chance of progressing to the extra-cortical compartment and invading the soft tissue as well as metastasizing to the lungs. Early diagnosis of chondrosarcoma is important in oncological practice.|$|R
