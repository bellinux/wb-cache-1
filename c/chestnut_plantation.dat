Approximately 343 acre of plantation forests were established within the Zoar Valley Multiple Use Area during the 1960s and 1970s. Most are composed of non-native conifers, although several native hardwood plantations are present as well. Modern timber harvests by the state are intended to encourage native species growth and improve wildlife habitat. An American <b>chestnut</b> <b>plantation</b> is also maintained as {{a joint venture with}} the American Chestnut Foundation, with the goal of developing chestnut blight-resistant trees.|$|E

5000|$|There is a stone {{bridge across}} Mavelščica Creek; it {{is a special}} feature of the {{municipality}} because in the past {{it was part of}} an important north-south transit route known as the [...] "Ljubelj Road" [...] connecting Salzburg and Aquileia. Because of this special function the bridge was built with special care, with large stones specially fitted to one another. The year 1666 is carved on the bridge. The bridge is occasionally referred to as [...] "Napoleon's Bridge"; although Napoleon likely crossed it, its construction {{had nothing to do with}} the movement of French troops because it predates the Napoleonic campaign by a century and a half. Circa 1970 the bridge was registered as Yugoslav cultural heritage with the highest level of protection through the efforts of Marko Mušič. The bridge was renovated in the early 1980s. Today it is part of a protected complex together with a nearby <b>chestnut</b> <b>plantation.</b>|$|E

The creation of this ecoregion was made to preserve the existing qualities and allow human/cultural interaction. Montesinho is classified into forests and woods (oak and <b>chestnut</b> <b>plantations</b> {{at the base of the}} Coroa Mountains, the Tuela and lower Baceiro Rivers); wood and pine forests (forests and shrub vegetation in the western and eastern Rio Maças, Aveleda, Portelo/Montesinho, Mofreito/Montouto, Pinheiros, Serrea da Coroa, Vilar Seco da Lomba); a sub-Atlantic mixed farming area (around the Tuela and Baceiro Rivers); open space that allow farming along the plateaus of Baçal, Aveleda, Onor, Deilão); and the granite mountains of oak and birch species, mainly within the park and Pinheiros area.|$|R

40|$|Remote sensing {{and spatial}} {{analysis}} represent useful tools for modeling species’ dispersal, characterizing {{the spread of}} invasions and the invasability of a region, and thus allowing more accurate predictions for developing mitigation strategies. American chestnut, Castanea dentata, was historically a dominant forest species in North America, but occurs only sporadically today after its functional elimination by an exotic fungal pathogen in the early 1900 ’s. In recent decades Castanea resources have increased due to restoration efforts, commercial <b>chestnut</b> <b>plantations,</b> and horticultural uses. This resurgence is threatened by an additional exotic species, the globally invasive Asian chestnut gall wasp, Dryocosmus kuriphilus. The gall wasp was first discovered in Lexington, Kentucky (USA) in 2010. We used remotely sensed data and Geographic Information Systems to describe the local distribution of the Castanea hosts, and the occurrence and dispersal of the gall wasp. We tested the hypotheses that geomorphology, Castanea occurrence, and prevailing winds influence local proliferation. We found that gall wasp spread may be attributable to host plant distribution and {{to the effects of}} prevailing winds occurring during a brief period of adult insect emergence, and is influenced by topography. Our results suggest that weather data and topographic features can be used to delineate currently infested areas and predict future gall wasp infestations...|$|R
40|$|Chestnut blight disease {{caused by}} Cryphonectria parasitica is widely {{distributed}} throughout <b>chestnut</b> tree <b>plantations</b> in Korea. We surveyed 65 sites located at 9 provinces in South Korea, and isolated 248 virulent and 3 hypovirulent strains of chestnut blight fungus. Hypovirulent strains had dsRNA virus in the cytoplasm, {{which is one}} of the typical characteristics of hypovir-ulent strains. In addition, they showed more characteristics of hypovirulent strains, i. e., suppressed conidiation, reduced pig-mentation in colony color, and reduced phenol oxidase activity as well as reduced pathogenicity. Hypovirulent strains, KCPH- 22, KCPH- 135 and KCPH- 136, had a genomic dsRNA band with the molecular weight of 12. 7 kb, which is the L-dsRNA of CHV 1. They also had a 2. 7 kb defective dsRNA band. Single conidia isolated from hypovirulent strains were cultured and various phenotypes and absence of dsRNA bands were obtained from single conidial cultures, which means that hypovir-ulence transmission is unstable in asexual reproduction and variations in viral heredity by asexual reproduction. Biocontrol trial using hypovirulent strains was also carried out in the <b>chestnut</b> tree <b>plantations,</b> and canker expansion in the treated trees was stopped and healed by callus formation at the margin of the canker. These results show the potentials in successful biocontrol of chestnut blight if the vegetatively compatible hypovirulent strains could be directly used around the canker formed by compatible virulent strains...|$|R
40|$|For a {{considerable}} {{period of time}} chestnuts were a fundamental source of food and economy {{for the people in}} the Aspromonte area. After decades in which chestnut cultivation has been neglected as a result of depopulation in mountainous zones, the production capacity in this area has reduced resulting in an erosion of the native germplasm. A survey has been carried out to improve the knowledge about the chestnut germplasm present in this area and to evaluate its qualities with the objective of preserving native genetic resources, safeguarding them from genetic erosion phenomenon and individuating local genotypes of market value which could be used to promote a re-launch of local chestnut cultivation. The research, which was carried out in 2008 on the western slopes of the Aspromonte, has led to the identification of 38 genotypes. The germplasm which was individuated has {{a considerable}} rate of variability in that it has different phenological and morphological characteristics. Overall, the 38 genotypes have a ripening period extending from the last 10 days of September until the end of October. With regard to the valuable characteristics of the nuts, the genetic material which was analysed was overall found to be of market value. Most of the genotypes have the characteristics of an episperm which can be easily removed, a seed coat which fails to penetrate the inner kernel or penetrates minimally, and a single embryo. Genotypes with these characteristics will be studied furthermore for creating new <b>chestnut</b> <b>plantations</b> in Calabria...|$|R

5000|$|The {{geographic}} conformation of Corsica, {{with its}} eastern coast (the one nearest to the continent) low, malaria-ridden and impossible to defend, forced {{the population to}} settle {{in the mountains of}} the interior. The agricultural products exported during Antiquity reflect this situation: these were sheep, plus honey, wax and tar, produced by the widespread forests. Moreover, the island was famous for its cheap wines, exported to Rome. The concentration of settlement in the interior, typical also of the nearby Sardinia, lasted until the beginning of the 20th century: in 1911, 73,000 inhabitants lived in the zone comprised between 700 and 1,000 m above sea level.In the Middle Ages, and more precisely during the 12th century, when Pisa was Corsica's hegemonic power, the large immigration from nearby Tuscany brought to the island, together with the Tuscan language, customs and dishes typical of that Italian region. Later, when it was the turn of Genoa to dominate the island, a major shift in people's eating habits took place: the Genoese governor, with a decree signed on 28 August 1548, ordered that each landowner and tenant had to plant at least a chestnut, a mulberry, an olive and a fig tree each year, under the fine of three lire for each tree not planted. The reason for this decree was to give means of subsistence to island populations: still {{at the beginning of the}} seventeenth century, the Genoese administrator Baliano wrote that the Corsicans were living on barley bread, vegetables and pure water.Other decrees on the same line, such as that issued in 1619, which ordered that ten chestnut trees had to be planted every year by each landowner and tenant, [...] with time changed radically the landscape of whole regions of the island, with the almost total substitution of cereals with chestnuts: one region, the Castagniccia, south of Bastia, got its name from its chestnut (castagnu) forests. In the 18th century the chestnut had almost completely replaced cereals. Above all <b>chestnut</b> <b>plantations</b> radically changed the diet of the islanders, preserving them from the recurrent famines. It was so that the historian of Corsica Jakob Von Wittelieb could write that in the 1730s travelers in the island brought with them a flask filled with wine and a pocket containing a chestnut bread or some roasted chestnuts.|$|R
5000|$|The Australian {{gold rush}} of the 1850s and 1860s led to the first {{recorded}} plantings of European chestnut trees, brought in from Europe by the first settlers. Along the years, most <b>chestnut</b> tree <b>plantations</b> were C. sativa stock, which is still the dominant species. Some of these are still standing today. Some trees in northern Victoria are around 120 years old and up to 60 m tall. Chestnuts grow well in southwest Western Australia, which has cold winters and warm to hot summers. As of 2008, the country has just under 350 growers, annually producing around 1,200 metric tons of chestnuts, of which 80% come from northeast Victoria. The produce is mostly sold to the domestic fresh fruit market. Chestnuts are now slowly gaining popularity in Australia. A considerable increase in production is expected in the next 10 years, due {{to the increase in}} commercial plantings during the last 15 to 25 years. By far, the most common species in Australia is the European chestnut, but small numbers of the other species, as well as some hybrids have been planted.The Japanese chestnut (C. crenata) does well in wet and humid weather and in hot summers (about 30 °C); and was introduced to New Zealand in the early 1900s, more so in the upper North Island region ...|$|R
