The <b>confravision</b> discussion thus {{had some of the}} flavour of two debating teams. It does not follow that because this was so on this occasion a <b>confravision</b> session must be structured in this way. In fact, we would not recommend that the topic be divided in this way. Rather we would suggest that both groups discuss the same topic in their own way during the concurrent sessions. Each group should then spend an extended period of time- perhaps even a day or half day- developing a summary which could be put in print andlor videotape form. After exchange of summaries and time for their consideration by the other group, a brief <b>confravision</b> link could be used to familiarize participants with the medium and to enable the theme for later discussion to be narrowed down. The conference could then reform into the concurrent sessions before selected members of each group come together again on camera for in-depth discussion in a <b>confravision</b> link over an 60 extended period. Alternatively, small teams could be established to deal with di fferent aspects of the theme with change-over of personnel taking place periodically during the confravislon link. These alternative procedures are of course only examples of the variety of ways in which a <b>confravision</b> link might be utilised. In summary, given that (1) the number of persons involved was suitable to the <b>confravision</b> facilities, (2) time was available for argument and counter-argument, and (3) <b>confravision</b> links were placed strategically in the overall conference program, fruitful academic discussion could take place, The cost of a two-hour <b>confravision</b> link is two hundred and fifty dollars: this compares favourably with the thousands of dollars involved in transporting and accommodating twenty or more interstate participants. This fact taken into account with the pilot study we have described indicates that further development and evaluation are warranted...|$|E
