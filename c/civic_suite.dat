5|$|It {{is not an}} {{administrative}} building but a <b>civic</b> <b>suite,</b> Lord Mayor's parlour and Council chamber; local government administration is centred at the nearby Municipal Buildings. The town hall was built between 1749 and 1754 to a design by John Wood the Elder replacing an earlier town hall nearby. An extension to the north designed by James Wyatt was added in 1785. Following a fire in 1795 the hall was largely rebuilt and a dome designed by Wyatt was built. Minor alterations have subsequently been made. The streets surrounding its site have altered since its initiation, notably when viewed from Castle Street, the south-side, it appears as off-centre. This is because Water Street which ran to the junction with Dale Street, the west-east axis, was continuous and built up across the junction so that the town hall was not visible originally from that aspect. The structures were removed 150 years after this to expose the building from this position.|$|E

50|$|The 1960s and 70s had a {{considerable}} {{impact on the}} architecture of Catford. The old Town Hall of 1875, {{was replaced by the}} current <b>Civic</b> <b>Suite</b> in 1968, soon after the merger of the metropolitan boroughs of Lewisham and Deptford. Laurence House, where many of the Lewisham Council offices are housed, is on the site of old St Laurence's Church. The original Gothic C of E St. Laurence Church was located where Laurence House is today (known as the Catford Cathedral), but as part of the urban renewal of Catford in the 1960s, the church is now housed in a more modern style building 200 metres down Bromley Road.|$|E

40|$|This {{conference and}} {{research}} report was produced for the Lewisham Community Police Consultative Group. On Saturday, 25 th March, 2006, {{a conference on}} 'Stop and Search: The Way Forward' {{took place in the}} <b>Civic</b> <b>Suite</b> at Lewisham Town Hall in London. The conference, organised by the Lewisham Community Police Consultative Group (LCPCG), was attended by 125 delegates, of whom 48 gave overwhelmingly positive feedback, with 77 % rating the conference as either ‘excellent’ or ‘good’. Key issues emerging from the conference were that the importance and sensitivity of stop and search to local communities was reinforced. Unfair disproportionality in stop and search practices amongst Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) communities continues to exist. Action must be taken by all parties to reduce this. There is a need for ‘good’ and fair policing, since it is the ‘manner’ of the stop that matters, not the stop itself. The ‘quality’ of the stop and search encounter is vital and needs to rely on respect shown by all parties. Clear accountability of the police and communities in this is essential. Positive demonstration of respect in stop and search is a key issue for people of all ages. The community should encourage this and measure the success of such efforts...|$|E
