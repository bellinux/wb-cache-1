Paul Bremer III as the Administrator, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) began issuing radio and television licenses in June 2003 to meet the great demand for broadcasting licenses. The licenses were issued by the CPA Senior Adviser for Telecommunications. To plan for the expected great demand, this CPA office worked with Iraqi radio-frequency spectrum engineers and managers to develop a national FM-radio and TV channel <b>allotment</b> <b>plan</b> for all of the major Iraqi cities and towns. The national plan was developed using technical criteria and the Region 1 (Europe, Africa and the Middle East)allotment plan that was developed years before by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations treaty organization. The Iraqi <b>allotment</b> <b>plan</b> consisted of hundreds of FM radio and TV stations allotted to the cities and towns. The channels in the <b>allotment</b> <b>plan</b> were then open to anyone to apply for a license for a particular channel.|$|R

40|$|Creation of an <b>Allotment</b> <b>Plan</b> for the Fixed Satellite Service at the 1988 Space World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) {{represented}} a complex satellite plan synthesis problem, involving {{a large number}} of planned and existing systems. Solutions to this problem at WARC- 88 required the use of both automated and manual procedures to develop an acceptable set of system positions. Development of an <b>Allotment</b> <b>Plan</b> may also be attempted through solution of an optimization problem, known as the Satellite Location Problem (SLP). Three automated heuristic procedures, developed specifically to solve SLP, are presented. The heuristics are then applied to two specific WARC- 88 scenarios. Solutions resulting from the fully automated heuristics are then compared with solutions obtained at WARC- 88 through a combination of both automated and manual planning efforts...|$|R

The planning approach is described in detail and is related to the objectives of the conference. Computer software has been developed to implement the concepts, and the logic and rationale for identifying predetermined arc segments is discussed. Example scenarios are evaluated to give guidance in the selection of the technical characteristics of space communications systems to be <b>planned.</b> The <b>allotment</b> <b>planning</b> concept described guarantees equitable access to the geostationary orbit, provides flexibility in implementation, and reduces the need for coordination among administrations...|$|R

40|$|The Numerical Arc Segmentation Algorithm for a Radio Conference (NASARC) {{provides}} {{a method of}} generating predetermined arc segments {{for use in the}} development of an <b>allotment</b> <b>planning</b> procedure to be carried out at the 1988 World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) on the Use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit and the Planning of Space Services Utilizing It. Through careful selection of the predetermined arc (PDA) for each administration, flexibility can be increased in terms of choice of system technical characteristics and specific orbit location while reducing the need for coordination among administrations. The NASARC software determines pairwise compatibility between all possible service areas at discrete arc locations. NASARC then exhaustively enumerates groups of administrations whose satellites can be closely located in orbit, and finds the arc segment over which each such compatible group exists. From the set of all possible compatible groupings, groups and their associated arc segments are selected using a heuristic procedure such that a PDA is identified for each administration. Various aspects of the NASARC concept and how the software accomplishes specific features of <b>allotment</b> <b>planning</b> are discussed...|$|R
