5|$|Stone {{hoped to}} earn {{most of her}} college {{expenses}} through teaching {{in one of the}} institute’s lower departments. But because of its policy against employing first-year students as teachers, the only work Stone could get other than teaching at district schools during the winter break was house keeping chores through the school’s manual labor program. For this she was paid three <b>cents</b> <b>an</b> hour—less than half what male students received for their work in the program. Among measures taken to reduce her expenses, Stone prepared her own meals in her dormitory room. In 1844 Stone was given a position teaching arithmetic in the Ladies Department, but again received reduced pay because of her sex.|$|E
5|$|Mary Phagan {{was born}} on June 1, 1899, into an {{established}} Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. That spring, Phagan took {{a job with the}} National Pencil Company, where she earned ten <b>cents</b> <b>an</b> hour operating a knurling machine that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week. She worked {{on the second floor of}} the factory in the metal room in a section called the tipping department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{accuracy}} of ultrasonography and arthrography in {{the prediction of}} lesions of the rota-tor cuff was evaluated and compared with the opera-tive findings in a retrospective study of forty-nine patients (forty-nine shoulders). In the detection of full-thickness (stage-Ill) tears of the rotator cuff, ultra-sonography had an over-all sensitivity of 74 per <b>cent,</b> <b>a</b> specificity of 95 per <b>cent,</b> <b>an</b> {{accuracy of}} 84 per <b>cent,</b> <b>a</b> predictive value of a positive test of 95 per <b>cent,</b> and <b>a</b> predictive value of a negative test of 75 per cent.

25|$|The {{hearings}} {{opened with}} the Steelworkers arguing for a wage and benefit increase estimated between 30 and 50 <b>cents</b> <b>an</b> hour, while the employers claimed no increase whatsoever was possible without price relief. ODM director Charles E. Wilson {{made it clear}} in a public statement on January 15 that the administration's inflation program would be wrecked if the workers succeeded in winning a wage increase larger than 4 <b>cents</b> <b>an</b> hour. Office of Price Stabilization economists were disturbed by the union's request. A secret internal memorandum by OPS staff members indicated that the union was actually due a 22-cents-an-hour wage increase, and that the steel companies could absorb up to 40 <b>cents</b> <b>an</b> hour in additional costs without a price hike. But for the union to win a wage increase without giving the employers price relief would appear inequitable and create political problems for both OPS and WSB with Republicans in Congress.|$|E
