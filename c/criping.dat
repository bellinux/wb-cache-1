After researching Tiger through pictures and films, <b>Cripe</b> set out on what would soon become known as Lightning Bolt, again named for its inlay. The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and East Indian rosewood for the body, which, with admitted irony from <b>Cripe,</b> {{had been taken from}} a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers. Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. Soon after, Garcia requested that <b>Cripe</b> build a backup of the guitar. <b>Cripe,</b> who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to [...] "wing it." ...|$|R

40|$|As {{thousands}} of permanent and seasonal farmworkers have descended upon the Coachella Valley a major housing crisis has occurred. Despite {{the long hours}} migrant workers spend working in the fields, they receive insufficient payment from their labor for living and housing expenses. Year after year, as the workers produce billions for the local economy, many find themselves living out of their car or sleeping on a dusty mattress in a parking lot. This has partially been a result of low wages, as well as restricting legislation that has left many families on the streets. In response, my teammate and I attempted {{to address the issue}} at the architectural scale this past fall during the 2014 <b>Cripe</b> Design Competition. We provided strategies which lowered utility costs while also empowering the residents to live better lives. Though the issue can by no means be solved through architectural design alone, we are hoping that ours would enrich the lives of those migrant workers that live there.

40|$|With rising {{demands for}} ecologically {{friendly}} architecture and sustainable design solutions, the Ball State department of Architecture fourth year undergraduate capstone assignment was {{to design a}} Ball State University Center for the Environment. This {{was to be a}} comprehensive project involving all of the knowledge of our undergraduate career. It was also to be a design competition sponsored by <b>CRIPE</b> Architects + Engineers. The building site was located on Ball State's campus between the existing Teacher's College building and the Arts and Journalism Building. Trying to fit into the existing context and continue the internal "street" of the connecting buildings on campus, the challenge was to create an icon of sustainability for an ever-greening campus. The building was not only to showcase sustainability in its architecture and mechanics, but also in its function. It would become a laboratory and lecture hall location on campus as well as showcasing sustainability in exhibit halls and a state of the art natural water treatment facility. With the help of my professor and advisor Michele Chiuini, I was able to design this project. I have provided a brief analysis of the project requirements and my design solution as well as drawings and images showcasing the project's process and final design.
