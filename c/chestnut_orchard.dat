5000|$|The {{chestnut}} weevil (Curculio elephas) most often damages the fruits. In Hungary, it swarms in <b>chestnut</b> <b>orchards</b> around August 20, particularly strongly around noon and in sunny weather. The eggs are laid into the cupules {{or around the}} peduncle joints. The larvae feed on the nuts and leave only nutchips and excrement within. While the chestnuts ripen, the larvae retreat into the ground after having chewed {{their way out of}} the nuts. The following July, they turn into pupae. The larvae of the {{chestnut weevil}} can only chew their way out of a fallen nut, so breeding occurs mostly where chestnuts lie on the ground for a sufficient length of time, or where the trees produce many small fruits which remain behind at the harvest. Timing the harvests to pick up the chestnuts as soon as they fall reduces the numbers of the overwintering larvae. Regular soil work is also unfavourable to its life habits. Small grafts are sprayed with chemicals.

Soil samples were taken from a <b>chestnut</b> <b>orchard</b> (unpolluted control) and five apple orchards with different degrees of heavy metal pollution. Total concentrations of Cu, Pb, and As in soil ranged from 29 to 931 mg/kg, 35 to 771 mg/kg, and 11 to 198 mg/kg, respectively. The amount of microbial biomass carbon expressed on a soil organic carbon basis decreased with increasing concentrations of heavy metals. Thus, the heavy metals that accumulated in apple orchard surface soils had adverse effects on the soil microbial biomass. The analysis of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition indicated that the microbial community structure had changed because of the pesticide-derived heavy metals in soil. The relative abundance of gram-positive bacterial marker PLFAs increased and that of fungal marker PLFA decreased with increasing concentrations of heavy metals in soil.

Of Chinese origin, this species has invaded Japan, Korea, the USA, Nepal and Europe {{and in each}} region it has been attacked by parasitoids exploiting oak gall wasps. Classical biological control using the parasitoid Torymus sinensis (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) successfully reduced infestation in Japan. Subsequent work in Japan and Korea showed this parasitoid to represent a poorly understood and biologically diverse species complex. Following its success in Japan, T. sinensis was released in Italy in 2005. A growing appreciation of the taxonomic and ecological complexity of the T. sinensis complex in Japan and Korea has stimulated ongoing DNA-based work on relationships and interbreeding of species in this group.

Exploitation of this potential requires improved understanding of the taxonomy of these parasitoids, particularly of morphologically highly conserved lineages such as Eurytoma and Eupelmus in which recognised species may contain many cryptic lineages.

40|$|The rapid {{spread of}} the Chinese gall wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu) in Italian {{chestnut}} growing areas is causing new criticisms. In this context, {{in addition to a}} clear plant suffering due to the wasp infestation, the dangerous recurrence of chestnut blight and the sudden spread of Gnomoniopsis sp., a coloniser of galls but also the etiological agent of nut brown rot, must be considered. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} increase the plants’ vigour and prevent their decline. Preliminary experiments were carried out in different Italian regions between 2010 and 2011. Organic plant fertilizers were applied to plants showing middle or high defoliation levels caused by the wasp attacks. The observations carried out during the growing season indicate a good vegetative restart in the treated plants compared to the untreated controls, in all the situations and independently of the fertilizers applied. Most of the treated plants (between the 75 % and the 100 %) showed an evident improvement in the canopy vegetation, while the untreated controls were always classified in the worse classes of crown condition. These preliminary results highlight the efficacy of this kind of treatments for infested chestnut stands. This strategy, which is based on the preliminary evaluation of the plant vigour (following the proposed scale of attack severity and lack of foliage), consists in a manuring treatment at vegetative restart, which can be repeated in the following years in dependence on the results obtained. Moreover, pruning may be suggested only to manage the development of plants showing a definite recovery.

The spectra of intact and peeled chestnut samples were collected in the wavelength range from 833 nm to 2500 nm. The Sample Set Partitioning based on joint X–Y distances was used when the calibration and validation subsets were partitioned. The predictive models for intact and peeled chestnut samples respectively, were developed using partial least squares (PLS) regression based on the original spectra and the spectra derived from different pretreatments. The PLS models developed from the spectra of peeled samples gave accurate predictions. The correlation coefficient (R 2) of the optimized model for calibration set and validation set were 0. 90 and 0. 86. Although the models established on the spectra of intact samples did not perform excellently, they were still qualified to measure sugar content of the chestnut kernel. The correlation coefficient (R 2) of optimized model for calibration set and validation set were 0. 89 and 0. 59. These results suggested that NIR spectroscopy {{could be used as}} a fast and accurate alternative method for the nondestructive evaluation of sugar content in <b>chestnuts</b> during <b>orchard</b> and post-harvest processes...|$|R
60|$|In a green {{valley of}} the Apennines, close to the sea-coast between Genoa and Spezzia, is a marine villa, that once belonged to the Malaspina family, in olden time the friends and patrons of Dante. It is rather a fantastic pile, painted in fresco, but spacious, in good repair, and convenient. Although {{little more than a}} mile from Spezzia, a glimpse of the blue sea can only be caught from one {{particular}} spot, so completely is the land locked with hills, covered with groves of <b>chestnut</b> and olive <b>orchards.</b> From the heights, however, you enjoy magnificent prospects of the most picturesque portion of the Italian coast; a lofty, undulating, and wooded shore, with an infinite variety of bays and jutting promontories; while the eye, wandering from Leghorn on one side towards Genoa on the other, traces an almost uninterrupted line of hamlets and casinos, gardens and orchards, terraces of vines, and groves of olive. Beyond them, the broad and blue expanse of the midland ocean, glittering in the meridian blaze, or about to receive perhaps in its glowing waters the red orb of sunset.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} roost selection by Leisler’s bat (Nyctalus leisleri) {{before and}} after hibernation in 2005 in a mountain area of southern Switzerland. The study area is dominated by deciduous trees and characterised {{by the presence of}} previously managed <b>chestnut</b> (Castanea sativa) <b>orchards</b> that are now partly abandoned. In March–May and August–October, 15 radio-tracked bats (seven males and eight females) used 28 roost trees. We analysed roosts used by N. leisleri at three different levels: (i) micro-scale: features of roost cavities; (ii) meso-scale: characteristics of selected roost trees and (iii) macro-scale: structure of woodland surrounding roost trees. Selection at meso and macro-scales was obtained comparing characteristics of roost trees and surrounding woodland with potentially available trees and woodlands. Bats roosted mainly in live chestnut trees, with large diameter and absence of vegetation near the entrance. Roost trees were located closer to streams, in woodlands with a higher percentage of sweet chestnut trees and a lower tree density than random trees. Multifunctional forest management in abandoned chestnut stands, comprising recreation (chestnut harvesting) and preservation of a semi-natural habitat and its related biodiversity, would recreate the traditional woodland features – in particular an open forest structure with low tree density and presence of ancient chestnut trees – and provide suitable roosting sites to migratory N. leisler...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{motivated}} by previous pheromone trap tests for Conogrthes sp. And C. punctiferalis in which small numbers of Pleuroptia chloropahanta males were unexpectedly trapped. Formulations of (E) - 10 -hexadecenal (E 10 - 16 : Ald), (Z) - 1 O-hexadecenal (Z 10 - 16 : Ald), n-hexadecanal (n- 16 : Ald) or (E) - 10 -hexadecenol (E 10 - 16 : OH) alone or in various combinations were tested as attractants for male moths of P. chloropahanta in different plantations. In <b>chestnut</b> and peach <b>orchard</b> field tests in 1994, E 10 - 16 : Ald alone was attractive to the males but binary mixtures of E 10 - 16 : Ald and 5 to 50 % of Z 10 - 16 : Ald were not attractive. Trap catches by a binary mixture of E 10 - 16 : Ald and El 0 - 16 : OH in 1995 was very low and not {{different from that of}} a 4 -component mixture for C. punctiferalis. In field tests of two Japanese white pine plantations of in 2001, 36 P. chloropahanta males were caught by traps baited with El 0 - 16 : Ald alone. Conclusive results, that is, exclusive attraction by El 0 - 16 : Ald were also obtained by field trap tests in plantations of Paulownia tomenyosa and Syrax abassia, host plants of this species. These results strongly suggest (E) - 10 -hexadecenal is effective as a sex attractant for monitoring P. chloropahanta and this compound {{may be one of the}} sex pheromone components of this species...|$|R
60|$|There is no country-side {{like the}} English country-side {{for those who}} have learnt to love it; its firm yet gentle lines of hill and dale, its ordered {{confusion}} of features, its deer parks and downland, its castles and stately houses, its hamlets and old churches, its farms and ricks and great barns and ancient trees, its pools and ponds and shining threads of rivers; its flower-starred hedgerows, its orchards and woodland patches, its village greens and kindly inns. Other country-sides have their pleasant aspects, but none such variety, none that shine so steadfastly throughout the year. Picardy is pink and white and pleasant in the blossom time, Burgundy goes on with its sunshine and wide hillsides and cramped vineyards, a beautiful tune repeated and repeated, Italy gives salitas and wayside chapels and <b>chestnuts</b> and olive <b>orchards,</b> the Ardennes has its woods and gorges--Touraine and the Rhineland, the wide Campagna with its distant Apennines, and the neat prosperities and mountain backgrounds of South Germany, all clamour their especial merits at one's memory. And there are the hills and fields of Virginia, like an England grown very big and slovenly, the woods and big river sweeps of Pennsylvania, the trim New England landscape, a little bleak and rather fine like the New England mind, and the wide rough country roads and hills and woodland of New York State. But none of these change scene and character in three miles of walking, nor have so mellow a sunlight nor so diversified a cloudland, nor confess the perpetual refreshment of the strong soft winds that blow from off the sea as our Mother England does.|$|R
6000|$|Philetas, the {{remaining}} {{member of the}} Alexandrian Triad, {{seems to have been}} a more simple, genial, and graceful spirit than the other two, to whom he was accordingly esteemed inferior. Only a few fragments are left; but he was not altogether without his influence, for he was, as I have just said, one of the models on which Propertius and Ovid formed themselves; and some, indeed, call him the Father of the Latin elegy, with its terseness, grace, and clear epigrammatic form of thought, and, therefore, in a great degree, of our modern eighteenth century poets; not a useless excellence, seeing that it is, on the whole, good for him who writes to see clearly what he wants to say, and to be able to make his readers see it clearly also. And yet one natural strain is heard amid all this artificial jingle--that of Theocritus. It is not altogether Alexandrian. Its sweetest notes were learnt amid the <b>chestnut</b> groves and <b>orchards,</b> the volcanic glens and sunny pastures of Sicily; but the intercourse, between the courts of Hiero and the Ptolemies seems to have been continual. Poets and philosophers moved freely from one to the other, and found a like atmosphere in both; and in one of Theocritus' idyls, two Sicilian gentlemen, crossed in love, agree to sail for Alexandria, and volunteer into the army of the great and good king Ptolemy, of whom a sketch is given worth reading; as a man noble, generous, and stately, [...] "knowing well who loves him, and still better who loves him not." [...] He has another encomium on Ptolemy, more laboured, though not less interesting: but the real value of Theocritus lies in his power of landscape-painting.|$|R
