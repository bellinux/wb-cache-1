5|$|The {{introduction}} of the New Poor Law also resulted in opposition. Some who gave evidence to the Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws suggested that the existing system had proved adequate and was more adaptable to local needs. This argument was strongest in the industrial North of England and in the textile industries where outdoor relief was a more effective method of dealing with <b>cyclical</b> <b>unemployment</b> {{as well as being}} a more cost-effective method. Poor Law commissioners faced greatest opposition in Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire where in 1837 there was high unemployment during an economic depression. The New Poor Law was seen as interference from Londoners with little understanding of local affairs. Opposition was unusually strong because committees had already been formed in opposition to the Ten Hours Movement, leaders of the Ten Hours campaign such as Richard Oastler, Joseph Rayner Stephens and John Fielden became the leaders of the Anti-Poor Law campaign. The Book of Murder was published and was aimed at creating opposition to the workhouse system. and pamphlets were published spreading rumour and propaganda about Poor Law Commissioners and alleged infanticide inside of workhouses. Opposition to the Poor Law yielded some successes in delaying the development of workhouses, and one workhouse in Stockport was attacked by a crowd of rioters. As many Boards of Guardians were determined to continue under the old system, the Poor Law Commission granted some boards the right to continue providing relief under the Old Poor Law. However, the movement against the New Poor Law was short-lived, leading many to instead turn towards Chartism.|$|E

40|$|I {{examine whether}} the <b>cyclical</b> {{behavior}} of <b>unemployment</b> {{has changed over}} the post WWII period. Specifically, I test whether <b>cyclical</b> movements in <b>unemployment</b> have become more persistent. Finding that they have, indeed, become more persistent, I then take some initial steps in explaining why. I find that the increase in persistence has affected private nonfarm payroll employment as well as unemployment and that increased persistence appears to be widespread across industries. At the same time, increased persistence owes primarily to greater persistence in job finding rates and greater persistence in unemployment among permanent job losers. This combination suggests that the welfare loss from <b>cyclical</b> increases in <b>unemployment</b> is becoming increasingly concentrated among permanent job losers who become unemployed for extended durations during cyclical downturns.

The optimal lag orders are automatically selected according to the Schwarz Information Criterion. The test is applied for all the variables used in this study, namely y, the cyclical component of output based on HP filter, Yc(HP), the cyclical component of output based on BK filter, Yc(BK), the cyclical component of output based on quadratic trend, Yc(QT), u, the <b>cyclical</b> component of <b>unemployment</b> rate based on HP filter, Uc(HP), the <b>cyclical</b> component of <b>unemployment</b> rate based on BK filter, Uc(BK) and the <b>cyclical</b> component of <b>unemployment</b> rate based on quadratic trend, Uc(QT).

25|$|The {{implementation}} of the Act proved impossible, particularly in the industrial north which suffered from <b>cyclical</b> <b>unemployment.</b> The cost of implementing the Settlement Laws in operation since the 17th century was also costly and so these were not implemented fully: it often proved too costly to enforce the removal of paupers.

25|$|In the North of England particularly, {{there was}} fierce resistance; {{the local people}} {{considered}} that the existing system there was running smoothly. They argued {{that the nature of}} <b>cyclical</b> <b>unemployment</b> meant that any new workhouse built would be empty for most of the year and thus a waste of money. However, the unlikely union between property owners and paupers did not last, and opposition, though fierce, eventually petered out. In some cases, this was further accelerated as the protests very successfully undermined parts of the Amendment Act and became obsolete.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} assumptions as well. According to Richard L. Jensen, <b>cyclical</b> <b>unemployment</b> was a grave matter primarily until 1935. Between 1935 and 1941 structural unemployment became the bigger problem. Especially the unions successes in demanding higher wages pushed management into introducing new efficiency-oriented hiring standards. It ended inefficient labor such as child labor, casual unskilled work for subminimum wages, and sweatshop conditions. In {{the long term}} the shift to efficiency wages led to high productivity, high wages and a high standard of living. But it necessitated a well-educated, well-trained, hard-working labor force. It was not before war time brought full employment that the supply of unskilled labor (that caused structural unemployment) downsized.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we employ microeconomic {{evidence}} on the unemployment experiences of American males to evaluate the sensitivity of unemployment to business cycle fluctuations {{in the late nineteenth}} century as compared to the mid-twentieth century. Our results indicate a substantial decline in the value of the Okun coefficient (from - 0. 65 to - 0. 32) between the 1890 s and the 1960 s. These findings challenge Christina Romer’s interpretation that the measured decline in <b>cyclical</b> volatility of <b>unemployment</b> over the twentieth century was created by improvements in the statistical record. Rather, it was changes in the underlying dynamics of the labor market over the cycle, most notably the transition to procyclical productivity patterns and the shift from an added to a discouraged worker effect among secondary workers, which may be summarized as the development of modern labor market behavior, that account for the declining cyclical sensitivity of employment and the drop in the <b>cyclical</b> volatility of <b>unemployment</b> over the century. <b>Cyclical</b> sensitivity of <b>unemployment,</b> Unemployment volatility, Okun’s law...|$|R

40|$|How are {{business}} cycle fluctuations in unemployment and wages {{affected by the}} extent to which workers are able to smooth their consumption through asset markets? Can incomplete markets resolve the difficulty search and matching models have in accounting for the high <b>cyclical</b> volatility of <b>unemployment</b> observed in US data? This paper examines a parsimonious equilibrium model of job search with aggregate productivity shocks, where workers face uninsured idiosyncratic unemployment risk. Risk averse entrepreneurs post optimal dynamic contracts to attract risk averse workers, providing them consumption smoothing through wages during employment. Employers cannot insure workers against the idiosyncratic risk of job loss, however. Workers face an extreme form of incomplete markets, leading to a particularly simple representation for the equilibrium as a small system of differential equations. When workers face incomplete markets, <b>cyclical</b> fluctuations in <b>unemployment</b> are amplified, and those in wages dampened.
