40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a theorem proving procedure which combines {{the approach of}} Resolution with that of Rewriting. The basic-theoretical result is the completeness of a strong restriction of paramodulation for locking resolution procedures. Its oriented character suggests to consider the restricted paramodulation {{as a form of}} superposition (the Rewriting operation). This is achieved by means of a new formalism of <b>clauses,</b> <b>named</b> equational <b>clauses,</b> in which each literal is converted into an equation. Thereby, superposition on equational clauses is shown to embody not only paramodulation but also binary resolution; so clausal superposition will build up our major rule of inference. In addition, term simplification is incorporated in our procedure as well as subsumption. Experimental results and potential applications for our theorem prover are lastly reported...|$|R

5000|$|In the France's constitution, {{there is}} a <b>clause</b> <b>named</b> Laïcité which denotes the {{separation}} of church and state. Many Muslims who would like to wear the Hijab of their choosing cite this part of the Constitution. On the other hand, Laïcité also could be used to prohibit the display and practice of religion in schools, making daily prayer and the Hijab constitutionally unacceptable. The French are afraid not only of the destruction of their culture, but of the destruction of women's rights. Muslim women's views on the issue range widely depending on the cultural context. While women in Britain say that the hijab frees them from the predatory gazes of men; in France women are angry that they do not get to choose to wear the Hijab, while women in Iran have expressed that it is a symbol of male governmental oppression. There eventually was a law passed by the French National Party and Nicolas Sarkozy making it illegal to wear a Hijab or any other conspicuous religious symbol (such as a large crucifix) in French schools.|$|R

Most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, although leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and that leaders of Orthodox Judaism's Rabbinical Council of America, and respected Orthodox rabbis, including Joseph B. Soloveitchik, supposedly recognized the clause as valid. Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the constitutional principle of {{the separation of church and}} state, Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been explained to them as part of pre-marital counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil document, enforceable in a civilian court. However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own law committee, had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons.|$|R

In this paper we give a projection of several well-known clause form conversions to a simplified form of Boolean circuit. We introduce a new conversion which we show is equivalent to that of Boy de la Tour in certain circumstances and is hence optimal in the number of clauses that it produces. We extend the algorithm to cover reduced Boolean circuits, a data structure used by the model checker NuSMV. We present experimental results for this and other conversion procedures on BMC problems demonstrating its superiority, and conclude that the CNF conversion has a significant role in reducing the overall solving time. ...|$|R

De Frutos and Kittsteiner suggest in their paper that in order to ensure an efficient outcome, there should not be a contractual obligation for the party who triggers the <b>clause</b> to <b>name</b> the price. Instead, they advocate including in the termination agreement a clause stating that the parties will negotiate for the right to be the person who chooses whether to buy or sell at the price specified by the other partner. They suggest that this negotiation take the form of an ascending auction where the shareholders bid for the right not to set the price per share. Each partner raises his/her bid continuously, but either partner can drop out of the auction at any time. The party that drops out becomes the one who must propose the price per share, but that person receives a payment from the other partner equal to the bid at which the auction ended.|$|R
30|$|Most results [30] in {{the light}} of {{utilizing}} 40  years (1968 – 2007) accessible average wind information from the entire 44 wind stations covering the states of the country indicate that, the nation’s wind jurisdiction is found to lie between inferior and average.

40|$|This study {{examined}} how the quantitative and the numerative {{features of the}} nominal group described by Systemic Functional Linguistics theory characterized independent <b>clause</b> Sesotho personal <b>names.</b> They were presented as quantitative and numerative dichotomies with distinct features noted by both areas in the nominal group. Their semantics of interaction displayed speech roles such as statements, demands and commands, and as questions (cf. Eggins, 1996, p 149 - 150). An additional new feature superficially mentioned by Halliday (2001) extends to exclamatives (p. 45). The aim was to explore how these personal names structured with features of these speech roles are described as enacted messages that exchange information; give the name awarder’s evaluation of the situation (modality) and express experiences encountered at the child’s birth. Enacted messages negotiate attitudes (Martin and Rose 2007, p. 8) and through this art modality is highly incorporated.

50|$|In May 1845, the {{amalgamation}} of the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal and the Ellesmere and Chester Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament, {{and there}} were schemes to build railways throughout the area that they served.

In addition to the enlarged Ellesmere and Chester Canal, the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company would absorb the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. While many miles of waterway would be replaced by railway, some 80 or 90 mi would be retained in water, which included the Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Brbridge Junction section, the Shropshire Canal and the Shrewsbury Canal. Three Acts of Parliament were obtained in 1846, to enable railway construction, and extra <b>clauses</b> enabled the <b>name</b> change to the Shropshire Union to be made, and the acquisition of the Shrewsbury Canal.

5000|$|The {{reason that}} {{manufacturers}} performed this lockout {{is that the}} necessary orders for the Christmas shipment had been filled and they {{felt it necessary to}} push back against the radical labor movement they found themselves a part of. And so the strike continued, most readily characterized as a raid against supposed communist leaders who were thought to be the ones inciting the worker rebellions. Tampa citizens formed a “secret committee of 25 outstanding citizens” who, according to the Tampa Tribune, “had the sole purpose of driving out the communists, whether they are communists freshly arrived or long here”. On December 10, 1931, the New York Times published an article that addressed this ongoing public battle of citizen vigilante committees versus supposed communist leaders. In it, Harris G. Sims outlined the vices of the workers and how the city is trying to squash the movement. “While strike leaders denied that Red propagandists inspired them,” the article says that when “police raided the headquarters of an industrial union a Soviet flag and a large quantity of Red literature were found and seized”. The strike escalated to the point where more than “twenty automobiles manned by policemen with riot guns were ready to quell a disturbance failed to arise.” Finally, Federal Judge Alexander Akerman: “signed an injunction against more than 140 persons believed to be leaders of the outbreak ... the injunction was drastic and sweeping. It probably hit the heart of the radical program with a <b>clause</b> restraining those <b>named</b> ‘from continuing to maintain and conduct the organization known as The Tobacco Workers Industrial Union of Tampa as an organization under the statement of principles advocating and encouraging the belief in the destruction by force of organized government or in the destruction of private property as a means to that end’”.|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The United States has worked for decades to achieve a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through initiatives such as the 1993 Oslo Accords and the more recent 2003 Roadmap for Peace. During fiscal years 1993 through 2005, the United States provided more than $ 2 billion in assistance to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, including nearly $ 275 million in fiscal year 2005, to help achieve this goal. In particular, the 2005 assistance was provided {{to support the president}} of the Palestinian Authority, elected in January 2005, and to facilitate the Israeli disengagement from parts of the West Bank and Gaza, among other things. This assistance, primarily administered by the U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID), has been directed mainly toward five development sectors: economic growth, water and infrastructure, democracy and governance, health, and higher education. In recent years, the United States has taken several steps to help ensure that U. S. resources, including its aid to the West Bank and Gaza, do not support terrorist activities. On September 23, 2001, President Bush issued an executive order prohibiting the support of any organization or individuals that have been designated as terrorists. Since 2001, to implement the executive order and other antiterrorism provisions in various subsequent appropriations acts, USAID, in consultation with the Department of State, Congress, and others, developed a number of provisions to help ensure that its assistance is not delivered to or through terrorists. In addition, the USAID mission for the West Bank and Gaza (the mission) developed policies and procedures to implement antiterrorism provisions for the awards it administers. The provisions that were in effect for assistance delivered through contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements active in 2005 included (1) the vetting of certain non-U. S. prime awardees and subawardees for terrorist connections; (2) certifications by all prime awardees and subawardees of grants and cooperative agreements that they have not assisted and do not assist terrorists; and (3) a clause in all awards and related subawards prohibiting the support of terrorists (antiterrorism clause) and clauses in all prime awards prohibiting (a) the use of U. S. funds to recognize or honor terrorists (<b>naming</b> <b>clause)</b> and (b) the provision of cash to the Palestinian Authority (cash clause). Responding to a 2005 mandate to the Comptroller General of the United States, we examined fiscal year 2005 assistance to the West Bank and Gaza to, among other things, ensure that the required antiterrorism measures were implemented. In addition, we reviewed the financial audit reports of West Bank and Gaza contractors and grantees (and significant subcontractors and subgrantees) prepared by the USAID Office of the Regional Inspector General-Cairo (RIG) in response to a 2003 mandate and subsequent mandates. Among other things, the audits examined the awardees' compliance with antiterrorism provisions. To address these objectives, we reviewed the relevant laws and executive orders and USAID's directives, internal memorandums, operating procedures, and guidance for assistance-related antiterrorism measures. We focused on USAID's implementation of procedures related to vetting and antiterrorism certification and clauses. ...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThis study {{sought to}} examine {{independent}} <b>clause</b> Sesotho personal <b>names</b> as authentic social discourse using the Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) theory. It sought to analyze their structure and map them to social functions to demonstrate that they are enacted messages in socio-cultural context of Basotho. It used a form-meaning approach to interpret Sesotho names in socio-cultural contexts of use (cf. Halliday 1994, 2001, Eggins, 1996, 2004 and Martin & Rose 2007) {{as an alternative to}} the current formalist approach to onomastica interpretation. The SFL analysis was compared and contrasted mainly with the formalist syntactic specific and semantic specific analyses currently in use by Guma, Sesotho Academy and subsequent authors of Sesotho grammar and other linguists. The purpose of displaying these names as texts in social context enfolded the intent to reflect a systemic interface of lexico-grammar and social activity. The study used the clause-text-culture paradigm to explore Sesotho names as texts or semantic units. The idea was to access their ‘meanings beyond the clause’ (Martin & Rose 2007). Data was collected from national examinations pass lists, admission and employment roll lists from Public, Private, Tertiary, Orphanage institutions. Other data was identified in Telephone directories and Media. The purely linguistic lexico-grammatic analysis of the structure of names was supplemented by interview data from real interpretations from families, owners and senior citizens who have social and cultural knowledge of the meanings of some names. The study has established that Sesotho personal names can present as an independent clause feature. Sesotho personal names can also be described as lexico-grammatical properties and are meaningful in social contexts. They are used to exchange information as statements, demands and commands, and as questions and as exclamations. This means that these names can be categorized according to Halliday’s Mood types which make them function as declaratives, imperatives, interrogatives and exclamatives depending on the awarder’s evaluation. The study also finds that in negotiating attitudes, modality is highly incorporated. The study concludes that Sesotho names conform to the logical structures of the nominal group and the verbal group and these groups reciprocate in use. The verbal group is the core constituent in these names and it serves as a foundation for the nominal and verbal groups particularly because they function as reciprocating propositions. This includes the names with the sub-modification features. This extends the formalist description of Sesotho independent clause in that the identified sub-modifications which are opague and taken for granted by formalist analysts of Sesotho, are explicated as essential elements embedded in the formmeaning relation in SFL. The main contribution is that this is the only study on SFL and onomastica. There is no study that has been conducted using SFL to describe African names. It presents that Sesotho personal names are texts that have been negotiated in socio-cultural contexts. It provides a major departure from most studies that have used the Chomskian formulations or other sociolinguistic theories to describe the naming systems. It displays the art and importance of language use based on experience and culture in the naming system. The study also contributes to fields such as education, history, and others. Lastly, the study has established a new relation of onomastica and SFL theory and onomastica can now be added to the areas “being recognized as providing a very useful descriptive and interpretive framework for viewing language as a strategic, meaning-making resource. ” (Eggins 1996 : 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Connectors, Clause, Phrase, English GrammarThis {{lesson was}} {{developed}} by John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Making English Grammar Meaningful and Useful Mini Lesson # 13 Connectors: Words that Connect The purpose of this lesson is to present and contrast the many kinds of words that connect word groups together. These connecting words are called Connectors. CONNECTORS are words that connect word groups together. They can connect individual words. They can connect dependent clauses and phrases to the sentences {{in which they are}} found. They can even connect separate sentences. Simple Connectors are usually called conjunctions. They are used to connect simple ideas. These ideas can be expressed in words, phrases or short independent clauses. The most common Simple Connectors are ‘and’, ‘but’, and ‘or’, but can also include ‘so’, ‘yet’, ‘either’, ‘neither’, and ‘nor’. The following examples show how Simple Connectors can be used: Connecting words: The man was friendly and generous. Connecting phrases: The young women either went to work or to school. Connecting clauses: The fans went to the game early, but they didn’t get good seats. Sentence Connectors connect complete ideas. These ideas can be joined with a semicolon, but it is advisable to punctuate them as separate sentences. The Connector is usually used with the second sentence, and is not always found {{at the beginning of the}} sentence. Examples of Sentence Connectors are ‘therefore’, ‘however’, ‘moreover’, ‘furthermore’, ‘consequently’, ‘as a result’, and ‘finally’ to name a few. The following examples show how Sentence Connectors are used: It rained. Therefore, they didn’t go. The weather was good. They didn’t go out, however. The test was hard. Furthermore, I didn’t study very much. As a result, I didn’t do well. Most Dependent Clauses and Phrases are connected to their Main Clauses by words which have various names in traditional grammar, such as relative pronoun, complex preposition, subordinate adverb, and subordinate conjunctions. These words all express particular grammatical functions, but they are more complicated than they need to be. Basically, all of these words connect their clauses or phrases to the main clause of their sentences. Therefore, they can be collectively referred to as Clause or Phrase Connectors. They can be further identified by adding the kind of phrase or <b>clause</b> in their <b>names.</b> For example, an Adverb Clause Connector is a word that connects an Adverb Clause to the Main Clause. A Noun Clause Connector connects a Noun Clause to the Main Clause. An Adverb Phrase Connector connects an Adverb Phrase to the Main Clause. This lesson {{was developed by}} John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 ELLs find these Clause and Phrase Connectors confusing because several words can be used with more than one kind of clause or phrase. For example, the word ‘that’ can be both an Adjective Clause Connector and a Noun Clause Connector. Most question words such as ‘when’, ‘why’, and ‘where’ can be both Adverb Clause Connectors and Noun Clause Connectors. Some of the Dependent Clause and Phrase Connectors are presented in the following chart. CLAUSE and PHRASE CONNECTORS Adverb Clause Connectors (Subordinate Conjunctions) Adverb Phrase Connectors (Complex Prepositions) when, before, while, since after, because, though, although, even though, because of due to, despite in spite of Adjective Clause Connectors (Relative Pronouns) Noun Clause Connectors (Subordinate conjunctions) who, whom, which, that, whose that, what, why if, who, when whether, where The following sentences illustrate the various Connectors presented in this lesson. She wanted to attend, but she had too much homework. (Simple Connector) She had too much homework. Therefore, she didn’t go. (Sentence Connector) She attended the 1 st class before she attended this one. (Adverb Clause Connector) She’s attending this class because she wants to graduate.
