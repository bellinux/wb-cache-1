5000|$|Charles Messier ( [...] ; 26 June 1730 - 12 April 1817) was a French {{astronomer}} {{most notable}} for publishing an astronomical catalogue consisting of nebulae and star clusters {{that came to}} be known as the 110 [...] "Messier objects". The purpose of the catalogue was to help astronomical observers, in particular <b>comet</b> <b>hunters</b> such as himself, distinguish between permanent and transient visually diffuse objects in the sky.|$|R
50|$|Since NASA's {{automated}} patrol scopes left {{few remaining}} prospects for visual <b>comet</b> <b>hunters,</b> Brewington stopped <b>comet</b> hunting in 1999, {{moved back to}} South Carolina, and enrolled at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. He graduated with honors {{in the summer of}} 2002 and was hired by year's end as a 2.5-meter telescope operator through the Astronomy Department of New Mexico State University. From 2002 to 2015, he worked at the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. During Sloan projects SDSS-I through SDSS-IV, Brewington collected imaging and/or spectral data for projects including First-Phase Operations, Sloan Legacy Survey, SEGUE, Sloan Supernova Survey, APOGEE, BOSS, MARVELS, SEGUE-2, APOGEE-2, eBOSS, and MaNGA.|$|R
40|$|Since comet Shoemaker-Levy {{collided}} with the planet Jupiter with stupendous force in 1994 {{there has been an}} upsurge of amateur interest in comets Most comets are first discovered by amateur astronomers {{because there are so many}} amateurs looking for them, and techniques and instruments have improved dramatically in the past few years After a short but detailed introduction to the comets themselves Nick James and Gerald North describe comet hunting, photographing and imaging comets, and digital image processing The use of computers for orbital calculations and even helping to discover new comets is given a full chapter, as are advanced techniques including comet photometry and spectroscopy This comprehensive book has an accompanying CD-ROM and is at once a "primer" for <b>comet</b> <b>hunters</b> and a reference text for more advanced amateur astronomer...|$|R

5000|$|NGC 4976 is a {{peculiar}} elliptical galaxy {{in the constellation}} Centaurus. It was detected with a 5" [...] telescope working at 20x magnification by <b>comet</b> <b>hunter</b> Jack Bennett.|$|E
5000|$|What {{later became}} known as the Whirlpool Galaxy was {{discovered}} on October 13, 1773, by Charles Messier while hunting for objects that could confuse <b>comet</b> <b>hunters,</b> and was designated in Messier's catalogue as M51. Its companion galaxy, NGC 5195, was discovered in 1781 by Pierre Méchain, although it was not known whether it was interacting or merely another galaxy passing at a distance. It was, however, not until 1845 that William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, employing a 72-inch (1.8 m) reflecting telescope at Birr Castle, Ireland, found the Whirlpool possessed a spiral structure, the first [...] "nebula" [...] to be known to have one. These [...] "spiral nebulae" [...] were not recognized as galaxies until Edwin Hubble was able to observe Cepheid variables in some of these spiral nebulae, which provided evidence that they were so far away that they must be entirely separate galaxies.|$|R
5|$|French {{astronomer}} Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781, cataloguing it as a nebulous feature while {{searching for}} objects that would confuse <b>comet</b> <b>hunters.</b> The second brightest galaxy within the northern Virgo Cluster, M87 is located about 16.4 million parsecs (53.5 million light-years) from Earth. Unlike a disk-shaped spiral galaxy, M87 has no distinctive dust lanes. Instead, {{it has an}} almost featureless, ellipsoidal shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in luminosity with distance from the centre. Forming around one sixth of M87's mass, the stars in this galaxy have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution, their density decreasing with increasing distance from the core. At the core is an active supermassive black hole, which forms the primary component of an active galactic nucleus. This object is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly radio waves. M87's galactic envelope extends out to a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs (490,000 light-years), {{where it has been}} truncated—possibly by an encounter with another galaxy. Between the stars is a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by elements emitted from evolved stars.|$|R
40|$|The French {{astronomer}} Charles Messier (1730 - 1817) {{compiled a}} catalogue [1] of astronomical objects which reached 109 innumber after additions by later astronomers were added. The catalogue contains galaxies, emission nebulae, a supernova remnant, a double star, globular clusters, open clusters, an asterism, a star cloud, and planetary nebulae. While {{the objective of}} Messier in compiling the catalogue was to guide <b>comet</b> <b>hunters</b> {{not to be confused}} by his objects which he thought looked like comets [2], the Messier Catalogue as it later became known became a standard guide to astronomers for a study of the sky’s “greatest hits” or the best samples of objects which can be observed and studied. This paper explores the value of the Messier Catalogue in the teaching of Astronomy and Earth Science. The range of objects is wide and contains some of the best examples of their type. The teaching method I propose is the actual observations of the objects through a tele scope, with the corresponding explanation. Some principles which will be covered through this process are stellar evolution from the birth and death of stars, galaxy types, formation of galaxies, galactic interactions, life in the Universe, cosmology, and our place in the Universe. </p...|$|R
50|$|Uppsala Schmidt Telescope {{was built}} in 1957, but moved to Australia in 1982. Finally making a home at Siding Spring Observatory, the {{telescope}} was used by ANU in many roles such as Near Earth Object studies (NEOs) by the famous <b>Comet</b> <b>hunter</b> Rob McNaught.|$|E
50|$|Wolf {{started his}} career as a <b>comet</b> <b>hunter</b> and {{continued}} to discover them throughout his life. He discovered or co-discovered several comets, including 14P/Wolf and 43P/Wolf-Harrington. Wolf won a competition with E. E. Barnard on who {{would be the first to}} observe the return of Halley's Comet (P1/Halley) in April 1910.|$|E
50|$|With the {{compulsory}} retirement age {{no longer in}} place, unlike his predecessor, Candy was able to continue working at the Perth Observatory on projects including the eclipsing binary FO Hydra, a <b>comet</b> <b>hunter</b> telescope, a new theory on comet origins and evolution, {{the analysis of the}} lost comet Gale, as well as comparison of a South Australian comet discovered in 1979 with that of a comet from 1770.|$|E
50|$|Messier's {{occupation}} as a <b>comet</b> <b>hunter</b> led him {{to continually}} come across fixed diffuse objects {{in the night sky}} which could be mistaken for comets. He compiled a list of them, in collaboration with his friend and assistant Pierre Méchain (who may have found at least 20 of the objects), to avoid wasting time sorting them out from the comets they were looking for. The entries are now known to be galaxies (39), planetary nebulae (5), other types of nebulae (7), and star clusters (55).|$|E
5000|$|The Messier objects [...] are {{a set of}} over 100 astronomical objects first {{listed by}} French {{astronomer}} Charles Messier in 1771. Messier was a <b>comet</b> <b>hunter,</b> and was frustrated by objects which resembled but were not comets, so he {{compiled a list of}} them, in collaboration with his assistant Pierre Méchain, to avoid wasting time on them. The number of objects in the lists he published reached 103, but seven more thought to have been observed by Messier have been added by other astronomers over the years.|$|E
5000|$|... 16P/Brooks, {{also known}} as Brooks 2, is a {{periodic}} comet discovered by William Robert Brooks on July 7, 1889, but failed to note any motion. He was able to confirm the discovery the next morning, having seen that the comet had moved north. On August 1, 1889, the famous <b>comet</b> <b>hunter</b> Edward Emerson Barnard discovered two fragments of the comet labeled [...] "B" [...] and [...] "C" [...] located 1 and 4.5 arc minutes away. On August 2, he found another four or five, but these were no longer visible the next day. On August 4, he observed two more objects, labeled [...] "D" [...] and [...] "E". [...] "E" [...] disappeared by the next night and [...] "D" [...] was gone by the next week. Around mid-month, [...] "B" [...] grew large and faint, finally disappearing {{at the beginning of}} September. [...] "C" [...] managed to survive until mid-November 1889. No new nuclei were discovered before the apparition ended on January 13, 1891.|$|E
5000|$|In his Astronomical Memoirs Tebbutt gave {{an account}} of his discovery: ... On the evening of May 13, 1861, while searching the western sky for comets, I {{detected}} a faint nebulous object near the star Lacaille 1316 in the constellation Eridanus. In my marine telescope the object appeared much diffused, and {{it was with the}} greatest difficulty that I estimated its distance from three well known fixed stars. The object was hardly distinguishable in the small telescope attached to the sextant, and I found it necessary to employ a coloured glass between the index and horizon glasses, for the superior brilliance of the reference stars Procyon, Sirius and Canopus, when they were brought into the field of view, quite extinguished its feeble light. The measurements gaveR.A. = 3 h. 54 m. 12 s.Declin. = —30° 44&#8242;as the place of the object at 6 h. 57 m. local mean time. Every <b>comet</b> <b>hunter</b> knows how necessary it is to the carrying out of his work to have at hand a copious catalogue of nebulae, but this valuable adjunct I unfortunately did not possess. I could not, however, find the object in the limited catalogues at my command. I accordingly made up my mind to watch it, and it is well that I did so, otherwise I should have missed one of the best opportunities for introducing myself to the astronomical world. ...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{only a handful of}} famous deep sky "catalogs," {{including}} Charles Messier’s, which was the first and remains the most famous. Messier was a <b>comet</b> <b>hunter,</b> and in the late 1700 s he published a list of 109 objects in the sky that were not comets. In December 1995, Sky & Telescope published a list of deep sky objects sent to them by British amateur astronomer extraordinare, Sir Patrick Moore (officially, Sir Patrick Caldwell-Moore). It was a huge hit! Sir Patrick may be the most prolific authors of astronomy books for all time and has been presenting the BBC Sky at Night television series since April 1957. Moore’s list contained 109 non-Messier objects that were Patrick’s favorites, many of them visible only in the southern hemisphere. Accompanying the list of objects were long exposure black and white and color photographs of some of these objects. In this book Martin Mobberley, who has known Sir Patrick Moore for many years, describes these objects and tells how to locate them. He discusses the best ways to visually observe them and image them. He also tells a little of Moore’s life and observing practices and how he made his choices for the "catalog. " If you’re wanting a challenge for your newly acquired telescope, or are interested in seeing what others have highlighted as some of the greatest sights in the night sky, this book will set you on the path of discovery...|$|E
