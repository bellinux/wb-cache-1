40|$|Cancer {{chemoprevention}} can {{be defined}} as prevention of cancer by the administration of one or more chemical entities, either as individual drugs or as naturally occurring constituents of the diet. Based largely on the time period that <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> exhibit activity in animal models of carcinogenesis, they can be classified as inhibitors of carcinogen formation, blocking agents, and suppressing agents. The majority of compounds that inhibit the formation of carcinogens prevent the formation of nitrosamines from secondary amines and nitrite in an acidic environment. Blocking agents are inhibitors of tumor initiation, while suppressing agents are inhibitors of tumor promotion/progression. Many well-characterized <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> act at one or more steps in both tumor initiation and promotion/progression. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a general discussion of the mechanisms through which <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> inhibit carcinogenesis.

40|$|Tumorigenesis or {{carcinogenesis}} is a multi-step {{process that}} is induced primarily by carcinogens leading {{to the development of}} cancer. Extensive research {{in the last few years}} has revealed that regular consumption of certain fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of acquiring specific cancers. Phytochemicals derived from such fruits and vegetables, referred to as <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> include genistein, resveratrol, diallyl sulfide, S-allyl cysteine, allicin, lycopene, capsaicin, curcumin, 6 -gingerol, ellagic acid, ursolic acid, silymarin, anethol, catechins and eugenol. Because these agents have been shown to suppress cancer cell proliferation, inhibit growth factor signaling pathways, induce apoptosis, inhibit NF-kB, AP- 1 and JAK-STAT activation pathways, inhibit angiogenesis, suppress the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, inhibit cyclooxygenase- 2, they may have untapped therapeutic value.

40|$|Malignant tumors carry a {{high risk}} of death, and the {{prevention}} of malignant tumors is a crucial issue in preventive medicine. To this end, many <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> have been tested, but the effects of single agents {{have been found to be}} insufficient to justify clinical trials. We have therefore hypothesized that combinations of different <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> may synergistically enhance the preventive effect of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> used singly. To provide the treating physician with some guideline by which to choose the most effective agents to be combined, we propose a strategy which we have termed the “combination-oriented molecular-targeting prevention” of cancer. As the molecular target of our model, we focused on tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which specifically causes apoptosis in malignant tumor cells. Many of these agents were found to up-regulate the expression of death receptor 5, a TRAIL receptor. They were also found to synergistically induce apoptosis in malignant tumor cells when combined with TRAIL. Here, we strongly advocate that the strategy of “combination-oriented molecular-targeting prevention” of cancer will be a practical approach for chemoprevention against human malignant tumors...|$|R

40|$|Chemoprevention is {{effective}} in inhibiting the onset of cancer in experimental animal models, but the transferability of similar results to humans is questionable. Therefore, reliable intermediate molecular biomarkers are needed to evaluate the efficacy of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> {{before the onset of}} cancer. The use of genomic biomarkers is limited by their poor predictive value. Although post-genomic biomarkers (i. e., gene-expression analyses) are useful for evaluating the safety, efficacy, and mechanistic basis of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents,</b> the biomarkers are often poorly related to the phenotype, due to posttranscriptional regulation. Proteome analyses can evaluate preclinical phenotype alterations, but only at low protein counts. MicroRNA alterations, which are essential for the development of cancer, may be modulated by <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents.</b> Furthermore, microRNA delivery may be used to counteract carcinogenesis.

40|$|Despite {{substantial}} {{progress in}} screening, early diagnosis, {{and the development}} of noninvasive technology, gastrointes-tinal (GI) cancer remains a major cause of cancer-associated mortality. Chemoprevention is thought to be a realistic ap-proach for reducing the global burden of GI cancer, and efforts have been made to search for <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> that suppress acid reflux, GI inflammation and the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Thus, proton pump inhibi-tors, statins, monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been investigated for their potential to prevent GI can-cer. Besides the development of these synthetic agents, a wide variety of the natural products present in a plant-based diet, which are commonly called phytoceuticals, have also sparked hope for the chemoprevention of GI cancer. To perform successful searches of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> for GI cancer, it is of the utmost importance to understand the factors contributing to GI carcinogenesis.

40|$|Bioactive dietary {{agents have}} been shown to {{regulate}} multiple cancer hallmark pathways. Epidemiologic studies have linked consumption of Allium vegetables, such as garlic and onions, to decreased incidence of cancer. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a bioactive compound derived from Allium vegetables, has been investigated as an anti-cancer and <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agent.</b> Preclinical studies provide ample evidence that DATS regulates multiple cancer hallmark pathways including cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. DATS has been shown to arrest cancer cells at multiple stages of the cell cycle with the G 2 /M arrest being the most widely reported. Additionally, increased pro-apoptotic capacity as a result of regulating intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway components has been widely reported following DATS treatment. Invasion, migration, and angiogenesis represent emerging targets of DATS and support its anti-cancer properties.

Although smoking cessation is a primary strategy for preventing lung cancer, former smokers remain at high risk of cancer. Accordingly, {{there is a need to}} increase the efficacy of lung cancer prevention. Poor bioavailability is the main factor limiting the efficacy of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents.</b> The aim of this study was to increase the efficacy of cancer <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> by using lipid nanoparticles (NPs) as a carrier. This study evaluated the ability of lipid NPs to modify the pharmacodynamics of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> including N-acetyl- L-cysteine, phenethyl isothiocyanate and resveratrol (RES). The chemopreventive efficacy of these drugs was determined by evaluating their abilities to counteract cytotoxic damage (DNA fragmentation) induced by cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and to activate protective apoptosis (annexin-V cytofluorimetric staining) in bronchial epithelial cells both in vitro and in ex vivo experiment in mice. NPs decreased the toxicity of RES and increased its ability to counteract CSC cytotoxicity. NPs significantly increased the ability of phenethyl isothiocyanate to attenuate CSC-induced DNA fragmentation at the highest tested dose. In contrast, this potentiating effect was observed at all tested doses of RES, NPs dramatically increasing RES-induced apoptosis in CSC-treated cells. These results provide evidence that NPs are highly effective at increasing the efficacy of lipophilic drugs (RES) but are not effective towards hydrophilic agents (N-acetyl-L-cysteine), which already possess remarkable bioavailability. Intermediate effects were observed for phenethyl isothiocyanate. These findings are relevant to the identification of cancer <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> that would benefit from lipid NP delivery...|$|R

Isothiocyanates inhibited isolated redox-active enzymes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. As shown for the most active compound, benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), on thioredoxin reductase, the inhibition has an initial competitive part (Kis 6. 1 " 1. 0 mM) followed by a time-dependent irreversible inhibition (k 2 s 72. 8 " 25. 5 M- 1 s- 1). Also, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase were irreversibly modified by BITC. Sulforaphane led to irreversible inhibition of the studied redox enzymes, but with 5 – 10 times lower k 2 values. In contrast, allyl sulfides had only moderate effects on the tested enzymes. However, diallyl disulfide was found to react directly with reduced glutathione (k 2 s 100 M- 2 s- 1). This reaction might contribute to enhanced oxidative stress and the induction of the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase as determined on activity and transcript levels. All <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> tested induced transcript levels of genes associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

40|$|Laboratory and {{clinical}} {{studies suggest that}} genetic change is intrinsically involved {{in the development of}} cancer and that this change occurs in humans throughout carcinogenesis, in both early and late stages. Therefore, the quantification of the level of genetic change in human epithelial tissues may serve as a marker for cancer risk. The micronucleus test has been used to quantify the level of site-specific chromosomal breakage occurring in epithelial tissues of individuals at elevated risk for cancer. These studies include individuals exposed to carcinogens, patients who have chromosome-breakage syndromes, and individuals with premalignant lesions. As a counterpart to this approach, the assay has been used to study the suppression of this breakage with <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents,</b> some of which occur naturally in the diet. These agents include beta-carotene, retinyl palmitate, 13 -cis-retinoic acid, riboflavin, canthaxanthin, and folic acid. Not all of these agents were effective.

The results of these studies suggest that successful intervention with <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> will depend on tailoring treatment regimens to specific populations.

40|$|The {{effect of}} diet on cancer {{formation}} {{and prevention of}} carcinogenesis has attracted considerable attention for years and {{is the subject of}} several studies. Some components of the daily diet, such as resveratrol, curcumin, genistein, gingerol, can significantly reduce the risk of cancer or affect the rate of tumor progression. Cancer chemoprevention assumes the use of natural or synthetic biologically active substances in order to prevent, inhibit or reverse the progression of cancer. There are many biologically active compounds in several natural products, i. e. garlic, ginger, soy, curcuma, tomatoes, cruciferous plants or green tea. Their chemopreventive activity is based on the inhibition of processes underlying carcinogenesis (inflammation, transformation and proliferation), but also affects the final phase of carcinogenesis - angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite the relatively low toxicity of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents,</b> their molecular targets often coincide with the objectives of the currently used cancer therapies. The widespread use of <b>chemopreventive</b> <b>agents</b> may contribute to reduction of the rate of cancer incidence, and increase the effectiveness of conventional cancer therapies.
