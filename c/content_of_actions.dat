S. business professionals, we explore {{the effect of}} national culture on ethical decision-making {{within the context of}} business. Using Reidenbach and Robin’s (1988) multi-criteria ethics instrument, we examined how these two countries’ differences on Hofstede’s individualism/collectivism dimension are related to the manner in which business practitioners make ethical decisions. Our results indicate that Brazilians and Americans evaluate the ethical <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> or decisions differently when applying utilitarian criteria. By contrast, business people from both countries do not differ sig-nificantly when they use egoistic criteria in evaluating the ethical nature of business decisions...|$|E
40|$|Body {{language}} {{reading is}} of significance for daily life social cognition and successful social interaction, and constitutes a core component of social competence. Yet {{it is unclear}} whether our ability for body language reading is gender specific. In the present work, female and male observers had to visually recognize emotions through point-light human locomotion performed by female and male actors with different emotional expressions. For subtle emotional expressions only, males surpass females in recognition accuracy and readiness to respond to happy walking portrayed by female actors, whereas females exhibit a tendency to be better in recognition of hostile angry locomotion expressed by male actors. In contrast to widespread beliefs about female superiority in social cognition, the findings suggest that gender effects in recognition of emotions from human locomotion are modulated by emotional <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> and opposite actor gender. In a nutshell, the study makes a further step in elucidation of gender impact on body language reading and on neurodevelopmental and psychiatric deficits in visual social cognition...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Interpretations of women's {{activism}} {{depend on}} {{the ways in which}} analysts conceptualize the relations between privacy, publicity, and politics. In this paper the relationship between women's standing in the public sphere and their activism is problematized. Women's activism is shaped by strategic, and sometimes opportunistic, choices to locate their activism either in public or in private spaces. These choices point to the importance of reconceptualizmg publicity and privacy in ways that separate the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> from the spaces in which action is taken. Such a distinction creates the possibility of taking private actions into public spaces and of taking public actions in private spaces. When the content of action is separated from the spaces of action, women's activism is evaluated in terms of the efficacy of various actions in either public or private spaces, rather than in terms of women's presumed lack of access to the public sphere. Despite years of feminist organizing, women occupy an ambiguous position in US politics. Most traditional political analyses have focused on activities in electoral and governmental arenas; the actions of individuals that are not directed to formal institutions such as government, political parties, and the like, have been held to be beyond politics. As a result, community work and much of the work of women ha...|$|E

This institutional rule-perspective is then aligned with Action Situations at Ostrom’s three analytical levels, considering that different legal institutions are relevant to the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> Situation rules. In the second step, the institutional rule-perspective is placed in the specific legal setting of a example in a Dutch municipality.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 92 - 101. In pharmacological experiments, {{a popular}} method {{to discover the}} effects of psychotherapeutic drugs is to monitor behaviors of laboratory mice subjected to drugs by vision sensors. Such surveillance operations are currently performed by human observers for practical reasons. Automating behavior analysis of laboratory mice by vision-based methods saves both time and human labor. In this study, we focus on automated action recognition of laboratory mice from short video clips in which only one action is performed. A two-stage hierarchical recognition method is designed to address the problem. In the first stage, still actions such as sleeping are separated from other action classes based {{on the amount of}} the motion area. Remaining action classes are discriminated by the second stage for which we propose four alternative methods. In the first method, we project 3 D action volume onto 2 D images by encoding temporal variations of each pixel using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Resulting images are modeled and classified by hidden Markov models in maximum likelihood sense. The second method transforms action recognition problem into a sequence matching problem by explicitly describing pose of the subject in each frame. Instead of segmenting the subject from the background, we only take temporally active portions of the subject into consideration in pose description. Histograms of oriented gradients are employed to describe poses in frames. In the third method, actions are represented by a set of histograms of normalized spatio-temporal gradients computed from entire action volume at different temporal resolutions. The last method assumes that actions are collections of known spatio-temporal templates and can be described by histograms of those. To locate and describe such templates in actions, multi-scale 3 D Harris corner detector and histogram of oriented gradients and optical flow vectors are employed, respectively. We test the proposed action recognition framework on a publicly available mice action dataset. In addition, we provide comparisons of each method with well-known studies in the literature. We find that the second and the fourth methods outperform both related studies and the other two methods in our framework in overall recognition rates. However, the more successful methods suffer from heavy computational cost. This study shows that representing actions as an ordered sequence of pose descriptors is quite effective in action recognition. In addition, success of the fourth method reveals that sparse spatio-temporal templates characterize the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> quite well. Sandıkcı, SelçukM. S...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{debate over}} the moral {{responsibility}} of psychopaths has centered on whether, or in what sense, they understand moral requirements.

I advance two independent justifications of this claim. First, I argue that if the psychopath comes to know what morality requires via a route that does not involve a proper appreciation {{of what it means to}} cause another harm or distress, the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> violations of rules against harm will be of a lower grade than the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> similar <b>actions</b> by normal individuals. Second, I argue that in order to intend a harm to a person—that is, to intend the distinctive kind of harm that can only befall a person—it is necessary to understand what personhood is and what makes it valuable. The psychopath's deficits with regard to mental time travel ensure that s/he cannot intend this kind of harm. © 2014 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis.

Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although The Adventures of Tintin and Asterix serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{philosophers}} have broadly studied intentional {{actions that}} agents attempt {{to perform in}} the world. However, logicians <b>of</b> <b>action</b> have tended to neglect the intentionality proper to human action. I will present here the basic principles and laws of a logic <b>of</b> individual <b>action</b> where intentional actions are primary as in contemporary philosophy <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> In my view, any action that an agent performs unintentionally could in principle have been attempted. Moreover any unintentional <b>action</b> <b>of</b> an agent is an effect <b>of</b> intentional <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> that agent. So my logic <b>of</b> <b>action</b> contains a theory of attempt and <b>of</b> <b>action</b> generation. As Belnap pointed out, action, branching time and historic modalities are logically related. There is the liberty <b>of</b> voluntary <b>action.</b> I will then work out a logic <b>of</b> <b>action</b> that is compatible with indeterminism. Propositions with the same truth conditions are not the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the same attitudes of human agents.
