40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative model of multicomponent gas diffusion and flow in bulk coals, focusing on CH 4 -CO 2 counter-diffusion associated with CO 2 -sequestration enhanced coalbed methane (CO 2 -ECBM) recovery. The model was developed {{based on the}} bidisperse diffusion mechanism and the Maxwell-Stefan (MS) diffusion theory, which provides an improved simulation of multicomponent gas diffusion dynamics. The model was firstly validated under the condition of pure gas diffusion by comparing with the analytical solutions of a bidisperse diffusion model and the experimental data obtained from pure-gas sorption kinetic tests. Then it was numerically solved by considering CH 4 -CO 2 counter-diffusion and flow in a large coal sample to simulate a laboratory CO 2 -injection <b>core</b> <b>flush</b> experiment.

The study aimed for {{a better understanding of}} the CO 2 -sequestration enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) recovery process. The transport model used was based on the bidisperse diffusion mechanism and Maxwell-Stefan (MS) diffusion theory. This provides an alternative approach to simulate multicomponent gas diffusion and flow in bulk coals. A series of high-stress <b>core</b> <b>flush</b> tests were performed on a large coal sample sourced from a Bowen Basin coal mine in Queensland, Australia to investigate the kinetics of one gas displacing another. These experimental results were used to derive gas diffusivities, and to examine the predictive capability of the diffusion model. The simulations show good agreements with the displacement experiments, revealing that MS diffusion theory is superior for describing diffusion of mixed gases in coals compared with the constant Fick diffusivity model.

The relative error for the width of artificial fracture decreased to 1 %. The width of natural and artificial fractures in carbonate reservoirs can be estimated by image log data. A series of tests for formation damage were conducted by using the stainless steel simulated <b>core</b> samples <b>flushed</b> with different drilling fluids, such as the sulfonate/polymer drill-in fluid and the solids-free drill-in fluid with or without ideal packing bridging materials. Based on the experimental results using this kind of simulated cores, a novel approach to the damage control of fractured carbonate reservoirs was presented.

40|$|During {{a loss of}} coolant {{accident}} in a pressurized water reactor, borated water is injected into the core through emergency core cooling system to reduce the decay heat, remove excess reactivity, and maintain an adequate core cooling throughout the full range of accident phases. Concentration of boric acid in the core is expected to increase over time due to the continuous vaporization of water from the core. Under certain conditions, the concentration may reach the solubility limit and precipitation of boric acid may occur. Hot leg switchover is a manual emergency procedure involving simultaneous injection through both the hot and cold legs to ensure adequate <b>core</b> <b>flushing</b> and prevent or mitigate precipitation of solid boric acid in the core. The nuclear research community, industry, and regulatory commission are currently collaborating to understand the possible effects of the precipitation of boric acid on adequate core cooling during the long-term phase of a loss of coolant scenario, particularly in understanding whether modifications of the current procedures are required. An experimental apparatus was constructed to conduct experiments with de-ionized water and boric acid, to observe and study the ow behavior, and to measure the boric acid concentration in boiling water environments in geometry similar to a pressurized water reactor. Three methods for quantifying boric acid content at very high concentrations, even exceeding saturation, were explored. A gravimetric method for concentration determination proved to be the most effective for high values as were observed in the test facility. Concentration of solution in the test section was approximately solved using an analytic approach for comparison to experimentally determined values. During experimentation, concentrations of boric acid were found to increase linearly with time. Rapid boiling in the test section induced uniform mixing in the test section, causing no appreciable difference in the concentration trends between various solution injection locations and other operational parameters of the facility. The rate of increase of boric acid concentration in the solution was observed to be proportional to the applied power to the heating rods in the facility test section. Comparison of boric acid concentration with the analytical solution confirmed that a fraction of the boric acid was transported within the vapor phase outside the test facility. Fractional boric acid loss from the test section was found to be lower than estimated from the observed losses during the calibration procedure. The constructed facility is used in the study of effects of the precipitate on coolant flow conditions related to cooling capabilities during the long-term cooling phase in a {{loss of coolant accident}}. Acquiring this understanding could help the resolution of General Safety Issue 191 as imposed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission...|$|R

40|$|High {{performance}} multi-core processors {{are becoming}} an industry reality. Although multi-cores are suited for multithreaded and multi-programmed workloads, many applications are still mono-thread and multi-core performance {{with a single}} thread workload is an important issue. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that performance, power and temperature considerations of future multi-cores may necessitate activity-migration between cores. Motivated by the above, this paper investigates the performance implications of single thread migration on a multi-core. Specifically, the study considers the influence {{on the performance of}} a single thread of the following migration and multi-core parameters: frequency of migration, core warm-up modes, subset of resources that are warmed-up, number of cores, and cache hierarchy organization. The results of this study can provide insight to architects on how to design performance-efficient power and thermal strategies for a multi-core chip. The experimental results, for the benchmarks and microarchitectures used in this study, show that the performance loss due to activity migration on a multi-core with private L 1 s and a shared L 2 can be minimized if: (a) a migrating thread continues its execution on a core that was previously visited by the thread, and (b) cores remember their predictor state since their previous activation (all other core resources can be cold). The analogous conclusions for a multi-core with private L 1 s and L 2 s and a shared L 3 are: remembering the predictor state, maintaining the tags of the various L 2 caches coherent and allowing L 2 -L 2 data transfers from inactive cores to the active core. The data also show that when migration period is at least every 160 K cycles, the transfer of register state between two <b>cores</b> and the <b>flushing</b> of dirty private L 1 data have a negligible performance overhead. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{forecast}} {{the development of}} waterquality of lakes resulting from opencast mining {{it is necessary to}} understand the interactions between lake sediments and the water body. Therefore sediments of an acidic and a neutral mining lake were investigated in a closed lignite mine in Mid-Germany (Goitsche near Leipzig). The small water bodies were formed by ascending groundwater within the last six years. Sediment cores of each lake were taken four times in 1997 / 98. Physicochemical parameters (O_ 2, pH, E_H) were determined and the pore waters were investigated for Fe, Mn, DOC, SO_ 4 " 2 "-, nutrients and heavy metals (Zn, Ni, As). The geochemical and mineralogical composition of solid phases were determined once for each lake. Flooding of acid mining lakes with river water causes large quantities of phosphorus to sorptively bind to iron hydroxides which, through re-dissolution from the sediments, can be released back into the pore water thereby entering the water column. To investigate P-retention in the sediments incubation experiments of sediment cores from an acid mining lake were carried out, with which conditions during and after the flooding were simulated. The sediment <b>cores</b> were <b>flushed</b> regularly with acidic and neutral river water, of which samples were regularly taken during the incubation. Additionally, the influence on a carbon-enriched sediment and mud enriched with Fe(OH) _ 3 was examined. The sediment cores were removed from the incubation system after several weeks. Geochemical investigation of pore waters and solid phases were performed. One strategy to remediate acidic mining lakes is flooding of the mine pit with river water. The different possible effects of flooding on the lake sediment were simulated in a mesocosm experiment using intact sediment cores. Plankton material and Fe hydroxides enriched with phosphorus were applied to the sediment surface to minic the expected Fe precipitation and organic carbon supply by plankton sedimentation. The overflowing river water was kept acidic or neutral to simulate different stages of the flooding process. Additions stimulated microbial activity and proliferation whereas neutral water alone had little effects. A reducing zone with elevated pH was generated near the surface where Fe(III) reduction and sulfate reduction subsequently occurred. In the first period accumulation of Fe(II) phases was observed in this zone and later sulfide phases were formed. Fe(II) oxidation was inhibited in this zone, but recovered to initial values after prolonged incubation of the assays. Bacterial numbers generally followed the observed activities. Our results show that easily degradable organic matter is crucial for microbial alkalinity generation and water pH is of minor importance. As a consequence, the use of a nutrient-rich productive river for mine pit flooding is expected to have beneficial effects on the water quality of the treated lake. (orig.)

40|$|Several papers {{dealing with}} {{laboratory}} experiments or field operations confirm that, in some circumstances, low salinity waterflooding improves oil recovery. However, the basic mechanisms explaining the oil recovery improvement are not clearly established. The literature points out several hypotheses, {{among them is}} the role of clay particles detachment and migration. Experiments using an intermediate-wet clayey sandstone were first performed showing an oil recovery increment when the injected brine salinity was reduced. SEM observations on native and <b>flushed</b> <b>cores</b> show the differences of pore surfaces before and after the low salinity waterflooding and the peculiar role of clay particles. Following this trail, in a second set of experiments we investigated the role of microparticles on the formation and stability of brine/oil emulsions when the salinity is changed. For that, we used calibrated latex particles negatively charged and several oils (mineral, crude and a blend of the two). Emulsion samples were observed using an optical microscope to determine their droplet size distributions and interface structures. The macroscopic stability of the emulsions was also investigated. The results show that the particle wettability, which is related to its surface charge and brine salinity, plays a central role. For high salinity the particles are hydrophobic and migrate toward the brine/oil interface forming a stable emulsion known as “Pickering emulsion”. For low salinity the particles are hydrophilic and the emulsion is not stable. In a third step the same latex particles were deposited in an artificial consolidated porous medium prior to two phase flow experiments. Our results show that even if no recovery improvement is observed, colloidal particles are recovered at the outlet when low salinity waterflooding is performed. The additional oil recovery during a low salinity brine injection is not a direct consequence of the particles mobilization but involves several mechanisms such as rock and brine composition, particle and oil nature, wettability, …. A thorough analysis of all these mechanisms calls upon further studies. Collaboration avec TOTA...|$|R
40|$|The current {{conceptual}} model of radionuclide transport in unsaturated fractured rock includes water movement in fractures, with migration of the entrained radionuclides being retarded by diffusion into and sorption within the rock matrix. Water infiltration and radionuclide transport through low-permeability unsaturated fractured rock are episodic and intermittent in nature, {{at least at}} local scales. Under episodic flow conditions, the matrix is constantly imbibing or draining, and this fluctuating wetness both drives two-way advective movement of radionuclides, and forces changes in the matrix diffusivity. This work is intended to examine, both experimentally and numerically, how radionuclide transport under episodic flow conditions {{is affected by the}} interacting processes of imbibition and drainage, diffusion, and matrix sorption. Using Topopah Spring welded volcanic tuff, collected from the potential repository geologic unit at Yucca Mountain for storing high-level nuclear waste, we prepared a saw-cut fracture core (length 10. 2 cm, diameter 4. 4 cm, and fracture aperture 100 {micro}m). The dry core was packed into a flow reactor, flushed with CO{sub 2 }, then saturated via slow pumping (0. 01 mL/min) of synthetic groundwater. The fractured <b>core</b> was then <b>flushed</b> with air at > 97 % relative humidity (to simulate in situ unsaturated fractured rock conditions at Yucca Mountain), then the episodic transport experiment was conducted. Episodic flow involved 4 cycles of tracer solution flow within the fracture, followed by flushing with high humidity air.

40|$|Water {{production}} {{is a growing}} problem within the oil industry, as oil and gas fields mature worldwide and water breakthrough {{becomes more and more}} common. Often water production leads to reduction in productivity and reduction of the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery from a field. The challenges we face in regard to water production are outlined in Chapter 1 as are some of the solutions available today to reduce or mitigate water production. The purpose of this research project was to investigate the physical and chemical behaviour of TMOS, an oil-soluble chemical that forms a gel when it encounters and reacts with water. Silanes such as TMOS are well known and extensive research has been done to understand their behaviour and the parameters that influence that behaviour. A summary of relevant studies is given in Chapter 2. Although well-known in single phase aqueous solutions, the behaviour in a multiphase system such as an oilfield is less well understood. For this purpose the mass transfer and gelation behaviour was investigated in a two phase system with TMOS dissolved in an oil phase in contact. The results of this study are presented in Chapter 3. These multiphase bulk experiments were performed in an X-ray CT scanner, and periodic scans allowed the reconstruction of TMOS in the oil and the water phase. TMOS is initially dissolved in the oil phase, and transfers to the water phase. In the water phase the TMOS first hydrolyzes to silicic acid, and ultimately condensates to form silica gel. The mass transfer of TMOS from the oil phase to the water phase can be described with a simple exponential law. Gelation could be identified by the onset of high density silica clusters which show up on the CT images as bright spots. Several parameters were investigated to see their effect on mass transfer. The initial concentration of TMOS in the oil phase does not significantly affect the mass transfer behaviour, although increasing initial concentrations do tend to speed up gelation. The volume fraction of water to oil phase does have a measureable effect: when the ratio of water to oil increases mass transfer also increases. Addition of salt to the water phase does not significantly affect the mass transfer, but it does tend to decrease the gel time. The pH of the aqueous solution has a large impact, both high and low pH lead to fast mass transfer, with a minimal transfer rate around neutral pH. The gel time is extremely shortened at high pH, with flocculation in the aqueous phase observed almost immediately. At low pH gelation is faster than at neutral pH, but slower than at high pH. After characterizing the behaviour of TMOS in bulk, the behaviour in porous media needs to be investigated. For this purpose a series of multiphase flow experiments is performed (the experimental method is described in Chapter 4). First the multiphase flow is characterized (Chapter 5), after which the flow behavior during TMOS injection is investigated (Chapter 6). Compared to the bulk experiments mass transfer is significantly faster because the interfacial area between the oil phase and the water phase within the porous media is much greater than in the test tubes used in the experiments described in Chapter 3. Injection of TMOS in a porous medium is also more dynamic than the static bulk experiments: TMOS dissolved in oil is injected into the porous media after the water saturation is reduced to residual water saturation and only oil is mobile. Once mass transfer begins the in situ water saturation increases, and water will once again become mobile. This affects not only the viscosities of the oil and the water phase, but also the relative permeability of the phases through changing the in situ saturations. The flow behavior during TMOS injection can be separated into five phases. The first two stages represent an initial period in which mass transfer does not occur {{as a result of the}} initially low solubility of TMOS in water (stage I and II). Once small volumes transfer and react to form silicic acid and methanol solubility increases and next a period in which mass transfer initiates (stage III). This is an accelerating but finite process. The experiments show that the water phase can only contain a finite amount of TMOS. Once this maximum is reached mass transfer slows down (stage IV) and ultimately terminates (Stage V). TMOS placement is influenced by the rate of injection, which controls the residence time of the oil/TMOS mixture in the porous medium. Faster injection rate tends to stretch the exhibited mass transfer behavior, whereas low injection rates tends to compact the different phases, and very low injection rates can cause extensive permeability reduction due to the onset of gelation during TMOS placement. At high injection rates the core permeability is not significantly damaged by the TMOS placement. The effect of TMOS placement and gelation is described in Chapter 7. Gelation is steered by varying the type of back <b>flush.</b> If the <b>core</b> is <b>flushed</b> with brine after TMOS placement the permeability reduction is large, whereas <b>flushing</b> the <b>core</b> with oil after TMOS placement leads to little or no permeability reduction, as long as the injection rate during TMOS placement was high enough to avoid gelation during the placement stage itself.
