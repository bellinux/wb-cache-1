50|$|Many of The Avengers episodes include {{location}} shots {{around the}} Bushey area, {{and the latter}} half of the Confessions of a Driving Instructor is entirely shot on the roads between Elstree and Bushey, finishing in the <b>car</b> <b>dump</b> at 'Bushey Breakers'.|$|E
50|$|For {{their weekly}} {{challenge}} {{the girls were}} driven to a <b>car</b> <b>dump,</b> there Michael explained they would be walking on a haulaway wearing eco-chic flowy dresses designed by Leila Hafzi, the models would also be displaying floral ornaments on their heads. The task proves to be intimidating for some girls and particularly for Elisa who comments on her tension before her performance. Marianna has a meltdown after the challenge, feeling she might have lost control of her body and fearing to be ousted for this mistake {{she will not be}} able to forgive herself for.|$|E

50|$|Alternatives to {{the rotary}} <b>dump</b> <b>cars</b> are bottom <b>dump</b> <b>cars</b> with bottom doors, and back end hoes which unload gondola cars. The former has the {{disadvantage}} that any imperfection in the seals {{of the doors}} allows material to spill onto the track.|$|R
40|$|In 2002 a truck {{loaded with}} used car scrap {{triggered}} a radiation monitoring gate detector at a scrapyard. The material under suspicion {{turned out to}} be some ceramic waste material. The ceramic waste was used for many years to raise roads or pave yards and premises in the surroundings of Almelo, {{as was the case with}} the used <b>car</b> <b>dump</b> where the metal scrap came from. The ceramic material contains zircon sand, which has elevated concentrations of naturally occuring radionuclides. Therefore, using this waste in a surface soil layer may cause radiological exposures to the public. From measurements at the used <b>car</b> <b>dump</b> dose rates were determined up to ten times the background. From further research it was determined that part of the ceramic waste has concentrations above exemption level. From these measurements it was also concluded that the ceramic material is retaining radon and its decay products. From some calculations a maximum effective annual dose was estimated of about 1 mSv. This dose is determined mainly by external radiation and is for long lasting exposure on some large factory grounds. On the other hand, children might be playing in smaller yards or premises. Ingestion might play some role in that case. For this exposure path an annual dose of 0. 12 mSv was calculated. For adults this is not an important exposure path. Inhalation doesn't seem to play an important role neither for adults nor for children...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTaking the {{unloading}} {{process of}} <b>car</b> <b>dump</b> as the research object, a dust control model {{is set up}} by combining the overturned process and the dumper chamber structure characteristics. The push-pull flow is adopted to control the openness dust from the source, the control parameters calculation method has been given {{and the results of}} the model have gone through the CFD simulation. The simulation results show that the push-pull flow can control the dust effectively from the source, the relative concentration of dust in the working area reducing from 78 % to 9 %, and the dust control rate is 85 % to 90 %...|$|E
50|$|The tunnel had two coal {{receiving}} {{stations in}} 1915 for loading coal onto tunnel trains. One was {{served by the}} Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, the other by the Chicago and Alton Railroad. Surface railroad <b>cars</b> <b>dumped</b> coal into bins under the track, from which chutes led down to the tunnel. A tunnel car could be loaded with a full load of 3+1/2 ST of coal in two seconds.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{are often}} {{specialized}} to deliver {{different types of}} goods. On land, semi-trailers are outfitted with various trailers such as box trailers, flatbeds, car carriers, tanks and other specialized trailers, while railroad trains include similarly specialized <b>cars.</b> Armored <b>cars,</b> <b>dump</b> trucks and concrete mixers are examples of vehicles specialized for delivery of specific types of goods. On the sea, merchant ships come in various forms, such as cargo ships, oil tankers and fishing boats. Freight aircraft are used to deliver cargo.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{self-propelled}} guns, military tractors, {{tracked vehicles}} {{and other military}} material were produced. The plant was partially evacuated to the Ural region in October 1941. The equipment was back the following year. In 1947, production of dump trucks was started. The company later concentrated on production of subway <b>cars,</b> <b>dump</b> trucks and armored tracked vehicles (e.g. GM chassises). A number of models of Metrovagonmash subway cars have been deployed in nearly every subway (Metro) system of the former Soviet Union, {{as well as in}} Budapest, Prague, Sofia and Warsaw.|$|R

5000|$|Buddy L {{made such}} {{products}} as toy <b>cars,</b> <b>dump</b> trucks, delivery vans, fire engines, construction equipment, and trains. Fred Lundahl used to manufacture for International Harvester trucks. He started {{by making a}} toy dump truck out of steel scraps for his son Buddy. Soon after, he started selling Buddy L [...] "toys for boys", made of pressed steel. Many were large enough {{for a child to}} straddle, propelling himself with his feet. Others were pull toys. A pioneer in the steel-toy field, Lundahl persuaded Marshall Field's and F. A. O. Schwarz to carry his line. He did very well until the Depression, then sold the company.|$|R

5000|$|In 2002, {{she went}} to India for a visit after 6 years and {{happened}} to meet a man whom she briefly dated when she {{used to live in}} Mumbai as a teen. He told her that he had been waiting for her all these years and that he hadn't moved on. Sapna, at once, decided to leave everything in the United States - her job, career, house and boyfriend - and be with that man and start life afresh in Mumbai. She narrated, [...] "So I went back to LA, sold my house and <b>car,</b> <b>dumped</b> my Elvis lookalike boyfriend and moved here (to Mumbai)," [...] However, their relationship didn't work out but Sapna developed a likelihood for the city she had grown up in as a child.|$|R
5000|$|Maranville {{was known}} as one of [...] "baseball's most famous clowns" [...] due to his {{practical}} jokes and lack of inhibitions. When he was appointed manager of the Chicago Cubs in 1925—one of their worst seasons ever—he did not change his behavior. One night he went through a Pullman <b>car</b> <b>dumping</b> water on sleeping players' heads, saying, [...] "No sleeping under Maranville management, especially at night." [...] Not long after that, he was out on the street outside Ebbets Field in Brooklyn mimicking a newsboy hawking papers. He cried out, [...] "Read all about it! Maranville fired!" [...] And so he was—the next day.Following the end of his playing career, Maranville turned to managing, including stints as a minor league manager for Montreal Royals, at Albany, Elmira, and Springfield, Massachusetts.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the time}} of his death in 1986, the FBI {{suspected}} Spilotro was responsible for at least 22 murders. Spilotro was indicted in 1983 for his role in the murders of Bill McCarthy and James Miraglia, popularized in the press as the [...] "M&M Murders." [...] McCarthy and Miraglia were two young criminals who had robbed and shot two businessmen and a woman in the mobster-populated neighborhood of Elmwood Park, near Chicago. They were also in debt to Spilotro's old boss, Sam DeStefano. Their bodies were discovered on May 15, 1962, in the trunk of a <b>car</b> <b>dumped</b> on the Southwest Side of Chicago. Both had been beaten badly and had their throats slit. From McCarthy's injuries, it seems his head was placed in a vise, popping out his eye, presumably to persuade him to disclose the whereabouts of Miraglia. The murder of Bill McCarthy (renamed [...] "Tony Dogs") is included in Martin Scorsese's 1995 film Casino. Spilotro would later refer to McCarthy as the toughest man he ever met.|$|R

40|$|Muck {{conveyors}} are {{a potential}} source of airborne dust. Muck from the excavated face, which is usually fairly wet when placed on the conveyor, dries out as it travels on the conveyor through the airstream. Water sprays placed at intervals along the conveyor will minimize dust from the conveyor contaminating the airstream. Conveyor transfer and drop points should be enclosed and provided with water sprays. Scraper and spray wash will wash return belts and idlers. 7. 5. 11 Airways, Haulage Ways, Mine <b>Cars</b> and <b>Dumping</b> Stations a) Airways and rail haulage ways Cleaning the walls and floors of airways and rail haulage ways, by periodically washing down or vacuuming, will remove many potential dust sources. Concrete lined openings facilitate cleaning. Residual dust and dirt {{should not be allowed}} to accumulate in the airways and haulage ways as these represent potential dust sources. b) Mine cars Keeping the muck in the mine cars wet reduces the potential for creating dust. Overloading cars must be avoided as it can lead to spillage which then becomes another potential dust source. Washing mine cars regularly will keep them free of dirt and dust, and parking a loaded mine car for a long periods should be avoided as this allows the muck to dry out. If feasible, major route of mine cars should not be along primary intake airways. c) Dumping Stations Subsurface muck <b>car</b> <b>dumping</b> stations represent major potential dust sources. Enclosure and bypass airways can be installed to avoid high velocity air/dust contact. Water spray at dump activated during dumping will wet the muck and suppress dust. Local dust scrubbers located at the dumps will clean dusty air that escapes from the dump station enclosures. Choice of location and equipment for dump stations must prioritize dust control. 7. 5. 12 Leakage and Recirculation of Contaminated Air from Exhaust Ducts Leakage from exhaust ducts containing contaminated air and subsequent recirculation of the leakage contributes to dust problems.
