60|$|It really {{seemed as}} if the {{battered}} visage of the House of the Seven Gables, black and heavy-browed as it still certainly looked, must have shown a kind of cheerfulness glimmering through its dusky windows as Phoebe passed to and fro in the interior. Otherwise, it is impossible to explain how the people of the neighborhood so soon became aware of the girl's presence. There was a great run of <b>custom,</b> <b>setting</b> steadily in, from about ten o' clock until towards noon,--relaxing, somewhat, at dinner-time, but recommencing in the afternoon, and, finally, dying away a half an hour or so before the long day's sunset. One of the stanchest patrons was little Ned Higgins, the devourer of Jim Crow and the elephant, who to-day signalized his omnivorous prowess by swallowing two dromedaries and a locomotive. Phoebe laughed, as she summed up her aggregate of sales upon the slate; while Hepzibah, first drawing on a pair of silk gloves, reckoned over the sordid accumulation of copper coin, not without silver intermixed, that had jingled into the till.|$|E

For example, flying scenery on an ordinary batten would not qualify as spot rigging; flying a chandelier on a dedicated line would be. Likewise, if a wall were being flown in on a batten which was installed at an angle neither parallel nor perpendicular to the proscenium line, it would qualify as spot rigging, because <b>custom</b> <b>setting</b> of lift lines would be required.|$|E

5000|$|Wonders are {{important}} {{buildings in the}} game. They are real-life structures ranging from the Colossus and the Pyramids to the Supercollider and Space Program. They provide various benefits such as improving resource gathering or making units cheaper. Building wonders can also allow a player {{to win the game}} if 'wonder victory' is chosen as a <b>custom</b> <b>setting</b> of the game, as each wonder is worth a preset amount of [...] "Wonder Points". Wonders can be built starting in the Classical Age. The only exception is the Egyptians can make wonders an age earlier. As you progress in the game the wonders become more expensive, but generate more points. For example, the Supercollider is worth eight times as much as the Pyramids in terms of Wonder Points.|$|E

The {{problem of}} {{scarcity}} of ground-truth expert delineations of medical image data {{is a serious}} one that impedes the training and validation of medical image analysis techniques. We develop an algorithm for the automatic generation of large databases of annotated images from a single reference dataset. We provide a web-based interface through which the users can upload a reference data set (an image and its corresponding segmentation and landmark points), provide <b>custom</b> <b>setting</b> of parameters, and, following server-side computations, generate and download an arbitrary number of novel ground-truth data, including segmentations, displacement vector fields, intensity nonuniformity maps, and point correspondences. To produce realistic simulated data, we use variational (statistically-based) and vibrational (physically-based) spatial deformations, nonlinear radiometric warps mimicking imaging nonhomogeneity, and additive random noise with different underlying distributions. We outline the algorithmic details, present sample results, and provide the web address to readers for immediate evaluation and usage...|$|E

The need to validate software utilised as forensic computing tools suffers the same fate and is hampered to a greater extent with the source code of said tools usually not being accessible.
