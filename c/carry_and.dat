5|$|After high school, Mitsuda {{decided to}} leave town and become independent. With {{encouragement}} from his father and sister, he moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Junior College of Music. Despite the school's low prestige, Mitsuda received solid instruction from his professors, most of them practicing musicians who would take Mitsuda to gigs with them to help <b>carry</b> <b>and</b> set up equipment. At the cost of being used for free physical labor, Mitsuda got a first-hand view of the Japanese music world and valuable training {{both in and out}} of the classroom. As part of his college course, he was granted an intern position at the game development studio Wolf Team, studying under composer and musician Motoi Sakuraba, whom Mitsuda would work with together on game projects decades later.|$|E

5|$|In the 1969 season, after a {{slow start}} and despite diminished speed and acceleration, Sayers {{led the league in}} rushing once again with 1,032 yards. He {{averaged}} 4.4 yards per <b>carry</b> <b>and</b> was the only player to gain over 1,000 rushing yards that year. He moved into second place on the Bears' all-time rushing yards list, passing Bronko Nagurski. Sayers was recognized as the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year by United Press International. The Bears, long past the Halas glory years, finished in last place with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. In his fourth and final Pro Bowl appearance, Sayers was the West's leading rusher and its leading receiver. For the third time in as many Pro Bowl performances, he was named the back of the game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Reversible {{logic is}} {{emerging}} as a promising computing paradigm, having its applications in low-power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotech-nology and optical computing. Firstly, we showed a modified design of conventional BCD subtractors and also proposed designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors. The proposed designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors {{are based on the}} novel designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD adders, respectively. Then, we introduced the reversible logic implementation of the modified conventional, as well as the proposed, <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors efficient {{in terms of the number}} of reversible gates used and garbage output produced. To the best of our knowledge, the <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors and their reversible logic design are explored for the first time ever in literature...|$|R

5|$|The 5-inch/38 gun {{would remain}} on the battleships for the ships' entire service life; however, {{the total number of}} guns and gun mounts was reduced from 20 guns in ten mounts to 12 guns in six mounts during the 1980s' {{modernization}} of the four Iowas. The removal of four of the gun mounts was required for the battleships to be outfitted with the armored box launchers needed to <b>carry</b> <b>and</b> fire Tomahawk missiles. At the time of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, these guns had been largely relegated to littoral defense for the battleships. Since each battleship carried a small detachment of Marines aboard, the Marines would man one of the 5-inch gun mounts.|$|E
5|$|The P90 can {{be fitted}} with a sling for greater ease of <b>carry,</b> <b>and</b> since the weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a {{collapsing}} or folding stock), it can be quickly deployed when needed. The weapon's smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter's clothing or equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at {{the front end of}} the weapon's frame to prevent the shooter's hand from accidentally slipping in front of the muzzle while shooting. A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frame—accessed by removing the buttplate—allows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section had a powerful but cumbersome Wireless Set No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to <b>carry</b> <b>and</b> the noise was liable {{to attract the attention}} of the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company had not had time to work with them operationally.|$|E

Payton graduated in 1975 with a Bachelor's degree in Communications.|$|E
5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy {{for a man to}} <b>carry</b> <b>and</b> fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of the}} gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{president}} Ronald Reagan's and Navy Secretary John Lehman's {{effort to create}} a 600-ship Navy, New Jersey was selected for reactivation in the spring of 1981, and she was towed from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Long Beach Naval Shipyard at the end of July 1981 for modernization/reactivation. At the time of the reactivation the Navy envisioned using New Jersey and her sister ship Iowa to meet sustained global requirements and relieve the strain on the Navy created by an increase in U.S. commitments to the Indian Ocean and Caribbean Sea regions. During this time the Navy developed several proposals to update their battleships to carry cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as point defense system mounts. Preliminary modernizations schemes included the removal of four of the ten 5inch gun mounts on New Jersey {{to make room for the}} armored box launchers that would be required to <b>carry</b> <b>and</b> launch the BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the overpressure effects when firing the main battery.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{evacuation}} plan agreed with the DAO, Air America committed 24 of its 28 available helicopters to support {{the evacuation}} and 31 pilots agreed to stay in Saigon to support the evacuation; this meant that most helicopters would have only one pilot rather than the usual two. At 08:30 on 29 April, with the shelling of Tan Son Nhut Airport subsiding, Air America began ferrying its helicopter and fixed-wing pilots from their homes in Saigon to the Air America compound at Tan Son Nhut, {{across the road from}} the DAO Compound. Air America helicopters started flying to the rooftop LZs in Saigon and either shuttled the evacuees back to the DAO Compound or flew out to the ships of TF76. By 10:30 all of Air America's fixed-wing aircraft had departed Tan Son Nhut, evacuating all non-essential personnel and as many Vietnamese evacuees as they could <b>carry</b> <b>and</b> headed for Thailand.

5|$|Box {{lacrosse}}, {{also known}} as indoor lacrosse and sometimes shortened to boxla or simply box, is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America. The game originated in Canada, where {{it is the most}} popular version of the game played in contrast to the traditional field lacrosse game. It is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each, and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered. The playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse. The object of the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a lacrosse stick, to catch, <b>carry,</b> <b>and</b> pass the ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling a solid rubber lacrosse ball into an opponent's goal.|$|E
