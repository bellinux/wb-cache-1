50|$|A liquid-crystal laser is a laser {{that uses}} a liquid crystal as the {{resonator}} cavity, allowing selection of emission wavelength and polarization from the active laser medium. The lasing medium is usually a dye doped into the liquid crystal. Liquid-crystal lasers are comparable in size to diode lasers, but provide the continuous wide spectrum tunability of dye lasers while maintaining a large coherence area. The tuning range is typically several tens of nanometers. Self-organization at micrometer scales reduces manufacturing complexity compared to using layered photonic metamaterials. Operation may be either in <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>mode</b> or in pulsed mode.|$|E
50|$|Alternative DTS {{evaluation}} units {{deploy the}} method of Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR). The OFDR system provides information on the local characteristic only when the backscatter signal detected during the entire measurement time is measured {{as a function of}} frequency in a complex fashion, and then subjected to Fourier transformation. The essential principles of OFDR technology are the quasi <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>mode</b> employed by the laser and the narrow-band detection of the optical back scatter signal. This is offset by the technically difficult measurement of the Raman scatter light and rather complex signal processing, due to the FFT calculation with higher linearity requirements for the electronic components.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{applications}} of lasers {{depend on a}} beam whose output power is constant over time. Such a laser is known as continuous wave (CW). Many types of lasers {{can be made to}} operate in <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>mode</b> to satisfy such an application. Many of these lasers actually lase in several longitudinal modes at the same time, and beats between the slightly different optical frequencies of those oscillations will in fact produce amplitude variations on time scales shorter than the round-trip time (the reciprocal of the frequency spacing between modes), typically a few nanoseconds or less. In most cases these lasers are still termed [...] "continuous wave" [...] as their output power is steady when averaged over any longer time periods, with the very high frequency power variations having little or no impact in the intended application. (However the term is not applied to mode-locked lasers, where the intention is to create very short pulses at the rate of the round-trip time).|$|E
