5|$|During the deportations, {{he tried}} to secure more work permits from the Germans but they refused to issue them. He {{attempted}} to protect those he could. During the Aktion on 3–5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone in the ghetto was checked, holders of work passes– which allowed the holder to protect a spouse and only two children under 16– were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary. At one point, while Gens was checking permits, a family with three children went through the checkpoint, and Gens pulled aside the third child. Shortly afterwards, a family with only one child passed through the checkpoint. Gens began berating the father for losing track of his second child, and pushed the third <b>child</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first family into the second family. This incident took place {{under the supervision of}} German officials, who did not intervene.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} what nutritional, demographic, and behavioral differences existed between children one year of age from two similar WIC clinics with different prevalences of anemia. <b>Children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> higher-prevalence site were found to consume significantly (p <. 05) more B 12, C, copper, fiber, folate, total kilocalories, and riboflavin than did <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower-prevalence site. Family income and maternal weight gain were significantly (p <. 05) higher in the lower-prevalence group as compared to the higher-prevalence group.

5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the aptly named Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a <b>child</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Young Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has a mop of curly hair, wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, the contrast between the caution he has learned from an early age and his longing for the love and affection of a family makes him an intriguing character.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Eve's vengeful adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne {{arranges}} for Eve's past {{relationship with}} Julian {{to be exposed}} to the Russell family and the rest of Harmony, resulting in Chad being erroneously identified as their son. From this point on, the apparently incestuous relationship between Chad and Whitney becomes one of the primary storylines on Passions. Whitney discovers that she is pregnant with Chad's child. She initiates a relationship with Fox Crane to be able to insinuate that he is the father and protect herself, and her <b>child,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stigma of incest. She gives birth to a son and immediately uses her then-boyfriend Fox Crane's power of attorney to put him up for adoption. Two couples—Julian and Eve, and T.C. and Liz—compete to adopt the boy, but Chad is awarded custody of the child. He attempts to use the child to reconnect with Whitney. Whitney and Chad name their baby Miles Davis Harris after jazz musician Miles Davis. During the show's 2005 summertime extravaganza, Whitney has sex with Chad {{in the middle of a}} tsunami and admits to Chad that he is Miles' biological father. Identified as the Vendetta plot, the show's 2006 summertime extravaganza centers on Alistair Crane luring Whitney, Chad, and several other residents of Harmony, to Rome. While in Rome, Chad is given his birth certificate by tabloid editor JT Cornell and discovers that he was conceived during Alistair's rape of Liz. Following the revelation of his true paternity, Chad marries Whitney and they decide to raise their son together, and rename him Miles Harris-Crane.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To analyze small {{intestinal}} {{bacterial overgrowth}} in school-aged {{children and the}} relationship between hydrogen and methane production in breath tests. METHODS: This transversal study included 85 children residing in a slum and 43 <b>children</b> <b>from</b> a private school, all aged between 6 and 10 years, in Osasco, Brazil. For characterization of the groups, data regarding the socioeconomic status and basic housing sanitary conditions were collected. Anthropometric data was obtained in <b>children</b> <b>from</b> both groups. All children completed the hydrogen (H 2) and methane (CH 4) breath test in order to assess small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO was diagnosed when there was an increase in H 2 &#x 2265; 20 ppm or CH 4 &#x 2265; 10 ppm with regard to the fasting value until 60 min after lactulose ingestion. RESULTS: <b>Children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> slum group had worse living conditions and lower nutritional indices than <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> private school. SIBO was found in 30. 9 % (26 / 84) of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> slum group and in 2. 4 % (1 / 41) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> private school group (P = 0. 0007). Greater hydrogen production in the small intestine was observed in <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> slum group when compared to <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> private school (P = 0. 007). A higher concentration of hydrogen in the small intestine (P < 0. 001) and in the colon (P < 0. 001) was observed among <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> slum group with SIBO when compared to <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> slum group without SIBO. Methane production was observed in 63. 1 % (53 / 84) of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> slum group and in 19. 5 % (8 / 41) of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> private school group (P < 0. 0001). Methane production was observed in 38 / 58 (65. 5 %) of the children without SIBO and in 15 / 26 (57. 7 %) of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with SIBO <b>from</b> <b>the</b> slum. Colonic production of hydrogen was lower in methane-producing children (P = 0. 017). CONCLUSION: Children who live in inadequate environmental conditions are at risk of bacterial overgrowth and methane production. Hydrogen is a substrate for methane production in the colon...|$|R

5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar are desperate for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High priest), is {{responsible for the death of}} their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to see that his sister has given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, he calls the palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who predicts that the elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will be smarter. Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be good for the kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the child in a nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII. Maragathavalli, Kailasakaruppan's childless wife, rescues the abandoned <b>child</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> river, and the couple decides to raise him as their own, naming him Ukraputhan.|$|E

25|$|Qutb's {{experiences}} as an Egyptian Muslim – his village childhood, professional career, and activism in the Muslim Brotherhood – left an indelible mark on his theoretical and religious works. Even Qutb's early, secular writing shows {{evidence of his}} later themes. For example, Qutb's autobiography of his childhood Tifl min al-Qarya (A <b>Child</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> Village) makes little mention of Islam or political theory and is typically classified as a secular, literary work. However, it is replete with references to village mysticism, superstition, the Qur'an, and incidences of injustice. Qutb's later work developed along similar themes, dealing with Qur'anic exegesis, social justice, and political Islam.|$|E
