Specifically, the study examined the relationship between dental anxiety (the negative response to the stress elicited from a dental interaction) and self-consciousness (the tendency to evaluate aspects of oneself that are subject to private and public display).

Sixty York University undergraduate students were recruited by convenience sampling to participate. These subjects completed <b>Corah’s</b> Dental Anxiety Scale and the Self-Consciousness Scale. The Self-Consciousness Scale consists of three subscales, including private self-consciousness, public self-consciousness, and social anxiety.

Material and methods. A total of 885 adolescents in 22 randomly pre-selected areas were clinically examined and com-pleted a questionnaire regarding dental anxiety. Dental anxiety was estimated using the <b>Corah's</b> Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS). Past invasive dental treatment experience was de-fined {{as the number of}} extracted and filled teeth. Results.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the pre-emptive use of a cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) {{inhibitor}} with a well established steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for pain and edema relief following periodontal surgery for crown lengthening. Thirty patients requiring periodontal surgery were randomly assigned to receive one of the following medications: selective COX- 2 inhibitor or steroidal antiinflammatory drug, 60 min before the surgical procedure. To examine patient anxiety, a <b>Corah's</b> dental anxiety scale was applied before surgery. Using a visual analog scale, the extent of pain/discomfort during the trans-operative period and immediately after the surgery was measured. Additionally, intensity of pain/discomfort and edema were examined 4, 8, 12 and 24 h postoperatively. With regard to anxiety, no statistical differences between the groups were observed (p> 0. 05). With respect to the extent of pain/discomfort during the trans-operative, immediate and late postoperative period, data demonstrated no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between the COX- 2 inhibitor and steroidal groups. With regard to edema, intragroup analysis did not reveal any statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) during the 24 h following surgery in either group. In conclusion, both anti-inflammatory drugs presented a similar potential for pain and edema relief following periodontal surgery...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{compare the}} pain {{perception}} and anxiety levels of female patients undergoing scaling and root planing during menstrual (perimenstrual) period with those observed during postmenstrual period. Materials and Methods. This {{was a single}} blind study, with a split-mouth design. Forty-four women with chronic periodontitis with regular menstrual cycles were subjected to complete <b>Corah’s</b> Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) during their first debridement visit. Patients were randomly selected to undergo their first debridement visit during either their menstrual or postmenstrual period. Scaling was performed under local anesthesia in bilateral quadrants of patients during the periods. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to score pain levels for each quadrant after performing scaling and root planing. Results. Increase in pain perception among females during their menstrual or perimenstrual period was significantly greater than their postmenstrual period (P < 0. 05). It is observed that women whose first appointment was given in perimenstrual period had more pain (VAS) (P = 0. 0000) when compared to those women whose first appointment was given in postmenstrual period. Conclusion. Females in their menstrual period demonstrated higher pain responses and high anxiety levels to supra- and subgingival debridement. This increase in the pain levels of women during their menstrual period was statistically significant. If the appointments are given in postmenstrual period, women feel less pain...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare trait anxiety and dental anxiety among children, {{adolescents}} and their parents. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 100 patients from the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of the Federal University of Parana (Brazil) between the ages of 8 and 17 years (mean age: 10. 3; standard deviation: 2. 03) and their parents, who responded to <b>Corah′s</b> Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) and the Trait Anxiety Scale. The data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, analysis of variance and both Pearson′s and Spearman′s correlation coefficients. Results: Ninety percent of children and adolescents and 76 % of the parents had moderate anxiety based on the DAS score. Seventy-four percent of children and adolescents and 72 % of the parents had moderate anxiety based on the Trait Anxiety Scale score. The trait anxiety and dental anxiety scores were correlated among the adults (rs = 0. 64) and children (r = 0. 52), whereas no correlation between scores was found among the adolescents. Associations were also found between children′s trait anxiety and the dental and trait anxiety of their parents (both r = 0. 43). Conclusions: A moderate degree of dental anxiety was prevalent among the children, adolescents and parents who took part in this investigation, with correlations demonstrated between some trait anxiety and dental anxiety scores...|$|R
