5|$|At {{that time}} there was dispute {{regarding}} the difference between rational numbers and irrational numbers {{and there was no}} <b>consistency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way in which decimal fractions were represented. In 1586, Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called De Thiende ("the tenth") which historians credit as being the basis of modern notation for decimal fractions. Stevin felt that this innovation was so significant that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution in 1789, most countries and even some cities had their own system of measurement. Although different countries might have used units of measure with the same name, such as the foot, or local language equivalents such as pied, Fuß, and voet, there was no <b>consistency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of those units, nor in the relationships with their multiples and submultiples, much like the modern-day differences between the US and the UK pints and gallons.|$|E

5|$|The number 1,207 appears {{very early}} in the {{historical}} record (472 BC), and the Greeks appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of the <b>consistency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ancient sources, some modern historians are inclined to accept 1,207 as the size of the initial Persian fleet; others reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean. However, very few appear to accept that there were this many ships at Salamis: most favour a number in the range 600-800. This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of Persian ships after Artemisium (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by Herodotus.|$|E
5|$|Top seed Rafael Nadal {{faced an}} uphill battle against Stanislas Wawrinka in the fourth round match, facing a tiebreak in each set and {{eventually}} defeating him. Second seed Roger Federer defeated Dent in the fourth round {{to set up a}} quarterfinal match with longtime rival Andy Roddick, who overcame Gaël Monfils in a two-set match. Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Juan Martín del Potro, Verdasco and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga made it into the quarterfinals. Del Potro defeated Nadal in the three-set quarterfinal match to reach the first ATP Masters semifinal of his career. Del Potro took the final set on a tiebreak after losing the second set. Murray faced Verdasco in the second quarterfinal in a rematch of 2009 Australian Open fourth round. Verdasco suffered an injury in the second game of the match and had to be seen by his physio. He was not in good enough shape to compete with Murray and eventually lost. Federer defeated Roddick while Djokovic moved past Tsonga to advance to the semifinals. Djokovic rallied back to defeat Federer in the first semifinal after losing the first set. The third seed however kept his <b>consistency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next two sets and won them. Murray edged past del Potro in the second semifinal to enter his second straight Masters final. Murray faltered in the second set of the match conceding two service breaks. However he recovered in the final set, gaining an early break of serve, to win the match.|$|E

In this project, I examine both analyses for Modern Irish VSO, pointing out the explanatory adequacy of both theories.

These phenomena are some that generative grammars have used to argue for an underlying SVO, but I favor the TSO analysis because of <b>consistencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon that are particular to tense rather than to verbs...|$|R
