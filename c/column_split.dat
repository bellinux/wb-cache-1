40|$|Biorreatores pneumáticos têm se destacado no campo da biotecnologia devido suas muitas vantagens funcionais, mostrando-se mais promissores do que o modelo convencional tipo tanque agitado e aerado. Parâmetros como retenção gasosa global (&# 61541;G), coeficiente volumétrico de transferência de oxigênio (kLa) e velocidade de cisalhamento média (&# 1059;m) devem ser analisados como critérios de desempenho desses modelos de biorreatores, para o melhor entendimento da hidrodinâmica dos mesmos. Entretanto, não existem estudos na {{literatura}} que comparem biorreatores pneumáticos em termos de condições de cisalhamento. Dessa forma, o objetivo principal deste estudo foi aplicar uma metodologia recente para quantificar e comparar a velocidade de cisalhamento média (&# 1059;m) em três biorreatores pneumáticos: coluna de bolhas, airlift tipo split-cylinder e airlift de cilindros concêntricos. O coeficiente volumétrico de transferência de oxigênio (kLa) foi escolhido como parâmetro característico para determinar. Correlações de em função da velocidade superficial do gás na região de subida (Ugs) e das propriedades reológicas do fluido (índice de consistência, K, e índice de comportamento de escoamento, n) foram obtidas para cada modelo de biorreator pneumático estudado. Além disso, foram obtidas correlações entre &# 61541;G, Ugs e viscosidade (&# 956;) para fluidos Newtonianos e viscosidade aparente (&# 956;ap) para fluidos não-Newtonianos. De forma geral, a retenção gasosa global (&# 61541;G) foi maior em fluidos não-Newtonianos. Os valores &# 1059;m de estimados pela metodologia proposta estão dentro de uma faixa média de valores calculados por correlações clássicas. As correlações propostas foram utilizadas para predizer &# 1059;m durante cultivos de Streptomyces clavuligerus realizadas sob a mesma vazão específica de ar (3, 5 vvm) nos três diferentes tipos de biorreatores pneumáticos. Os menores valores &# 1059;m de, relacionados aos maiores valores de índice de consistência (K), foram encontrados para o biorreator coluna de bolhas, e o maiores valores de &# 1059;m, relacionados aos menores valores de K, foram encontrados para o biorreator airlift de cilindros concêntricos. Valores intermediários foram encontrados para o biorreator airlift tipo split-cylinder. Os resultados mostraram que altos valores de &# 1059;m afetam a saúde estrutural dos micélios, devido à ruptura das hifas vegetativas. Due to {{the large}} number of functional advantages, pneumatic bioreactors have drawn attention in the biotechnology field, being more promising than stirred and aerated tank bioreactors. Parameters such as global gas hold-up (&# 61541;G), volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa) and average shear rate (Ym) must be considered as performance criteria of these types of bioreactors to provide a better understanding of their hydrodynamics. However, there are no works in literature which compare the performance of bioreactors in terms of shear conditions. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to apply a method proposed in recent literature to evaluate the average shear rate (Ym) in three pneumatic bioreactors of 5 -dm 3 working volume: bubble <b>column,</b> <b>split</b> airlift and concentric-tube airlift. The volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa) was chosen as the appropriate characteristic parameter to assess the average shear rate (Ym) in this methodology. Correlations for as a function of superficial gas velocity in the riser region (Ugs) and rheological fluid properties (consistency index, K, and flow index, n) were obtained for each model of pneumatic bioreactor studied. Moreover, correlations between &# 61541;G, Ugs and viscosity (&# 956;) (for Newtonian fluids) and apparent viscosity (&# 956;ap) (for non-Newtonian fluids) were performed. In general, global gas hold-up (&# 61541;G) was higher for non-Newtonian fluids. The Ym values estimated by the proposed methodology lay within the range of values calculated by classical correlations. The proposed correlations were utilized to predict the Ym during three Streptomyces clavuligerus cultivations carried out at the same specific air flow rate (3. 5 vvm) in the different types of pneumatic bioreactors. The lowest values of related to the highest values of Ym consistency index (K) were found for the bubble column bioreactor, and the highest values of related to the lowest values of K were found for the concentric-tube airlift bioreactor. Intermediate values were found for the split airlift bioreactor. The results showed that high Ym values affect the structural health of the mycelia by rupture of the hipha...|$|E

Despite the large diffusion {{of the industrial}} buildings, a high seismic vulnerability was exhibited by these structures, mostly due to the connection systems deficiencies, during some recent earthquakes (Emilia 2012, Turkey 2011).

40|$|Reactive {{distillation}} is {{a hybrid}} process where chemical reaction and distillative separation are {{performed in a}} single equipment. Even though reactive distillation could increase the selectivity of the desired product by the selective reaction {{this is not always}} true as shown in this work. A study on the MTBE reaction system using two coupled reactive distillation columns to separate a C 4 crack mixture is carried out, where methanol acts as reactive entrainer and MTBE is the intermediate product. In the first column, isobutene and methanol react to form MTBE hence separating the inert C 4 component, while in the second <b>column</b> MTBE <b>splits</b> back to methanol and isobutene. Methanol is recycled back to the MTBE formation column and isobutene is obtained as a product. This coupled process with direct recycle of methanol is possible only if no side reactions occur. When the side reactions are taken into account, byproducts such as diisobutene, dimethyl ether and water will be produced so that higher purity methanol can not be obtained {{at the bottom of the}} <b>splitting</b> <b>column.</b> The outlet of the <b>splitting</b> <b>column</b> must be firstly separated rather than being recycled directly to the formation column. Moreover, an attempt has been made to show how the selectivity of the desired product isobutene can be critically influenced by the operating parameters such as the reflux ratio. If the reflux ratio increases, a high quantity of diisobutene and dimethyl ether will be obtained which seriously affects the selectivity of isobutene. The influence of operating parameters is investigated by using a continuation method, which shows that bifurcation behavior can appear in both MTBE formation and decomposition process.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{phenomenon}} of debonding in a thin soft elastic film sandwiched between two rigid plates {{as one of the}} plates is brought into intimate contact and then pulled away from contact proximity by application of a normal force. Nonlinear simulations based on minimization of total energy (composed of stabilizing elastic strain energy and destabilizing adhesive interaction energy) are employed to address the problems of contact hysteresis, cavitation, crack morphology, variation of contact area, snap-off distance, pull-off force, work done, and energy loss. Below a critical distance (d_c) upon approach, simulations show the formation of columnar structures and nonrandom, regularly arranged nanocavities at the soft interface at a length scale of ∼ 3 h (h being the thickness of the film). The persistence of such instability upon withdrawal (distance≫d_c) indicates a contact hysteresis, which is caused by an energy barrier that separates the metastable states of the patterned configuration and the global minimum state of the flat film. The energy and the pull-off force are found to be nonequilibrium and nonunique properties depending on the initial contact, defects, noise, etc. Three broad pathways of debonding leading to adhesive failure of the interface, depending on the stiffness of the film, step size of withdrawal, and the imposed noise, are identified: a catastrophic column collapse mode, a peeling mode involving a continuous decrease in the contact area, and a <b>column</b> <b>splitting</b> mode. The first two modes are caused by a very high stress concentration near the cavity edges.

For instance, the same customer may be referred to in different tables by slightly different but correct names, say “John Smith”, “Smith John ” or “J. Smith”.
