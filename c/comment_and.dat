The strand attracted <b>comment</b> <b>and</b> debate for several of its productions, such as Cathy Come Home, a Tony Garnett production of a Jeremy Sandford script, which dealt with the issue of homelessness. There were also problems caused by Newman bringing in freelance directors to work on the programme, who sometimes overspent on their plays to try and increase their impact; with staff directors this could be compensated by reducing the budget of a subsequent production, but for a freelancer there would be no such recourse.|$|E
5|$|Symbols are visuals used to {{represent}} objects, actions, and concepts {{through the use of}} items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words. For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.Tactile symbols which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with visual impairments and/or significant intellectual impairments. Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, <b>comment,</b> <b>and</b> answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). , a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Comments and {{identifiers}} are {{the main}} source of documentation of source-code and are therefore {{an integral part of the}} development and the maintenance of a program. As English is the world language, most <b>comments</b> <b>and</b> identifiers are written in English. However, if they are in any other language, a developer without knowledge of this language will almost perceive the code to be undocumented or even obfuscated. In absence of industrial data, academia is not aware of the extent of the problem of non-English <b>comments</b> <b>and</b> identifiers in practice. In this paper, we propose an approach for the language identification of source-code <b>comments</b> <b>and</b> identifiers. With the approach, a large-scale study has been conducted of the natural language of source-code <b>comments</b> <b>and</b> identifiers, analyzing multiple open-source and industry systems. The results show that a significant amount of the industry projects contain <b>comments</b> <b>and</b> identifiers in more than one language, whereas none of the analyzed open-source systems has this problem.
