Jackal hairs have very little fur fiber; therefore, their pelts have a flat appearance. The jackals of Asia and the Middle East produce the <b>coarsest</b> pelts, though this can be remedied during the dressing process. Elburz in northern Iran produces the softest furs. Jackal skins are not graded to a fur standard, and are made into collars, women's coats, and fur coats. During the 1880s, 200 jackals were captured annually in Mervsk and in the Zakatal area of the Transcaucasus, with 300 jackals being captured there during 1896. In this same period, a total of 10,000 jackals were taken within Russia and their furs sent exclusively to the Nizhegorod fair. In the early 1930s there were 20,000â€“25,000 jackal skins tanned annually in the Soviet Union, but these could not be utilized within the country, and so the majority were exported to the United States. Commencing from 1949, they were all used within the Soviet Union.|$|E

The collective ionic charge acts to cause the clay plates to repel each other and thus slip and slide against each other. The shell particles, also plate-like, were produced by the Mississippian potter by collecting then burning freshwater mussel shells, which were originally most likely a byproduct of harvesting the meat for food.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coarse</b> {{structures}} are an abstract construction describing {{the behavior of}} a space at a large distance. In this thesis, a variety of existing results on <b>coarse</b> {{structures are}} presented, with the main focus being <b>coarse</b> embeddability into Hilbert spaces. The end goal is to present a hierarchy of three <b>coarse</b> invariants, namely <b>coarse</b> embeddability into a Hilbert space, a property of metric spaces known as Property A, and a finite-valued asymptotic dimension. After outlining the necessary prerequisites and notation, the first main part of the thesis is an introduction to the basics of <b>coarse</b> geometry. <b>Coarse</b> structures are defined, and it is shown how a metric induces a <b>coarse</b> structure. <b>Coarse</b> maps, equivalences and embeddings are defined, and some of their basic properties are presented. Alongside this, comparisons are made to both topology and uniform topology, and results related to metrizability of <b>coarse</b> spaces are outlined. Once the basics of <b>coarse</b> structures have been presented, the focus shifts to <b>coarse</b> embeddability into Hilbert spaces, which has become a point of interest due to its applications to several unsolved conjectures. Two concepts are presented related to <b>coarse</b> embeddability into Hilbert spaces, the first one being Property A. It is shown that Property A implies <b>coarse</b> embeddability into a Hilbert space, and that it is a <b>coarse</b> invariant. The second main concept related to <b>coarse</b> embeddability is asymptotic dimension. Asymptotic dimension is a <b>coarse</b> counterpart to the Lebesgue dimension of topological spaces. Various definitions of asymptotic dimension are given and shown equivalent. The <b>coarse</b> invariance of asymptotic dimension is shown, and the dimensions of several example spaces are derived. Finally, it is shown that a finite asymptotic dimension implies <b>coarse</b> embeddability into a Hilbert space, {{and in the case of}} spaces with bounded geometry it also implies Property A...|$|R
25|$|Volcanic vents {{composed}} of felsic rocks {{are thought to}} have been located at the iron-bearing Sherman Mine, the former Temagami garbage dump and adjacent to the Milne Townsite. Remnants of a large volcanic vent are present west of Sherman Mine, including the existence of two felsic lava flows that outcrop between Link Lake and Turtle Lake. The aspect of the most extensive felsic lava flow indicates that the volcanic vent they erupted from was adjacent to the western portion of Link Lake. Additionally, differentiation of facies and directions in which the lava traveled exist in course grained, resedimented conglomerate. This suggests that a more prominent structure, perhaps evidence of a prehistoric volcano, existed west of Link Lake. Also, <b>coarsest</b> felsic volcanic fragments occur in feldspar-phyric pyroclastic deposits exposed on the Sherman Mine property, suggesting the approximate location of a volcanic vent.|$|E

For the historian John M. Roberts, Hitler's defeat marked the end of a phase of European history dominated by Germany. In its place emerged the Cold War, a global confrontation between the Western Bloc, dominated by the United States and other NATO nations, and the Eastern Bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union. Historian Sebastian Haffner avers that without Hitler and the displacement of the Jews, the modern nation state of Israel would not exist. He contends that without Hitler, the de-colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed. Further, Haffner claims that other than Alexander the Great, Hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure, in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span.|$|E
