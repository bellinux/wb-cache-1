5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E

5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E
5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> noncompliance for the subject {{when compared to the}} normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable {{than it would have been}} were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the AirTrain case appeal was decided in October 2000, two-thirds of the system's viaduct {{structures}} had been constructed already. The system was ready for its first test trains by December 2000. The state spent $75 million to renovate the Howard Beach station, which brought it into ADA <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> facilitated passengers' transfers {{to and from the}} AirTrain. The new Howard Beach station was completed in May 2001. The Port Authority also contributed $100 million toward the renovation of the Jamaica LIRR station, with the State of New York paying {{for the rest of the}} $387 million project. The purpose of this renovation was, in part, to facilitate AirTrain connections. The renovation of the Jamaica station started in May 2001 upon the completion of the Howard Beach station. By this time, the system's guideway rails were complete and the guideways were being constructed. The first two AirTrain cars were delivered in March 2001 and were undergoing testing at the AirTrain maintenance facility near Lefferts Boulevard. The guideways were completed in August 2001. However, a parking structure, proposed near the Jamaica terminal as part of a long-term plan to redevelop downtown Jamaica, was largely unfunded by 2002, the year the AirTrain was originally supposed to open.|$|E
