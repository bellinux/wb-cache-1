50|$|Valeriana californica is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the honeysuckle family known by the <b>common</b> name California <b>valerian.</b> It is native to Oregon, northeastern California, and Nevada, where it occurs in moist, forested mountain habitat. It is an erect herb up to half a meter tall with whorls or opposite pairs of deeply lobed leaves at intervals along stem. The inflorescence is a cyme of many funnel-shaped white or pink-tinged flowers each about half a centimeter long with three long, protruding stamens. The fruit is a ribbed achene about half a centimeter long which may be tipped with the featherlike remains of the flower sepals.|$|R
5000|$|Valeriana sitchensis is {{a species}} of {{valerian}} known by the <b>common</b> name Sitka <b>valerian.</b> It is native to northwestern North America from Alaska and northern Canada to Montana to northern California, where it grows in many types of habitat, including moist mountain forests. In moist subalpine meadows, it is often {{one of the most}} common plants. This is a rhizomatous perennial herb producing a stout, erect stem to about 70 centimeters in maximum height, but known to exceed one meter at times. The leaves vary in size and shape, often having deep lobes or being composed of several leaflets. The inflorescence is a cyme of many white or pink-tinged flowers, each under a centimeter wide. The flower has five corolla lobes and three whiskery stamens protruding from the center.|$|R
40|$|Valerian {{extracts}} {{have been}} used for centuries to alleviate restlessness and anxiety albeit with unknown mechanism of action in vivo. We now describe a specific binding site on GABA(A) receptors with nM affinity for valerenic acid and valerenol, <b>common</b> constituents of <b>valerian.</b> Both agents enhanced the response to GABA at multiple types of recombinant GABA(A) receptors. A point mutation in the beta 2 or beta 3 subunit (N 265 M) of recombinant receptors strongly reduced the drug response. In vivo, valerenic acid and valerenol exerted anxiolytic activity with high potencies in the elevated plus maze and the light/dark choice test in wild type mice. In beta 3 (N 265 M) point-mutated mice the anxiolytic activity of valerenic acid was absent. Thus, neurons expressing beta 3 containing GABA(A) receptors are a major cellular substrate for the anxiolytic action of valerian extracts...|$|R
50|$|There {{is a good}} {{range of}} flowers established. These include sanicle, common dog-violet, ramsons and ferns such as hart's tongue. The more open areas support plants such as <b>common</b> <b>valerian,</b> great willowherb, {{meadowsweet}} and Pendulous sedge. The river edges and wetter places support marsh-marigold, water mint, purple-loosestrife and yellow iris. water-crowfoot {{is seen in the}} river.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} geology {{ensures that}} most of the site is well drained, favouring lime-loving plants - the calcicoles. There are, however, localised areas with poorer drainage and in which some lime-hating plants can be found - the calcifuges - such as bracken Pteridium aquilinum, as well as plants associated with water-logged conditions such as <b>common</b> <b>valerian</b> Valeriana officinalis and wild angelica Angelica sylvestris.|$|E
50|$|The {{main feature}} of the marsh is club-rush which forms dense stands {{together}} with bulrush, great willowherb and common reed. The alder and birch wood on the drier areas has a good ground flora which is dominated by grasses, Remote-sedge and horsetails. The species reported include common spotted-orchid, marsh pennywort, <b>common</b> <b>valerian,</b> skullcap and creeping jenny. Wood horsetail is abundant in a damp area.|$|E
50|$|Valeriana occidentalis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the honeysuckle family known by the <b>common</b> name western <b>valerian.</b> It is native to the western United States, particularly the northwestern quadrant, but it occurs {{as far south as}} Arizona and as far east as Colorado and South Dakota. It occurs in moist, forested mountain habitat. It is an erect herb growing 30 to 75 centimeters tall with whorls or opposite pairs of leaves at intervals along stem. The leaves are generally divided into lobes or are compound, with each leaf made up of a few oval-shaped leaflets. The inflorescence is a dense cyme of many funnel-shaped white flowers each 3 or 4 millimeters long with three long, protruding stamens. The fruit is a ribbed achene about half a centimeter long which may be tipped with the featherlike remains of the flower sepals.|$|R
50|$|The {{trees along}} the canal include pedunculate oak, ash, crack willow and field maple. The area is colonised with common reed, reed sweet-grass and the more open areas support marsh-marigold, yellow water-lily, water dock and gipsywort. Meadowsweet and great willowherb flourish. There is also <b>common</b> <b>valerian,</b> purple-loosestrife, common marsh-bedstraw, yellow iris, ragged robin and marsh woundwort. Woodland flowers such as primrose, bluebell, yellow {{archangel}} and bugle thrive in a small wood near the tunnel entrance and under the towpath hedgerows. This wetland area supports a variety of fungi, liverworts and mosses.|$|E
50|$|The Achanalt {{reservoir}} and marshes {{were designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest on 18 May 1989 {{as the area}} is an important nesting ground. It is 214.6 ha. in size. The marshes are characterised by mesotrophic grassland on a river valley flood plain. There are two waterlogged Carex Juncus communities that include bottle sedge, marsh pennywort, and bogbean. In a relatively drier area, short grass and sedge occur, mainly in winter. The marshes are sedge dominated, and these include common sedge, carnation sedge, flea sedge, and star sedge. Tawny sedge and dioecious sedge occur in flush line areas. The featured herbs include heath spotted orchid and <b>common</b> <b>valerian.</b> Purple moor grass and tufted hair grass are locally extensive. Four nationally rare species of breeding birds are located here.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} involving {{the cultivation of}} <b>common</b> <b>valerian</b> was conducted on loess soil in Abramów (Lublin region) in the period 2007 - 2009. Qualitative parameters of herbal raw material obtained from this plant as well as in-crop weed infestation were evaluated depending on the protection method and forecrop. Hand-weeded plots, in which a hand hoe was used, were the control. In the other treatments, weeds were controlled using various herbicides and a mechanical implement (brush weeder). Potato and winter wheat + field pea cover crop were the forecrops for <b>common</b> <b>valerian</b> crops. A hypothesis was made {{that the use of}} a brush weeder and herbicides not registered for application in valerian crops would {{have a positive effect on}} this plant's productivity and weed infestation in its crops. It was also assumed that the introduction of a cover crop would allow the elimination of differences in the forecrop value of the crop stands in question. The best quantitative and qualitative parameters of <b>common</b> <b>valerian</b> raw material as well as the largest reduction of incrop weed infestation were recorded after the application of the herbicides which were not type approved. The use of the brush weeder in the interrows also had a beneficial effect on productivity of the plant in question, but secondary weed infestation at the end of the growing season of <b>common</b> <b>valerian</b> turned out to be its disadvantage. Traditional crop protection methods used in <b>common</b> <b>valerian</b> crops were less effective in weed infestation reduction and they resulted in lower plant productivity and raw material quality. Potato proved to be a better forecrop for <b>common</b> <b>valerian</b> than winter wheat + field pea; however, this positive effect was not confirmed statistically. The following annual weeds: Chenopodium album, Galinsoga parviflora, Stellaria media, were predominant in the <b>common</b> <b>valerian</b> crop. Traditional weed control methods resulted in the dominance of some dicotyledonous weeds, such as Viola arvensis, Galium aparine, Capsella bursa-pastoris...|$|E

40|$|Kirk Fen is a 0. 73 -hectare remnant prairie fen {{located at}} the University of Michigan Matthaei Botanical Gardens {{property}} in Ann Arbor, Michigan in Washtenaw County. It {{is known to have}} high floristic quality and two floral species threatened and imperiled in Michigan: the small white lady slipper (Cypripedium candidum) and <b>common</b> <b>valerian</b> (Valeriana ciliata). The eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus), a reptile of special concern, is a resident there as well. However, Kirk Fen occupies only twelve percent of its historical boundaries and is becoming a low diversity shrub-carr habitat dominated by invasive woody species, particularly glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula). Intervention is necessary to prevent further deterioration (Ruhfel 2005). Functioning prairie fens serve a critical role in our watersheds and are globally and locally rare. They are unique ecosystems throughout their range in the upper Midwestern North America and are threatened both from agriculture and urban development. This practicum is focused on two basic questions relating to fen restoration. What is the response of vegetation to the removal of invasive species? How should “success” be measured in fen restoration efforts? Clearing of woody invasive species in Kirk Fen was done in the years 2006 to 2009. Floral response was captured in 2008 and 2009 with comprehensive floral inventories, a pilot plant species dominance survey, and a pilot Cypripedium candidum survey. An inventory and species cover survey using five line-intercept transects was conducted in 2009. Photo points were established and iii base-line photo-point documentation was conducted from 2008 to 2009. Reports were made based on the inventories, surveys, and line-intercept transects. Using the Floristic Quality Assessment for Michigan flora (Herman et al. 2001) to compare the inventories of 2008 and 2009 to those reported in 2005, {{it was found that the}} original remnants had slightly less Mean C and lower species diversity. However, Mean Wetness (Mean W) increased, fewer native and adventive woody species were present, and greater native forbs and graminoid species were found. Low-, mid-, and high-C distribution remained relatively the same. Some important species did not recover during the two years of the inventories. Using the FQA and pilot surveys, the greater restored Kirk Fen site has shown dramatic recovery after clearing of woody invasive species. While common fen species numbers recovered during the study, the numbers of rare species historically found in the fen declined. These results raise questions about the impact of management activities on rare vs. common species in fen restoration projects. The study concludes with recommendations for future fire management, continued invasive species removal, deer exclusion, mitigation and improvements to the Kirk Brook catchment outside the fen, and creation of limited public access and educational activities related to the restoration of the fen...|$|E
