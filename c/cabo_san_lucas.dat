5|$|Following {{the sudden}} {{shift in the}} {{projected}} track, {{a state of emergency}} was declared on September14 in La Paz, Los Cabos, Comondú, Loreto and Mulegé. In <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas,</b> 2,100marine workers were set up to start evacuations. In La Paz, classes were suspended. Throughout the peninsula, 164shelters were opened capable of harboring 30,000people, but only 3,500persons used these shelters. At the time of landfall, hotels in the state were at 46%of capacity, equal to 30,000tourists, 26,000of whom were foreigners. The ports of La Paz, Los Cabos, San José del Cabo, and Loreto were closed. Around 800marine officers were placed on standby. Police with megaphones walked through vulnerable areas in <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas</b> urging people to evacuate.|$|E

50|$|Montgomery {{imposed a}} {{blockade}} at Mazatlan on February 17 despite British objections. Montgomery then sailed for Baja California Sur, seized <b>San</b> Jose del <b>Cabo</b> and <b>San</b> <b>Lucas,</b> but without sufficient forces {{did not set}} up garrisons there. On April 14, Montgomery accepted Colonel Miranda's surrender of La Paz. The articles of capitulation granted the Bajacalifornios who accepted the capitulation the rights of United States citizens and retained their own officials and laws.|$|R
50|$|A former {{settlement}} is Bahía Thetis, on the namesake bay five kilometers west of <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> Diego. There is a lighthouse at <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> Diego (<b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> Diego Light), established in 1934, {{and another one}} at <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> Pio (<b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> Pio Light, established in 1919. Both are still in operation.|$|R
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, the {{governor}} of Baja California Sur, Narciso Agundez, ordered emergency personnel to Comondú, Lorteo, and Mulege. Approximately 700 families fled to shelters in Cabo San Lucas; elsewhere, an additional 200 families evacuated in San Jose del Cabo. Some residents in Miraflores and Santiago also left their homes. Agundez asked soldiers to assist the islands of Magdalena and Margarita in preparing for the storm. Five communities in Mexico, including <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas,</b> {{declared a state of}} emergency. Authorities throughout the region opened numerous shelters, and in some locations, police officers went door-to-door asking residents to leave. The port in <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas</b> was closed due to the storm's threat, although the airport remained open.|$|E
5|$|In Acapulco, {{which had}} already {{suffered}} severe damage due to a harsh rainy season, residents piled sandbags in preparation for more precipitation. Ten shipping ports were closed. Over 240 people were evacuated {{in the state of}} Jalisco, 140 of which from the village of La Huerta. In addition, up to 850 people sought refuge in shelters across the state. Some 350 people from the municipality of Coahuayana and 150 people from the city of Coalcomán de Vázquez Pallares – both in Michoacán state – were moved to safety. Merchants taped their store windows to protect them from strong winds while residents stocked up on water. In <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas</b> on the southern tip of Baja California, authorities began evacuating low-lying areas as residents and tourists flooded supermarkets. Gas stations were filled with lines up to 0.5mi (0.8km) long. All traffic was closed to the ports of <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas</b> and San José del Cabo. The Red Cross opened shelters at several local schools. Municipal authorities issued a red alert. Army and Navy representatives met to discuss rescue operations. About 1,000 people sought refuge in shelters across <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas</b> and nearby San Jose del Cabo as the storm arrived. Most airline flights were canceled, frustrating tourists.|$|E
5|$|The first {{tropical}} storm {{of the season}} formed 75mi (120km) south-southwest of Puerto Vallarta on June 11. Tropical Storm One headed out to sea without intensifying further than 50mph (80km/h). Heading west-northwestward, the storm dissipated on July 12, centered roughly halfway between Socorro Island and <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas.</b>|$|E

Sambataro, a Newton, Massachusetts native, was CEO of Youkilis's charity, Hits for Kids, until the couple split up in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Initially, some {{forecasts}} {{predicted the}} storm would strike the Baja California Peninsula as {{a tropical storm}}; a tropical storm watch was briefly issued from Sante Fe to <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas</b> accordingly. Over 100 shelters were opened in the municipalities of Los Cabos, La Paz and Comondú, respectively. In all, Ivo contributed to heavy rainfall across Baja California Sur; however, damage was not reported.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 14, 1998. It traveled westward, and on August 19 spawned the tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Bonnie. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 25. The wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large low-level circulation over southern Mexico. A broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with the wave and the low-level circulation, and after persisting for several days developed a smaller low-level circulation on August 29 about 575miles (925km) south-southeast of <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas.</b> On August 31, the two primary areas of convection were well-removed from the center. By early on September 1, despite a lack of convective organization, the low-cloud circulation was sufficiently well-defined that the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E, or the tenth tropical depression of the season, about 350miles (565km) south of <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas.</b> In real time, the National Hurricane Center first upgraded the system 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{development}} {{took place}} as convection consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation while located west of Sonora. During the afternoon of September20, an {{area of low pressure}} developed within the system, prompting the NHC to classify it as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 240mi (390km) south-southeast of <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas.</b> Situated along the western edge of a subtropical ridge, the system was steered towards the north-northwest throughout its existence.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Carlotta was {{the most}} {{powerful}} hurricane of the 2000 Pacific hurricane season. The third tropical cyclone of the season, Carlotta developed from a tropical wave on June 18 about 270miles (470km) southeast {{off the coast of}} Mexico. With favorable conditions for development, it strengthened steadily at first, followed by a period of rapid deepening to peak winds of 155mph (250km/h) on June 22. Cooler waters caused Carlotta to gradually weaken, and on June 25 it degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure while located about 260miles (420km) west-southwest of <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ileana never {{significantly}} impacted land, and no {{tropical cyclone}} warnings or watches for the storm. While near peak intensity, it passed 60mi (100km) {{south of the}} unpopulated Socorro Island; a station on the island recorded sustained winds of 59mph (95km/h), with gusts to 77mph (125km/h). The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along the Mexican coastline, causing flooding in Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, and Baja California Sur. High surf from Ileana reached the coast, killing one man near <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas</b> despite warnings not to swim in the ocean.|$|E

5|$|A band of {{convection}} formed {{northeast of}} Greg early on September7, inducing moderate to strong northeasterly wind shear on the cyclone. Combined with land interaction, the storm weakened to tropical storm intensity by 18:00UTC that day, and Greg made landfall near <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas</b> three hours later, with winds of 60mph (95km/h). After turning west-northwest and then west, the cyclone moved over progressively cooler waters {{and continued to}} lose strength, although a small area of deep convection persisted. Greg weakened to a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September8 before succumbing to the unfavorable environment and dissipating a day later west of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June23. It reached the eastern Pacific on July3, where associated convection began to increase three days later. Continued slow development occurred thereafter, and following satellite trends, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Four-E at 1800UTC on July9. Tracking westward, the depression {{began to move}} across waters too cool to support a tropical cyclone and into an environment of moderate shear. The low-level circulation became ill-defined and exposed, leading to degeneration to a remnant low at 0600UTC on July11 about 910mi (1465km) west-southwest of <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas,</b> Mexico. The low continued northwest until dissipation at 0000UTC the following day.|$|E
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized on July 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level circulation developed. It continued to organize, and subsequent {{to the development of}} a low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of <b>Cabo</b> <b>San</b> <b>Lucas</b> on July 29. Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level circulation twelve hours after the depression formed.|$|E
