Topics explored include the relationship between the low cost, limited value-added Internet services and the traditional higher cost, significantly value-added commercial database providers, the effects of the impending publication of many US applications, and the opportunities opening up as good-quality machine-generated translations are becoming more easily available. Other topics discussed include the implications of the anticipated implementation of the Community Patent Convention, the <b>community</b> <b>utility</b> <b>model,</b> WIPO's activities, the potential dangers of official patent office data being provided only on the Internet, and the problems of the multiple formats for data on the Internet and on CD-ROMs. The author emphasises these are personal views from his extensive experience in a major patent library.

40|$|This study frames {{integration}} of Solar Energy Conversion Systems (SECS) with the built environment, addressing on-site limitations for resource allocation {{in the urban}} context. The Sun, buildings, and solar technologies are investigated as resource systems within Ostrom’s framework of the commons and shared governance, with associated goods (as resource units) appropriated from light conversion (products of daylight, heat, power, shade, money). Light is transient and unevenly distributed across the {{hours of the day}} across the year. Building surfaces utilized to convert light into useful products such as electricity are often “area-constrained” and cannot provide total power to all occupants in urban structures. Being unevenly distributed over time and being area-constrained makes the appropriated goods from the solar resource system scarce to commercial buildings and multi-family residences. Scarce commodities require management strategies to distribute the variable returns derived from technologies such as PV and solar hot water. The balance between sustainable urban communities and limited surface area to deliver solar products to all occupants will soon drive communities to consider how the solar goods are managed and allocated. Examples demonstrate management of solar resource and associated goods through collective actions of local <b>communities</b> via <b>utility</b> sponsored <b>models,</b> solar gardens, and crowd-sourced investment...|$|R

A <b>utility</b> <b>model</b> certificate expires after seven years of application without the possibility of a renewal. An application for patent can be converted to one for a <b>utility</b> <b>model</b> certificate and vice versa if prior to the grant or refusal of the application the prescribed fee for the latter is paid.|$|R

This paper formulates six classes of QALY <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> and axiomatizes these <b>models</b> under expected <b>utility</b> (EU) and rank-dependent utility (RDU) assumptions. The QALY models investigated {{in this paper}} include the standard linear QALY model, the power and exponential multiplicative models, and the general multiplicative model. Emphasis is placed on a preference assumption, the zero condition, that greatly simplifies the axiomatizations under EU and RDU assumptions. The RDU axiomatizations of QALY models are generally similar to their EU counterparts, but in some cases, they require modification because linearity in probability is no longer assumed, and rank dependence introduces asymmetries between the domains of better-than-death health states and worsethan-death health states. 1999 Academic Press This paper concerns the foundations of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) <b>utility</b> <b>models.</b> QALY <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> are widely used in the expected utility analysis of health decisions because they provide an outcome measure that integrates the duration and quality {{of survival}}.

40|$|Random <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> have {{traditionally}} been applied to probabilistic choice data, with little attention to reaction times. We describe the class of “horse race ” random <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> {{that can be applied}} to both choice probabilities and reaction times. We show that any (well behaved) set of choice probabilities and reaction times on a fixed set can be represented by an independent “horse race ” random <b>utility</b> <b>model,</b> and relate this result to work in the theory of competing risks. We use the latter theory to motivate the condition that the option chosen and the time of choice be independent, a condition that is satisfied by a large class of (extreme value) “horse race ” random <b>utility</b> <b>models.</b> Combining the latter condition with the assump-tion of an independent “horse race ” random <b>utility</b> <b>model</b> yields a new characterization of Lute’s choice model, and a generalization of these conditions to subset choices (as opposed to choosing a single “best ” element) yields the transition probabilities of Tversky’s elimina-tion-by-aspects model. 0 1992 Academic Press, Inc. 1...|$|R

The primary effort {{of this research is}} to create a linear programming-based <b>utility</b> <b>model</b> that could assist a program manager in making purchase decisions. The final solution, given all available data regarding cost, schedule impacts, unique program constraints, and quality factors will be the optimal allocation of budgetary resources to achieve the best overall value for the end user and taxpayer. Data for this research were obtained from the Apache Block III Modernization Program after which a <b>utility</b> <b>model</b> was created to assess the utility of linear programming in the DoD acquisition decision-making process. The model compared 16 unique potential upgrades from the Apache Block III Modernization Program against each other and determined an optimal solution given the unique conditions of the program. <b>Utility</b> <b>modeling</b> proved to be an effective tool to help program managers make better purchase decisions. <b>Utility</b> <b>modeling,</b> coupled with sensitivity analysis, weighted <b>utility</b> <b>modeling,</b> and decision support analysis, has the ability to optimize resource allocation decisions thus maximizing overall value and reducing waste.
