40|$|With {{the final}} aim of {{reducing}} the energy consumption and increase the methane production at Swedish pulp and paper mills, the methane potential of 62 wastewater effluents from 10 processes at seven pulp and/or paper mills (A-G) was determined in anaerobic batch digestion assays. This mapping {{is a first step}} towards an energy efficient and more sustainable utilization of the effluents by anaerobic digestion, and will be followed up by tests in lab-scale and pilot-scale reactors. Five of the mills produce kraft pulp (KP), one thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP), two chemical thermo-mechanical pulp (CTMP) and two neutral sulfite semi-chemical (NSSC) pulp. Both elementary and total chlorine free (ECF and TCF, respectively) bleaching processes were included. The effluents included material from wood rooms, cooking and oxygen delignification, bleaching (often both acid- and alkali effluents), drying and paper/board machinery as well as total effluents before and after sedimentation. The results from the screening showed a large variation in methane yields (percent of theoretical methane potential assuming 940 NmL CH 4 per g TOC) among the effluents. For the KP-mills, methane yields above 50 % were obtained for the <b>cooking</b> <b>effluents</b> from mills D and F, paper machine wastewater from mill D, condensate streams from mills B, E and F and the composite pre-sedimentation effluent from mill D. The acidic ECF-effluents were shown to be the most toxic to the AD-flora and also seemed to {{have a negative effect on}} the yields of composite effluents downstream while three of the alkaline ECF-bleaching effluents gave positive methane yields. ECF bleaching streams gave higher methane yields when hardwood was processed. All TCF-bleaching effluents at the KP mills gave similar degradation patterns with final yields of 10 - 15 % of the theoretical methane potential for four of the five effluents. The composite effluents from the two NSSC-processes gave methane yields of 60 % of the theoretical potential. The TMP mill (A) gave the best average yield with all six effluents ranging 40 - 65 % of the theoretical potential. The three samples from the CTMP process at mill B showed potentials around 40 % while three of the six effluents at mill G (CTMP) yielded 45 - 50 %...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation of an indoor thermal environment in a Chinese commercial kitchen {{has been carried}} out using indoor zero-equation turbulence model. Two different ventilation systems in a Chinese commercial kitchen have been simulated. The results calculated for two different models show the airflow, temperature distribution and human thermal comfort index-PMV and PPD value. The simulation results indicate that both methods are capable of enhancing the capture and containment performance of <b>cooking</b> <b>effluent</b> effectively. Under the first condition, not only is unnecessary cooling load reduced and energy consumption of the air conditioning system economized, but a perceived thermal comfort environment can be provided. However, the supply air velocity and air temperature of the spot diffuser are restricted. In contrast, the perceived level of thermal comfort is not improved under the second circumstance. Further, the energy consumption of this case is higher than the former. Finally, the indoor thermal environmental properties have been analyzed...|$|R
