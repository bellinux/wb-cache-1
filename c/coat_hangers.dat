Most campfires, though, are exclusively for recreation, {{often as a}} venue for conversation, storytelling, or song.

25|$|Many dowsers today use a pair {{of simple}} L-shaped metal rods. One rod is held in each hand, with the short arm of the L held upright, and the long arm {{pointing}} forward. When something is found, the rods cross over one another making an X over the found object. If the object is long and straight, such as a water pipe, the rods may point in opposite directions, showing its orientation. The rods are sometimes fashioned from wire <b>coat</b> <b>hangers,</b> and glass or plastic rods have also been accepted. Straight rods are also sometimes used for the same purposes, and were not uncommon in early 19th-century New England.|$|E

2500|$|The pimp {{business}} has an internal structure – built around violence – {{for dealing with}} rule breakers. For example, pimps {{have been known to}} employ a [...] "pimp stick", which is two <b>coat</b> <b>hangers</b> wrapped together, in order to subdue unruly prostitutes. A variation is a [...] "pimp cane", used for similar purposes. Another punishment for disobedient prostitutes is to [...] "trunk" [...] them, where the pimp locks the prostitute in the trunk of a car. Although prostitutes are supposedly free to move between pimps, this movement sometimes leads to violence. For example, a prostitute could be punished for merely looking at another pimp; this is considered [...] "reckless eyeballing". Violence is also used on customers, for example if the customer attempts to evade payment or becomes unruly with a prostitute.|$|E
2500|$|Yes premiered most of Time and a Word {{during their}} two solo concerts at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 21 and 22 March 1970. For the second half, they played {{songs from the}} album with a twenty-piece {{orchestra}} led by Tony Cox. Anderson later considered the shows a failure, {{due to a lack}} of rehearsal time and a poor sound system. To record the orchestra, microphones were left dangling above the players using <b>coat</b> <b>hangers.</b> Banks thought the experiment was a [...] "daft idea". Nevertheless, Chris Welch wrote a positive review in Melody Maker noting that despite the amplification problems, the [...] "musical break-through" [...] reaction from the audience suggested to him that the group had [...] "arrived". The shows were the last in which Yes performed with an orchestra, until the 2001 Symphonic Tour to support their nineteenth studio album Magnification, which also featured orchestral arrangements.|$|E
2500|$|At nine, Wilson {{undertook}} {{his first}} expeditions at the Rock Creek Park in Washington, DC. He began to collect insects and he gained {{a passion for}} butterflies. He would capture them using nets made with brooms, <b>coat</b> <b>hangers,</b> and cheesecloth bags. Going on these expeditions led to Wilson's fascination with ants. He describes in his autobiography how one day he pulled the bark of a rotting tree away and discovered citronella ants underneath. The worker ants he found were [...] "short, fat, brilliant yellow, and emitted a strong lemony odor". Wilson said the event left a [...] "vivid and lasting impression on [...] ". He also earned the Eagle Scout award and served as Nature Director of his Boy Scout summer camp. At the age of 18, intent on becoming an entomologist, he began by collecting flies, but the shortage of insect pins caused by World War II caused him to switch to ants, which could be stored in vials. With the encouragement of Marion R. Smith, a myrmecologist from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, Wilson began a survey of all the ants of Alabama. This study led him to report the first colony of fire ants in the US, near the port of Mobile.|$|E

She shows Thredson the pregnancy document and convinces him to confess. He relates the three killings to her and a hidden Kit plays back the recorded confession. Lana tells Thredson she has aborted the fetus with a <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> and Kit hides the tape in the hydrotherapy room.

2500|$|Restoration {{work began}} in April 2013 as a station rewire which quickly {{grew into a}} {{heritage}} inspired project. The view taken was to restore the station to a 1949 state with British rail branding and reminisces of the GER and LNER railways. As to use one era would prove too costly and the budget was only for a rewire. The paint scheme was chosen by the Fen line users and was based upon a GER steam unit which had blue red and gold, gardenia is a heritage colour used and was also chosen. GER cast iron benches were made locally by East Coast Castings in Wotton and BR style totems were hand-made alongside LNER station clocks and <b>coat</b> <b>hangers.</b> Ticket machine were relocated to more sensible positions and re-branded to match the aesthetics intent. Platforms were resurfaced and LED lighting installed [...] throughout public areas along with new CCTV. Station posters and advertising boards were replaced with colour matched ones and located neatly in line. Station posters were also produced in a BR style header format to make {{the look and feel}} more memorable. A Norfolk county flagpole was installed to replace the old one and canopies and roof restored and or replaced. All in it cost under £1.1million. The project was jointly funded by First Capital Connect and Network Rail. The project's completion was marked with Michael Portillo unveiling a plaque in the booking hall area on 22 July 2014.|$|E
