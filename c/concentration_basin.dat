40|$|The Mediterranean and the Red Sea are two <b>concentration</b> <b>basins</b> {{with very}} similar {{hydrological}} characteristics. The {{water of the}} adjoining ocean, entering over a sill, holds {{the water and the}} nutrient budgets of the basins in balance. Changes in this inflowing oceanic water are analogous in the two basins: reduction in nutrient content, due to mixing with the nutrient-poor water of the basin, biological activity and the existence of successive sills (in the Mediterranean). The Mediterranean receives from the Atlantic Ocean the main part of its nutrient supply (of the order of 70 %, the rest being provided by the rivers). This supply is practically constant over the year. The inflowing water from the Indian Ocean provides the entire nutrient supply of the Red Sea.

40|$|An {{iterative}} calculation method is proposed to estimate total phosphorus in runoff from six landuses in six drainage basins {{based upon the}} acreage of those landuses, their respective runoff coefficients, and measured values from samples collected as part of various water quality monitoring programs. A computer routine was created to identify from among the multitude of possible combinations, the set of landuse-specific runoff concentrations that most suitably corresponded with monitoring data.

40|$|Extensive {{changes have}} been {{reported}} from the Arctic Mediterranean. The ice cover is retreating, {{the temperature in the}} Atlantic layer has been increasing, the salinity in the upper layers shows large variations and deep waters in the Greenland Sea have become warmer and more saline. These changes all appear externally forced; by the radiation balance, by the atmosphere, and by ocean advection. The question arises—are there processes inherent to the Arctic Ocean, which can constrain changes induced by external forcing? Three features are examined; the storage and export of liquid freshwater in the upper layers, the heat loss of the Atlantic water encountering sea ice and the possibility to define a salinity separating the two roles of the Arctic Mediterranean, as estuary and as <b>concentration</b> <b>basin.</b> If the freshwater outflow in the upper layer is rotationally controlled, the liquid freshwater storage and export only depend upon the freshwater input. The melting rate of sea ice is affected both by the heat transport and by the temperature of the inflowing Atlantic water.

40|$|The Mediterranean Sea is an {{enclosed}} basin {{composed of two}} similar basins and different sub-basins. It is a <b>concentration</b> <b>basin,</b> where evaporation exceeds precipitation. In the surface layer there is an inflow of Atlantic water which is modified along its path to the Eastern basin. This transformation occurs through surface heat loss and evaporation specifically in the Levantine basin. The Mediterranean is furthermore the site of water mass formation processes, which can be studied experimentally because of their easy accessibility. There are two main reasons why the Mediterranean is important. The first one {{is the impact of}} the Mediterranean on the global thermohaline circulation, the second reason is that the Mediterranean basin can be considered as Laborartory for investigating processes occurring on the global scale of the world ocean. In this paper we want to provide a short historical review of the evolving knowledge of the Mediterranean circulation that has emerged from experimental investigations over the last decades. We start by describing the old picture of the basin circulation which had stationary, smooth large scale patterns. Then we show the major experiments that led to the discovery of the sub-basin scale circulation and its mesoscale features. We conclude with the dynamical discovery of EMT in the 1990 s and the most exciting ongoing new research programmes...|$|E
40|$|The planktonic foraminiferal {{record of}} core MD 99 - 2346 (Gulf of Lion) shows a {{decrease}} of sea surface temperature (SST) {{at the time of}} Heinrich event H 2 (24 – 23. 5  cal kyr BP), Younger Dryas and during the early to middle Holocene. These events were associated with {{a decrease of}} surface water salinity. The salinity lowering events were similar and synchronous to those recorded in the North Atlantic Ocean during H 1, H 2 and the Younger Dryas. They can be explained by a decrease in the salinity of the Atlantic surface water entering the Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar. This result indicates that the Mediterranean Sea remained a <b>concentration</b> <b>basin</b> and that its freshwater budget was not significantly different from the modern conditions at the time of these low salinity events. Higher abundances of the benthic foraminifer Cibicidoides pachydermus at the time of Heinrich events (H 2 and H 1) may result from a seasonal, and more pulsed supply of labile organic matter. A high abundance of intermediate and deep infaunal taxa (Globobulimina spp.) during the warm Bölling/Alleröd period is interpreted {{as a result of an}} increased lateral advection of organic matter to the deeper environments of the Gulf of Lion. Surface water productivity, as reflected by the organic flux to the benthic ecosystem, reaches a maximum during the cold Younger Dryas period. It is possible that cold conditions at the time of the Younger Dryas have allowed an enhanced vertical mixing and deep-water cascading in the Gulf of Lion. This may have resulted in an increase of primary and export production. This putative intensification of deep-water cascading would have occurred after the sustained rise of the global sea-level from 16 to 12. 5  cal kyr BP. The deglacial sea-level rise may also have played an important role in favouring the downslope movement of dense shelf water enriched in organic matter originating from the early Rhône delta complex.

40|$|Reconstructions with {{comprehensive}} {{estimates of}} confidence intervals are presented {{of changes in}} the W–E stable oxygen isotope gradient in Mediterranean surface waters between the Holocene Climate Optimum and the Present, and between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Present. Rigorous statistical assessment is made of the significances of the mean geographic trends observed in these reconstructions. Firstly, it is concluded that any reconstruction should strictly be based on values obtained by analyses of one single foraminiferal species throughout the basin, as different species are found to respond with isotopic variations of different amplitudes to climatic/hydrographic change. This difference is tentatively related to differences between the habitats and seasons of growth of the various species. Secondly, a significant increase of roughly a factor 3 is found in the Mediterranean W–E oxygen isotope gradient during the Last Glacial Maximum, relative to the Present. This difference is almost entirely due to increased glacial values in the Levantine Sea, which are considered to be a result of a combination of increased evaporation rates and/or somewhat cooler than anticipated surface water conditions. Thirdly, an eastward increase of roughly half the present-day magnitude is found for the W–E oxygen isotope gradient during the Holocene Climate Optimum. Values in the Levantine Sea appear to have undergone up to 0. 3 ‰ more depletion than those elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean. However, no significant trends are found between the eastern and western parts of the Levantine Sea, nor between values near the Nile delta and those from elsewhere in the Levantine Sea. The Holocene Climate Optimum's eastward increase in the Mediterranean oxygen isotope gradient, although weaker than the Present, suggests that the Mediterranean continued to function as a <b>concentration</b> <b>basin,</b> albeit in a less vigorous way than today. Finally, simple mixing arguments are used to argue that inferred oxygen isotope ratios of surface waters may not be used as an indication of conservative property (e. g. salinity) distribution on geological timescales, but instead show amplitudes of response to climatic/hydrographic changes that likely are > 2 times larger than the corresponding amplitudes of response for truly conservative properties...|$|E

Previous research has established that sediment <b>concentrations</b> from forest <b>basins</b> lacking well-defined channel networks averages 5. 3 to 6. 2 kg of sediment per hectare per centimeter of runoff (kg/ha-cm) in this physiographic region. Our results indicate that sediment concentrations are much greater in forested basins which have channel networks.

Sediment concentrations in the HSNF basins do not correlate with either stormflow peak discharge or water yield, nor do basin morphometric attributes appear to explain the observed variation in concentrations. The presence of continuous ground cover and cohesive bank materials, and the lack of observed surface erosion in the HSNF catchments all suggest that the source of this sediment is in-channel storage. Moreover, these results indicate that relatively high sediment concentrations can be produced by stable forested basins which have not been disturbed by timber harvesting...|$|R

The basins are modeled {{with the assumption that}} the outflow in the river comes from two sources prompt (within-year) runoff from precipitation, and flow from the long-term reservoirs of the <b>basin.</b> Tritium <b>concentration</b> in the outflow water of the basin is dependent on three factors: (1) tritium concentration in runoff from the long-term reservoir, which depends on the residence time for the reservoir and historical tritium concentrations in precipitation; (2) tritium concentrations in precipitation (the within-year runoff component); (3) relative contributions of flow from the long-term and within-year components. Predicted tritium concentrations for the outflow water in the river basins were calculated for different residence times and for different relative contributions from the two reservoirs. A box model was used to calculate tritium concentrations in the long-term reservoir. Calculated values of outflow tritium <b>concentrations</b> for the <b>basin</b> were regressed against the measured data to obtain a slope {{as close as possible to}} 1. These regressions assumed an intercept of zero and were carried out for different values of residence time and reservoir contribution to maximize the fit of modeled versus actual data for all the above rivers. The final slopes of the fitted regression lines ranged from 0. 95 to 1. 01 (correlation coefficient 3 ̆e 0. 96) for the basins studied. Values for the residence time of waters within the basins and average relative contributions of the within-year and long-term reservoirs to outflow were obtained. Values for river basin residence times ranged from 2 years for the Kissimmee River basin to 20 years for the Potomac River basin. The residence times indicate the time scale in which the basin responds to anthropogenic inputs. The modeled tritium <b>concentrations</b> for the <b>basins</b> also furnish input data for urban and agricultural settings where these river waters are used...|$|R
40|$|A {{case study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate the potential {{of a combination of}} flow cytometry, cell sorting and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for mesoscale monitoring of dominant bacterioplankton groups. In June 1999, the spatial distribution of phylogenetically characterised bacterioplankton groups in an area of 150 x 350 km in the northern North Sea was studied in conjunction with blooms of phytoplankton including coccolithophores. The bacterial cells were enumerated using flow cytometry and 3 groups were defined on the basis of cellular light scatter, nucleic acid and protein content. The phylogenetic composition of cells sorted from those 3 groups was analysed using FISH with a restricted set of rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes. Cells with high nucleic acid and high protein content were mainly affiliated to the alpha- proteobacterial genus Roseobacter. Members of the Cytophaga- Flavobacterium cluster consistently accounted for the majority of cells in the high nucleic acid and low protein group; and members of the gamma-proteobacterial SAR 86 cluster were always present in significant amounts among the cells with low nucleic acid and low protein content. The composition of bacteria within the groups was remarkably conservative in 13 randomly selected samples, while the concentration of the groups varied considerably on the 10 to 100 km scale. The bacterial groups formed patches of high abundance; these were spatially separated and could remain traceable for 2 to 3 d. The distribution of bacterioplankton groups did not correlate with distribution of either chlorophyll a (chl a), or phytoplankton groups (small coccolithophores and picoeukaryotic algae) or physical parameters such as temperature and salinity. It seems unlikely therefore that currently used remotely sensed parameters may be used as proxies of bacterioplankton group <b>concentration</b> at <b>basin</b> scales. However, this case study proves that a shipboard survey conducted over 4 to 6 d is effective for identifying and monitoring patches of certain bacterioplankton groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of water source environment becomes serious problems accompanying with rapid urbanization in China. Ecological engineering provides ecologically sound and cost-effective solution to solving this problem. As a case study, a 15 hm(2) ecological water storage basin for a water plant {{was designed and}} constructed on the TEDA area in Tianjin City. Located on saline, the. construction of this project has to face serious difficulties, such as high salinity, scarce seed banks of macrophytes, and strong winds. Freshwater replacement, soil amendation and macrophytes planting at the basinshore, wooden water breaker and plastic membrane installation and other measures were conducted for the assistance of plant community establishment. The result showed that the chloride <b>concentration</b> in the <b>basin</b> water decreased from 11600 mg/L to less than 100 mg/L, and the chloride content in the basin sediment decreased from 2. 1 % to 0. 35 % after freshwater soaking. The introduced macrophytes of 8 species all survived and I I other macrophytes species were occurred in the basin. A new ecosystem was created with increased biological diversity in the original saline, and the water quality was improved. This ecological water storage basin also provided a pleasing landscape for local people...|$|R
