He opened it, and began to read. She didn't know what to say; words were so inadequate. His wife dying like that, and so suddenly--it was too terrible.

5000|$|To {{the post}} office, there were {{positive}} advantages to postal cards {{as opposed to}} <b>correspondence</b> in <b>envelopes.</b> The cards were lighter and less bulky than letters {{and they were all}} the same size. The result was that they occupied less than one third of the space required by the same number of letters. To the public there were also advantages. They were simple and cheap making them an instant success. Britain had a half-penny rate to begin with. The U.S. [...] "penny postcard" [...] rate lasted through 1951.|$|R

30|$|A few {{measuring}} {{systems have}} been presented. The most straightforward methodology is greatest connection (MC) (Xilinx Inc. 5) plan. In this plan, {{the beginning of an}} edge is distinguished when C(n) ranges to most extreme. Since the deliberate vitality is not standardized inside of the synchronization window and differs in a wide range, it is difficult to choose a limit as the most extreme quality. So this system is not suitable for multipath fading <b>correspondence</b> and non-consistent <b>envelope</b> tweak (Kabulepa et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|The Eric Lind {{collection}} documents {{his involvement}} with numismatics and philately and his interests in the Holocaust {{and the fate of}} the Jews during World War II. Materials collected here cover topics such as Anti-Semitism, Holocaust, Nazis and Neo-Nazis, forgeries during WW II, stamps and currency, and the era of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The collection consists of printed materials, artifacts, paper money and coins, stamps, post cards, <b>envelopes,</b> <b>correspondence,</b> documents, and photographs. Eric Lind was born in 1920 in Augsburg, Bavaria. In 1936 he left on youth Aliyah for Palestine. He immigrated to the United States in 1948, where he worked as an insurance inspector. He died in 1983 in Detroit, Michigan. digitize...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of techniques used to maximize response rates was {{the purpose of}} this study. Variables included perceived threat of questionnaire, questionnaire length, cover letter approach, follow-up <b>correspondence,</b> stamped/unstamped return <b>envelope,</b> and anonymity. The sample comprised 4, 608 college faculty. Three analyses of response rates were performed at different points in time. There {{were no significant differences in}} response rate for the three levels of questionnaire threat, two lengths (in pages) of questionnaire, two forms of return envelope, or two levels of anonymity. Questionnaires with fewer items were returned more often after the initial mailing. Typed cover letters with a perscnal appeal elicited higher response rates. Follow-up letters with another questionnaire enclosed increased response rates. On the basis of the data, use of a follow-up letter with another questionnaire enclosed, a typed cover letter with a personal appeal, and inclusion cf an unstamped return envelope is recommended.

40|$|A theory {{involving}} a <b>correspondence</b> between <b>envelope</b> solitonlike solutions of the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation (GNLSE) and solitonlike solutions of the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation (GKVdE) is developed {{within the context}} of the Madelung's fluid description (fluid counterpart description of the GNLSE). This correspondence, which, under suitable constraints, can be made invertible, seems to be very helpful for finding one family of solutions (whether envelope solitonlike solutions of the GNLSE or solitonlike solutions of the GKdVE) starting from the knowledge of the other family of solution (whether solitonlike solutions of the GKdVE or envelope solitonlike solutions of the GNLSE). The theory is successfully applied to wide classes of both modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation (MNLSE) and modified Korteweg-de Vries equation (MKVdE), for which bright and gray/dark solitonlike solutions are found. In particular, bright and gray/dark solitary waves are determined for the MNLSE with a quartic nonlinear potential in the modulus of the wavefunction (i. e. q 1 |Ψ|^ 2 + q 2 |Ψ|^ 4) as well as for the associated MKdVE. Furthermore, the well known bright and gray/dark envelope solitons of the cubic NLSE and the corresponding solitons of the associated standard KdVE are easily recovered from the present theory. Remarkably, this approach opens up the possibility to transfer all the know how concerning the instability criteria for solitonlike solutions of the MKdVE to the instability theory of envelope solitonlike solutions of the MNLSE...|$|R
40|$|Inventory in the Unisa Archives, Manuscripts Collection (Mss Acc 140) 1 BoxJohn Wickens’ Scrapbook of Walter Battiss {{materials}} (c 1912, 1947 - 1994) (1 Box, 0. 1 linear metres) The John Wickens’ Scrapbook of Walter Battiss materials was {{donated to}} the Unisa Library Archives by John’s sister, Mrs. Pat Franklin of Cape Town, in 2001. John Wickens, a friend of Battiss and a librarian by profession, died circa 2000. Wickens had lovingly kept a Scrapbook on the life and artistic career of his friend Walter Battiss (1906 - 1982). Walter Battiss started his teaching career at the Pretoria Boys’ High School in 1936. He married Grace Anderson, a well-known art-educationalist, in 1940 and moved to Giotto’s Hill, Menlo Park, Pretoria, where he stayed until his death. Battiss was appointed as the first professor and Head of the Department of History of Art and Fine Arts at Unisa in November 1964. He retired in 1971 {{and in the same}} year, Walter Battiss was awarded an Honorary DLitt et Phil degree in recognition of his contribution to the development of art and art appreciation in South Africa. Prof Walter Battiss was an enthusiastic traveler who loved visiting islands, Europe, USA, UK, Africa and the Middle East. Battiss held many solo exhibitions in South Africa and abroad. An excellent correspondent, Battiss wrote many letters to his friends in South Africa, including to John Wickens. Walter Battiss {{died at the age of}} 76 at his holiday home in Port Shepstone. The numerical order of the items in the inventory reflects the original order within the Scrapbook. The contents of the Scrapbook (c 1912, 1947 - 1994), consist of illustrated <b>correspondence</b> and <b>envelopes,</b> art catalogues, poetry, invitations to art exhibitions, stamps, Fook Nooks, press cuttings, photographs of Battiss, sketches and a 1982 poster AprilFooks Day. The archival materials are of great research value to scholars interested in Battiss’ oeuvre, as well as in the development, history and teaching of twentieth-century South African art...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{model the}} {{amplitude}} envelope of the broadband speech signal as a kinematic system and calculate its basic parameters, including displacement, velocity and acceleration. Such system captures the smoothed amplitude fluctuation pattern over time, illustrating how energy is distributed across the signal. Although the pulmonic air pressure {{is the primary}} energy source of speech, the amplitude modulation pattern is largely determined by articulatory behaviours, especially mandible and lip movements. Therefore, {{there should be a}} <b>correspondence</b> between signal <b>envelope</b> kinematics and articulator kinematics. Previous research showed that a tremendous amount of speaker idiosyncrasies in articulation existed. Such idiosyncrasies should therefore be reflected in the envelope kinematics as well. From the signal envelope kinematics, {{it may be possible to}} infer individual articulatory behaviours. This is particularly useful for forensic phoneticians who usually have no access to articulatory data, and clinical speech pathologists who usually find it difficult to make articulatory measurement in clinical consultations. Also in this paper, we illustrate a correspondence between the amplitude envelope kinematics and the lower lip kinematics (X-ray pellet history data) of one speaker reading one sentence. For future research, more speakers are needed to record both speech and articulatory signals to build a statistical model between the kinematics data of both domains...|$|R
