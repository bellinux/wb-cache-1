5|$|Morgan {{returned}} to England in 1926, and assumed {{command of the}} 22nd Heavy Battery. Equipped {{with a mixture of}} 9.2 inch guns, 6 inch guns, 12 pounders and 6 pounders, it was responsible for the coastal defences of Weymouth, Dorset. Still a captain, Morgan hoped that his next <b>career</b> <b>move</b> would be to attend the Staff College, Camberley, having narrowly passed the entrance examination. Instead, he was offered a place at the Staff College, Quetta, requiring a return trip to India. Morgan's classmates at Quetta in 1927 and 1928 included William Slim, John Crocker, Kenneth Anderson, David Cowan, George Alan Vasey and Tommy Burns. After graduation, Morgan was posted to the 70th Field Battery at Lucknow, and then was artillery staff officer at headquarters Western Command, under Brigadier Henry Karslake. When Karslake became major-general, Royal Artillery, at GHQ India in 1931, he brought Morgan to Delhi to serve with him as General Staff Officer (Grade 2). Morgan was finally promoted major in 1932 and brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1934.|$|E

25|$|Lange {{was born}} in Weißwasser, Prussian Silesia, a town in present-day Saxony. His father was a railway {{construction}} supervisor. Lange finished high school in Staßfurt in 1928 and studied law in the University of Jena. He received a doctorate in law in 1933, and was recruited by the Gestapo office of Halle. He joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) in November 1933, but soon felt that {{this had been a}} bad <b>career</b> <b>move.</b> Thus, in 1936 Lange joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) (member number 290,308).|$|E
25|$|Between October and December 1972, Nilsen {{lived with}} his family as he {{considered}} his next <b>career</b> <b>move.</b> On {{more than one occasion}} in the three months Nilsen lived in Strichen, his mother voiced her opinion as to her being more concerned with Nilsen's lack of female companionship than the career path he should next opt to take, and of her desire to see him marry and start a family. On one occasion, Nilsen joined his older brother, Olav, his sister-in-law, and another couple to watch a documentary devoted to male homosexuality. All present viewed the topic with derision, except Dennis, who ardently spoke in defence of gay rights. A fight ensued, after which Olav informed his mother that Dennis was homosexual.|$|E
25|$|After being {{released}} by Norwich he joined Gillingham, {{there was much}} speculation regarding his next <b>career</b> <b>move.</b> He received a number of offers but eventually signed a two-year contract with Gillingham {{where he would be}} player/coach. It did not prove a good move for Roberts and he had a number of disagreements with the club, particularly after Stan Ternent had succeeded Andy Hessenthaler as manager. In December 2004 Roberts had himself served as joint caretaker manager, along with Darren Hare and Paul Smith, after the sudden departure of both Hessenthaler and initial caretaker John Gorman. In March 2005 he joined Cambridge United on loan {{until the end of the}} season, scoring his 200th league goal on his debut. Cambridge were relegated from League Two. In August 2005, Roberts retired from playing after reaching an agreement with Gillingham to pay the final year of his contract.|$|E

25|$|Byrd {{obtained}} the prestigious post of Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1572 {{following the death}} of Robert Parsons, a gifted composer who drowned in the Trent near Newark on 25 January of that year. Almost from the outset Byrd is named as 'organist', which however was not a designated post but an occupation for any Chapel Royal member capable of filling it. This <b>career</b> <b>move</b> vastly increased Byrd's opportunities to widen his scope as a composer and also to make contacts at Court. Queen Elizabeth (1558–1603) was a moderate Protestant who eschewed the more extreme forms of Puritanism and retained a fondness for elaborate ritual, besides being a music lover and keyboard player herself. Byrd's output of Anglican church music (defined in the strictest sense as sacred music designed for performance in church) is surprisingly small, but it stretches the limits of elaboration then regarded as acceptable by some reforming Protestants who regarded highly wrought music as a distraction from the Word of God.|$|E
25|$|Leavis {{had won a}} {{scholarship}} from the Perse School to Emmanuel College, Cambridge to read History, and on his return {{from the war in}} 1919 he changed his field of study to English and became a pupil in the newly founded English School at Cambridge. Despite graduating with first-class honours, Leavis was not seen as a strong candidate for a research fellowship and instead embarked on a PhD, then an unusual <b>career</b> <b>move</b> for an aspiring academic. In 1924, Leavis presented a thesis on 'The Relationship of Journalism to Literature', which 'studied the rise and earlier development of the press in England'. This work contributed to his lifelong concern with {{the way in which the}} ethos of a periodical can both reflect and mould the cultural aspirations of a wider public. In 1927, Leavis was appointed as a probationary lecturer for the university, and, when his first substantial publications began to appear a few years later, their style was very much influenced by the demands of teaching.|$|E
25|$|Defying {{audience}} expectations, as {{he often}} did, Peckinpah immediately followed The Wild Bunch with the elegiac, funny and mostly non-violent 1970 Western The Ballad of Cable Hogue. Utilizing {{many of the same}} cast (L. Q. Jones, Strother Martin) and crew members of The Wild Bunch, the film covered three years in the life of small-time entrepreneur Cable Hogue (Jason Robards) who decides to make his living by remaining in the desert after having miraculously discovered water when he had been abandoned there to die. He opens his business along a stagecoach line, only to see his dreams end with the appearance of the first automobile on the horizon. Shot on location in the Valley of Fire in Nevada, the film was plagued by poor weather, Peckinpah's renewed drinking and his brusque firing of 36 crew members. The chaotic filming wrapped 19 days over schedule and $3 million over budget, effectively terminating his tenure with Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. In retrospect, it was a damaging <b>career</b> <b>move</b> as Deliverance and Jeremiah Johnson, critical and enduring box office hits, were in development at the time and Peckinpah was considered the first choice to direct both films. Largely ignored upon its initial release, The Ballad of Cable Hogue has been rediscovered in recent years and is often held up by critics as exemplary of the breadth of Peckinpah's talents. They claim that the film proves Peckinpah's ability to make unconventional and original work without resorting to explicit violence. Over the years, Peckinpah cited the film as one of his favorites.|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on the band's hiatus in a 2011 interview, Kinney {{told that}} Staley wasn't {{the only one}} battling addiction. [...] "He was the focal point, like singers are.

And the reason we pulled back – you know when you stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest <b>career</b> <b>move</b> – but we did that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E
500|$|Partially {{due to her}} {{experiences}} filming Mermaids, Cher turned down leading roles in such films as The War of the Roses and Thelma & Louise. According to Berman, [...] "After the success of Moonstruck, she was so worried about her next <b>career</b> <b>move</b> that she was overly cautious." [...] In the early 1990s, she contracted the Epstein–Barr virus and developed chronic fatigue syndrome, which left her too exhausted to sustain her music and film careers. Because she needed to earn money and was not healthy enough to work on other projects, she starred in infomercials launching health, beauty, and diet products, which earned her close to $10million in fees. The skits were parodied on Saturday Night Live and critics considered them a sellout, many suggesting her film career was over. She told Ladies' Home Journal, [...] "Suddenly I became the Infomercial Queen and it didn't occur to me that people would focus on that and strip me of all my other things." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{they had}} no {{permanent}} drummer, McCartney looked for someone to fill the position, which was difficult, as Lennon later said that drummers were [...] "few and far between", because a set of drums was an expensive item. Harrison had seen Best playing with the Black Jacks in The Casbah Coffee Club (which was run by his mother, Mona Best). He {{was regarded as a}} steady drummer, playing the bass drum on all four beats in the bar, which pushed the rhythm, and was known in Liverpool at the time as being [...] "mean, moody, and magnificent" [...] by female fans, which convinced McCartney he {{would be good for the}} group. After the Black Jacks broke up, McCartney asked Best to go to Hamburg, telling him they would earn £15 per week each. Best had the chance to go to a teacher-training college, as he had passed his school exams, unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of theirs, but decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better <b>career</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E
500|$|Having no {{permanent}} drummer, Paul McCartney looked {{for someone to}} fill the Hamburg position. Best had been seen playing in the Casbah with his own group, the Black Jacks, and {{it was noted that}} he was a steady drummer, playing the bass drum on all four beats in the bar, which pushed the rhythm. In Liverpool, his female fans knew him as being [...] "mean, moody, and magnificent", which convinced McCartney he {{would be good for the}} group. After the Black Jacks broke up, McCartney convinced Best to go to Hamburg with the group, by saying they would each earn £15 per week (equivalent to £ in [...] ). As Best had passed his school exams (unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of theirs), he had the chance to attend teacher-training college, but he decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better <b>career</b> <b>move.</b> Best had an audition in the Jacaranda club, which Williams owned, and travelled to Hamburg the next day. Williams later said that the audition with Best was unnecessary, as the group had not found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg, but did not tell Best in case he asked for more money.|$|E
500|$|Vikram did {{not sign}} up to a film for sixty {{five days after the}} release of Sethu, to ensure that he made the right <b>career</b> <b>move.</b> Vikram spent time {{completing}} projects he had agreed to feature in before the release of Sethu and hence made a couple of appearances in the Malayalam films, Red Indians and the horror film Indriyam. He also played a leading role in Siragugal, a rare Tamil telefilm produced and featuring Radhika Sarathkumar, which was shot entirely in the suburbs of London. Furthermore, he also completed two Telugu films during the period; 9 Nelalu and Youth. 9 Nelalu featured Vikram as the husband of the character played by Soundarya, who faces the challenges of being a surrogate mother. The film won positive reviews, with a critic mentioning that Vikram gave a [...] "controlled performance; while Vikram's newfound popularity in Tamil films saw the film dubbed into Tamil soon after as Kandane Seethayai, with an inserted comedy track by comedian Vivek. His next release was Rajakumaran's Vinnukum Mannukum, alongside Sarath Kumar, Kushboo and Devayani, which revolved around an ordinary boy falling in love with an actress. Vikram has since mentioned his displeasure at being a part of the film, claiming that he had arguments with the director for every single shot and that [...] "everything in that film, right from the first shot was wrong"; the film became a failure commercially. His next film was Dhill where he played an aspiring police officer, Kanagavel, who tackles a corrupt policeman. To appear trim {{in the role of the}} aspiring police officer, Vikram went on a strict diet eating only fruits and drinking juice. The film opened to positive reviews with a critic from The Hindu claiming that [...] "Vikram has the ability and potential" [...] and that [...] "Vikram has once again proved that his success in Sethu was not a fluke". Dhill subsequently went on to become Vikram's first success in the masala film genre and led the way for more such films in the same genre for him. Vikram's portrayal of a blind folk singer in Vinayan's Kasi won him the Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award and the film also did well commercially. For the movie, he sunbathed on the terrace of his beachside home in Chennai for a sunburnt look and got dizzying headaches while practising to look blind. Again, Vikram's performance won positive reviews from critics with a reviewer describing it as an [...] "extraordinarily detailed performance" [...] and that [...] "as the blind singer, he brings laughter, tears and a lump in one's throat".|$|E

500|$|All Hope Is Gone was {{generally}} well received by critics. Several music critics anticipated the album {{immediately after the}} release of Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). In its review of Vol. 3, Allmusic stated, [...] "There's a sense that whatever Slipknot do next might be their ultimate broadcast to the faithful." [...] Copies of All Hope Is Gone intended for reviewers were pressed under the false name [...] "Rusty Cage" [...] {{to reduce the risk of}} the album leaking onto the Internet. Stephen Erlewine wrote in his review for Allmusic that the early [...] "cluster of cacophony" [...] of [...] "Gematria" [...] is [...] "so effective [...] that when things do get a little softer a little later on, the album threatens to collapse like a soufflé" [...] and opined that [...] "one more power ballad like Snuff would be enough to derail the album.". He gave the album a rating of four out of five stars. Regarding the album's creation process, Darren Sadler of Rock Sound wrote, [...] "Slipknot raised their collective middle fingers, and created an album that stands out head and shoulders above everything else that will be released this year." [...] He compared the album's sound to those of other bands such as Stone Sour, Morbid Angel, and Meshuggah, and he gave the album a score of 9 out of 10. Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth.net gave All Hope Is Gone 7.5 out of 10 stars. Ogle stated that the fans' views of the [...] "diversity" [...] of the album would be Slipknot's [...] "saving grace, or their misfortune", concluding, [...] "While it may not be as jaw-dropping or revolutionary as some might have hoped, it's by no means a bad release." [...] Reviewing for Blender, writer Darren Ratner observed a different theme in the lyrics when compared to previous Slipknot albums, noting that the band is able to [...] "make ugliness sound just a little bit pretty". Marc Weingarten of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ rating, calling All Hope Is Gone [...] "a metal assault-and-battery on the hypocrisies of the modern world". Jim Kaz of IGN stated that the band's attempt to move from nu-metal to [...] "more classic metal elements" [...] was [...] "the best <b>career</b> <b>move</b> they could've made". Kaz gave All Hope Is Gone a score of 8.1 out of 10, writing, [...] " [...] effectively [...] upon the band's collective strengths." [...] Q noted that the band no longer resembled [...] "a threat to Western civilisation" [...] but claimed that the album delivered one shock; [...] "how listenable they've become", including [...] "Snuff" [...] in the top 50 downloads for August 2008.|$|E
