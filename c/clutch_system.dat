5|$|Michael Schumacher lapped {{consistently}} in the 1:26 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap 22, a 1:26.428, to extend his lead over Häkkinen to 5.4 seconds, who in turn was 9.9 seconds in front of Zonta. Verstappen in fourth was a further 2.9 seconds behind, but was drawing ahead of Ralf Schumacher in fifth. On lap 23, Zonta became the first front runner to make a scheduled pit stop and emerged in eleventh position. Salo continued {{to move up the}} field when he passed Wurz for sixth on lap 25. Three laps later, Zonta moved into ninth position after he overtook Mazzacane and Diniz. Salo made a pit stop for the second time on lap 29 and emerged in tenth place. Verstappen took his pit stop three laps later and came out in seventh position. Zonta made his third and final pit stop of the race on lap 36 and dropped to eighth position. Michael Schumacher took his pit stop on lap 39 and rejoined 13.6 seconds behind Häkkinen, who now led the race. Three laps later, Häkkinen made a pit stop and rejoined behind Michael Schumacher with a deficit on eleven seconds. Fisichella was the final driver to make a scheduled stop on lap 44. Fisichella's pit stop was problematic: he stalled when he encountered a problem with his <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> and his mechanics push-started his Benetton and he rejoined in eleventh.|$|E
25|$|The {{friction}} clutch or post and <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> uses a clutch that moves along a post. Disengaging the clutch frees {{it from the}} post, allowing the pedal to move without restraint.|$|E
25|$|The ratchet <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> uses {{a ratchet}} and pawl to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first {{disengage}} the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch. Because the ratchet engages in only a fixed set of positions, the timpanist must fine-tune the drum {{by means of a}} fine-tuning handle.|$|E

It included fully independent power take off, which was powered by a two <b>clutch</b> <b>system.</b> It also included power adjust rear wheels, which became an industry standard.Production of this model continued into 1953, with nearly 150,000 tractors produced.|$|E
25|$|The program {{started with}} a {{disabled}} employee who couldn't drive a sports car because of his physical issue. He developed a new <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> {{that would allow him}} to drive, but needed to test it virtually beforehand, as road testing of such a vital modification would be very dangerous. He was granted free access to CATIA to design his idea, which allowed him to eventually drive a sports car.|$|E
25|$|Normally the {{steering}} shaft {{is connected to}} the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the main drive shaft. The steering shaft is split into two output shafts through a <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at all. An idler reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|E

25|$|Most school {{bands and}} orchestras below a {{university}} level use less expensive, more durable timpani with copper, fiberglass, or aluminum bowls. The mechanical parts of these instruments are almost completely {{contained within the}} frame and bowl. They may use any of the pedal mechanisms, though the balanced action system {{is by far the}} most common, followed by the friction <b>clutch</b> <b>system.</b> Many professionals also use these drums for outdoor performances due to their durability and lighter weight. The pedal is in the center of the drum itself.|$|E
25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse steering shaft and <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|E
500|$|The {{cars were}} {{modified}} BT46s—chassis numbers BT46/4 and BT46/6. Modifications {{to implement the}} fan concept were quite extensive—involving sealing the engine bay as well as adding the <b>clutch</b> <b>system</b> and the fan. They were designed and tested in some secrecy. Brabham's lead driver, Niki Lauda, realised he had to adjust his driving style, mostly for cornering. He found that if he accelerated around corners, the car would [...] "stick" [...] to the road {{as if it were}} on rails. This had the side effect of exposing the driver to very high lateral acceleration, which would become a major problem in the ground effect era. In his autobiography, Lauda described the car as being unpleasant to drive due to the lateral loads and reliance on aerodynamics over driver skill. He realised early on that the rate of ground effect development meant that in the future, every driver would be exposed to such g-loading while behind the wheel of such a car, and the physical effort needed to drive the cars would leave the drivers exhausted {{by the end of the}} races.|$|E

25|$|The main disadvantage, {{like the}} <b>clutch</b> braking <b>system,</b> is that {{steering}} dissipates heat through the brakes. Unlike the <b>clutched</b> <b>system,</b> however, {{in this case}} all turning requires braking. This {{can be used on}} lighter tanks, but the amount of kinetic energy in larger tanks makes the required brakes impractically large. Another disadvantage is that the differential will allow the tracks to turn at different speeds no matter what the cause may be. This may be the application of braking, but also occurs as the tank travels over terrain; if one side of the tank enters softer terrain and slows down, the tank will naturally turn towards that side. Forward momentum tends to offset this effect, so it is mainly a problem at low speeds.|$|R

2500|$|BMC {{experimented with}} a {{twin-engine}} Mini Moke (dubbed the [...] "Twini Moke") in the mid-1960s, but never {{put it into}} production. This made advantage of the Mini's 'power pack' layout, with a transverse engine and the gearbox in the engine sump. Simply by fitting a second engine/gearbox unit across the rear, a rudimentary 4×4 system could be produced. Early prototypes had separate gear levers and <b>clutch</b> <b>systems</b> for each engine. Later versions sent for evaluation by the British Army had more user-friendly linked systems.|$|R
