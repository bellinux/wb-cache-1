40|$|One {{principal}} {{goal of the}} Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC) is {{to ensure}} that archived materials are readily available to researchers. Even fragile materials must be in a stable and functional condition for researchers to effectively utilize them without causing damage. This issue raises concerns about how best to preserve the integrity of rare books, manuscripts, prints, drawings, maps, and photographs while still ensuring adequate research access. This session describes the chief techniques necessary for proper preservation and conservation of paper documents. The primary objective of conservation treatment is to stabilize an item, prevent further damage and deterioration, and improve the condition of the item for future use by researchers. Through the use of modern conservation techniques, it is possible to repair items to a stable restored condition. A sample of treatments performed include constructing new cases or bindings, reattaching loose or broken boards, sewing pamphlets and textblocks, mending tears, cleaning dirty documents, reattaching loose pages, repairing cracked bindings, removing old or damaging repairs, creating Mylar encapsulations, and constructing acid free <b>custom</b> <b>enclosures.</b> Fundamentally, the goal of repairing items in MASC is to stabilize them as well as allow access for future researchers. Through the continuous application of preservation and conservation treatments to the MASC collections, the archives will continue to maintain the historical originality of items while ensuring their accessibility.

40|$|A {{programmable}} optical stimulator for Drosophila eyes is presented. The target {{application of}} the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A <b>custom</b> <b>enclosure</b> was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization {{results show that the}} fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7. 2  mW/cm 2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3. 54  mW/cm 2. The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28. 17  °C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8  h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8  h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{practical}} {{theoretical framework}} is presented for designing and classifying minimally strained nucleic acid nanotubes. The structures {{are based on}} the double crossover motif where each double helical domain is connected to each of its neighbors via two or more Holliday junction-like reciprocal exchanges, such that each domain is parallel to the main tube axis. Modeling is based on a 5 -parameter characterization of the segmented double-helical structure. Once the constraint equations have been derived, the primary design problem for a minimally strained N-domain structure is reduced to solving 3 simultaneous equations in 2 N+ 2 variables. Symmetry analysis and tube merging then allow for the design {{of a wide variety of}} tubes, which can be tailored to satisfy requirements such as specific inner-and-outer radii, or multiple lobed structures. The general form of the equations allows similar techniques to be applied to various nucleic acid helices: B-DNA, A-DNA, RNA, DNA-PNA, or others. Possible applications for such tubes include nano-scale scaffolding as well as <b>custom</b> shaped <b>enclosures</b> for other nanoobjects...|$|R
40|$|The Digital Beamforming Synthetic Aperture Radar (DBSAR) is an eight-channel {{phased array}} radar system that employs {{solid-state}} radar transceivers, a microstrip patch antenna, and a reconfigurable waveform generator and processor unit. The original DBSAR transceiver design utilizes connectorized electronic components {{that tend to}} be physically large and heavy. To achieve increased functionality in a smaller volume, PCB (printed circuit board) transceivers were designed to replace the large connectorized transceivers. One {{of the most challenging}} problems designing the transceivers in a PCB format was achieving proper performance in the calibration path. For a radar loop-back calibration path, a portion of the transmit signal is coupled out of the antenna feed and fed back into the receiver. This is achieved using passive components for stability and repeatability. Some signal also leaks through the receive path. As these two signal paths are correlated via an unpredictable phase, the leakage through the receive path during transmit must be 30 dB below the calibration path. For DBSAR s design, this requirement called for a 100 -dB isolation in the receiver path during transmit. A total of 16 solid-state L-band transceivers on a PCB format were designed. The transceivers include frequency conversion stages, T/R switching, and a calibration path capable of measuring the transmit power-receiver gain product during transmit for pulse-by-pulse calibration or matched filtering. In particular, this calibration path achieves 100 -dB isolation between the transmitted signal and the low-noise amplifier {{through the use of a}} switching network and a section of physical walls achieving attenuation of radiated leakage. The transceivers were designed in microstrip PCBs with lumped elements and individually packaged components for compactness. Each transceiver was designed on a single PCB with a <b>custom</b> <b>enclosure</b> providing interior walls and compartments to isolate transceiver subsystems from radiated interference. The enclosure also acts as a heat sink for the voltage regulators and power amplifiers inside the system. The PCB transceiver design produces transmit pulses of 2 W with an arbitrary duty cycle. Each transceiver is fed by an external 120 -MHz signal transmit and two 1, 140 -MHz local oscillator signals. The received signal is amplified and down-converted to 120 MHz and is fed to the data processor. The transceiver dimensions are approximately 3. 5 11. 5 0. 6 in. (9 29 1. 5 cm). The PCB transceiver design reduces the volume and weight of the DBSAR instrument while maintaining the functionality found in the original design. Both volume and weight are critical for airborne and flight remote sensing instrumentation...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of HistoryJames E. SherowDuring {{the period}} between 1848 and 1938, a {{combination}} of land-use changes and regional climatic alterations caused changes in the physical structure of the Canadian River. The Canadian River begins in the southern Rocky Mountains and flows south and then northeast across the High Plains of New Mexico and Texas. The Comanche Indians used the river as a transportation corridor, as a winter shelter for themselves and for their horse herds, as well as hunting the bison that visited the valley. The Comanches also valued the spiritual power, puha, found in the running water and on the mesas within the river’s lowlands. After {{the defeat of the}} Comanches in the Red River Wars and the destruction of the bison herds, New Mexican Hispanos moved their flocks of sheep into the valley and established settlements along the tributary streams. These settlers practiced “extensive” land use, drawing from a broad array of the valley’s resources and using them comparatively lightly in ways that drew from older Spanish laws and <b>customs.</b> The <b>enclosure</b> of parts of the valley by Anglo-Texan ranchers drove the Hispanos out of the Canadian watershed in Texas, although access to the open range in New Mexico allowed other Hispanos to retain their settlements. Corporations including the Capitol Lands Syndicate and Prairie Cattle Company introduced large numbers of cattle to the region {{at the same time that}} regional rainfall patterns shifted. This combination of heavy grazing and altered precipitation patterns led to erosion in the uplands that caused changes in the physical structure of the Canadian River. After 1903, the arrival of railroads into eastern New Mexico accelerated the development of dry-land farms in both states. Increasing calls for damming and controlling the Canadian led to the first interstate Canadian River Compact in 1928. The advent of a severe drought in the 1930 s and the Great Depression led to federal resources becoming available and the first dam was built on the stream, ending the era of the free-flowing river and again starting physical changes to the Canadian...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{mechanisms of}} information processing and storage, and network plasticity for in-vitro LNNs are studied by monitoring extracellular electrochemical neuronal activity via a Multi-Electrode Array (MEA). MEAs monitor action potentials, and enable observing morphological activities of in-vitro dissociated LNNs {{at the network}} level. Cortical neurons (extracted from 18 -day old rat embryos) are dissociated and plated onto a grid of 59 electrodes {{on the center of}} an MEA culture dish. Once plated, the neurons reform synaptic connections with one another to become a single functional network, displaying highly correlated activity among constituent neurons. MEAs can be used as two-way interface between the outside world and LNNs. In-vitro LNNs serve as excellent models for long-term experiments studying the development of network circuitry. This specific investigation focused on designing novel technologies aimed at studying a specific form of neural network plasticity: synaptic scaling in homeostatic plasticity. This endeavor is broken into 3 thrusts: Thrust I: Cell Incubation System: The Hotbox is a custom-built environmental control device that modulates temperature, CO₂, and humidity levels inside a <b>custom</b> built environmental <b>enclosure.</b> Temperature is monitored with thermocouple, and a PID controller is used to drive heating elements.

Thrust II: Electrophysiology—Alleviating Bursting in LNN: Attempts to scale short-term Burst-Inhibiting phenomena to longer time scales and induce more pronounced and permanent network modifications were successful. However, the integrity of LNN health was compromised at 17 DIV; thus this experiment can only serve as a preliminary experiment for future experiments attempting to demonstrate Burst-Inhibiting and Synaptic Scaling phenomena.

40|$|Remote {{infrared}} (IR) sensing {{provides a}} valuable {{method for detection}} and identification of materials associated with nuclear proliferation. Current challenges for remote sensors include minimizing the size, mass, and power requirements for cheaper, smaller, and more deployable instruments without affecting the measurement performance. One area that is often overlooked is sensor calibration design that is optimized to minimize the cost, size, weight, {{and power of the}} payload. Yet, an on-board calibration system is essential to account for changes in the detector response once the instrument has been removed from the laboratory. The Calibration Systems project at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is aimed towards developing and demonstrating compact quantum cascade (QC) laser-based calibration systems for infrared sensor systems in order to provide both a spectral and radiometric calibration while minimizing the impact on the instrument payload. In FY 05, PNNL demonstrated a multi-level radiance scheme that provides six radiance levels for an enhanced linearity check compared to the currently accepted two-point scheme. PNNL began testing the repeatability of this scheme using a cryogenically cooled, single-mode quantum cascade laser (QCL). A cyclic variation in the power was observed that was attributed to the thermal cycling of the laser's dewar. In FY 06, PNNL continued testing this scheme and installed an auxiliary liquid nitrogen reservoir to limit the thermal cycling effects. Although better repeatability was achieved over a longer time period, power fluctuations were still observed due to the thermal cycling. Due to the limitations with the cryogenic system, PNNL began testing Fabry-Perot QCLs that operate continuous-wave (cw) or quasi-cw at room temperature (RT) in FY 06. PNNL demonstrated a multi-level scheme that provides five radiance levels in 105 seconds with excellent repeatability. We have continued testing this repeatability in FY 07. A burn-in effect appears in which the power increases over a certain time period. Repeatability better than 1 %, however, is demonstrated for most of the radiance levels after this initial burn-in. In FY 06, PNNL also began investigating a fiber-coupled RT QCL for a compact IR calibration source. PNNL demonstrated a uniform beam profile by measuring a time-averaged response and modulating the fiber optic with a motor to minimize the effects of speckle. In FY 07, PNNL examined the power stability of fiber-coupled QCLs. Feedback appears to degrade the stability so that anti-reflective coatings for fibers may be essential. In FY 07, PNNL continued to investigate the stability of room temperature QCLs as well as the measurement technique to provide a quantitative estimate for the measurement uncertainty. We designed and built a <b>custom</b> environmental <b>enclosure</b> to reduce the measurement uncertainty. After an initial burn-in, we have achieved uncertainties better than 0. 1 % for data collected over almost 100 hours of operation. We also built a bench-top system to demonstrate how the QC laser can be used to calibrate a microbolometer array and illustrated the importance of a multi-point calibration...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) are {{electrochemical}} conversion devices that convert various fuel sources directly into electrical energy at temperatures ranging from 600 °C to 1000 °C. These high temperatures could potentially allow the direct use of various hydrocarbon fuel sources and hydrogen, {{without the need}} for expensive noble metal catalysis. Conventional SOFCs are designed in a two-chamber system, separating the fuel and oxidant flow to the anode and cathode, respectively. However, fuel cell manufacturing cost and robustness have proven to be the main challenges to rapid commercialization. A promising alternate method to achieve these requirements and to open up new architecture designs for the SOFC is the development of single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (SC-SOFCs). SC-SOFCs avoid many of the manufacturing challenges associated with conventional SOFCs, and have shown optimal performance between 500 °C and 800 °C. This reduces the need for high temperature sealing and a complicated manifold structure; however it also reduces the partial pressure of the gases at the electrodes, which reduces the theoretical obtainable voltage. (cont.) Microfabrication techniques such as photolithography, sputtering, and photo-resist liftoff were used to create various micro SC-SOFC that are 25 - 400 microns long and 15 - 40 microns wide, utilizing platinum and gold for the electrodes and YSZ as the electrolyte. After successfully fabricating these micro SC-SOFCs, the fuel cells were tested in a microprobestation with a <b>custom</b> gas chamber <b>enclosure,</b> which was exposed to CH 4 : 02 :N 2 at 20 : 20 : 100 ccm or 40 : 20 : 100 ccm. A switch in the OCV from a negative voltage to a positive voltage was observed around 600 °C, possible indicating change in electrochemical reactions with temperature. An OCV of [approx. ] 0. 4 V and peak power density of 27 [mu]W/cm 2 at 900 °C in a 1 : 1 methane:oxygen ratio was achieved.
