To estimate the seasonal and spatial distribution of APAHs in dustfall in Shanghai, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were the analytical methods applied to the dustfall samples collected in this area from Dec. 2004 to Oct. 2005. Forty-one APAHs were found and divided into six groups which were alkyl naphthalenes (ANAs), alkyl phenanthrenes (APHs), alkyl anthracenes (AANs), alkyl fluoranthenes (AFLs), alkyl pyrenes (APYs) and alkyl <b>chrysenes</b> (ACHs). ANAs and APHs were two dominant APAHs {{in the proportion of}} more than 50 %. The concentrations of total APAHs ranged from 1. 6 to 9. 0 μg g- 1. The ratios of APAHs to TPAHs (PAHs plus APAHs) fell into the range of 28 ∼ 50 %. The APAH levels were found to be higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. In terms of spatial distribution, concentration of APAHs was found to be higher in western Shanghai than eastern Shanghai. The source analysis showed that dustfall APAHs mainly derived from vehicle emissions and used crankcase oil.

40|$|Abstract – An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} into the PAH chemical contamination resulting from the “Erika ” tanker fuel spillage of December 1999 along the French coast of the Bay of Biscay. A qualitative and quantitative assessment was conducted of this contamination in water, suspended particulate matter, sediments, and in intertidal molluscs. The chemical composition of PAHs in pre-spill and post-spill samples was determined and used to distinguish the “Erika’s” fuel {{as the source of}} PAHs in the coastal environment of the Bay of Biscay. Changes in concentrations of PAHs were also assessed. The GC-MS analysis made it possible to identify and quantify parent unsubstituted PAHs, alkyl-substituted PAHs (C-PAH) and sulfur heterocycle unsubstituted and alkyl substituted compounds (SPAH and C-SPAH). The re-sults of this study demonstrated that heavily oil-contaminated shorelines, including beaches, rocky coasts as well as sandy sediments apparently became reservoirs of spilled fuel and these continued to contaminate seawater, suspended particulate matter and mussels with PAHs. These conclusions were borne out by the following observations: (1) the pat-tern changes in PAH composition after the “Erika ” oil spill were consistent in all contaminated compartments (water, suspended particulate matter SPM, intertidal sediments and molluscs), (2) the compositional patterns of PAHs after the “Erika ” oil spill in contaminated water, SPM, intertidal sediments and molluscs constantly included alkyl-substituted phenanthrenes, pyrenes, <b>chrysenes</b> and sulfur heterocycle compounds in higher relative abundances than those in the pre-spill samples of these compartments, (3) the relative abundances of different suites of PAHs at contaminated site...|$|R

This research investigation included two similarly-designed experiments. In the first, a biological surfactant produced by Rhodococcus strain H 13 -A and a commonly-used synthetic surfactant, Tween- 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate), were compared for their effectiveness in enhancing the transport of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from a complex organic phase into aqueous solution. In the batch-reactor experiment, each reactor contained a surfactant solution and West Texas Crude oil, while the control reactors contained distilled-deionized water and the crude oil. Using a temporal-monitoring scheme, the reactors were sacrificially sampled to determine the water-accommodated fraction (WAF). The phenanthrenes, fluorenes, pyrenes, and <b>chrysenes</b> showed significant increases in their aqueous-plus-micellar-phase concentrations in the presence of surfactants; the increase was greater for the biosurfactant compared to the synthetic surfactant. The enhancement in "solubility" was also more significant for the highly-substituted aromatics, when compared to their parent compounds. In the second study, the effects of four biosurfactants on the solubility of petroleum saturated hydrocarbons were compared. Rhodococcus species H 13 -A (glycolipid-producing), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (rhamnolipid-producing), Candida bombicola ATCC 22214 (sophorolipid-producing), and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 (surfactin-producing) were compared to a control of distilled-deionized water. The experimental design was similar that of the first study. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa treatment significantly enhanced the solubility of the lower-weight, higher-weight and branched saturated hydrocarbons. The Rhodococcus treatment significantly enhanced the solubility of the low-molecular-weight compounds, but only moderately increased the solubilities of the other saturates. Neither the Candida nor the Bacillus solutions produced any negligible increase in solubility under these laboratory conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Canadian {{oil sand}} region, {{located in the}} {{northern}} part of the province Alberta, holds the third largest oil reserves in the world with an estimated volume of 173 billion barrels of heavily biodegraded petroleum. Surface mining of oil sand deposits which are situated in low depth, has a huge impact on the surrounding environment due to the removement of vegetation, surface soils, and subsurface geological material (overburden). In 2011, an area of around 600 km 2 was affected by oil sands mining. However, not only the mining process itself is an issue of growing public and environmental concern, also by-products resulting from the oil sand extraction with hot water cause additional environmental problems. The extraction water and residual oil are stored in tailings ponds, which surpass approximately 180 km 2. The environmental impact of oil sand exploration and further processing is not only of growing concern regarding soil and vegetation removement but also pollution of the surrounding compartments soil, water and air, and the deterioration of the landscape and the ecosystem function are major problems. For landscape reconstructions the major solid waste or residual products of oil sand extraction, the coarse tailings sands, the mature fine tailings and the removed overburden are used. According to soil remediation standards, these reclamation sites should support a healthy plant community that will evolve towards an ecosystem comparable to that existing prior to disturbance. For a successful recultivation of the disturbed land into its natural environment soil and plant community development needs to be understood. Within the last decades especially soil structure, affected water, and plant growth and diversity have been studied for reclamation areas in Alberta. In contrast only little is known about the occurrence of residual oil-sand-derived organic matter, which is a contaminant in the soils from reclamation sites, and its possible fate with increasing age. The goal of this thesis is to understand how the initial organic matter composition of the oil sands evolves during oil sand processing and to gain information on the proportion, fate and type of oil-sand-derived organic matter in the developing soils on reclamation sites. Additionally the reactions of plants and microbial communities in terms of composition and adaptation to oil contamination of the growth substrate used for recultivation are studied. To assess the influence of oil sand processing and the progress of reclamation, field samples consisting of original oil sand material, mature fine tailings from a tailings pond and from drying cells of different ages as well as a variety of reclamation site samples were analyzed regarding biogeochemical parameter such as biomarkers, nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen (NSO) compounds, pore water ion concentrations, cell counts and microbial community structure. Oil sand related compounds are found in all samples from each step of the process chain. By comparing selected biomarkers and biomarker ratios from the different sample types it is shown that neither heat nor biological processes in tailings ponds, drying cells or reclamation sites have altered the composition of organic matter constituents to any significant extent. This demonstrates the resistance of the analyzed biomarkers against the extraction processes and biodegradation. Contrary to the oil-related biomarkers, changes in PAH abundances and patterns in the mature fine tailings and especially in the reclamation samples are observed, indicated by a loss or depletion of naphthalenes, phenanthrenes and <b>chrysenes.</b> These specific oil-derived organic constituents seem to be utilized as carbon/energy sources by microorganisms in the reclamation samples, leading to a reduction of hazardous substances in the developing soils. Designated cell abundances on reclamation sites are up to ten times higher compared to the original oil sand material. Here nitrate and roots in the newly developing soil seem to be the most important stimulants for microbial growth. In addition to the oil-sand-derived hydrocarbons, heteroatom-containing compounds were analyzed by ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry regarding process-related changes of polar organic compounds. Based on bulk compound class distributions specific compositional features were identified that are related to the different steps of the process chain. As an example oxygen containing compounds like naphthenic acids are most pronounced in the oil sand samples and decrease along the process chain, whereas saturated fatty acids are most abundant in reclamation samples and represent their increasing input into the developing soils. These fatty acids are related to a microbial and cuticular wax origin. In contrast to the O 2 class the N 1 class decreases from the oil sand samples to the reclamation samples. This class is dominated by pyrrolic nitrogen compounds such as carbazoles, benzocarbazoles and dibenzocarbazoles, respectively. Detailed analysis of the N 1 class shows that the reclamation samples do not contain any unique N 1 compound and an almost invariant double bond equivalent distribution along the process chain. This implies that all nitrogen-containing constituents must derive from the oil sand, which makes them sensitive tracers of oil-sand-derived organic material even in soils from relatively old reclamation sites. A greenhouse experiment was set up to investigate effects of the different reclamations substrates on plants and soil microbial community by characterizing the phospholipid fatty acid composition of substrate and root material. Therefore three different reclamation substrates and two different plant species (Elymus trachycaulus and Lotus corniculatus) were analyzed. The analysis of the phospholipid fatty acid profiles in the substrates shows an enrichment of Gram-negative bacteria especially in the tailings sand/mature fine tailings substrates containing residual oil-sand-derived organic matter. These bacteria seem to be capable of surviving high amounts of hydrocarbon contamination, even though oil-sand-derived organic compounds are very resistant to biodegradation and do not serve as a good carbon and/or energy source. In contrast phospholipid fatty acid data reveal that the development of fungi in the substrate is inhibited by oil-sand-derived organic matter. The two plant types respond differently to the substrates. The phospholipid fatty acid inventory indicates a significantly higher fungal biomass and a generally higher microbial biomass for all growing substrates in the Lotus corniculatus roots. These results show that not only the substrate itself but especially the plant type influences the proportion of bacteria to mycorrhizal fungi and that the plant Lotus corniculatus might be a favourable pioneering plant for oil sand reclamation sites. It can be concluded, that the establishment of reclamation sites that evolve towards an ecosystem existing prior to mining operations is very challenging. Mature fine tailings and tailings sands show only slight to no changes of oil-sand-derived hydrocarbons and NSO compounds before they are used as reclamation substrates. As soon as the tailings sands are used in landscape reconstruction, specific oil-sand-derived pollutants were degraded by an active and specified microbial community. With increasing age of the sites the oil-sand-derived pollutants decrease and the input of exogenous organic material, mainly derived from plants and trees increases, which supports the aspired ecosystem restoration. However, recalcitrant pyrrolic nitrogen compounds were found on all reclamation sites and thus serve as an efficient and sensitive tool to detect even highly diluted petroleum residues in soils or other types of contaminated environmental samples. Die kanadische Ölsand-Region im Norden der Provinz Alberta beheimatet, mit einem geschätzten Volumen von 173 Milliarden Barrel stark biodegradiertem Erdöl, die drittgrößte Ölreserve der Welt. Dabei hat die Förderung der oberflächennahen Bitumenvorkommen durch den Tagebau große negative Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt, da unter anderem Böden und Vegetation entfernt werden müssen. Doch nicht nur der Abbauprozess selbst ist ein Thema wachsender öffentlicher und ökologischer Besorgnis. Nebenprodukte aus der Ölsandextraktion verursachen zusätzliche Umweltprobleme, da Extraktionswässer und Reste des extrahierten Öls in Absetzbecken, die mittlerweile eine Fläche von 180 km 2 übertreffen, gespeichert werden müssen. Auch die Kontamination der umgebenden Umweltkompartimente Boden, Wasser und Luft ist ein Thema laufender Debatten. Für die Landschaftsrekonstruktionen werden die Hauptabfallprodukte bzw. Restprodukte der Ölsandgewinnung wie „tailings sands“, „mature fine tailings“ und der Abraum aus dem Tagebau verwendet. Nach den kanadischen Bodensanierungsstandards sollten Rekultivierungsflächen das Wachstum einer gesunden Pflanzengemeinschaft unterstützen, die sich zu einem Ökosystem vergleichbar dem vor der Zerstörung entwickelt.

50|$|Myricetin {{also has}} been shown to inhibit the act of genetic {{mutation}} as exhibited by the Ames test.

This data shows that myricetin is not unilaterally able to reduce the carcinogenic activity of all polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or even the more specific subclass of benzo(a)pyrenes. It is to be noted that myricetin’s exact biochemical activity is still not fully understood.

5000|$|QTAIM {{is applied}} to the {{description}} of certain organic crystals with unusually short distances between neighboring molecules as observed by X-ray diffraction. For example, in the crystal structure of molecular chlorine the experimental Cl...Cl distance between two molecules is 327 picometres which is less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of 350 picometres. In one QTAIM result 12 bond paths start from each chlorine atom to other chlorine atoms including the other chlorine atom in the molecule. The theory also aims to explain the metallic properties of metallic hydrogen in much the same way. The theory is also applied to so-called hydrogen-hydrogen bonds [...] as they occur in molecules such as phenanthrene and <b>chrysene.</b> In these compounds the distance between two ortho hydrogen atoms again is shorter than their van der Waals radii and according to in silico experiments based on this theory, a bond path is identified between them. Both hydrogen atoms have identical electron density and are closed shell and therefore they are very different from the so-called dihydrogen bonds which are postulated for compounds such as (CH3)2NHBH3 and also different from so-called agostic interactions. In mainstream chemistry close proximity of two nonbonding atoms leads to destabilizing steric repulsion but in QTAIM the observed hydrogen hydrogen interactions are in fact stabilizing. It is well known that both kinked phenanthrene and <b>chrysene</b> are around 6 kcal/mol (25 kJ/mol) more stable than their linear isomers anthracene and tetracene. One traditional explanation is given by Clar's rule. QTAIM shows that a calculated stabilization for phenanthrene by 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) is the result of destabilization of the compound by 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) originating from electron transfer from carbon to hydrogen, offset by 12.1 kcal (51 kJ/mol) of stabilization due to a H..H bond path. The electron density at the critical point between the two hydrogen atoms is low, 0.012 e for phenanthrene. Another property of the bond path is its curvature. Another molecule studied in QTAIM is biphenyl. Its two phenyl rings are oriented at a 38° angle with respect to each other with the planar molecular geometry (encountered in a rotation around the central C-C bond) destabilized by 2.1 kcal/mol (8.8 kJ/mol) and the perpendicular one destabilized by 2.5 kcal/mol (10.5 kJ/mol). The classic explanations for this rotation barrier are steric repulsion between the ortho-hydrogen atoms (planar) and breaking of delocalization of pi density over both rings (perpendicular).|$|E
50|$|One area {{in which}} Rhodotorula species may become of {{importance}} is in bioremediation, especially of contaminated water sites. Although typically bacteria are commonly used bioremediation studies, there are more fungal studies now than ever. As with bacteria, fungi can naturally develop modified metabolism to deal with environmental contaminants, and could then be used in bioremediation. One main target is often polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) since they often persist in the environment and {{have high levels of}} toxicity. Through sediment analysis and testing of contaminated waters Rhodotorula were found to be common in contaminated sites. It was noted in samples taken from contaminated waters that Rhodotorula species had the ability to degrade petroleum compounds. These studies as well as others suggest that Rhodotorula species may be good candidates for bioremediation of polluted waters for PAHs. In more directed studies a number of species of Rhodotorula were found to be able to degrade a number of specific contaminants. For example, R. glutinis and R. rubra have both been found to have a high ability to degrade phenanthrene, while R. minuta has been found to degrade benzo(a)anthracene. In a mixed fungal community Rhodotorula species contributed to effective degradation of low molecular weight PAHs, and although bacterial communities alone were not able to, the fungal communities also degraded high molecular weight PAHs (more than 3 benzene rings) such as <b>chrysene</b> and benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E

40|$|PurposeThis study {{evaluates the}} toxic effects of <b>chrysene</b> (a {{component}} from cigarette smoke) on Müller cells (MIO-M 1) in vitro and investigates whether the inhibitor lipoic acid can reverse the chrysene-induced toxic effects. MethodsMIO-M 1 cells {{were exposed to}} varying concentrations of <b>chrysene</b> with or without lipoic acid. Cell viability was measured by a trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Caspase- 3 / 7 activity was measured by a fluorochrome assay. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was quantified by an LDH assay. The production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) was measured with a 2 ’, 7 ’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured using the JC- 1 assay. Intracellular ATP content {{was determined by the}} ATPLite kit. ResultsMIO-M 1 cells showed significantly decreased cell viability, increased caspase- 3 / 7 activity, LDH release at the highest <b>chrysene</b> concentration, elevated ROS/RNS levels, decreased ΔΨm value, and decreased intracellular ATP content after exposure to 300, 500, and 1, 000 µM <b>chrysene</b> compared with the control. Pretreatment with 80 µM lipoic acid reversed loss of cell viability in 500 -µM-chrysene-treated cultures (24. 7 %, p< 0. 001). Similarly, pretreatment with 80 µM lipoic acid before <b>chrysene</b> resulted in decreased caspase- 3 / 7 activities (75. 7 %, p< 0. 001), decreased ROS/RNS levels (80. 02 %, p< 0. 001), increased ΔΨm values (86 %, p< 0. 001), and increased ATP levels (40. 5 %, p< 0. 001) compared to 500 -µM-chrysene-treated cultures. ConclusionsChrysene, a component of cigarette smoke, can diminish cell viability in MIO-M 1 cells in vitro by apoptosis at the lower concentrations of <b>Chrysene</b> (300 and 500 µM) and necrosis at the highest concentration. Moreover, mitochondrial function was particularly altered. However, lipoic acid can partially reverse the cytotoxic effect of <b>chrysene.</b> Lipoic acid administration may reduce or prevent Müller cell degeneration in retinal degenerative disorders...|$|E
40|$|Self-assembled monolayers of <b>chrysene</b> and indene on {{graphite}} {{have been}} observed and characterized individually with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at 80 K under low-temperature, ultrahigh vacuum conditions. These molecules are small, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing no alkyl chains or functional groups that are known to promote two-dimensional self-assembly. Energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations performed for small groups of the molecules physisorbed on graphite {{provide insight into the}} monolayer structure and forces that drive the self-assembly. The adsorption energy for a single <b>chrysene</b> molecule on a model graphite substrate is calculated to be 32 kcal/mol, while that for indene is 17 kcal/mol. Two distinct monolayer structures {{have been observed}} for <b>chrysene,</b> corresponding to high-and low-density assemblies. High-resolution STM images taken of <b>chrysene</b> with different bias polarities reveal distinct nodal structure that is characteristic of the molecular electronic state(s) mediating the tunneling process. Density functional theory calculations are utilized in the assignment of the observed electronic states and possible tunneling mechanism. These results are discussed within the context of PAH and soot particle formation, because both <b>chrysene</b> and indene are known reaction products from the combustion of small hydrocarbons. They are also of fundamental interest in the fields of nanotechnology and molecular electronics...|$|E
40|$|The {{destruction}} of three {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) : benzo[a]pyrene, <b>chrysene</b> and fluorene in aqueous solution using advanced oxidation process H 2 O 2 /UV was investigated. The influence of pH, initial hydrogen peroxide and radical scavenger concentrations on the reaction rate was studied. The oxidation reactions most rapidly run in neutral and acidic solution at optimal hydrogen peroxide concentration (ca. 0. 01 M). The degradation of benzo[a]pyrene and <b>chrysene</b> follows radical reaction, for fluorene the mechanism is not clear. The rate constants of the hydroxyl radicals and selected PAHs reaction {{were found to be}} 2. 53 × 1010, 9. 82 × 109 and 2. 77 × 109 M− 1 S− 1 for benzo[a]pyrene, <b>chrysene</b> and fluorene, respectivel...|$|E
40|$|To degrade <b>chrysene,</b> a {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH), Armillaria sp. F 022, a fungus col-lected from a soil, was used. Maximal degradation (77 %) was obtained when Armillaria sp. F 022 was incubated in cultures agitated at 120 rpm for 30 days, as compared to just 41 % degradation in stationary culture. Furthermore, the degradation of <b>chrysene</b> was affected {{by the addition of}} surfactants. The mecha-nism of degradation was determined through identification of the intermediates. Several enzymes (manga-nese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, laccase, 1, 2 -dioxygenase and 2, 3 -dioxygenase) produced by Armillaria sp. F 022 were detected in the culture. The highest level of activity was shown by 1, 2 -dioxygenase after 20 days (143. 6 U l- 1). These ligninolytic and dioxygenase enzymes {{played an important role in}} the oxidation of <b>chrysene.</b> <b>Chrysene</b> was indeed degraded by Armillaria sp. F 022 through several intermediates, chrysenequinone, 2 -((1 E, 3 E) - 4 -carboxy- 3 -hydroxybuta- 1, 3 -dien- 1 -yl) - 1 -naphthoic acid, 1 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid, and gentisic acid...|$|E
40|$|A {{factorial}} design {{was applied for}} the development of a solid surface room-temperature phosphorimetric method aiming the selective determination of <b>chrysene.</b> Data analysis was made using statistical experimental analysis (testing the significance of the factors using the analysis of variation, F-test and t-test), graphic method (Pareto´s chart) and the evaluation of the interactions among all variables. This procedure was used in order to guarantee high accuracy of results and minimization of the time spent for optimization. As the result, the experimental conditions using a selective phosphorescence inducer (silver) and a substrate surface modifier allowed the determination of <b>chrysene</b> in the presence of pyrene. The method allowed the detection of effective masses of <b>chrysene</b> in the ng range. Method validation is presented including a recovery and “t ” tests using...|$|E
