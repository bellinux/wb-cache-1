40|$|In this paper, the {{amplitude}} of random telegraph noise (RTN) in FinFET is studied, comparing with RTN in planar devices. The impacts of intrinsic characteristics in FinFET (<b>channel</b> <b>non-uniformity</b> and quantum confinement) on its RTN amplitude are comprehensively studied, {{based on the}} framework of “hole in the inversion layer” (HIL) model and the 3 D device simulations. The results indicate that, the conventional HIL model for planar device can be extended to FinFET, if {{taking into account the}} non-uniform Fin current density. It is also found that, the RTN-induced “hole” in FinFET is smaller than that in planar device under the same inversion carrier density per gate, due to strong quantum confinement in FinFET. These results are helpful for accurate RTN amplitude modeling in FinFET...|$|E
40|$|In this letter, {{we present}} a fiber grating coupler with an {{integrated}} 16 -way power splitter. The incoming light from the fiber is split immediately over 16 channels, and therefore, the total optical power is never confined in a single waveguide. This {{is of particular interest}} for silicon photonics platforms, because, here, high optical intensities can cause significant non-linear losses. The device has a total coupling efficiency that is similar to standard focusing grating couplers. Furthermore, a <b>channel</b> <b>non-uniformity</b> below 1. 1 dB has been obtained. By studying the alignment sensitivity, we found that for high splitting uniformity, a careful positioning of the fiber is necessary. We also experimentally demonstrate that this device is indeed capable of handling high optical powers without introducing additional non-linear losses...|$|E
40|$|Curved-channel {{microchannel}} plate (C-plate) improvements resulting from an ongoing NASA STIS {{microchannel plate}} (MCP) development program are described. Performance limitations of previous C-plates {{led to a}} development program {{in support of the}} STIS MAMA UV photon counter, a second generation instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope. C-plate gain, quantum detection efficiency, dark noise, and imaging distortion, which are influenced by <b>channel</b> curvature <b>non-uniformities,</b> have all been improved through use of a new centrifuge fabrication technique. This technique will be described, along with efforts to improve older, more conventional shearing methods. Process optimization methods used to attain targeted C-plate performance goals will be briefly characterized. Newly developed diagnostic measurement techniques to study image distortion, gain uniformity, input bias angle, channel curvature, and ion feedback, will be described. Performance characteristics and initial test results of the improved C-plates will be reported. Future work and applications will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{intracellular}} calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) transient {{in adult}} rat heart cells was examined using the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo- 3 and a laser scanning confocal microscope. We {{find that the}} electrically evoked [Ca 2 +]i transient does not rise at a uniform rate at all points within the cell during the [Ca 2 +]i transient. These spatial non-uniformities in [Ca 2 +]i are observed immediately upon depolarization and largely disappear {{by the time the}} peak of the [Ca 2 +]i transient occurs. Importantly, some of the spatial non-uniformity in [Ca 2 +]i varies randomly in location from beat to beat. Analysis of the spatial character of the non-uniformities suggests that they arise from the stochastic nature of the activation of SR calcium-release <b>channels.</b> The <b>non-uniformities</b> in [Ca 2 +]i are markedly enhanced by low concentrations of Cd 2 +, suggesting that activation of L-type calcium channels is the primary source of activator calcium for the calcium transient. In addition, the pattern of calcium release in these conditions was very similar to the spontaneous calcium sparks that are observed under resting conditions and which are due to spontaneous calcium release from the SR. The spatial non-uniformity in the evoked [Ca 2 +]i transient under normal conditions {{can be explained by the}} temporal and spatial summation of a large number of calcium sparks whose activation is a stochastic process. The results are discussed with respect to a stochastic local control model for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, and it is proposed that the fundamental unit of E-C coupling consists of one dihydropyridine receptor activating a small group of ryanodine receptors (possibly four) in a square packing model...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{extensive}} observations and numerous theoretical {{studies in the}} past decades several key questions related with Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) emission mechanisms are still to be answered. Precise detection of the GRB polarization carried out by dedicated instruments can provide new data and be an ultimate tool to unveil their real nature. A novel space-borne Compton polarimeter POLAR onboard the Chinese space station TG 2 is designed to measure linear polarization of gamma-rays arriving from GRB prompt emissions. POLAR uses plastics scintillator bars (PS) as gamma-ray detectors and multi-anode photomultipliers (MAPMTs) for readout of the scintillation light. Inherent properties of such detection systems are crosstalk and non-uniformity. The crosstalk smears recorded energy over multiple <b>channels</b> making both <b>non-uniformity</b> corrections and energy calibration more difficult. Rigorous extraction of polarization observable requires to take such effects properly into account. We studied influence of the crosstalk on energy depositions during laboratory measurements with X-ray beams. A relation between genuine and recorded energy was deduced using an introduced model of data analysis. It postulates that both the crosstalk and non-uniformities can be described with a single matrix obtained in calibrations with mono-energetic X- and gamma-rays. Necessary corrections are introduced using matrix based equations allowing for proper evaluation of the measured GRB spectra. Validity of the method was established during dedicated experimental tests. The same approach can be also applied in space utilizing POLAR internal calibration sources. The introduced model is general and with some adjustments well suitable for data analysis from other MAPMT-based instruments...|$|R
40|$|The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS Aqua Spacecraft was {{launched}} on May 4, 2002. AIRS acquires hyperspectral infrared radiances in 2378 channels ranging in wavelength from 3. 7 - 15. 4 microns with spectral resolution of better than 1200, and spatial resolution of 13. 5 km with global daily coverage. The AIRS {{is designed to}} measure temperature and water vapor profiles for improvement in weather forecast accuracy and improved understanding of climate processes. As with most instruments, the AIRS Point Spread Functions (PSFs) {{are not the same}} for all detectors. When viewing a non-uniform scene, this causes a significant radiometric error in some channels that is scene dependent and cannot be removed without knowledge of the underlying scene. The magnitude of the error depends on the combination of non-uniformity of the AIRS spatial response for a given <b>channel</b> and the <b>non-uniformity</b> of the scene, but is typically only noticeable in about 1 % of the scenes and about 10 % of the channels. The current solution is to avoid those channels when performing geophysical retrievals. In this effort we use data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument to provide information on the scene uniformity that is used to correct the AIRS data. For the vast majority of channels and footprints the technique works extremely well when compared to a Principal Component (PC) reconstruction of the AIRS channels. In some cases where the scene has high inhomogeneity in an irregular pattern, and in some channels, the method can actually degrade the spectrum. Most of the degraded channels appear to be slightly affected by random noise introduced in the process, but those with larger degradation may be affected by alignment errors in the AIRS relative to MODIS or uncertainties in the PSF. Despite these errors, the methodology shows the ability to correct AIRS radiances in non-uniform scenes under some of the worst case conditions and improves the ability to match AIRS and MODIS radiances in non-uniform scenes...|$|R
