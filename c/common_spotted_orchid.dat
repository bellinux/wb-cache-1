5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. <b>Common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid,</b> zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E
5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid</b> (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis). bee orchid (Ophrys apifera) and man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus).|$|E
50|$|The meadow is flower-rich wet grassland. Flora include <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids,</b> cuckooflowers, meadowsweets, marsh-marigolds and ragged-robins. There {{are also}} grass snakes and birds such as blackcaps.|$|R
50|$|Gunton Warren is {{a coastal}} site which has sand dunes, shingle, lowland heath and cliff slopes. Birds include rare {{migrants}} including icterines and yellow-browed warblers. Corton Woods has mature trees and diverse flora such as lesser celandine, bee <b>orchids</b> and <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{formerly}} used to burn ironstone to remove impurities, leaving {{a layer of}} calcine, which produces poor soil in which wildflowers flourish. The reserve also includes a stretch of railway embankment for transporting the iron ore. Flora include <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids,</b> great reedmace, kidney vetch and meadowsweet.|$|R
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid,</b> zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|E

50|$|Part of {{this site}} is ancient {{woodland}} of hornbeam, oak and silver birch, with an understorey which is mainly hazel and hawthorn. The other part is younger woodland which has wildflower glades with orchids such as broad-leaved helleborines, bee <b>orchids</b> and <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids.</b> There are fauna such as slowworms and grass snakes.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{formerly}} {{part of the}} London North West Railway line, which closed in 1962. The banks provide a rich habitat for chalk grassland flowers, such as <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids</b> and cowslips. The south-facing slope has deep rooted plants such as hawkweed and scabious, while the sheltered north-facing slope has lush grasses. There are many species of butterflies.|$|R
50|$|Dactylorhiza fuchsii, the <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid,</b> is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae.|$|E
50|$|Didcot {{also has}} a nature reserve, Mowbray Fields, where {{wildlife}} including <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid</b> and Southern Marsh Orchid occur.|$|E
50|$|Surrounding {{the river}} and lakes, {{fragments}} of now rare meadow survive. These provide ideal conditions for meadowsweet, great burnet and <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{previously}} a park for Norman House. It is woodland on a sandy and gravel soil, with meadows and six man-made ponds. Grassland plants include cowslips, wild strawberries and <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids.</b> There are birds such as nuthatches and woodpeckers, and {{many species of}} butterfly. Black poplars, which are the county's rarest native tree, have been planted to replace trees lost to storm damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{north shore}} is mainly vegetated with scrub and woodland, {{including}} willow, blackthorn, elder, birch, hawthorn, and hazel. <b>Common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids</b> {{grow in the}} base-rich flushed areas. At the extreme south eastern corner of the site there {{is an area of}} marshy grassland with abundant meadow-sweet, wild angelica, common knapweed, and sneezewort and where there is periodic flooding of the shore you can also find species like common spike rush, reed canary grass, lesser spearwort, and amphibious bistort.|$|R
50|$|Cadbury Hill is a {{designated}} Local Nature Reserve. In 2009, a 19th-century agricultural stock pond - previously hidden by undergrowth - was restored by the Yatton & Congresbury Wildlife Action Group (YACWAG). The Local Nature Reserve comprises ancient semi-natural woodland, scrub and unimproved grassland. Species of interest include marsh tit, noctule bat, slow worm, wood anemone, bluebell, betony, small scabious, rock rose, small leaved lime. On the northern limestone slope grow hundreds of <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids.</b> The hill fort itself has many ant hills, which are visited by green woodpeckers.|$|R

50|$|Springs present {{encourage}} the species which flourish {{in such areas}} and these include sharp-flowered rush, marsh marigold, ragged robin, <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid</b> and bird's-foot trefoil.|$|E
50|$|The first {{development}} {{following the}} formation of the trust in 1980 was the establishment of England's first urban nature reserve at Brandon Hill, bringing hay meadows, wildlife ponds and butterfly gardens into a formal city park. In 1981 Stockwood Open Space came under the trust's management to encourage a range of wildlife and have been particularly successful with <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids.</b> Other early work in the 1980s included taking over the management of Littleton Brick Pits near Littleton-upon-Severn, an artificial lagoon once the site of clay extraction for brick making, and reintroducing reedbeds close to the Severn Estuary, as a feeding and resting place for migrating birds.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} also home to many species of plants {{including}} the bee orchid, pyramidal orchid, Marsh Helleborine, Bee <b>orchid</b> and <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids.</b> There is an Interpretative Centre {{at the end of the}} causeway on the right hand side which has displays and information on the flora and fauna of the island, and there are also information signs to either side of the causeway access, and on the roundabout where the causeway road approaches the beach. The Centre was opened in 1986 and provides a base for many schools and educational groups to visit the Island. It was funded by the European Commission and the Dublin Rotary Club.|$|R
50|$|Stockwood Open Space {{is a local}} nature reserve. It is {{an expanse}} of old {{farmland}} and ancient woodland providing a blend of old meadows, thick hedges and woodlands on lime-rich clay soils. It is owned by Bristol City Council and managed as a nature reserve {{in partnership with the}} Avon Wildlife Trust. cowslip, Dyer's greenweed, <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids</b> and bird's-foot trefoil are amongst the flowers to be found, and numerous butterflies include meadow brown, marbled white and large skipper. The wood known as Ilsyngrove is very old and the home of bluebell, yellow archangel and the rare Bath asparagus. Birds including whitethroats, kestrels and sparrowhawks are often seen. Two farm ponds are homes for frogs, toads and newts.|$|R
50|$|Horsetail Glade, as {{the name}} suggests, {{is home to a}} large area of giant horsetails. There are {{numerous}} willow species, and <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid</b> grows here in the summer.|$|E
50|$|On steeper banks, {{which are}} not cut, a {{particularly}} rich flora includes alpine bistort, Polygonum viviparum, <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid,</b> Dactylorhiza fuchsii, and intermediate lady's-mantle, Alchemilla xanthochlora, among many others.|$|E
50|$|Slader's Leigh {{is a local}} nature reserve. It is a wildflower meadow {{with plants}} {{including}} devil’s-bit scabious, cowslip, betony, <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid</b> and tormentil which provide a habitat {{for a range of}} butterflies.|$|E
50|$|It is {{here that}} one will find some rare and some {{endangered}} species such as the dormouse, the nightingale, the bee fly, the birds-nest orchid and the purple emperor butterfly. Tortington has {{a wide variety of}} habitats - woodland, open farmland, water meadows, river banks, ponds, rifes - and all have some wildlife classed as rare or even as endangered species. In the woods of Tortington the hazel dormouse population is being monitored by the Mid Arun Valley Environmental Survey (MAVES) who are also monitoring owls and bats in this, Areas 5 and 6 in the survey area. The woodland understorey has a variety of smaller floral species - early-purple and <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids,</b> primrose, bluebell, wood anemones, wood sorrel and snakeshead fritillaries. Many of Tortington's numerous bluebell woods are beside public footpaths so can be viewed in April and May. A protected species, the common bluebell is also an indicator of ancient woodland.|$|R
50|$|Lineage Wood has neutral {{grassland}} rides {{with diverse}} flora, especially orchids {{such as the}} greater butterfly, fly <b>orchid,</b> <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> and bee <b>orchid.</b> 22 species of butterfly have been recorded. The disused railway line also has floristically rich grassland, but the soil is more alkaline.|$|R
40|$|Deer {{can have}} an adverse impact on {{woodland}} vegetation and simplify vertical structure by selectively browsing on herbs, shrubs and young trees. Vegetation changes brought about by deer browsing are also detrimental to some vertebrate and invertebrate woodland fauna. Without appropriate management, deer populations will impose long-term changes on the composition of native woodlands. Available data suggest that densities of deer in upland habitats {{should be in the}} region of 4 – 7 per km 2 to ensure adequate regeneration and to protect sensitive flora and fauna. Further data are needed for lowland habitats. Recommendations for establishing effective deer management and tree protection measures are given. flowering plants are also now known to be susceptible to deer. Bluebells (Hyacynthoides non-scripta) and dog’s mercury (Mercurialis perennis) can be depleted by muntjac browsing[3, 4] and oxlips (Primula elatior) by red deer[5]. Muntjac also feed on early purple <b>orchids</b> (Orchis mascula), <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids</b> (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), wood anemones (Anemone nemorosa) and ladies smock (Cardamine pratensis), and reduce pollination and reproductive success in lords and ladies (Arum maculatum) [3, 4, 6]...|$|R
50|$|One field {{consists}} of unimproved rush pasture with {{species such as}} <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid,</b> marsh marigold and ragged robin. The River Yarty {{is also an important}} habitat, used by otter, kingfisher, dipper and golden-ringed dragonfly.|$|E
50|$|This ancient coppice with {{standards}} wood {{is mainly}} hornbeam, {{but it also has}} young oak and ash standards. The ground flora is rich and ancient, including <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid,</b> wood bitter-cress and the rare thin-spiked wood sedge.|$|E
50|$|The site {{is mainly}} grassland, {{with a variety}} of wild flowers such as the narrow-leaved water {{dropwort}} and <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid.</b> Invertebrates include Roesel's bush-crickets, shield bugs and skipper butterflies, and there are birds such as skylark and snipe.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} areas of {{woodland}} and grassland. The steeply sloping chalk meadow has {{many species of}} butterfly, including three scarce blue species, the Adonis, chalkhill and small blue. There are flowers such as <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> and fragrant <b>orchids.</b> Beech woodland above the chalk bank supports great spotted woodpeckers and great spotted woodpeckers, and lower woodland has beech and yews.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the finest}} areas of marshy {{grassland}} in Hertfordshire. It is at its best in late spring when it is carpetted with orchids. Blagrove Common {{is one of the}} few remaining areas of unimproved marshy grassland on poorly drained boulder clay. It is bisected by a stream and varies in wetness from marshy grassland to dry neutral grassland. The marshy areas are dominated by rushes and tufted hairs grass. Amongst these large numbers of early marsh, southern marsh and <b>common</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids</b> and a variety of their hybrids can be found. The grasslands have been maintained for several centuries by grazing. This form of management ensures that some species, such as orchids, survive instead of allowing the more vigorous grasses to out compete all other species. Traditional grazing on wet areas also produces muddy, trampled areas which are an important micro-habitat for some plants and invertebrates. The drier areas of the common support meadow fox tail grasses, common cat's ear and common sorrel among many other species. Winter Blagrove is alot quiter in the winter months but management work continues, primarily focusing on cutting and raking the dominant rush growth. Flocks of tits can be seen around the edge of the common, with the odd goldcrest or treecreeper amongst them. Kestrels often hunt over the common, perching on the overhead wires and searching the ground for voles and mice, which are common on the reserve. Buzzards can be heard and seen gliding over distant woodland togther with red kites. Summe...|$|R
