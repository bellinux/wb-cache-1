50|$|The Rhea County Courthouse is a {{historic}} county courthouse {{in the center of}} Dayton, the county seat of Rhea County, Tennessee. Built in 1891, it is famous as the scene of the Scopes Trial of July 1925, in which teacher John T. Scopes faced charges for including Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in his public school lesson. The trial became a <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> <b>titans</b> between the lawyers William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution and Clarence Darrow for the defense, and epitomizes the tension between fundamentalism and modernism {{in a wide range of}} aspects of American society. The courthouse, now also housing a museum devoted to the trial, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976.|$|E

50|$|Divination and {{information}} lead to confrontation. With Raimi disabled, Oran enraged, and Kamimura possessed, a true <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> <b>titans</b> is destined.After escaping their death, eluding {{the military and}} witnessing death of Raimi's coworker Sandra, Oran and Raimi look {{for a place to}} crash. They enter a small gnostic shop, where an Albino fortuneteller does a tarot reading for Raimi. The reading makes Raimi want to investigate the alley he found the eyeless vargrant. There, Raimi reminiscences about his previous encounter with Gregory, the newsstand vendor as Raimi and Oran investigate the alleged evil eye. As they are stripping down ads covering the eye, Raimi hears moans of Kamimura, whom he mistakes for the eyeless vagrant. After he helps him get up, Raimi and Kamimura reach Oran just in time for Oran to shed the last ad and reveal the evil eye which releases Goku from Kamimura's mental grasp and sends the monk into an insane rage. As Kamimura and Oran fight, Raimi figures that Kamimura is another piece of a puzzle. He manages to snap Kamimura back to his original self. After revealing that he has seen the eye before, Kamimura joins the Saints in their quest, much to Oran's chagrin.|$|E

The resurgence of the historical epic film in 2001 to 2011 is not mere coincidence, American cinema attempted to analyze, explain and justify the changes brought about by the post- 9 / 11 era. The historical epic film creates a common imagined past as well as it helps consolidate an American identity.

40|$|This eBook {{includes}} revised papers {{which were}} initially {{presented at the}} conference “ 2012 EUDO Dissemination Conference: The Euro Crisis and the State of European Democracy”, co-funded by the Lifelong Learning Programme, EACEA decision no. 2012 - 2718 / 001 - 001. The book is divided in five sections. The first two sections explore the diverse {{ways in which the}} institutional system of the European Union has been affected by the unfolding Euro crisis and the efforts to contain that crisis. The contributions look at the impact on the relations between the EU institutions (for example, was there an increase {{of the power of the}} intergovernmental institutions?), the innovations in EU decision-making (such as the ‘invention’ of reverse majority voting in the Council), the experiments with the use of soft law instruments and with greater differentiation (between the EU- 27 and sub-groups such as the EURO- 17), and the use of international agreements situated outside the EU legal framework, which were used to adopt the Fiscal Compact and the European Stability Mechanism. The third section looks specifically at the prominent but rather secretive and, democratically speaking, somewhat anomalous role played by the European Central Bank in containing the Euro crisis. In the fourth section, the focus of analysis shifts from the European to the national level. The contributions to that section examine political and institutional changes that are taking place at the national level, and the way in which national elites have tried to accommodate the new demands from ‘Europe’ or to influence the decisions taken in the European arena. The authors of the fifth section present contrasting views on how the crisis has affected the significance of European citizenship and the rights attached to it, as well as the attitudes of European citizens towards the European Union and towards each other.
