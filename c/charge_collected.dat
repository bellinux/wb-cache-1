[...] He rejected the terms capacity (capacitance) and capacious (capacitive) and their inverses incapacity and incapacious. [...] The terms current in his time for a capacitor were condenser (suggesting that the [...] "electric fluid" [...] could be condensed out) and leyden after the Leyden jar, an early form of capacitor, also suggesting some sort of storage. [...] Heaviside preferred the analogy of a mechanical spring under compression, hence his preference for terms that suggested a property of a spring. [...] This preference {{was a result of}} Heaviside following James Clerk Maxwell's view of electric current, or at least, Heaviside's interpretation of it. [...] In this view, electric current is a flow caused by the electromotive force and is the analogue of velocity caused by a mechanical force. [...] At the capacitor, this current causes a [...] "displacement" [...] whose rate of change is equal to the current. [...] The displacement is viewed as an electric strain, like a mechanical strain in a compressed spring. [...] The existence of a flow of physical charge is denied, as is the buildup of charge on the capacitor plates.

Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) [1] fabricated {{in a standard}} microelectronic technology provide an attractive solution for these demanding applications. The signal-to-noise ratio of MAPS can be increased by using in-pixel ampli ers. The compromise between speed, noise, gain and power consumption has to be achieved {{in the design of}} the ampli er. The charge collection ef ciency and total capacitance at the ampli er input is in uenced by the size of <b>charge</b> <b>collecting</b> diode. Therefore, in order to achieve better MAPS performances, both the geometry of the <b>charge</b> <b>collecting</b> diode and the ampli er design have to be considered in the optimization process.

The characterization measurements of the ampli ers fabricated in 0. 35 μm technology will be presented.

50|$|APD {{applicability}} and usefulness {{depends on}} many parameters. Two {{of the larger}} factors are: quantum efficiency, which indicates how well incident optical photons are absorbed and then used to generate primary charge carriers; and total leakage current, which {{is the sum of}} the dark current and photocurrent and noise. Electronic dark-noise components are series and parallel noise. Series noise, which is the effect of shot noise, is basically proportional to the APD capacitance, while the parallel noise is associated with the fluctuations of the APD bulk and surface dark currents. Another noise source is the excess noise factor, ENF. It describes the statistical noise that is inherent with the stochastic APD multiplication process.

5000|$|The terms {{elastance}} and elastivity were {{coined by}} Oliver Heaviside in 1886. [...] Heaviside coined {{a great many}} of the terms used in circuit analysis today, such as impedance, inductance, admittance, and conductance. Heaviside's terminology followed the model of resistance and resistivity with the -ance ending used for extensive properties and the -ivity ending used for intensive properties. The extensive properties are used in circuit analysis (they are the [...] "values" [...] of components) and the intensive properties are used in field analysis. Heaviside's nomenclature was designed to highlight the connection between corresponding quantities in field and circuit. [...] Elastivity is the intensive property of a material corresponding to the bulk property of a component, elastance. It is the reciprocal of permittivity.
