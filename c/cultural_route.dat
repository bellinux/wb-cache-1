40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of <b>cultural</b> <b>routes</b> {{is a valuable}} tool for intercultural dialogue at grass-roots level and contributes to social cohesion through the {{development of}} inspiring themes and participatory activities. At the same time they are an ideal way for the Council of Europe to put into action the values it promotes of democracy and human rights, including access to culture for all. The offer of various <b>cultural</b> <b>routes</b> at the European level is exceptionally rich, the choice of major <b>cultural</b> <b>routes</b> of Europe being defined by the basic criteria of the Council of Europe. The paper focuses on <b>cultural</b> <b>routes</b> development in Romania, as a valuable asset, having all required features and offering corresponding content, information and facilities to the benefit for both local businesses and tourists.

40|$|The <b>cultural</b> <b>routes</b> have a {{supranational}} {{comprehensive legislation}} {{and represent the}} cultural good more complete and heterogeneous: in fact, they are composed not only {{by a set of}} one or more material cultural goods and the landscape, but they are also expression of intangible cultural values and a “means” to promote the cultural exchange and the cultural diversity. This cultural heritage must be preserved through development policies and sustainable tourism, in order to maintain intact the cultural balance between environment, man and the same landscape. In this context, play an important role the supranational Organizations and their regulatory activities, but also the appropriate Institutions for the protection of <b>cultural</b> <b>routes,</b> which offer various conceptions of <b>cultural</b> <b>routes</b> and multiple safeguard instrument. At national level, the legislations in terms of cultural heritage of Italy and Spain present common aspects. In terms of <b>cultural</b> <b>routes,</b> the reconstruction and comparison of the national disciplines, and those of their respective local self-government, makes it possible to highlight important aspects of legislative development and criticality. The transnational <b>cultural</b> <b>routes</b> are now counted as a category of world cultural heritage. By virtue of the principles of European administrative law and of the supranational legislation, are proposed elements for a legal and administrative unitary configuration of this type of routes. ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>Cultural</b> <b>Route</b> of the Council of Europe is not {{necessarily}} a physical path to be walked through and can be made up of cultural stakeholders such as museums, municipalities or local governments clustered into one umbrella association. Being awarded the title <b>Cultural</b> <b>Route</b> of the Council of Europe opens the way to a larger visibility, network of cultural stakeholders or even funding. It {{should also be noted that}} the programme was launched by the Council of Europe and not the European Union, even though it contributes to it. As a result, the programme goes beyond the borders of the EU, and even Europe in general as some Routes go as far as North Africa or the Middle East.|$|E

40|$|Europe {{offers a}} wide variety of {{cultural}} itineraries that, crossing several regions or countries, provide a living example of the rich and impressive European common heritage. For more than two decades 24 of such itineraries have been jointly collaborating under the Council of Europe's (CoE) <b>Cultural</b> <b>Routes</b> Programme aimed at preserving the diversity of European culture and heritage, and to promote understanding of Europe's history. Today, when cultural heritage is more and more often viewed as a new form of good - cultural good, - methods of heritage management are changing to incorporate new elements, which could help local communities to draw more obvious benefits from their cultural legacy while preserving and maintaining its uniqueness. Often these elements come from tourism: a new kind of tourism, which is respectful of the environment, of the natural and cultural heritage and of the local traditions. This article offers an overview of the Study on the CoE <b>Cultural</b> <b>Routes</b> Impact on Tourism SMEs (Khovanova et al., 2011) that demonstrated how the need for implementing sustainable tourism management practices is growing within the CoE <b>cultural</b> <b>routes.</b> One of the breaking findings of the Study was that, even though founded on social and <b>cultural</b> principles, CoE <b>routes</b> today serve as a source of innovation, small business creation, local income generation, and cultural tourism products development. These potentials are now been reinforced by building in sustainable tourism elements in <b>cultural</b> <b>routes</b> management practices, and by bringing the benefits of ICT and digitalization, following the Study recommendations. The findings of the Study could also help cultural heritage managers and policy makers around the globe to better understand tourism potential of cultural heritage sites, while encouraging respectful and sustainable management approaches.
