50|$|WWF {{has called}} for radical reform of the fire service, which has been weakened, since 1981, by {{political}} interference in recruitment and promotion, bureaucratisation, the removal of fire-fighting responsibilities from the forestry service and abolition of the dasokommando, which is a Greek specialised fire-fighting unit. According to Konstantinos Liarikos, environmental programme director of WWF, part of the existing fire service needs to be especially dedicated to forest fire-fighting, and emphasis should be on suppression rather than prevention: the cost of hiring an Erickson Air-Crane Helitanker fire-fighting helicopter is 800,000 euros a season, and {{is equivalent to the}} cost of hiring 800 seasonal fire-fighters, which WWF claims would be more effective. In addition, <b>citizen</b> <b>awareness</b> programmes are needed to educated suburban residents about fire prevention and fire-fighting. For example, the connection of electric pumps to swimming pools to help residents to use water for dousing fires. Planting fire-resistant tree species in gardens, such as bay laurel, poplar, acacia and oak, can also help save homes.

30|$|Macharis and Kin [12] {{propose a}} {{classification}} called the 4 A’s of sustainable city distribution that clusters innovative concepts {{based on their}} primary intention: Awareness, Avoidance, Act and shift and Anticipation of new technologies. It {{could be argued that}} CL complies with all A’s. First, by involving a crowd of randomly united <b>citizens,</b> <b>awareness</b> is created of the challenges that last mile transportation and home delivery impose on the city. E-commerce and omnichannel retail, which integrates online and offline sales channels, stimulate a rising amount of individual parcels and delivery vans [17]. At the same time, altered mobility, demographic change and increasing employment reduce the possibility to successfully receive deliveries in person [28]. This ‘online shopping paradox’ has substantial consequences regarding environment and quality of life, yet it is unlikely that consumers take these into account when placing orders. CL enables consumers to observe the large quantity of parcels that circulates in the neighbourhood, city or region and the spatial opportunities of commuters that move between home and business every day.|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} done to assess the {{determinants}} of morbidity pattern, quality of life (QoL) and awareness of elderly about various government schemes and social security legislations. Materials and Methods: Data was collected by house to house survey among participants aged 60 years and above using a structured interview schedule. The QoL was assessed using Kannada version of WHOQOL-BREF instrument following language validation. Results: Mean age of 206 participants was 69. 6 ± 6. 7 years. Half of them were males and majority were graduates 54 (26. 2 %). Morbidity was present among 194 (94. 2 %) participants (95 % CI 89. 5 - 98. 9 %), most common being hypertension 96 (46. 6 %). Morbid conditions were seen more among less educated (P = 0. 007). Only 68 (33 %) were under medical insurance coverage, 17 (8. 3 %) were under old age government pension and 74 (35. 9 %) were under retirement pension scheme. Social relationships, psychological health and environmental domain scores were associated with socio-economic status. Social relationship domain score was significantly better among well educated participants and those without morbidities.
