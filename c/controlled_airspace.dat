5|$|Airspace {{is shared}} by CAT, {{military}} and GA users. It is divided into <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace,</b> in which aircraft must always be {{under the control of}} an air traffic controller, and uncontrolled airspace, in which aircraft can operate autonomously. Although GA flights can under certain conditions enter <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace,</b> they operate mainly outside of it.|$|E
5|$|Increases in {{the number}} of CAT operations, and {{in the number}} of {{airports}} they operate from, has resulted in a corresponding increase in Class A <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace.</b> Between 1997 and 2006 this area grew in size from 13 per cent of all airspace to 22 per cent nationally, and from 24 per cent to 43 per cent in airspace above England and Wales, leading to a perception within the GA community of being squeezed out. There are particular problems for GA around large airports, where Class A <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace</b> extends to ground level. The concentration of commercial operations and high demand for GA in the South East of England have also resulted in extensive areas of Class A <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace</b> there, which serve to channel uncontrolled GA operations through high-collision-risk hot spots.|$|E
5|$|Airspace: in many European countries, {{the growth}} of civil {{aviation}} is {{reducing the amount of}} uncontrolled airspace. In the U.S. new security requirements, and {{the growth of}} <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace</b> around cities, has also had some impact on where to fly.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after takeoff, TWA's Captain Gandy {{requested}} {{permission to}} ascend to 21,000 feet to avoid thunderheads that were forming near his flight path. As was the {{practice at the}} time, his request had to be relayed by a TWA dispatcher to air traffic control (ATC), as neither flight crew was {{in direct contact with}} ATC after departure. ATC denied the request; the two airliners would soon be reentering <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace</b> (the Red 15 airway running southeast from Las Vegas) and ATC had no means of providing the horizontal separation required between two aircraft at the same altitude.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{climbed to}} its assigned cruising altitude of 6,000 feet and left <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace.</b> The pilot kept {{in contact with}} ATC for information and advisory services. At 2359 h the controller noticed that the aircraft had not made its scheduled left turn toward Campbeltown. The controller asked the pilot to confirm his routing, and he advised the pilot that he was already west of his intended course. The pilot then made a sharp left turn to the southeast, followed by another to the southwest, toward Campbeltown. As the aircraft descended toward Campbeltown, {{it had not been}} on its approved course since it left the immediate vicinity of Glasgow.|$|E

25|$|United Airlines Flight 718, a Douglas DC-7 Mainliner named Mainliner Vancouver, and {{flown by}} Captain Robert Shirley, First Officer Robert Harms, and Flight Engineer Gerard Fiore, {{departed}} Los Angeles International Airport at 9:04am PST with 53 passengers and five crew members aboard (including two flight attendants), bound for Chicago's Midway Airport. Climbing to an authorized altitude of 21,000 feet, Captain Shirley flew under IFR in <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace</b> {{to a point}} northeast of Palm Springs, California, where he turned left toward a radio beacon near Needles, California, after which his flight plan was direct to Durango in southwestern Colorado. The DC-7, although still operating under IFR, was now, like the Constellation, flying in uncontrolled airspace.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{the beam}} {{is able to}} be {{minimized}} in other ways. On the ground, physical access is controllable (e.g., via fencing), and typical aircraft flying through the beam provide passengers with a protective metal shell (i.e., a Faraday Cage), which will intercept the microwaves. Other aircraft (balloons, ultralight, etc.) can avoid exposure by observing airflight control spaces, as is currently done for military and other <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace.</b> The microwave beam intensity at ground level {{in the center of}} the beam would be designed and physically built into the system; simply, the transmitter would be too far away and too small to be able to increase the intensity to unsafe levels, even in principle.|$|E
25|$|In July 2015, the Irish {{government}} revealed {{plans to}} purchase a ground-based long-range air surveillance radar system for the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) and Defence Forces {{to keep track of}} covert aircraft flying in Irish-controlled airspace, including military aircraft that do not file a flight plan and have their transponders switched off. Minister for Defence Simon Coveney said the increased capability would give better coverage of the Atlantic airspace over which the IAA has responsibility. The long-range surveillance radar is reported to cost €10 million, and is seen as a priority purchase to provide the civilian and military authorities with an improved competency in monitoring aerial incursions. Ireland is not a member of NATO, and thus does not benefit from integrated European military radar systems nor NATO equipment. The Irish Air Corps lacks a dedicated air intercept capability, and previous air incursions have seen the Royal Air Force respond to and escort unwelcome aircraft out of Irish <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace.</b>|$|E

500|$|<b>Controlled</b> <b>airspace</b> is {{essential}} for the provision of a known air traffic environment necessary for the safe operation of CAT. A CAA review found that [...] "mixing [...] operations with other users is considered undesirable, even untenable" [...] by commercial operators. However this position has resulted in extensive Class A <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace</b> with complex boundaries, including some running down to the ground, prohibiting VFR access to airspace, resulting in high numbers of GA flights operating close to the borders of <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace</b> who could not get formal receipt of an air traffic service. Coupled with pilot navigation errors, hundreds of airspace infringements have been recorded every year.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{control of}} American {{airspace}} {{continued to be}} split {{between the military and}} the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA, the federal agency in charge of air traffic control at the time). The CAA had no authority over military flights, which could enter <b>controlled</b> <b>airspace</b> with no warning to other traffic. The result was a series of near-misses and collisions involving civil and military aircraft, the latter often flying at much higher speeds than the former.
