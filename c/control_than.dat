Another guest was Atlantic Records vice-president Jerry Wexler, who previously had produced works for artists such as Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin. Wexler was interested in Nelson's music, so when Atlantic opened a country music division of their label, he offered Nelson a contract that gave him more creative <b>control</b> <b>than</b> his deal with RCA. When Nelson was released from his RCA contract, he signed with Atlantic for US$25,000 per year, becoming the label's first country artist.|$|E

The marriage temporarily secured the northern frontier of the Kingdom, and held out the prospect that a son of one of David's Mormaers could gain Orkney and Caithness for the Kingdom of Scotland. Thus, by the time Henry I died on 1 December 1135, David had more of Scotland under his <b>control</b> <b>than</b> ever before.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of <b>control</b> <b>than</b> was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E

5|$|Survival horror is a subgenre {{of video}} games {{inspired}} by horror fiction {{that focuses on}} survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience. Although combat {{can be part of}} the gameplay, the player is made to feel less in <b>control</b> <b>than</b> in typical action games through limited ammunition, health, speed and vision, or through various obstructions of the player's interaction with the game mechanics. The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game. Games make use of strong horror themes, like dark maze-like environments and unexpected attacks from enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{directors}} {{active in}} the Indies came from various backgrounds. Some, like The Teng Chun, Fred Young, and the Wongs, had been interested in film since their youth. Others, such as Njoo Cheong Seng and Andjar, had a background in theatre. Still others, including Albert Balink and Ismail, were journalists by trade. They were all men; {{the first woman to}} direct a film in the Indonesian archipelago, Ratna Asmara, made her debut after the Indies were dissolved. Between them, the 29men directed some 103films, at times working collaboratively; it was not unusual for them to take more than one role in production.

40|$|Aims To characterise the {{predominant}} species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. Methods 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease, 12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) populations were analysed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. Results Bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from <b>controls</b> <b>than</b> in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis/Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in <b>controls</b> <b>than</b> in patients with coeliac disease (p< 0. 05). Bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in <b>controls</b> <b>than</b> in patients with treated coeliac disease (p< 0. 01). Bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p< 0. 01). Bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease <b>than</b> in <b>controls.</b> Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. A higher LAB diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and <b>controls</b> <b>than</b> in patients with active coeliac disease. Weissella spp and Lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected in patients with treated coeliac disease <b>than</b> in <b>controls</b> and patients with active coeliac disease. Conclusions Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and LAB populations in the duodenum of Spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Killer immunoglobulin-like {{receptor}} (KIR) genes can {{regulate the}} activation of NK and T cells upon interaction with HLA class I molecules. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has {{been regarded as}} a multi-factorial disorder disease. Previous studies revealed that KIRs were involved in HCV and HIV infection or clearance. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the possibility of the inheritance of KIR genotypes and haplotypes as a candidate for susceptibility to persistent HBV infection or HBV clearance. The sequence specific primer polymerase chain reaction (SSP-PCR) was employed to identify the KIR genes and pseudogenes in 150 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 251 spontaneously recovered (SR) controls, and 412 healthy controls. The frequencies of genotype G, M, FZ 1 increased in CHB patients compared with healthy control subjects. The frequency of genotype AH was higher in SR <b>controls</b> <b>than</b> that in both CHB patients and healthy controls. The carriage frequencies of genotype G and AH were higher; while, the frequencies of AF and AJ were lower in SR <b>controls</b> <b>than</b> those in healthy control subjects. The frequency of A haplotype was lower, whereas, the frequency of B haplotype was higher in CHB patients and SR <b>controls</b> <b>than</b> those in healthy controls. In healthy controls, haplotype 4 was found lower compared with that in CHB patients and SR controls and the frequency of haplotype 5 was higher in SR <b>controls</b> <b>than</b> that in other two groups. Based on these findings, it seems that the genotypes M and FZ 1 are HBV susceptive genotypes; AH, on the other hand, may be protective genotypes that facilitate the clearance of HBV. It appears that th...|$|R

5|$|Although Poniatowski {{protested the}} First Partition of the Commonwealth (1772), he was {{powerless}} {{to do anything}} about it. He considered abdication, but decided against it. During the Partition Sejm of 1773–1775, in which Russia was represented by ambassador Otto von Stackelberg, with no help forthcoming from abroad and the armies of the partitioning powers occupying Warsaw to compel the Sejm by force of arms, no alternative was available save submission to their will. Eventually Poniatowski and the Sejm acceded to the partition treaty; at the same time, several other reforms were passed. The Cardinal Laws were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers. Royal power was restricted, as the king lost the power to give out titles, and positions of military officers, ministers and senators, the starostwo territories, and Crown lands would be awarded through an auction. The Sejm also created two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main governmental body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The partitioners intended the Council to be easier to <b>control</b> <b>than</b> the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of the}} Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it was a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. The new legislation was guaranteed by the Russian Empire, giving it another excuse to interfere in Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed.|$|E
5|$|Over {{half the}} red-backed fairywrens {{in an area}} {{can be found in}} pairs during the mating season. This is {{apparently}} a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. It is more difficult to maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds try to stay in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young. Paternity tests have shown that an older male with bright plumage has much more success in the mating season and can mate with more than one female. Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and makes more mating overtures towards females. A male with browner and less bright plumage or a younger male with bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating. Further, an unpaired male serves as a helper to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. When the male pairs his bill darkens, and this happens within three weeks. This is much easier to <b>control</b> <b>than</b> plumage, as moulting takes time and is controlled by seasonality. The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm {{also created}} two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main {{governmental}} body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The Council was intended by the partitioners {{to be an}} institution easier to <b>control</b> <b>than</b> the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of}} the Russian Empire. It was nonetheless a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. The Council, with committees (ministries) on Foreign Affairs, Treasury, Defense, Justice and the Interior (Police), was able to interpret existing laws in the sphere of administration, and provided the Commonwealth with a continuous governing body that operated between the Sejms and was not affected by the liberum veto. The Permanent Council was led by the king, had 36 members elected, half from each chamber of the Sejm, and ruled by majority vote (the king decided in case of a tie). The previously powerful ministers were placed under the control of the new council and supervised by the five parallel departments of the Council. The Council, in addition to its administrative duties, would present to the king three candidates for each nomination to the Senate and other main offices.|$|E
