40|$|Construction {{management}} competencies {{are essential}} to realise sound practices among and to realise optimum performance by, inter alia, emerging civil engineering contractors. Such competencies enable a clear focus on the business of construction and the management of projects, with increased efficiency and reduced costs as a benefit. The objective of the MSc (Built Environment) treatise study were to determine the current practices and performance of emerging civil engineering construction contractors operating in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropole. The descriptive method was adopted in the empirical study. The salient findings of the study are: most of the emerging civil engineering construction <b>contracting</b> <b>organisations</b> lack construction management competencies; construction resources are inappropriately managed leading to construction failures; most of the emerging civil engineering construction <b>contracting</b> <b>organisations</b> lack adequate supervision resulting to poor workmanship; {{there is a shortage}} of skilled labour amongst emerging civil engineering construction contractors; procurement processes are inappropriate leading to under capacitated emerging civil engineering construction <b>contracting</b> <b>organisations</b> being awarded contracts; most emerging civil engineering construction <b>contracting</b> <b>organisations</b> lack the requisite aptitude for construction; there is a lack of capacity at all management levels of emerging civil engineering construction organisations in managing the business of construction and that of projects; the nine functions of organisations are not comprehensively represented, and self-ratings indicate inadequacy relative to the management function of control, and relative to certain activities of the organising function. Conclusions include that emerging civil engineering construction <b>contracting</b> <b>organisations</b> need to be comprised of technical teams that possess adequate competencies and that use the construction technology to its full use enabling their organisations to stay abreast of their competitors. Recommendations that can contribute towards improving the status quo include: formal civil engineering and construction management education, resources must be present and training should be promoted throughout the industry at all levels of management to ensure proper supervision and correct use of adequately trained labour, skilled or semi-skilled, incapacitated emerging civil engineering construction contractors should be awarded contracts through appropriately and structured procurement procedures, adequate aptitude in construction should be promoted and enhanced in order to realise conceptualisation and visualisation capabilities, comply with legislation, maintain records and communicate using state of the art technology, optimally manage the finances, have the requisite resources and undertake the work efficiently, interact with the respective publics, and market the organisation to ensure sustainability thereo...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim was {{to address}} {{behaviour}} that led to inappropriate processing in a small design and build <b>contracting</b> <b>organisation</b> that employs direct labour. The objective was to reduce process waste and improve the value delivered to clients. This formed {{part of a larger}} knowledge transfer project (KTP) to improve performance on construction sites through the application of lean thinking. Methodology: Action research was used to identify and bring about change within the <b>contracting</b> <b>organisation.</b> The method was applied to live construction projects in the social housing sector in the greater London area. The intervention was to raise the awareness of site personnel to the importance of finishing tasks through informal discussions and visual management techniques. Findings: Raised awareness of the importance of finishing work to allow other trades to follow on unimpeded led to significant improvements in the quality and flow of work. This helped to contribute to significant savings in time and cost. Practical implications: This applied research is practical and cost effective to apply to live projects managed by small and medium sized contracting organisations. Academic implications: the observations made reveal a form of waste in construction that has not been widely recognised in the literature on Lean. Research limitations: Findings relate to a small SME with directly employed labour, therefore the findings have limited applicability. Further applied research is required to determine the generalisation of the approach/findings to organisations that subcontract their labour Originality/value: Provides a unique insight into the practical application of lean thinking tools and process improvement...|$|E
40|$|Contractor {{selection}} {{is a crucial}} element in construction procurement (Drew & Skitmore 1993, p. 363).

This paper reviews a range of international tender processes, highlighting the ethical features that govern these guidelines. The paper {{is part of a}} project to develop ethical guidelines for procurement for major contracting authorities. By reviewing tender guidelines we are able to gain an indication of the type of ethical standards reserved for procurement. The need for good business ethics in the tender process stems from the belief that ‘good ethical practice’ is critical in meeting organisational goals (Vee & Skitmore 2003, p. 125). Hence, an ethical tender process will select ethical contractors who are viewed as beneficial to the contracting authority...|$|E

40|$|In 2007, {{following}} continued {{dissatisfaction with}} the lack of cost certainty on publicly funded projects, the Irish Government introduced the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF). This framework had stated strategic objectives of achieving greater cost certainty at contract award stage; better value for money at all stages during project delivery and, more efficient end-user delivery. The framework, in particular, sought to rebalance risk, so that there was an optimal transfer of risk to the contracting authority and the contractor through the implementation of fixed price contracts. Coinciding with the introduction of the CWMF, there was significant debate around the introduction of Building Information Modelling (BIM) internationally, in assisting with the delivery of greater efficiency and, cost certainty of Public Works Contacts (PWCs). In this paper the authors’ aim was to investigate how best to align the virtues of BIM methodologies with the stated aims of the CWMF.

40|$|Abstract. Finland {{is divided}} into {{municipalities}} that form the local selfgovernment. The basic duty of the municipalities is to provide the well-being and welfare to its inhabitants. The Finnish municipalities are providing services both in-house and from private sources. Technical services can be developed by evolving the work of own organization, in cooperation with other municipalities, or by contracting out. The client-producer model is increasing in the in-house production. The most contracted-out tasks are services of special equipments and elevators, waste management and maintenance of electrical systems, and the less contracted-out are cleaning and maintenance of outdoor areas. The reasons for outsourcing property and facilities services are insuffi ciencies in the own resources, lack of special know-how, lower price, and the fashion trend of privatising in the public sector. The main obstacles for using contracted services are the running resources in the <b>contracting</b> <b>organisation,</b> the undeveloped service market in the area, the fear that total outsourcing may give the monopoly to the service provider, etc. 3. 1 The Self-government of Finnish Municipalities The whole area of Finland {{is divided into}} 446 municipalities that form the local government.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry is highly fragmented {{compared with other}} manufacturing industries. The degree of this fragmentation is unparalleled in any other sector with significant impact on productivity and performance. Many research studies have developed and proposed a number of integrated process models. Unfortunately, {{they are unable to}} formalise how communication and information exchange within the construction process can be achieved, without duplication or lost in quality. A move away from the traditional sequential process to reciprocal interdependency processes no doubt place heavy demand on communication and information flow. This problem is widely acknowledged and many of the proposed IT solutions are less practicable to be attractive to practitioners in the industry. Any IT-dependent solution must start with optimisation and better uses of the readily available IT- hard- and software.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough UniversityThe construction industry is facing ever more challenging targets to reduce {{the environmental impact of}} new-build and refurbishment projects. The construction industry has failed to adopt renewable energy technologies (RETs) into mainstream construction projects; however, this aspect of the construction challenge needs addressing by large contractors. This thesis has established {{that there is a need}} to educate contractor personnel in the application and integration of RETs into construction projects to ensure that the construction industry can preserve its legacy for future generations. In order to improve the construction industry s use of renewable energy in building projects, it was necessary to reassess how the industry viewed energy. Contracting organisations have a diverse workforce, a fact established through a company-based desk study, workshops, interviews and surveys; this guided the direction of the project to satisfy the aims and objectives. The initial research findings enabled development of a strategy to improve RET knowledge within a UK <b>contracting</b> <b>organisation.</b> This research has developed trialled and tested a training programme aimed at educating construction professionals on the application of RETs that are relevant to new-build construction projects, and at improving knowledge sharing within a <b>contracting</b> <b>organisation.</b> Training material has been developed that includes six RET handbooks, a sustainability workshop incorporating RETs, an e-learning suite of online modules designed to suit a range of construction disciplines from designers to site-based staff. In addition, the research improved business practice through supporting knowledge share across all business units in addition to identifying the benefits of post-occupancy evaluation. The research has impacted the sponsoring organisation on several business elements including creation of a new business unit to assess completed projects in order to inform design and construction on future projects leading towards improved knowledge management on RETs. The e-learning component uses a combination of graphical imagery, audio voice-overs, knowledge-checks and assessment gathered from active construction projects to enable employees to engage in knowledge and experience sharing on a project-by-project basis, and organisational learning through case studies and post-occupancy evaluation of completed projects. Feedback received from the pilot study of the training materials has been encouraging and positive. While further research is required to measure the long-term effect of the initiative on the workforce population, a six month review suggested that a refresher course is required bi-annually to ensure the workforce score consistent results in the assessment and to update the training with new project experience to share within the organisation. The wider impact on the industry is to showcase the potential learning benefits of post-occupancy evaluation (POE) to contractors and the industry as a whole. The research has highlighted typical industry practice within a contracting organisations regarding knowledge sharing within the company and has demonstrated the improvement on employee knowledge after introduction of a training initiative utilising POE (typically a consultant tool) during the construction phase to prevent re-inventing the wheel. Through regularly and collectively sharing information and project experience, it is envisaged that the full range of contractor disciplines will have increased interaction to ensure all perspectives are accommodated during the design, construction and facility management phases of a building s life cycle...|$|E

40|$|For {{the last}} ten years, Computers have been used {{extensively}} {{in the development and}} procurement of construction projects. This is due to the relatively cheap hardware and software and most importantly the availability of skilful engineers and technicians to use computers effectively and efficiently. Construction site planning and management, however, is largely paper driven and computers are used for administration work rather than planning and managing the process. This paper describes a collaborative research study being undertaking between the University of Teesside and an international <b>contracting</b> <b>organisation</b> based in the UK. The prime objective of the research is to analyse and develop a formalised construction process model with integrated Information Technology Tools (ITT) as enablers for productivity and performance improvement of the site management processes. Other objectives are: to develop an understanding of the production processes (managing type contracts) and identify key areas in which computers can be used as enabling tools to improve and stream line the processes. In order to achieve the objective a number of tasks have been set, these were: identifying current processes using semi-structured interview; map out processes using IDEF 0; benchmark processes and identify key areas in which computer can be used; and development and implementation of an IT based methodology to be used in managing the process. The paper concludes that the one of the major areas within the production process, which could enormously benefit from IT, is change orders due to design change, client variation, etc. The paper discusses the development of an IT based tool for site planning and change order management as a first phase of the project...|$|E
40|$|The {{outcomes}} of the construction projects can be evaluated in numerous ways. One method is to measure the satisfaction of participants as represented by the differences between their expectations and perceptions. This measurement is used widely in construction as it promises benefits, such as the improvement of product delivery, and enhances services quality by identifying some necessary changes. Commonly satisfaction measurement is gauged by evaluating the level of client satisfaction of construction performance. The measurement of customer satisfaction on the other hand, {{is based on the}} quality of the end product. This evaluation is used to encourage contractors to improve their performance to a required level and to ensure that the projects are delivered as expected- in terms of time, budget and quality. Several studies of performance measurement have indicated that contractor performance is still not satisfactory, as the outcome delivered is not as required (because of cost overruns, time overruns or because it is generally unsatisfactory). This drawback may be due to the contractors’ lack of expertise, motivation and/or satisfaction. The measurement of performance based on contractor satisfaction levels is still new and very few studies have yet taken place in the construction industry. This paper examines how the characteristics of a <b>contracting</b> <b>organisation</b> – namely its experience in the industry, background, past performance, size of organisation and financial stability- may influence its satisfaction levels with regards to project performance. Previous literature reviews and interviews are used as research tools in the preliminary investigation. The outcome is expected to present a basic understanding of contractor satisfaction measurement and its potential for improving the performance of project outcomes. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} increasing efficiency {{and effectiveness of}} construction projects by reducing non-value adding activities from the contracting process and benefiting from repetitive nature of projects. The construction industry in general suffers from low productivity growth and processes that contain {{a considerable amount of}} waste and thus companies have lately begun to invest in developing their execution process in addition to the outcome. The study focuses in operations executed in pre-construction phase as most costs and objectives are determined before construction begins and thus efficiency and effectiveness can also be influenced significantly at that stage. The empirical part of the research was executed as a qualitative case study. The case organisation of this study is a Finnish municipal <b>contracting</b> <b>organisation</b> that operates in the construction industry. The study also included benchmarking of other organisations’ processes. In total 20 semi-structured were conducted for data collection. The research identifies that efficiency of project-based production is highly dependent of several actors that are often included into projects. Thus, people also affect process development practices and in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness of a contracting process, all project team members and stakeholders have to be motivated to eliminate waste and develop the process continuously. In general waste is generated if the actors don’t share objectives or the collaboration isn’t effective. These issues can be addressed with successful project network management. Also it was found out that the preparatory work done with stakeholders prior to construction design sets a basis for an efficient process. In addition, the study concludes that recurrent nature of projects can be exploited by standardising the project network and transferring people from project to project, replicating process and solutions to a certain extent to subsequent projects and creating bids so that suppliers can anticipate realising economies of repetition...|$|E
