The fine nature of the bubbles (0.3 to 0.5mm in diameter) gives them enhanced carrying capabilities for fine mineral particles. Fine bubbles also improve the separation of minerals, as they intensify {{the difference in the}} flotation kinetics of the valuable minerals from the gangue minerals, thus allowing higher grade <b>concentrates</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> produced.|$|R

50|$|Dewatering is an {{important}} process in mineral processing. The purpose of dewatering <b>is</b> <b>to</b> remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density. This is done {{for a number of}} reasons, specifically, to enable ore handling and <b>concentrates</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transported easily, allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue. The water extracted from the ore by dewatering is recirculated for plant operations after being sent to a water treatment plant. The main processes that are used in dewatering include dewatering screens such as Sepro-Sizetec Screens, sedimentation, filtering, and thermal drying. These processes increase in difficulty and cost as the particle size decreases.|$|R
40|$|Use of {{allogeneic}} {{blood products}} to treat pediatric trauma may be challenged, particularly {{in relation to}} safety. We report successful treatment {{of a child with}} severe abdominal and pelvic injuries with preemptive fibrinogen supplementation followed by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) -guided, goal-directed hemostatic therapy. Fibrinogen concentrate was administered (total dose: 2 g), while transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelet concentrate was avoided. Activated partial thromboplas-tin time was prolonged and Quick values were low but ROTEM clotting time values remained normal, therefore, no thrombin-generating drugs were considered necessary. This case shows the potential for hemostatic treatment with coagulation factor <b>concentrates</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> pediatric trauma...|$|R

30|$|Here, it {{is worth}} {{discussing}} which functional states of platelets <b>are</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> maintained during storage for subsequent preparation of platelet <b>concentrates</b> (<b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for regenerative therapy). There {{is no doubt that}} the functional states observed in freshly isolated platelets are the best for preparation of platelet concentrates and for their best clinical performance. Nevertheless, given that platelet <b>concentrates</b> <b>are</b> expected <b>to</b> provide significant amounts of growth factors and fibrin(ogen) at implantation sites, stored platelets are not necessarily expected to function as fully as fresh ones (e.g., in terms of aggregation). Rather, stored platelets <b>are</b> expected not <b>to</b> lose growth factors during the storage period, while coagulation factors, especially those involved in the endogenous coagulation cascade, should maintain their activities to convert and polymerize fibrinogen to form well cross-linked fibrin fibers.|$|R

Likewise, the application of basic mineral processing techniques, such as magnetic separation, integrated where necessary with flotation, showed that the beneficiated products of the same granite waste as well as of road tunnelling waste should find a ready market in the ceramics industry...|$|R

50|$|This popularity, however, was short-lived. Significant {{maintenance}} difficulties appeared, {{particularly with}} uneven forces wear on the crosshead guides. The two cylinders <b>were</b> supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proportioned</b> so as <b>to</b> do equal work (with the low pressure being three {{times larger than}} the high); but since the steam passed between the low- and high-pressure cylinder is always expanded, even before cutoff, the force produced in the low-pressure cylinder varies differently from that in the high-pressure cylinder. The complex valve assembly and the starter valve also led to increased maintenance costs. The introduction of the superheater further increased efficiency and made it much easier to maintain.|$|R

Particular attention <b>is</b> paid <b>to</b> the central regions of the cluster, and it is found that the dark matter can <b>be</b> sufficiently <b>concentrated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistent with the high central mass surface densities for moderate-redshift clusters from their gravitational lensing properties...|$|R

40|$|Cork {{processing}} wastewater is a {{very complex}} mixture of vegetal extracts and has, among other natural compounds, a very high content of phenolic/tannic colloidal matter that is responsible for severe environmental problems. In the present work, the concentration of this wastewater by nanofiltration was investigated with the aim of producing a cork tannin <b>concentrate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> utilized in tanning. Permeation results showed that the permeate fluxes are controlled by both osmotic pressure and fouling/gel layer phenomena, leading to a rapid decrease of permeate fluxes with the concentration factor. The rejection coefficients <b>to</b> organic matter <b>were</b> higher than 95 %, indicating that nanofiltration has a very good ability <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> the tannins and produce a permeate stream depleted from organic matter. The cork tannin concentrate obtained by nanofiltration and evaporation had total solids concentration of 34. 8 g/l.
