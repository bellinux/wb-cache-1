2500|$|By way of exception, {{alternative}} remedies to {{compensatory damages}} are available {{depending on the}} contract's nature. If damages would be an inadequate remedy, for instance, because the subject matter was a unique painting, {{or a piece of}} land, or was to deliver petrol during an oil crisis, a court may compel literal or specific performance of the contract's terms. It can also compel a defendant to refrain from actions that would continue a breach of contract. Injunctions are discretionary remedies, and so they are not awarded in cases where it might cause hardship, like compelling <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> when it would mean an unexpectedly disabled inhabitant would lose her home. Additionally, the courts have, at least since the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, refused to grant specific performance of contracts involving personal services. This is part of a more general principle that two (potentially hostile) parties to litigation should not be made to work in a long term relationship. In Cooperative Insurance Ltd v Argyll Ltd although a shop broke its contract with a shopping centre to keep its business operating, and actual performance was important to keep flagship businesses and so attract more customers to the centre generally, specific performance was not granted because compelling a potentially loss making business to keep operating was draconian and probably not capable of being policed by the court. No award can be made which punishes, or makes an example of a defendant, even for a cynical and calculated breach of contract. However, in limited situations, a claimant may succeed in a claim for restitution of the contract breaker's gains, as is routinely available in cases involving trustees or other fiduciaries who profit from transactions where they have a conflict of interest. In the leading case, Attorney General v Blake a former secret service agent's profits from book sales, which recounted government information in breach of Blake's employment contract, were stripped. While Lord Nicholls stated, other than compensatory damages are not an adequate remedy, that [...] "no fixed rules can be prescribed" [...] and their Lordships were eager to not hamper the development of the law, the cases where such awards have been made in contract have all involved some quasi-proprietary element. In an earlier case, Wrotham Park Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd, Brightman J awarded a percentage of gains resulting from building a lot of homes in breach of a restrictive covenant, based on a sum that the parties would have been likely to contract for had they struck a bargain. More recently in Experience Hendrix LLC v PPX Enterprises Inc Mance LJ held that a percentage of profits made by PPX breaching the intellectual property rights on songs by Jimi Hendrix would have to be paid up. So if {{in the course of a}} contract one party is in a position to take advantage of another's rights without their fully informed consent, a restitutionary remedy can be awarded.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} if a transfer restriction in a <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> real <b>property</b> for consideration is legally binding. In doctrine the legal situation is described as unclear. It will also be investigated if the restriction is binding {{in relation to the}} acquirer´s creditors and in relation to a new owner <b>of</b> the <b>property.</b> A transfer restriction in a <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> real <b>property</b> for consideration is legally binding between the parties and in relation to a new owner <b>of</b> the <b>property.</b> Even though the restriction is binding between the parties and in relation to a new owner, it is not binding in relation to the acquirer´s creditors. The Supreme Court has stated that it is a general legal principle that a transfer restriction in a conveyance for consideration is not binding in relation to the acquirer´s creditors. In this thesis it will also be argued that the legal situation is inconsequent. The reason for the inconsistency is that a restriction which stipulates a pre-emption right in a <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> real <b>property</b> for consideration is not legally binding. A pre-emption right and a transfer restriction mean the same thing for the acquirer. Both conditions limit the acquirer´s right to transfer the property...|$|R

50|$|In 1685 the {{application}} of Saul Brown (originally Saul Pardo) to trade at retail was denied, as was also that of the Jews for liberty to exercise their religion publicly. That they did so privately in some definite place of worship would appear {{from the fact that}} a map of New York, dated 1695, shows the location of a Jewish synagogue on Beaver Street, also that Saul Brown was the minister, and that the congregation comprised twenty families. Five years later the site of the synagogue was so well known that in a <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> the premises were referred to as a landmark. In 1710 the minister of the congregation, Abraham de Lucena, was granted exemption from civil and military service by reason of his ministerial functions, and reference is made to the enjoyment of the same privileges by his predecessors. The minutes of the Congregation Shearith Israel of New York begin in 1729, when it was located in Mill Street, and refer to records dating back as far as 1706. This congregation established on Mill Street, in 1730, on a lot purchased two years before, the first synagogue in the future United States.|$|E

For a full appreciation of charters as sources, however, {{it is necessary to}} study their formal features (or 'diplomatic'). All charters in this period relating to the <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> had an address at the beginning and a list of witnesses at the end (in the 'testing clause') sandwiching an account of what the charter was about. This middle section included the 'disposition', in which the transfer of property (or its renewal or confirmation) was noted, and the 'holding clause' recording the terms on which the property was to be held. Because these elements were routine and became formulaic their detail can too easily be regarded as rather arcane and be overlooked.

40|$|A {{significant}} re-interpretation of {{the language}} of giving and granting in Scottish charters during the period from the death of King Malcolm III to the death of King Alexander III, based on the analysis of the diplomatic of over 1300 royal charters. The research stems from work done in relation to the AHRC project, The Paradox of Medieval Scotland 1093 - 1286. The most important insight is that the use of the verb dare established the subject as the donor of the property in question, {{whether or not he was}} historically the original donor, thus making him legally responsible for warranting the gift should it be challenged by an other party. Scottish charters of ‘confirmation’, previously viewed as inconsistent in their use of dare, can now be interpreted as absolutely precise in their use of technical dispositive language.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the use (and non-use) of list price {{information in the}} process of marketing commercial real estate. As far as we are aware, this has not been addressed in the literature. While housing market research suggests that list prices can serve as a strong anchor and/or signal, list price information is included in less than one-third of the commercial property sales and is less likely to be included as part of the sellers’ offering information for larger multi-tenant properties. Given the potentially powerful effect of list prices (first offers) on outcomes, the non-use of list price information is a puzzle. We speculate that the limited use of list prices {{may be due to the}} sellers’ interests in both maintaining their informational advantage and not truncating higher than expected offers, especially during periods of economic growth or with more complex properties. Using a two-stage selection correction model, we find that office properties which provide list price information are, on average, associated with lower price outcomes (ceteris paribus) and that these outcomes vary by price cohort and economic condition. It is important to note, however, that while these findings identify a correlation, they do not necessarily imply causation (i. e., that the use of list prices ‘cause’ transaction prices to be lower). Our results support the notion that asymmetric information and signaling (i. e., the <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> and/or seller information that may affect the likelihood of sale) play a dominant role in explaining the sellers’ strategic non-use of list price information in the commercial property market...|$|E
