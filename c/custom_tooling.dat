40|$|The work {{presented}} here advances {{the field of}} Additive Manufacturing using direct write processes. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a broad set of processes that apply material, layer by layer to produce an object. Traditionally these processes {{have been used for}} rapid prototyping in industry. AM process are valued for their ability to produce objects quickly without <b>custom</b> <b>tooling</b> allowing for small volume production runs and the generation of custom products in a cost effective way. They are also valued for their ability to produce shapes of geometric complexity too difficult or too expensive for other processes to produce. Direct write processes allow for the widest range of material to be additively manufactured and are used from fields as diverse as bio-fabrication to zinc-air battery fabrication. In this thesis I have developed techniques and materials which allow AM to be applied to the field of food, foam, and actuator production. The work on food production focuses on processes and additives which allow grains and proteins to be shape stable through traditional cooking processes. It also expands upon how to develop a parametric design space for a food item allowing its nutritional content to be customized. The work on foam production studies how viscous thread instability can be induced in a direct write system to produce complex foamed structures implicitly through the pathing processes. This is a new and distinct method of producing foam objects which allows DW systems to product foams on a smaller scale than traditional explicit design methods. It also allows for the production of structures with a highly tunable elastic modulus. This property was used to develop a needle injection simulator. The work on the production of actuators lead {{to the development of a}} novel class of actuator. Electrically Active Hydraulic Solids (EAHS) are a combination of conductive elements, phase change material and elastomer which can be shaped using direct write, injection molding, and cutting techniques. These new actuators self-heat using electrical current and can generate high forces. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a methodology for fixturing, scanning, and orienting additively manufactured (AM) metal parts prior to finishing operations using {{a process called}} CNC-RP (rapid prototyping), which is a subtractive rapid machining method that employs the concept of sacrificial supports. AM has enabled the manufacturing of complicated designs in a layer-based fashion but often produces parts with inadequate surface roughness and/or dimensional control. Subtractive manufacturing (SM) techniques typically fabricate parts with overall better surface roughness and feature accuracy but require fixtures and <b>custom</b> <b>tooling</b> for each part design. Combining the two technologies of additive and subtractive manufacturing to create metal parts would allow the design flexibility of additive while simultaneously enabling the accuracy and finish of subtractive. However, the process of locating components when two processes are involved can be challenging. Solutions to this challenge have been applied to the metal casting industry {{in the form of}} custom fixtures, but the fixtures made for these finishing operations are intended for high volumes of a single part; thus, these fixtures are too expensive to justify for the small batch sizes made through additive manufacturing. Through non-contact scanning, a set of algorithms built into a localization software program identifies the location and orientation of a part secured within the fixture and outputs this identification {{in the form of a}} position vector. These algorithms also yield the angular rotations required to align the part 2 ̆ 7 s current position vector to the ideal computer aided design (CAD) model position vector in preparation for CNC-RP. Another program was developed to determine the finite rotations of the A- and B-axis when part length is taken into consideration. These rotations were physically implemented with a fixture hardware element. Process capability metrics were employed to validate this method. For both axes, parts could be produced within tolerance only after this method was employed (Cp and Cpk values greater than 1. 0 are “acceptable”); however A-axis correction fell short with a Cpk value of 0. 985, but tighter process control and/or more accurate equipment may resolve this issue. Thus, this thesis provides a feasible methodology to combine additive manufacturing and CNC-RP subtractive manufacturing...|$|E
