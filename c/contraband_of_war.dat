2500|$|Amsterdam now started {{pushing a}} special embassy to England that would {{negotiate}} a treaty of friendship with Charles II and a defensive alliance against third-party aggression.

The very generous gift to Charles at first seemed to have the desired effect.|$|R
25|$|The war {{provided}} an opportunity for large numbers of slaves to escape to Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Federal army considered escaped slaves to be <b>contraband,</b> or spoils <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> Some enlisted in the Federal army {{as part of the}} United States Colored Troops. Both the Federal and Confederate armies impressed some men into labor gangs, repairing railroads and bridges. Without the support of their spouses or former owners, women and children suffered greatly. Slave families endured depredation not only by raiding Union and Confederate soldiers, but also by partisan guerrillas, who were the most feared as they were the most likely to be violent. Reaching Union-held territory was not a guarantee of freedom, however. A slave named Preston, fleeing from Greenbrier county was arrested and placed in the Mason county jail on June 4, 1862, just by the Ohio river.|$|R
25|$|On May 1, 1862, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler, with {{an army of}} 5,000 men, {{occupied}} the city of New Orleans without resistance. Butler was a former Democratic party official, lawyer, and state legislator. General Butler {{was one of the}} first Major Generals of Volunteers of the Civil War appointed by Abraham Lincoln. He had gained glory as a Massachusetts state militia general who had anticipated the war and carefully prepared his six militia regiments for the conflict. At the start of hostilities he immediately marched to the relief of Washington, D.C., and despite a lack of orders had occupied and restored order to Baltimore, Maryland. As a reward Butler was made commander of Fortress Monroe, on the Virginia Peninsula. There he gained further political renown as the first to practice confiscation of fugitive slaves as <b>contraband</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> This practice was made a later policy of war by Congress. Due to these and other astute political maneuvers, Butler had been chosen to command the army expedition to New Orleans. Because of his lack of military experience and military success, many were happy to see him go.|$|E
2500|$|While {{in command}} at Fort Monroe, Butler {{declined}} {{to return to}} their owners fugitive slaves who had come within his lines. [...] He argued that Virginians considered them to be chattel property, and that they could not appeal to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 because of Virginia's secession. [...] Furthermore, slaves used as laborers for building fortifications and other military activities could be considered <b>contraband</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> [...] It was later made standard Union Army policy to not return fugitive slaves.|$|E
2500|$|After secession, the Union {{maintained}} its control over Fort Monroe in Hampton {{on the coast}} of Southern Virginia. Escaped slaves rushed to the area, hoping for protection from the Confederate Army. (Even more quickly, the town's White residents fled to Richmond.) General Benjamin Butler set a precedent for Union forces on May 24, 1861, when he refused to surrender escaped slaves to Confederates claiming ownership. Butler declared the slaves <b>contraband</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> and allowed them to remain with the Union Army. By July 1861, there were 300 [...] "contraband" [...] slaves working for rations at Fort Monroe. By the end of July there were 900, and General Butler appointed Edward L. Pierce as Commissioner of Negro Affairs.|$|E
50|$|Under {{international}} law, {{the citizens}} of neutral nations are entitled to trade, at their own risk, with any or all powers engaged in war. No duty to restrain contraband trade is imposed on the neutral governments, but no neutral governments {{has the right to}} interfere on behalf of citizens whose property is seized by one belligerent if it is in transit to another. The penalty traditionally imposed by belligerents on neutral carriers engaged in commercial traffic with the enemy consists of confiscation of cargo. By the Declaration of London, it was extended to include condemnation of the carrying vessel if more than half the cargo was <b>contraband.</b> The right <b>of</b> <b>warring</b> nations to sink neutral ships transporting contraband is not recognized in international law, but the practice was initiated by Germany in World War I and was often resorted to by the Axis Powers in World War II.|$|R

The additional barracks would house the old, disabled, women, children and orphans. Jacobs was sent to Alexandria to distribute donations among these people.|$|R

2500|$|Butler, a {{successful}} trial lawyer, {{served in the}} Massachusetts legislature as an antiwar Democrat and as {{an officer in the}} state militia. [...] Early in the Civil War he joined the Union Army, where he was noted for his lack of military skill, and his controversial command of New Orleans, which brought him wide dislike in the South and the [...] "Beast" [...] epithet. [...] He helped create the legal idea of effectively freeing fugitive slaves by designating them as <b>contraband</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> in service of military objectives, which led to a political groundswell in the North which included general emancipation and the end of slavery as official war goals. [...] His commands were marred by financial and logistical dealings across enemy lines, some of which probably took place with his knowledge and to his financial benefit.|$|E
2500|$|Admiral of the Fleet Sir Alexander Milne, 1st Baronet, GCB (10 November 1806 [...] 29 December 1896) was a Royal Navy officer. As {{a captain}} on the North America and West Indies Station he was {{employed}} capturing slave-traders and carrying out fishery protection duties. He {{served as a}} Junior Naval Lord under both Liberal and Conservative administrations and {{was put in charge}} of organising British and French transports during the Crimean War. He became Commander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies Station and in this role he acted with diplomacy, especially in response to the Trent Affair on 8 November 1861 during the American Civil War, when the USS San Jacinto, commanded by Union Captain Charles Wilkes, intercepted the British mail packet RMS Trent and removed, as <b>contraband</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> two Confederate diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell. He became First Naval Lord in the third Derby–Disraeli ministry in July 1866 and in this role took advantage of the Government's focus on spending reduction to ask fundamental questions about naval strategy. He again became First Naval Lord in the first Gladstone ministry in November 1872, remaining in office under the second Disraeli ministry and identifying the critical need for trade protection at times of War and demanding new cruisers to protect British merchant shipping.|$|E
2500|$|On November 8, 1861, the Union {{naval ship}} , {{under the command}} of Capt. Charles Wilkes, intercepted the British steamer , {{captured}} and put into U.S. port custody two Confederate diplomats James M. Mason and John Slidell. The northern people and press were in favor of the capture; however, there was concern that the British would use this as grounds {{to go to war with}} the United States. The British government dispatched 8,000 British troops on the Canada–US border and efforts were made to strengthen the British fleet. Sec. Seward believed that Mason and Slidell were <b>contraband</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> [...] Sen. Sumner, however, believed that the men did not qualify as war contraband, since they were unarmed, and that their release with an apology by the U.S. government was appropriate. [...] In the Senate, Sumner suppressed open debate in order to save Lincoln's administration from embarrassment. [...] On December 25, 1861, at Lincoln's invitation, Sumner read to Lincoln's Cabinet letters he received from prominent British political figures, including Cobden, Bright, Gladstone, and the Duke of Argyll. [...] The letters provided critical information on political sentiment in Britain and supported the envoys' return to the British. [...] "One war at a time" [...] was Lincoln's response; he then quietly but reluctantly ordered the release of the Confederate captives to British custody and apologized for their capture. [...] After the Trent Affair, Sen. Sumner's reputation improved among conservative Northerners.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The sale <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> tobacco {{allows for}} tobacco tax evasion, which can {{undermine}} {{the effectiveness of}} tobacco tax policies in {{reducing the number of}} smokers. Estimates of the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> vary widely as do the methods used to measure the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> being smoked. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> use in two different jurisdictions. Methods A cross-sectional direct collection of cigarette butts was conducted in Peel and Brantford, Ontario, Canada in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Cigarette butts were collected from a variety of locations within both regions. Cigarette butts were assessed and classified into one of the following categories: contraband, legal Canadian, legal Native, International, unknown, and discards. Results The overall proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> cigarettes in Peel was 5. 3  %, ranging from 2. 8 to 8. 6  % by location. In Brantford, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> was 33. 0  %, with a range from 32. 8 to 33. 1  % by location. Conclusions The direct collection of cigarette butts was determined to be a feasible method for a local public health unit in determining the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> cigarettes. This approach showed that Brantford has a higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> consumption compared to Peel, which may be due to geographic location and proximity to the United States (US) -Canada border and Native Reserves. More research is needed to confirm this geographic association with other jurisdictions...|$|R
