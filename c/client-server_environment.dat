40|$|Introduction Semantic Query Caching (SQC) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a data-caching scheme for <b>client-server</b> <b>environments</b> [5, 11]. Under this architecture, the client maintains in cache semantic descriptions and associated answer set of previous queries. If the current query is answerable from cache, no communication with the servers is necessary. If a query is only partially answerable from cache, the amount of data needed from the servers may be substantially reduced. 1 SQC provides an alternative approach to page-caching and tuple-caching architectures [3, 6], in which the unit of transfer between servers and clients is a page or a tuple, respectively. The key advantage of SQC over other approaches is its flexibility: {{it can be used}} to answer new queries which are semantically related to previous queries that were cached. 2 Tuple-based and page-based caches are relatively inflexible.

Location-based services (LBS for short) providers require users' current locations to answer their location-based queries, e. g., range and nearest-neighbor queries. Revealing personal location information to potentially untrusted service providers could create privacy risks for users. To this end, {{our objective is}} to design a privacy-preserving framework for LBS where users can obtain LBS and preserve their location privacy. In this thesis, we propose privacy-preserving LBS frameworks for different environments: (1) <b>client-server</b> <b>environments</b> in Euclidean space (the Casper system), (2) <b>client-server</b> <b>environments</b> in road networks, (3) mobile peer-to-peer environments, and (4) location monitoring services in wireless sensor networks (the TinyCasper system). In general, these frameworks have two main modules, namely, location anonymization and privacy- aware query processing. The location anonymization module blurs an user's exact location into a cloaked area (or a cloaked road segment set in road network environments) that satisfies the user's privacy requirements. The proposed frameworks support the two most popular privacy requirements, k-anonymity, i. e., a user is indistinguishable among k users, and minimum area Amin (or minimum total length of a cloaked road segment set), i. e., {{the size of a}} cloaked area is at least Amin. The user is able to specify his/her privacy requirements in a privacy profile and change the privacy profile at any time. The privacy-aware query processing module is embedded inside a database server to provide LBS based on cloaked areas (or cloaked road segment sets). To prove the concept of our privacy-preserving LBS frameworks, we implement system prototypes for Casper and TinyCasper. For each proposed privacy-preserving LBS framework, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of its location anonymization and privacy-aware query processing modules. All experiment results show that the proposed frameworks are scalable and efficient with respect to large numbers of users, large numbers of queries, and various privacy requirements, and they provide high quality services in terms of the accuracy of query answers and the query response time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{end user}} expects a broad {{spectrum}} of new applications from advanced communication networks, e. g. the Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). In many cases, interactions of similar applications provided by different vendors will be useful or even necessary. This is often solved by application layer protocols, leading {{to a wide range of}} protocol stacks on different devices. Furthermore, application developers and system administrators need to have deep knowledge about these protocols and their network specific requirements. This paper describes a conceptually different approach to overcome these problems. The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a protocol for the exchange of information in distributed environments. We use it to introduce command sets, standardized as well as application specific, for the support of interoperability in peer-to-peer as well as <b>client-server</b> <b>environments.</b> For this purpose, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Unified Data Exchange (SIP 4 UDE) concept provides a generic transport of any kind of control interactions in a unified manner.

Many solutions have been proposed to gain high quality of service for video on demand in <b>client-server</b> <b>environments,</b> with adaptive algorithms that adjust the bit-rate of a video stream depending on the clients available bandwidth. Providing video on demand over decentralized peer-to-peer systems is an active research field. The variable bit-rate environment that characterizes peer-to-peer networks causes significant difficulties to ensure quality of service and playback continuity for video on demand applications. This thesis addresses the challenge of serving high quality video on demand by designing and implementing a multi bit-rate video on demand architecture for peer-to-peer networks. We propose a switching scheme, an encoding methodology and a novel algorithm for multiple bit-rate video streaming over peer-to-peer networks. Identical video content is encoded into three different sets of streams with different average bit-rates. The novel multi bit-rate algorithm will switch dynamically between the three sets of streams depending on the available bandwidth.

We {{develop and}} analyze {{algorithms}} for propagating updates by mobile hosts in wireless <b>client–server</b> <b>environments</b> that support disconnected write operations, {{with the goal}} of minimizing the tuning time for update propagation to the server. These algorithms allow a mobile host to update cached data objects while disconnected and propagate the updates to the server upon reconnection for conflict resolutions. We investigate two algorithms applicable to mobile systems in which invalidation reports/data can be broadcast to mobile hosts periodically. We show that there exists an optimal broadcasting period under which the tuning time is minimized for update propagations. We perform a comparative analysis between these two update propagation algorithms that rely on broadcasting data and an algorithm that does not, and identify conditions under which an algorithm should be applied to reduce the total tuning time for update propagation by the mobile user to save the valuable battery power and avoid high communication cost. For real-time applications, we address the tradeoff between tuning time and access time with the goal to select the best update propagation algorithm that can minimize the tuning time while satisfying the imposed real-time deadline constraint. The analysis result is applicable to file/data objects that mobile users may need to modify while on the move...|$|R

30|$|As VLSI {{technology}} has been improved, a smart card employing 32 -bit processors has been released, and more personal information such as medical, financial data {{can be stored in}} the card. Thus, it becomes important to protect personal information stored in the card. Verification of the card holder's identity using a fingerprint has advantages over the present practices of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and passwords. However, the computational workload of fingerprint verification is much heavier than that of the typical PIN-based solution. In this paper, we consider three strategies to implement fingerprint verification in a smart card environment and how to distribute the modules of fingerprint verification between the smart card and the card reader. We first evaluate the number of instructions of each step of a typical fingerprint verification algorithm, and estimate the execution time of several cryptographic algorithms to guarantee the security/privacy of the fingerprint data transmitted in the smart card with the <b>client-server</b> <b>environment.</b> Based on the evaluation results, we analyze each scenario with respect to the security level and the real-time execution requirements in order to implement fingerprint verification in the smart card with the <b>client-server</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

Consistent with these efforts, our work focuses on the integrity and protection of information exchanged in high-performance networked computing applications such as video teleconferencing and other streamed interactive data exchanges. For these applications, security procedures are often omitted in the interest of performance. Since this may not be acceptable when using public communications media, our research makes explicit and then utilizes the inherent tradeoffs in realizing performance vs. security in communications. In this paper, we expand the notion of QoS to include the level of security that can be offered within performance and CPU resource availability constraints. To address performance and security tradeoffs in asymmetric and dynamic <b>client-server</b> <b>environments,</b> we developed Authenticast, a dynamically configurable, user-level communications protocol, offering variable levels of security throughout execution. The Authenticast protocol comprises a suite of heuristics to realize dynamic security levels, as well as heuristics that decide when and how to apply dynamic security. To demonstrate this protocol, we have implemented a prototype of a high performance privacy system. We have developed and experimented with a novel security control abstraction with which tradeoffs in security vs. performance may be made explicit and then utilized with dynamic client-server asymmetries. This abstraction is called a security thermostat [12], and interacts directly with Authenticast to enable adaptive security processing. Our results demonstrate overall increased scalability and improved performance when adaptive security is applied to the client-server platform with varying numbers of clients and varying resource availabilities at clients...|$|R
