50|$|After {{degating}} {{and heat}} treating, sand or other molding media may remain {{adhered to the}} casting. To remove any mold remnants, the surface is cleaned using a blasting process. This means a granular media will be propelled against {{the surface of the}} casting to mechanically knock away the adhering sand. The media may be blown with compressed air, or may be hurled using a shot wheel. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>media</b> strikes the casting surface at high velocity to dislodge the mold remnants (for example, sand, slag) from the casting surface. Numerous materials may be used to clean cast surfaces, including steel, iron, other metal alloys, aluminium oxides, glass beads, walnut shells, baking powder, and many others. The blasting media is selected to develop the color and reflectance of the cast surface. Terms used to describe this process include cleaning, bead blasting, and sand blasting.

40|$|Today {{cleaning}} {{with carbon}} dioxide pellets similar to sand blasting is an established technology. It {{is used for}} cleaning buildings outsides, rusty contamination or even to remove paint from airplanes. In any of these cases, the treated contamination is of a rough and macroscopic character. For the cleaning challenges of the Semiconductor Industry of the Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) with submicron particle contamination and thin film contamination this process {{is not at all}} suitable. On the other hand, established cleaning methods for the above mentioned problems, such as wet cleaning with water or chemicals, are often inconvenient, costly and are followed by the necessary disposal of <b>cleaning</b> <b>media.</b> At the Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart, Germany, experiments have been performed to develop an optimized cleaning system with carbon dioxide snow. High purity carbon dioxide is highly compressed and afterwards expands through a specially formed nozzle. Like this the carbon dioxide creat es a mix of snowflakes and gas. The effect of cleaning is a result of an almost gentle but very effective momentum transfer by the snowflakes on the contamination and the resulting shock wave which is induced by the sublimating carbon dioxide. The main advantages of this cleaning method can be described as follows: - cleaning of hybrid structures with a very high local resolution - minimal consumption of carbon dioxide - dry cleaning - no contaminated <b>cleaning</b> <b>media</b> (compared to wet cleaning with water or chemicals - disposal-free cleaning - cleaning of particle and filmic contamination - effective cleaning of submicron contamination at a high performance.

For instance, acetone is suitable in solubilizing chemical impurities, due to its polar characteristics, and it’s easy to be removed, due to its low boiling point, but it is not very effective with microbiological impurities, and ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or a mixture of the above solvents might be preferable.|$|E

This contexthas prompted the idea of investigating bubble columns, which operate at constant pressure drop, asalternatives to fibrous filters. This study examines the influence of different operating conditions, suchas liquid height, air flow rate, bubble size and presence of granular beds on ultrafine particle collection. Experimental results show that bubble columns are characterised by high collection efficiency, whenthey feature a large liquid height and small diameter bubbling orifices, while their efficiencies remainlower than those of fibrous filters.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to sequence labeling tasks {{in the field}} of Natural Language Processing by introducing novel concepts, models and algorithms for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, social media text detection and Web page cleaning. First, the task of social media text classification in Web pages is addressed, where sequences of Web text segments are classified based on a high-dimensional feature vector. New features motivated by social media text characteristics are introduced and investigated with respect to different classifiers. Two classification problems in the context of social media text classification are treated, (1) the problem of social media text detection and (2) a method for Web page <b>cleaning</b> for social <b>media</b> platforms. A new Web page corpus, particularly designed to train and test the classifiers on representative Web pages is created. Moreover, a POS tagger for social media texts is developed. The need for a specialized tagger is due to the specific social media text characteristics and the high non-standardization of such texts. Based on these factors, a Markov model tagger with parameter estimation enhancements with respect to social media texts is proposed. Particular focus is put on reliable estimation of non-standardized tokens like out-of-vocabulary words. To that end, methods are proposed to improve the reliability of probability estimation. Moreover, a novel approach mapping unknown tokens to tokens either known from training or tokens which fall into a class represented by regular expressions is presented. Finally, for remaining unknown tokens, semi-supervised auxiliary lexica and adequate estimation from prefix and suffix information is proposed. Furthermore, we propose to combine sparse in-domain social media training data and a newspaper corpus by an oversampling technique which improves POS tagging accuracies significantly. Training and evaluation of the proposed POS tagger is performed on a new manually annotated German social media text corpus. Tagging accuracies are presented and compared to accuracies achieved with state-of-the-art POS taggers. Finally, we show that the proposed social media text detection and Web cleaning methods, as well as the presented POS tagger can be efficiently used in the context of information retrieval for Web page corpus construction. By applying Web page <b>cleaning</b> and social <b>media</b> text detection to Web page corpora obtained from Web crawlers, the generated corpus can be further refined...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Rapid sand {{filtration}} {{is an essential}} unit process in the water purification process. It captures and removes coagulated and flocculated material and other suspended matter not removed during the preceding treatment processes. The pores in the filter bed gradually become clogged and the media progressively collects deposit through the continuous use and life of the filter. During normal operations cleaning is initiated by excessive head loss, deterioration in filtrate quality or when the predetermined time for a filter run has elapsed. Air scour, to remove deposit from filter media by vigorous agitation, and wash water, to remove this deposit from the filter bed, are applied. The combined action of air and water should quickly return the media to its original perfectly clean state for the cycle to continue. However, on inspection it is often found that filter sand on purification plants is unacceptably dirty and backwash systems are clearly incapable of <b>cleaning</b> the <b>media</b> to its initial state of cleanliness. It is at times possible to relate the dirty filter media to faulty designs or poor operating procedures, but often {{the reasons for the}} media deterioration remain elusive and the media becomes dirtier the longer it is in use. As there was an almost complete lack of published or agreed upon procedures to measure the cleanliness of filter media, rudimentary methods for measuring filter media cleanliness and backwash efficiency were developed. Thereafter filter media from full-scale treatment plants was analyzed with these methods at regular intervals to establish some benchmarks for these determinants. These methods were also applied during the laboratory and pilot plant phases of the project...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe most {{effective}} and widely used dedusting techniques to separate nanoparticles of a carrier fluid are fibrous media. The main problem is the clogging of the filter that induces a pressure drop increase over time and thus requires a regular <b>cleaning</b> of the <b>media</b> (or its replacement). Following these observations, this study proposes to investigate the potential of bubble columns for nanoparticles collection. Despite collection efficiencies {{lower than those of}} fibrous filters, experimental results show that bubble columns present likely performances for the collection of nanoparticles and have collection efficiency even more important when the liquid height is high and bubbling orifices have low diameters. Experiments have also revealed the presence of a most penetrating particle size for a particle diameter range between 10 and 30 nm. The model developed in this article highlights a good agreement between the theoretical collection efficiency by Brownian diffusion and experimental collection efficiencies for particles lower than 20 nm. Nevertheless, the modelling may be extended to other collection mechanisms in order to explain the collection efficiency increase for particles higher than 20 nm and to confirm or infirm that electrostatic effects can be the cause of this efficiency increase...|$|R
40|$|Vibration and {{cavitation}} can {{be generated}} in many ways and serve many useful purposes. This study describes physical aspects of useful vibration and cavitation for {{a broad spectrum of}} applications at atmospheric or elevated pressures. After a review of available devices, hydrodynamic vibrating-body-in-pipe tools as described in patents by Ivannikov are identified as having a major potential and being largely unexplored. Major advantages of these tools are simplicity of construction, scalability, powerful effects and attractive frequency range for well cleaning applications. Self induced vibration with a free body colliding with the pipe wall causes alternating flow around the body with a water hammer effect that enhances the vibration and cavitation. Cavitation can thus be generated at lower flow rates and at higher backpressures than with passive tools such as orifices. Cavitational collapse at high backpressure creates exceptionally strong effects, giving access to novel applications. At backpressures where even water hammer enhanced cavitation ceases to exist, very strong vibrations persist to pressure levels encountered in deep wells. This unique dual enhanced vibration and cavitation behaviour of the tools is the key to vibrating-body-in-pipe technology for which the new name VibroCav was coined. The study focuses on VibroCav tools with balls, except for one series of tests with a so-called flip-flop body. Exploratory tests in a 350 bar test circuit in Assen lead to the design of a 50 bar laboratory closed test circuit installed in the 3 ME lab in Delft with facilities to apply up to 10 bar backpressure and up to 40 bar pressure differentials over the tools. In the 50 bar test circuit many experiments were carried out, firstly with bottom supported balls in a straight pipe and secondly with hanging balls in a pipe with a conical outlet allowing remote adjustment of the gap between the ball and the pipe wall. The influence of water composition, gas content and various ball materials was tested. Selected high backpressure test were carried out with a 350 bar closed test circuit in Drachten. A total of 29 field trials on an industrial scale were carried out for <b>cleaning</b> the porous <b>media</b> around water and oil wellbores under widely varying conditions and 5 field trials were done to evaluate the potential of the technology for the removal of scale deposits in wellbores. The laboratory experiments with the 50 bar test circuit delineated various operational modes of the VibroCav tools as function of flow rate and backpressure with regimes designated as (i) vibration only, (ii) active cavitation always combined with vibration, (iii) no vibration and passive cavitation and (iv) no vibration and no passive cavitation. The vibration regime persists to the maximum backpressure that could be reached and probably to much higher pressures, however at high flow rate conditions and a narrow gap vibration ceases when the Re value increases beyond the point of drag reduction due to shifting of the boundary separation point (Re approximately 3 x 105 for unbounded flow). Active cavitation is just as passive cavitation subdued by increasing backpressure; but in this test circuit it has still been observed at a backpressure of 63 barg. With a bottom supported tool as used in this test circuit a significant path downstream of the ball is obscured and active cavitation closer to the gap might still exist. This is the basis for the expectation that for this tool active cavitation may survive up to 100 barg backpressure. Tools with a hanging ball, in which cavitation is more clearly visible, were not tested at such high backpressures. The influence of water quality and gas content proved to be insignificant. Lightweight balls showed in bottom supported tools violent vibration and strong active cavitation but were easily damaged by the high contact forces between the ball and the support. With hard steel balls and softer steel supports, bedding-in is observed due to contact forces beyond the elastic limit of the support. If the ball is softer than the support, the ball flattens, breaks or is otherwise damaged by the support. The field trials for <b>cleaning</b> porous <b>media</b> around wellbores combined with theoretical analysis provided valuable semi-quantitative understanding of the influence of frequency, source directivity, source energy, wellbore geometry and permeability damage on the penetration depth of sources for vibration based well cleaning. The most significant wave energy for <b>cleaning</b> porous <b>media</b> is provided by the slow Biot wave, which is a compressional wave in fluid in the interconnected pore network. The higher the virgin permeability of the rock and the lower the wave frequency the better is the penetration depth. Permeability deterioration due to pore fouling reduces the penetration depth of the cleaning treatment and with progressive fouling the pore damage may get out of reach of the cleaning tools. The limited number of scale removal trials showed significant potential of the VibroCav tools due to the combination of physical hammering, jetting, wave energy and shock waves of collapsing cavitation bubbles. The study provides a solid basis for a scientifically founded continuation of the development of VibroCav technology for many areas of application in several industrial sectors and should be regarded as the precursor for a range of innovating techniques. 3 MEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

There is evidence of food commercials {{having an impact on}} children's food preferences, choices, consumption and obesity. We describe the product categories advertised during kids programmes, the type of food promoted and the characteristics of food commercials targeting children. Methods: A content analysis of the commercials aired during the kids programmes of six Swiss, one German and one Italian stations was conducted. The commercials were collected over a 6 -month period in 2006. Results: Overall, 1365 h of kids programme were recorded and 11 613 advertisements were found: 3061 commercials (26. 4 %) for food, 2696 (23. 3 %) promoting toys, followed by those of <b>media,</b> <b>cleaning</b> products and cosmetics. Regarding the broadcast food advertisements, 55 % were for fast food restaurants or candies. Conclusion: The results of the content analysis suggest that food advertising contributes to the obesity problem: every fourth advertisement is for food, half of them for products high in sugar and fat and hardly any for fruit or vegetables. Long-term exposure to this distortion of the pyramid of recommended food should be considered in the discussion of legal restrictions for food advertising targeting childre...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of coal mineral matter, {{and particularly the}} content of major elements (Al, Si, Fe, Ca, K, Na, Mg), {{plays an important role}} in the processing and use of bituminous coals. Mineral matter is the ballast, reducing the calorific value of the fuel. The aim of the study was to analyze the concentrations of main elements of coking coal mineral matter and products of its <b>cleaning</b> in heavy <b>media,</b> jiggers and flotation machines. Analysis of elements was performed through the technique of the atomic absorption spectrometry AAS. The results of main elements concentrations of coal mineral matter and its cleaning products are discussed in relation to each operation of mechanical treatment. As a result of the cleaning process in heavy media, the content of mineral substances decreased seven times, mainly due to the removal of components such as silicon, aluminum and iron from coal. Similar results were obtained in the case of cleaning in jiggers, leading to a significant reduction of the contents of silicates and aluminosilicates. In both cases, there was an increase in the content of sodium. Despite the significant reduction of the contents of alkali metals’ compounds, their content in concentrates as converted to oxides is quite high (0, 43 – 0, 81 % of dry coal). The lowest alkalis content is the displayed by a coal concentrate from the flotation process dewatered in a centrifuge...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNanometric {{aerosols}} localized in workplace environments mainly {{stem from}} two sources: {{on the one}} hand, nanoparticles which are manufactured {{in more and more}} industrial applications and on the other hand, ultrafine particles generated by different processes: fumes, cutting processes and metallization processes [...] . This latter technique, which involves projecting (by compressed air) fine metallic particles on a surface, is a very intense source of ultrafine toxic particles. Currently, the most effective and widely used dedusting techniques in order to separate particles from a carrier fluid are fibrous media (often in the form of cartridges). The main problem with the filtration of such particles is the progressive clogging of the filter that induces a pressure drop increase over time and thus requires a regular <b>cleaning</b> of the <b>media</b> or its replacement. This problem is mostly pronounced in the case of metallization processes as agglomerates of nanoparticles tend to increase the filter clogging. Following these observations, we proposed to investigate an alternative to these classical techniques that could be applied to metallization fumes. We concentrated our choice on bubble columns which offer advantages such as little maintenance requirement due to simple construction, easy temperature control, low initial costs of installation and operation at constant pressure. An experimental study was conducted to determine the performance of a bubble column in terms of collection efficiency of nanostructured particles. The choice of a demineralized water as collection fluid was done {{in order to avoid the}} formation of secondary particles when bubbles explode at the surface of the liquid. Particle concentrations upstream and downstream of the bubble column were determined with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer. Results showed that collection efficiency is governed by two key parameters: the residence time and size or air bubbles. An optimization of these parameters induced an increase of bubble column performance but collection of ultrafine particles remains lower than those of fibrous media. Consequently, to become a viable alternative to fibrous media in terms of collection efficiency, this separation process may be intensify and we propose to study the influence of the presence of beads (of various sizes and natures) in the liquid...|$|R
40|$|Raw {{water of}} {{reservoirs}} has high colour and low turbidity while river water normally has low colour and high turbidity. Organic matters carried with run off water accumulate {{at the bottom}} of reservoirs. Reservoir waters being stationary provides a friendly environment for algal growth and colour development from decomposition of those and some inorganic ion such as Iron & Manganese from soil. So treatment of reservoir water is to be focused on colour removal rather than turbidity removal. It has been found that colour removal requires high coagulant dosage than turbidity removal and purification of reservoir water gives rise to operational problems in the conventional treatment systems such as short filter run with filter clogging and filter bed cracking. Kalatuwawa Water Treatment Plant has been constructed in 1954 with design capacity of 20 mgd. It is a conventional type treatment plant having the following processes, Aeration, Pre-chlorination, Coagulation, Flocculation, Sedimentation, Filtration Post chlorination and pH correction. Raw water is drawn off to the treatment plant from the Kalatuwawa impounding reservoir and the treated water is conveyed to Greater Colombo area under gravity feed and contributes 16 mgd to the total supply of Greater Colombo. In the course of filtration, clean filter media gradually gets clogged. After about one month, small cracks on the surface of filters starts to appear and these cracks develop into large openings with mud ball formation in continuation of the filtration process. So it has been difficult to reduce the colour to acceptable level during high colour period as settled water passes through openings without filtration. This has been a long-standing problem, which has not received a proper solution so far. Objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the reasons for filter clogging & filter cracking and find solutions to overcome this problem with improvement of colour removal efficiency. The analysis of the problem was divided into two parts. In the first part, the possible contributory factors from the reservoir up to filters were investigated. Physical & operational factors which may contribute to the problem in the filters themselves were investigated in the second part. A pilot filter was set up in parallel to the existing filters and run more than one year with increased back wash rate and air scouring and found to be operating without clogging and cracking problem in media. Similarly the applicability of clay and settled sludge as coagulant aid, and PAC as colour adsorbent was investigated for the purpose of improving settling and colour removal efficiency in order to reduce the filter load during high colour period. The chemical analysis done for raw water reveals that colour of Kalatuwawa water has developed primarily from organic substances with iron. Organic colour substances come from decomposition of vegetation and Iron from bottom soil. This study investigated the possibility of filter clogging and cracking due to algal growth in the reservoir water and found no significant algal count in raw water to clog filters Through Jar test analysis, it appears that clay and settled sludge can be applied as a coagulant aid in conjunction with Alum and these reduce colour in the settled water to satisfactory level with use of optimum dosage. Addition of Powered Activate Carbon as adsorbent to flocculation basin was found to reduce colour to minimal amount. Applying pre- chlorination is necessary to remove iron from water, as aeration alone is not able to do so. Increased back wash rate up to 36 m 3 /m 2 fhr with air scouring system gives adequate bed expansion and <b>cleaning</b> to filter <b>media.</b> Therefore this study leads to the conclusion that increased backwash rate with improvement of settling would solve the cracking and clogging problem of the filters. Similarly it requires the rehabilitation and modification of filter under drain system...|$|R
