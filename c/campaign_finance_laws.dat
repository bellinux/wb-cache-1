5|$|During the General Assembly's 2005 session, Fletcher again {{proposed}} his {{tax reform}} plan, and {{late in the}} session, both houses passed it. The plan raised sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms. Businesses were also subjected to a gross receipts tax. In exchange, corporate taxes were lowered, as were income taxes for individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether. The Assembly also passed a budget {{for the remainder of}} the biennium, abolished the state's public <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>laws,</b> and passed new school nutrition guidelines.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>laws,</b> there was no {{perceptible}} decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more {{of their own money}} than in the past.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Patton {{was elected}} Governor over Republican Larry Forgy. The major {{achievement}} {{of his first}} term was overhauling higher education, including making the state's community colleges and technical schools independent of the University of Kentucky and organizing them into the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Shortly after Patton turned back a weak challenge to his re-election in 1999, two Democratic state senators defected to the Republican Party, giving Republicans a majority in that legislative house {{for the first time}} ever. The economic prosperity that fueled Patton's first term success faded into a recession in the early 2000s. Faced with a hostile legislature and a dire economic forecast, Patton was unable to enact much significant legislation in his second term, and his situation was exacerbated in 2002 when news of an extramarital affair and allegations of a sex-for-favors scandal broke. After initially denying the affair, Patton later admitted to it, but continued to deny using his office to benefit his mistress. Later in his term, Patton was attacked for pardoning four of his political advisers who were indicted for violating Kentucky's <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>laws</b> and for allegedly abusing his patronage powers. These successive scandals derailed any further political aspirations.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final versio {{is available from the}} University of Connecticut School of Law via [URL] has American <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law</b> long suffered from doctrinal confusion and sparked bitter ideological conflict? This article demonstrates that these attributes are rooted in a judicial dispute over the cognitive and social characteristics of central actors in elections. 	 The article unpacks the foundations of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law</b> through a multi-tiered analysis of case texts. It first explicates the doctrinal deficiencies that riddle the Supreme Court’s <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> jurisprudence. These flaws reflect the Court’s clumsy engagement with democratic theory, which has been an unrecognized driver of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law</b> and the wellspring of the partisan dispute. Conservatives assert that the pillar of democracy is free participation in the marketplace of information, and subsequently reject restriction of <b>campaign</b> <b>financing</b> even when advanced in the name of anti-corruption. Conversely, liberals perceive democracy as vulnerable to systemic corruption from plutocratic influences and thus endorse regulatory oversight of campaign spending. The latter half of the article excavates the origins of this conflict: the factions adopt divergent positions on the cognitive and social attributes of political actors (voters, candidates, donors, and public officials). As these positions inform the factions’ theories of democracy, the <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> quagmire can be traced to political and psychological assumptions present in the cases. Progress in <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law</b> demands revision of the relationship between these assumptions and contemporary electoral realities...|$|R
25|$|Scaife gained notoriety for evading weak <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>laws</b> {{to donate}} US$990,000 to the 1972 {{re-election}} campaign of U.S. President Richard M. Nixon. Scaife was not {{charged with a}} crime, but about $45,000 went to a fund linked to the Watergate scandal. Scaife later said he was repulsed by the scandal and refused to speak with Nixon after 1973. Following Duggan's suicide and then Watergate, he shifted his political giving from politicians' campaigns to anti-communist research groups, legal defense funds, and publications.|$|E
25|$|By {{extending}} the exploration mode of his potential candidacy to a six-month period (his scheduled announcement came one day short {{of six months}} into his exploratory phase), Bush used his time to get acquainted with the press, court donors, and prepare a strategy. In doing this, he navigated several <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>laws</b> which limit donations and prohibit coordination with Super PACs. In May 2015, {{it was reported that}} Bush had been raising money since January 2015, estimated to be close to 100 million, for his super PAC, Right to Rise.|$|E
25|$|This {{prompted}} {{an investigation}} beginning in February 2010 {{by the office}} of New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. into possible improprieties. The Independence Party later questioned how Haggerty spent the money, which was to go to poll-watchers. Former New York State Senator Martin Connor contended that because the Bloomberg donations were made to an Independence Party housekeeping account rather than to an account meant for current campaigns, this was a violation of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>laws.</b> Haggerty also spent money from a separate $200,000 donation from Bloomberg on office space.|$|E
40|$|Labor {{unions and}} federations, {{particularly}} the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), devote significant resources to litigating before the Supreme Court. This Supreme Court litigation frequently {{takes place in}} cases that reach far beyond labor law, meaning that unions help to shape the law governing many aspects of American society. Virtually no legal scholarship considers the role that unions play in these cases, and consequently {{there has been no}} systemic attention to the positions that unions take before the Supreme Court. Yet, unions’ litigation positions, especially before the Supreme Court, yield useful information about union strategies and priorities. The labor movement frequently participates in litigation regarding the constitutionality of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law.</b> Unions’ litigation in this area is particularly important because the structure of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law</b> plays a role in determining who is elected to office; in other words, legal developments in this area have far-reaching effects on substantive law and policy. This essay lays the groundwork for future analysis of the important relationship between unions and <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> litigation. To that end, it describes how the labor movement has sought to shape <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law</b> through litigation, analyzing the contours of union positions in Supreme Court <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> cases as well as the outcomes of those cases. It also briefly discusses how the labor movement has adapted to modern <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law,</b> particularly after Citizens United v. FEC...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{explores the}} {{potential}} {{implications of the}} creation of a distinct 2 ̆ 2 election period 2 ̆ 2 through the BCRA reforms to <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law.</b> The idea of a separate set of rights of expression during the immediate pre-election period is a relative newcomer to American law, but is a central feature of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law</b> in other countries. The creation of a defined election period is the underpinning of strong restrictions on political speech in countries such as Britain, and is currently the source of tension under European law. Recent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, most notably in Bowman v. United Kingdom, highlight the fundamental divide between animating conceptions of liberty and equality in the funding of the political process. By mildly introducing the idea of a separate regulatory sphere for a temporally-defined election period, BCRA intriguingly invites a reexamination of the core constitutional logic of American <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R
