25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, <b>clutch,</b> <b>flywheel,</b> and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|E

30|$|High {{temperatures}} {{appear in}} the contacting surfaces of a single-disc clutch system (friction <b>clutch</b> disc, <b>flywheel</b> and pressure plate) due to the relative motion between these parts during the sliding period. These high temperatures are responsible for several disadvantages such as increasing wear rate, surface cracks and permanent distortions. In some cases, these disadvantages may lead the contacting surfaces to failure before the expected lifetime. In this work, mathematical models of the friction clutch system (single-disc clutch) were built to find the temperature field during the sliding period (single engagement). Analysis has been completed using developed axisymmetric models to simulate the friction clutch system during the engagement. The surface temperatures are found based on uniform pressure and uniform wear assumptions.|$|R

5000|$|The Inter Autoscooter is a French {{three-wheeled}} microcar {{that first}} {{appeared at the}} 1953 Paris Salon. Some say it was produced {{to compete with the}} Messerschmitt KR175 which also appeared that year. This is not surprising as both cars were built by aircraft companies and shared a similar cockpit and tandem seating layout. The Inter was produced by SNCAN in their aircraft factory at Villeurbanne in the region of Lyon; Just over 300 units were built between 1954 and 1956. Early advertising literature reveals that two models were offered, one with a cockpit cover that hinged open from the side and named the Berline, the other an open bodied version called the Torpedo. Both cars were powered by a small Ydral 175cc two-stroke engine driving the single rear wheel. The Inter had some unusual features not least being its ability to fold together its two front half axles so as to facilitate easy storage, however this feature only appears on the first few cars made as it proved to be impractical and was soon discontinued. The Inter also featured a device called a gyrostarter, this was in effect a kind of electric kick start made by the American electromechanical giant WestinghouseThe device consists of a built in electric 6 volt motor with a <b>clutched</b> <b>flywheel,</b> the momentum of the rotating flywheel is transferred to the engine by means of its clutch once it has built up sufficient speed, it sounds much like a helicopter preparing for take off!

50|$|Sutherland asked Lawrence {{to design}} and build a simple {{prototype}} for a car that could be built in small numbers. Lawrence considered the design he produced his most radical work ever. Starting with a simple chassis of two parallel large-diameter tubes Lawrence installed the engine from a Datsun 280Z in front and the transaxle, <b>clutch</b> and <b>flywheel</b> from an Alfa Romeo Alfetta in rear. The engine also received a Rootes-type supercharger and a 48 mm Weber carburetor. The front suspension was upper and lower A-arms and the rear was a de Dion system, but it was what Lawrence did for springs that made it notable. The springs front and rear were 4-inch wide single leaf units attached to the chassis by a fitting in their centre that was able to rotate, and which put the front spring {{in front of the}} front chassis cross-member and the rear spring behind the rear chassis cross-member. That means that if the springs were on stands it was theoretically possible to rotate the chassis through 360°. All of the roll-resistance was provided by two long torsion bars running the length of the chassis, one on each side, that were attached to the suspension by 12-inch arms. The strength of roll-resistance was adjustable at each wheel by changing the location of the anchors for the torsion bars. To make the car roadworthy it received simple Lotus 7-style bodywork widened to fit the chassis and Morgan-style front fenders.|$|R

Crankshaft end play is carried by the rear bearing on the two GM engines. It has the lighter 'skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter [...] "flat back" [...] that bolted to a <b>clutch</b> and <b>flywheel</b> housing {{at the front of the}} transmission.This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores.

Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries.

40|$|Abstract — Clutch {{system is}} among the main systems inside a vehicle. Clutch is a {{mechanical}} device located between a vehicle engine and its transmission and provides mechanical coupling between the engine and transmission input shaft. Clutch system comprise of <b>flywheel,</b> <b>clutch</b> disc plate and friction material, pressure plate, clutch cover, diaphragm spring and the linkage necessary to operate the clutch. The clutch engages the transmission gradually by allowing {{a certain amount of}} slippage between the flywheel and the transmission input shaft. However, the slipping mechanism of the clutch generates heat energy due to friction between the clutch disc and the flywheel. At high sliding velocity, excessive frictional heat is generated which lead to high temperature rise at the clutch disc surface, and this causes thermo-mechanical problems such as thermal deformations and thermo-elastic instability which can lead to thermal cracking, wear and other mode of failure of the clutch disc component. In this project, the modeling of clutch is done in detailed using modeling software. After that the FEM analysis is done for sintered iron friction material. The stresses & deformation obtained for this friction material is then compared to analysis software result. The analysis is done for worn out friction disc.

It uses mechanical components only a <b>flywheel,</b> <b>clutches,</b> gears, and a continuously variable transmission for its hybrid functionalities of brake energy recuperation, reduction of inefficient part-load operation of the engine, and engine shutoff during vehicle standstill. This powertrain has mechanical characteristics, such as a relatively small energy storage capacity {{in the form of}} the compact flywheel and multiple driving modes to operate the powertrain because of the use of clutches. The optimization problem is complex because it is twofold: (i) to find the optimal sequence of driving modes and (ii) to find the optimal power distribution between the engine, flywheel, and vehicle. Dynamic programming is used to compute the globally optimal EMS for six representative driving cycles. The main design criterion is the minimization of the overall fuel consumption, subject to the systems kinematics, dynamics, and constraints. The results provide a benchmark of the fuel saving potential of this powertrain design and give insight in the optimal utilization of the flywheel system. In addition, the complexity (and computation time) of the problem is reduced by a priori (static) optimization of the power distribution for each driving mode. Static optimization of a dynamic optimization problem yields a sub-optimal solution; however, the results show that the consequences on the fuel saving are small with respect to the optimal one (the difference is 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 8...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the I.

The paper presents a theoretical study on the dynamic behaviour of automotive transmissions focusing {{on the presence of}} oil between the impacting tooth of the meshing gears. This rattle phenomenon is particularly audible at low regimes and regards all the gear pairs different from the gear inserted to transmit the power. Another operating condition that manifests the gear rattle phenomenon is typically the “idle condition”, when all the gear pairs are meshing but without loading. The presence of oil between the impacting tooth of the gear pairs can play a positive role to decrease the vibrations and than the rattle noise level. In the paper some driveline complete models comprising many components as <b>flywheel,</b> <b>clutch,</b> primary and secondary shafts, are described accounting for the presence of oil lubricant between the teeth of the unloaded gear pairs. The described models consider an oil film lubrication between the tooth of the gear pairs, starting from the Reynolds equation and adopting some hypotheses regarding in particular the oil squeeze effect and also hypotheses about the teeth shape. Moreover some dissipative terms as friction and hysteresis in the clutch springs together with the oil drag torque in the gear box elements have been considered and modelled in the article...|$|R

This phenomenon is induced by stick-slip oscillations at the friction lining interfaces between the <b>clutch</b> disc and <b>flywheel,</b> and the pressure plate. The phenomenon {{is influenced by the}} clutch lining friction characteristics, the topography of the mating-sliding surfaces, and the operational conditions during the engagement process. Therefore, the interfacial characteristics are affected by contact pressure, interfacial slip speed, and surface temperature. Take-up judder causes driver and vehicle occupant discomfort, as well as gradual wear of contacting surfaces. The response frequency of the system is reported to be in the range 5 – 20 [*]Hz, depending on the clutch system and vehicle inertia. In this paper, the measured interfacial friction characteristics together with clamp load variation (contact pressure) under different surface temperatures are included in a multi-degree of freedom dynamic analysis to obtain torsional vibrations of the system, pertaining to take-up judder conditions. Such an in-depth investigation has not hitherto been reported in literature. The paper shows that take-up judder is omnipresent under all clutch engagement conditions, but its poignancy is most evident at cold surface temperatures.

40|$|In Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) {{the clutch}} control {{strategies}} {{to manage the}} engagement operation and clutch vibrational behaviour are mutual interdependent and only an optimized mechatronic design could lead to an effective target from several points of view: passengers' comfort, fuel economy, system reliability, performance, driving feeling, etc. In fact, noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) phenomena are crucial subjects in the modern automotive industry. In passenger car equipped with automatic transmissions the electronic management of the coupling between engine and transmission couldn’t provide sensible improvement of comfort and overall vehicle performance during gearshifts without the availability of dependable models of the <b>flywheel,</b> <b>clutch</b> and driveline as powerful tools for vehicle design engineers. In this paper, simulations of driveline vibrational behaviour have been performed by implementing a high-order multi-body model for the dry clutch mechanism {{with the purpose of}} studying the excitation of torsional vibration caused by frictional actions during the slip phase of the clutch engagement in manual or automated manual transmissions. The analysis aims at deepen about the coupling between pressure plate wobbling and torsional motions in order to improve the current understanding of the excitation mechanisms in the frequency region of the so-called “eek noise”, 250 - 500 Hz. The results of this work substantiate that enhancing of torsional motion in the characteristic frequency range of the eek effect occurs in vehicle launch and gear shifting operations regardless of the rigid wobbling motion of the pressure plate. Such outcomes underline the need to include the non-linear characteristic of the clutch cushion spring in the simulation frictional induced vibration originated at clutch level.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project is to determine a passenger vehicles' acceleration and top speed change {{in response to the}} change in the ratio of the final drive gearing coefficient. To accomplish this, the following tasks had to be completed: analysis of the transmission types, their construction and the operation of the final drive assembly, performing a numerical analysis and comparing it to dynamic real world test results using a “BMW (E 36) 318 is” as the test subject. The car chosen for {{this research}} is a “BMW (E 36) 318 is” due to its classical arrangement comprised of a front mounted four cylinder petrol engine and rear wheel drive. The analysis of the final drive gearing in such arrangement is easier, due to the transmission being separate from the rear mounted differential assembly. By changing the differential housings which have different internal gearing, their effect on the vehicle's acceleration and top speed could be observed and compared to the calculations of expected values. The research was started by gathering and analyzing material about the power delivery chain in the manual transmission vehicle model to develop a familiarity with the components: <b>flywheel,</b> <b>clutch,</b> transmission and integrated subframe final drive assembly. In regards to the available final drive assemblies, four differential housings were chosen with the following internal gearing configurations to conduct this study: 2. 79 : 1 – the lowest one, available from the factory in the diesel powered vehicles known for their high torque. 3. 15 : 1 – the gear set mostly found in the high powered petrol engine cars. 3. 45 : 1 – the gear set that came standard with the chosen test vehicle. 4. 10 : 1 – the gear set used for the least powerful petrol engines, usually coupled with automatic transmissions. Changing the differential therefore changes the gearing of the final drive assembly and provides a change in vehicle dynamics. After conducting the gathering and analysis of the available information from the data-sheets and literal documentation, practical tests were conducted using a “DL 1 ” data collection tool to capture the information about the response of the car with all four aforementioned differentials. Using the “Analysis V 8 ” software with the said tool, the top speed and acceleration for each gear and all four differentials were determined, alongside the engine RPM for 50 km/h and 90 km/h for different gears. Finally the theoretical calculations for the top speed at max engine in every gear were calculated. They were correlated with the observed values for our measurements, including the top RPM for each gear and the engine RPM for 50 km/h in 3 'rd gear, 50 km/h and 90 km/h in 4 th gear, 90 km/h in 5 th gear. The observations conclude that increasing the ratio of the gear set in the differential leads to a quicker accelerating vehicle, but it negatively affects the comfort and fuel consumption. The best gear set ratio for fuel economy and acceleration for our test vehicle was determined to be the factory 3. 45 : 1 although with increased driving speed (above 90 km/h) fuel economy and comfort are reduced. For users who spend most of their commute at highway speeds, it would be recommended to switch their final drive assembly to the one with the ratio of 2. 79 : 1 for increased comfort and decreased fuel consumption. The conducted research is unique in terms of applicability. A user could tailor their car to their needs in regard to the expected driving conditions based on this research. Also- the calculated and observed data have a very close correlation, therefore a calculated final drive ratio selection could be trusted to have the expected result on the vehicle...|$|R
