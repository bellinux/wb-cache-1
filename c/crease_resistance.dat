However, {{preparation of}} fabrics with castor oil lubricants result in less yellowing and less fabric weight loss, {{as well as}} increased dyeing brilliance. Jute has a decreased strength when wet, and also becomes subject to microbial attack in humid climates. Jute can be processed with an enzyme {{in order to reduce}} some of its brittleness and stiffness. Once treated with an enzyme, jute shows an affinity to readily accept natural dyes, which can be made from marigold flower extract. In one attempt to dye jute fabric with this extract, bleached fabric was mordanted with ferrous sulphate, increasing the fabric's dye uptake value. Jute also responds well to reactive dyeing. This process is used for bright and fast coloured value-added diversified products made from jute.|$|E

Crease recovery angle (CRA) and tensile strength are the two most important parameters which are used to evaluate the performance of the crosslinked cellulosic fabrics and garments. In this study, we investigated the effect of DMDHEU resin on the crosslinking of cotton, bamboo, tencel and viscose fabrics. Three levels of resin concentration and four levels of curing temperature were employed for crosslinking treatments. The curing time was kept at 4 min in all the cases. The results show that the crease recovery angle has improved in all the cases and the improvement was found to be excellent for viscose, With the exception of cotton, in all the other cases, the tensile strength was unchanged. Thus resin treatment is strongly recommended for bamboo, viscose and tencel fabrics as it is found to improve wrinkle resistance without causing any deterioration in strength...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Four {{studies were}} conducted. First, {{mountain}} big sagebrush communities were burned at Lava Beds National Monument, California, and The Crooked River National Grassland, Oregon. In {{two years at}} Lava Beds, basal cover of Idaho fescue in one community and Thur- ber's needlegrass {{in one of three}} communities did not recover. Basal cover of bluebunch wheatgrass and Sandberg's bluegrass re- covered or increased above prefire levels at the expense of Idaho fescue and Thurber's needlegrass. Bunchgrasses recovery was based on height and production which increased to equal or exceed prefire levels. At Crooked River, height and production of bluebunch wheat- grass were much higher than prefire levels, but basal cover remain- ed extremely low after two years. Prescribed burning recommenda- tions were presented. Secondly, after hot and cool in situ propane barrel burns, mountain big sagebrush seed emergence in the greenhouse was stimu- lated. Basin big sagebrush seed emergence was reduced by both fire intensities. Emergence was inverse to fire intensity for both sub- species. Wyoming big sagebrush was not affected by fire. Both in- tensities reduced emergence of most herbaceous species from mountain big sagebrush dominated soils. Hot fires were required to reduce emergence of the few herbaceous species affected by fire on basin and especially Wyoming big sagebrush dominated soils. A trend of in- <b>creasing</b> fire <b>resistance</b> with increasing site severity was evident. Thirdly, individual and area fuel loading equations were de- veloped for each component of fuel of the three subspecies of big sagebrush. R² values for individual shrub equations ranged from. 36 to. 96. Line intercept cover, the number, and the height of intercepted shrubs were used to estimate area fuel loadings with R² values ranging from. 42 to. 84. This method of estimating area fuel loading provides relatively high precision at reduced cost. Fourthly, basal cover and leaf length or plant height were used to estimate bunchgrass production. R² values for burned plant equations were higher (. 66 -. 87) than R² values for unburned- ungrazed plant equations (. 35 -. 85). Basal cover accounted for at least 70 percent of the variation in Thurber's needlegrass, burned Idaho fescue, and burned bluebunch wheatgrass production.

40|$|In {{continuation}} of the preceeding report the present paper deals with the method of 	"Pre-heating and Quenching" of crepe marocain. 	The samples that were specially prepared were pre-heated respectively at 110 °， 120 ° 	and 130 ℃ for various minutes， (1 ， 1. 5 ， 2 ， 2. 5 ， and 3 minutes，) and was quenched into 	the resin solution immediately after each pre-heating. The shrinkage of the cloth 	which attended on dipping was simultaneously measured， and which {{proved to be a}} good 	measure of the penetration of the resin solution into the interstices of the fiber. The 	samples were then cured at 130 ℃ for 10 minutes after intervened drying. 	The samples were then tested by running crease tester under 500 g and 2000 g loads， 	and the resin contents and the mode of distribution was studied. 	The optimum temperature of "Pre-heating" was found to be 120 ℃， and the time of 	heating 1. 5 minutes， folIowed by the dipping for 10 minutes in order to assure a good 	result. 	The dipping duration of an ordinary padding or mangling， usually within 60 seconds 	at best， was obviously suspected to be too short for such fabrics from the shrinkage 	curves obtained; and it was actually found that even 2 minutes' dipping was insufficient， 	causing the resin to deposit {{on the surface of the}} fibers and/or yarns， and accordingly 	giving an exceedingly poor crease recovery for the heavier load， a 1 though it showed a 	pretty high <b>crease</b> <b>resistance</b> for the lighter load.

40|$|After {{going through}} the more {{important}} theories on cellular permeability, researches were undertaken {{with the purpose of}} proving the actual influence of the various degrees of cellular permeability on the phenomena of organic resistance against infections, and on the production of antibodies. Three groups of substances known to have action on cellular permeability were used; the first consisting of the following permeable substances: testos-terona, acetylcholine, and the spreading-factor of the staphyloccocus. The second group included substances which help in developing low cellular permeability: atropin, adrenalin and calcium. Finally, the third group consisted of a substance which helps to maintain normal permeability: cortin (an extract of the suprarenal cortex). In order to study the process developed by these elements with regard to organic resistance against infections, adult mice were inoculated with the following germs: K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, S. enteriditis and D. pneumoniae, in the smallest possible amount capable of starting a mortal sep infection in approximately 24 hours, exception made of D. pneumonias which causes death in 48 hours. The animals were divided into groups of 10, a before taking the injections containing the germs, they were given the sub lances under observation, through their peritoneum of intramuscularly.

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is focused on}} both experimental and numerical analysis of laser surface hardening of AISI M 2 high speed tool steel. Experimental analysis aims at clarifying effect of different laser processing parameters on properties and performance of laser surface treated specimens. Numerical analysis is concerned with analytical approaches that provide efficient tools for estimation of surface temperature, surface hardness and hardened depth {{as a function of}} laser surface hardening parameters. Results indicated that optimization of laser processing parameters including laser power, laser spot size and processing speed combination is of considerable importance for achieving maximum surface hard ness and deepest hardened zone. In this concern, higher laser power, larger spot size and lower processing speed are more efficient. Hardened zone with 1. 25 mm depth and 996 HV surface hardness was obtained using 1800 W laser power, 4 mm laser spot size and 0. 5 m /min laser processing speed. The obtained maximum hardness of laser surface treated specimen is 23 % higher than that of conventionally heat treated specimen. This in turn has resulted in 30 % in <b>crease</b> in wear <b>resistance</b> of laser surface treated specimen. Numerical analysis has been carried out for calculation of temperature gradient and cooling rate based on Ashby and Easterling equations.

Textiles {{play a vital}} role in the present day society. All of us use different types of textile products for various uses throughout our lives. The moment a child is born he is sponged with a soft textile fabric and subsequently wrapped in a textile cloth to protect the sensitive body and skin of the new born from environmental hat, cold and dust. We dress ourselves with a novelty of textile garments according to our taste. We sit on fabric covered chairs and sofas and decorate our rooms with textile products and curtains. We walk on textile mats and sleep on textile bed sheets and underlay. Clothing and household textiles are aesthetically pleasing and vary in colour, design, texture and prices. The fiber properties govern the characteristics of the final fabric. Strong fibers make durable fabrics that can be light in weight. Absorbent fibers are good for skin-contact apparel and for towels and diapers. Fibers, which are self-extinguishing, are good for children sleepwear and protective clothing. To analyze a fabric for predicting performance one usually starts with the determination of its fiber content. The knowledge of the fiber properties helps to anticipate the contribution of its fiber content. The knowledge of the fiber properties helps to anticipate the contribution of the fiber to the performance of a fabric and the garment made from it. Fiber properties are determined by the nature of the external and the internal structure and the chemical composition. Natural fibers are subject to growth irregularities and are, therefore, not uniform in size or development. In natural fibers, fineness is a major factor in determining quality. Cotton, flax wool and silk all are natural fibers. Man-made fiber diamet 4 er is controlled by the size of the spinneret holes and by stretching during or after spinning. Polyester was first made in 1951. man-made fibers can be made uniform in diameter or can be thick and thin at regular intervals throughout their length.
