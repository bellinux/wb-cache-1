30|$|In the experiments, {{we compare}} PARE against the {{original}} transaction pipeline implementation and a well-adopted popular CC mechanism MVCC. The evaluation is performed on contended workloads representing the HFT application and a widely adopted OLTP benchmark TPC-C. The HFT workload runs on a simplified stock exchange market {{based on a}} single table: Stock(SecurityName, Price, Time, Quantity). Each item in the stock table <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> in the market with its name, latest price, latest trading time and the accumulated trading quantity. The HFT workload runs a unique type of transaction parameterized by <b>a</b> vector of <b>security</b> names. The n security names are selected by a portfolio selection algorithm. This design is motivated by the typical OLTP workload TPC-E, except that it allows various degrees of contention. In every f seconds, 5 out of n random securities are selected as strong investment signals. We mimic the dynamic nature and different degrees of contention of HFT applications by adjusting f and n, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{vulnerability}} {{that has}} been discovered but is unpatched <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> risk to <b>a</b> system. During the lifetime of a software system, new vulnerabilities are discovered over time. There are two opposing actors, the patch developers and the potential exploiters. An exploit can happen immediately after a disclosure, perhaps even before the disclosure if the discovery is made by a black-hat finder. Here, a framework for software risk evaluation {{with respect to the}} vulnerability lifecycle is proposed. Risk can be evaluated using the likelihood of <b>a</b> <b>security</b> breach and the impact of that adverse event on the system. The proposed approach models the vulnerability lifecycle as a stochastic process. Some of the CVSS metrics can be used to evaluate the impact of the breach. The model uses the information about the transition rates with the related distributions and can lead to simplified as well as detailed modeling methods. It allows a comparison of software systems in terms of the risk and potential approaches for optimization of remediation...|$|R

CEAS designs five enforcement mechanisms and the related message format to authenticate and authorize clientless endpoints. Furthermore, after the endpoints have connected to the networks, their initial determinations may be dynamically modified according to the updated circumstances. The experiment results prove that CEAS has the capability of effectively and flexibly making clientless endpoints access to trusted networks in a controlled and secure manner...|$|R
