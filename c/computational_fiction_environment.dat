25|$|Stargate SG-1 {{takes place}} in a {{military}} science <b>fiction</b> <b>environment</b> and employs the common science fiction concepts of strongly differentiated characters fighting an unequivocally evil enemy (the Goa'uld). However, it links alien races with well-known Earth mythologies, by use of the central Stargate device. Near-instantaneous interplanetary travel allows quick narrative shifts between the politics on Earth and the realities of fighting an interstellar war. Stargate SG-1 gradually evolves the basic premise of the Stargate film into its own unique mythological superstructure, expanding upon Egyptian mythology (notably the gods Apep/Apophis and Anubis as Goa'uld villains), Norse mythology (notably the god Thor as an Asgard ally) and Arthurian legend (notably Merlin as an Ancient ally against the god-like Ori), among others. SG-1 introduces new alien races (as opposed to alien human civilizations) less often than other science fiction television series and integrates newly encountered races or visited planets in stand-alone episodes into its established mythology while leaving the plotlines accessible for new audience members. Despite the show's extensive intergalactic mythology and science fiction elements, scholar M. Keith Booker considered SG-1 ultimately character-driven and heavily dependent on the camaraderie among the SG-1 members.|$|R

50|$|Games Workshop's Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40,000 games feature Orcs ('Orks' in Warhammer 40,000). The latter {{setting is}} unique for {{featuring}} Orks in a science <b>fiction</b> <b>environment</b> that {{are capable of}} building crude, but functional vehicles, firearms and even spaceships. Anatomically, Warhammer Orcs are no taller than humans, unless when they are standing upright instead of slouching, but are substantially broader, with ape-like short legs and long arms. They have massive heads that come directly forward on their necks, giving them a stooping appearance. They have tough thick green skin that is highly resistant to pain. Warhammer Orcs lack intelligence, but can be cunning at times. They are warlike and their society is geared towards constant warfare. Their constant need to fight is an expression of Orc culture: Orcs do not form alliances except for temporary alliances with each other. In combat they can transform even the most common object into a lethal killing instrument. Orcs tend to ally with Goblins, who are called Gretchin in Warhammer 40,000, and Snotlings, but when allied, the Orcs act as bullies towards their smaller Goblinoid (Orkoid in Warhammer 40,000) cousins, using them as servants, Human (Goblin) shields, or an emergency food source. They worship a pair of gods known as Gork and Mork (other gods were included in earlier editions of the game, but are no longer included), one of which is described as brutally cunning and the other as cunningly brutal, though the orcs themselves do not seem to know which is which. In Warhammer 40,000, orks develop from a fungus-like beginning. They are spread by spores which are emitted constantly during an ork's lifetime and are all expelled when it dies.|$|R

40|$|Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS) are {{critical}} to the operation of satellites that require attitude knowledge and/or attitude control to achieve mission success. Furthermore, ADCS systems only operate as designed in the reduced friction, micro-gravity environment of space. Simulating these characteristics of space in a laboratory environment {{in order to test}} individual ADCS components and integrated ADCS systems is an important but challenging step in verifying and validating a satellite's ADCS design. The purpose of this thesis is to design and develop an ADCS testbed capable of simulating the reduced <b>fiction,</b> micro-gravity <b>environment</b> of space within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Space Systems Laboratory. The ADCS testbed is based on a tabletop style, three degree of freedom, rotational air bearing, which uses four reaction wheels for attitude control and a series of sensors for attitude determination. The testbed includes all the equipment necessary to allow for closed loop testing of individual ADCS components and integrated ADCS systems in the simulated inertial environment of space. In addition to the physical ADCS testbed, a MATLAB Simulink based model of the ADCS testbed is developed to predict the performance of hardware components and software algorithms before the components and algorithms are integrated into the ADCS testbed. The final objective of this thesis is to validate the operation of the ADCS testbed and simulation to prepare the tool for use by satellite design teams. by Corey Whitcomb Crowell. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The Internet has {{transformed}} the reality of brazilian television, and changed the way of watching its programming. Aligned with a research published in 2015 by the Ministry of Communication that indicates that 42 % {{of the population is}} connected at least four hours a day to the Internet, Rede Globo has been testing a new model of television drama based on the transmedia storytelling. Such phenomenon constitutes in a trend that shows a new stage of involvement between the receptor and the products of entertainment offered. The success of Cheias de Charme, the 7 pm soap opera broadcasted by Rede Globo in 2012, is the result of an experiment that overlapped a <b>fiction</b> <b>environment</b> to a simulated reality scenario. In that context, the viewer is stimulated to move along the several platforms where the plot develops (television, radio, websites and social networks) in a way to fulfill the whole of the plot. Capable of uniting the two contexts (the real and the pseudo-fiction), the Internet was used as a mean (1) and as an object of soap opera. In the first hypothesis (1) it serves as a link between the two atmospheres where the plot develops. In the second (2), the world wide web is addressed as a theme in the script itself, being treated as agent of social transformation, mainly when the phenomenon empreguetes was propelled. This dissertation has as an objective to comprehend the transmedia strategies adopted by the soap opera Cheias de Charme for the launching of the clip Vida de Empreguete. From the content analysis techniques (Bardin, 2009) applied to the body of seven chapters and the materials published on the web – (www. globo. com/cheiasdecharme) and social networks that surround the clip, it was possible to identify the importance of the usage of Internet in the ambience of the soap opera (fiction) as well as outside of it (pseudo-reality and reality). A internet transformou a realidade da televisão brasileira e mudou a forma de assistir a programação. Alinhada à pesquisa divulgada em 2015 pelo Ministério das Comunicações, que indica que 42 % da população está conectada pelo menos quatro horas por dia à internet, a Rede Globo vem testando um novo modelo de teledramaturgia, baseado na narrativa transmidiática. Tal fenômeno se constitui em tendência que demonstra um novo grau de envolvimento entre o receptor e os produtos de entretenimento ofertados. O sucesso de Cheias de Charme, novela das 19 horas exibida pela Rede Globo em 2012, é resultado de um experimento que sobrepôs um ambiente de ficção a um cenário de simulação da realidade. Nesse contexto, o telespectador é incitado a transitar entre as diversas plataformas, nas quais a trama se desenrola (televisão, rádio, websites e redes sociais), de forma a completar o círculo da trama. Capaz de unir os dois contextos (simulação da realidade e realidade), a internet foi utilizada como meio (1) e objeto da telenovela (2). Na primeira hipótese (1), ela serve como elo entre as duas atmosferas onde a trama se desenvolve. Na segunda, a rede mundial de computadores é abordada como temática no próprio roteiro, sendo tratada como agente de transformação social, principalmente quando da propulsão do fenômeno empreguetes. Esta dissertação tem como objetivo compreender as estratégias transmidiáticas adotadas pela novela Cheias de Charme para o lançamento do clipe Vida de Empreguete. A partir das técnicas de análise do conteúdo (Bardin, 2009) aplicadas ao corpus de sete capítulos e os materiais divulgados na web - site (www. globo. com/cheiasdecharme) e redes sociais que envolvem o clipe - foi possível identificar a importância do uso da internet, tanto no ambiente da novela (ficção) quanto fora dela (simulação da realidade e realidade) ...|$|R
40|$|Tese (doutorado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Comunicação e Expressão, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Literatura, Florianópolis, 2011 Este trabalho desenvolve uma abordagem das narrativas Terra sonâmbula (Mia Couto, 1992) e Ventos do apocalipse (Paulina Chiziane, 1999), à luz da teoria ecofeminista. A partir dos dois textos citados, que têm em comum a guerra civil em Moçambique (1976 - 1992), analisamos os romances à luz da teoria acima citada, ressaltando interações interpessoais e dessas com o meio ambiente, levando em conta os níveis de destruição a que o país se viu mergulhado, desde a luta por sua independência política. Neste sentido, observando que relações de gênero e meio ambiente se entrecruzam, temos, representado nas duas ficções, o colonialismo português, gerando ambientes destruídos e destruidores para o ser humano, uma vez que o imperialismo das metrópoles se apropriou de bens necessários (tais como os recursos naturais da então colônia) para o seu próprio abastecimento. Além disso, também gerou, após o fim do sistema opressor, lutas armadas e propagação de violência entre grupos tnicoraciais. Em vista do exposto, o ecofeminismo tem se afirmado pela discussão que amplia os estudos feministas, ao realizar, nas obras supracitadas, questionamentos sobre impactos ambientais. Para tanto, emprega estudos interdisciplinares, que vão desde a compreensão da natureza do espaço, bem como análise da geografia {{cultural}} de cada lugar em foco. Ao incorporar uma gama de saberes amplos e diversificados, presentes nos romances citados, o ecofeminismo também aponta para o fim da existência de verdades absolutas como a dicotomia hierárquica entre humanos e não humanos e, ainda, integra o humano à natureza, como um de seus elementos constitutivos. This thesis analyzes two narratives from Mozambique: Terra sonâmbula (Mia Couto, 1992) and Ventos do apocalipse (Paulina Chiziane, 1999), {{in light}} of the ecofeminist theory. From the two text cited, which have in common the civil war in that country (1976 - 1992), we analyze the two novels {{in the light of the}} above-mentioned theory emphasizing interpersonal relationships and those with the environment, taking into account the levels of destruction that the country was plunged since its struggle for political independence. In this regard, noting that relationships of gender and the environment intersect, we see Portuguese colonialism represented in both <b>fictions,</b> creating <b>environments</b> destroyed and destructive to humanity, once the imperial metropolis has taken over necessary goods (such as natural resources of the colony) for their own survival. Moreover, this oppressive system has generated violence and wars among ethnic-racial groups, even after the end of colonialism. In view of these facts, ecofeminism has established itself by the discussion that these two books raise, by questioning the environmental impacts, extending feminist studies. To this end, it employs interdisciplinary studies, ranging from understanding the nature of space as well as analysis of the cultural geography of each place in focus. By incorporating a range of broad and diverse knowledge, present in the novels mentioned, ecofeminism also points to the end of the existence of absolute truths such as the hierarchical dichotomy between human and nonhuman, integrating humans to the natural world, as one of its components.

40|$|Esta dissertação tem como objetivo estudar o problema do mal através da {{literatura}} com o auxílio da hermenêutica filosófica literária. Para desenvolver esse tema, em primeiro lugar, buscamos localizar este estudo dentro das ciências das religiões. Propomos que a hermenêutica pode ser uma mediadora entre filosofia, teologia, ciências das religiões e suas respectivas abordagens à religião. Depois, apresentamos exemplarmente como as discussões da filosofia, da teologia e das ciências das religiões ocorrem dentro da literatura. Mostramos também, brevemente, como o problema do mal se coloca como tema de interesse para a filosofia e para a teologia. No final da primeira parte, introduzimos C. S. Lewis, o autor cuja a obra Além do planeta silencioso é o objeto do nosso estudo e expomos a metodologia dessa dissertação. No segundo capítulo, discutimos panoramicamente o problema do mal na filosofia e na teologia. Em seguida, apresentamos um painel com os principais estudos que examinam {{a interface}} entre o problema do mal e as obras de C. S. Lewis. Ao final do capítulo, elencamos as principais categorias/aspectos do problema do mal que são articuladas na abordagem apologética de Lewis em O problema do sofrimento e que ecoam na narrativa ficcional do nosso objeto de estudo. As principais categorias/aspectos do problema do mal que se relacionam com o primeiro volume da Trilogia cósmica são: a onipotência divina, a queda do homem, o sofrimento humano e o sofrimento animal. Para estudar o problema do mal na literatura, buscamos na hermenêutica filosófica literária de Paul Ricoeur um modelo de análise. Abstraímos da obra Tempo e narrativa a tríplice mimese ricoeuriana como roteiro para o estudo de Além do planeta silencioso. Por fim, aplicamos o modelo resultante à análise do primeiro volume da Trilogia cósmica de C. S. Lewis. Em mímesis I, estudamos a ambientação da ficção e os personagens da história. Em mímesis II, localizamos o capítulo da obra onde a narrativa pode ser vista como um todo. Então, descrevemos como as categorias/aspectos do problema do mal são articuladas nessa parte de Além do planeta silencioso, verificamos como a narrativa compartilha elementos do corpo literário da época em que foi produzida e como ela rompe com essa tradição. Em mímesis III, abordamos os valores e as implicações éticas práticas que podem ser verificadas na leitura do livro. C. S. Lewis propõe em sua narrativa uma teodiceia desde um ponto de vista teísta cristão, utilizando-se da ficção para transmitir sua maneira de entender o problema do mal e suas implicações. This thesis {{has as its}} goal to study the problem of evil through literature {{with the aid of}} the literary philosophical hermeneutics. In order to develop this theme, in first place, we seek to localize this study within the religion studies. We propose that hermeneutics can be a mediator among philosophy, theology, religion studies, and their respective approaches to religion. Next, we present exemplary how the discussions of philosophy, theology, and religion studies occur inside literature. We show also, briefly, how the problem of evil is placed as a theme of interest for philosophy and theology. At the end of this part, we present C. S. Lewis, the author whose work Out of the Silent Planet is the object of our study, and we expose the methodology of this thesis. In the second chapter, we discuss panoramically the problem of evil in philosophy and theology. Then, we present a panel with the major studies that examine the interface between the problem of evil and the works of C. S. Lewis. At the end of the chapter, we list the main categories/aspects of the problem of evil which are articulated in the apologetic approach of Lewis in The Problem of Pain, and that echoes in the fictional narrative of our object of study. The main categories/aspects of the problem of evil, which relate to the first volume of the Space Trilogy are: divine omnipotence, the fall of man, the human pain and the animal pain. In order to study the problem of evil in the literature, we seek in the literary philosophical hermeneutics of Paul Ricoeur a model of analysis. We abstract from the work Time and Narrative the Ricoeurian triple mímesis as an itinerary for the study of Out of the Silent Planet. At last, we apply the resulting model to the analysis of the first volume of the C. S. Lewis’s Space Trilogy. In mímesis I, we study the <b>fiction</b> <b>environment</b> and the characters of the story. In mímesis II, we locate the chapter in the work where the narrative {{can be seen as a}} whole. Then, we describe how the categories/aspects of the problem of evil are articulated in this part of Out of the Silent Planet, we verify how the narrative shares elements of the literature body of the time in which it was produced, and how it breaks from this tradition. In mímesis III, we approach the values and the ethical practical implications that can be verified in the reading of the book. C. S. Lewis proposes in his narrative a theodicy from a theist Christian standpoint, using fiction to transmit his way of understanding the problem of evil and its implications...|$|R

This {{chapter is}} {{based on the work of}} the Open Graves, Open Minds: Vampires and the Undead in Modern Culture Research Project at the University of Hertfordshire. The project relates the undead in literature, art, and other media to {{questions}} concerning gender, technology, consumption, and social change, and was initiated by a conference in April 2010. The project has generated a series of events, publications, and inspiring discussions. Select papers from the 2010 conference have appeared in a special edition of Gothic Studies (May 2013); other papers and specially commissioned chapters appear in a monograph, Open Graves, Open Minds: Representations of Vampires and the Undead from the Enlightenment to the Present (Manchester: MUP, 2013). Further publications will follow and more conferences are planned, including ???The Company of Wolves': Sociality, Animality, and Subjectivity in Literary and Cultural Narratives-Werewolves, Shapeshifters, and Feral Humans' - a conference to be held at UH in July 2015. OGOM has generated a Gothic Reading Group, and recruited 2 PhD students, one working on vampires and the other on werewolves. The project is clearly unusual in deriving its content directly from popular culture, and in its capacity to network with fans and enthusiasts well beyond the normal limitations of the academy. Graham Holderness's Black and Deep Desires: William Shakespeare Vampire Hunter (Top Hat Books, 2015), draws Shakespeare studies and historical <b>fiction</b> into the <b>environment</b> of the undead. This chapter will explore how the novel was produced by linking academic considerations with popular enthusiasm and exploratory creative writing. It will reference other parallel experiments such as Lori Handl???s Shakespeare Undead and the film Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. The main objective is to reveal the creative potentiality of a Shakespeare liberated from the academy and thrown wide open to communities of users...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{intersection}} of discourses on British girlhood and the film fan magazine in the interwar period. Whilst national print media had developed a substantial body of film magazines that broadly targeted and solicited a female readership in this period, a particular thread of this discourse was aimed at younger readers and fans. In their advertising, serialisation of recent film fictions and courtship of readers through competitions and letter writing, fan magazines used film culture to communicate with an emergent image of the young female cinemagoer. In the process, magazines like Girls’ Cinema constructed a film inflected girlhood, channeled through both a shared community of cinemagoing experiences and the interaction of girl fans with models of youthful femininity {{on and off the}} screen. Magazines structured interactive spaces and distinct modes of address for a youth readership; some papers included “young picturegoer” sections, others retained a core focus on youthful starlets as a touch point for their readers, particularly through the figure of the adult-adolescent construct “Little Mary” Pickford. They also borrowed and adapted an intimate mode of address from their working girl story paper counterparts to construct the reader as friend and confidant, linked to a wider community of young readers through their shared tastes and desires. The film fan magazine could be a place for young female readers to both learn by example from their favourite stars, but also to access advice on social etiquette, fashion, dance and courtship through gossip pages and question and answer sections, using film as a backdrop for navigating contemporary models of girlhood. The chapter pays specific attention {{to the ways in which}} the magazines crafted a distinctly national set of discourses on young female cinemagoing and star consumption, navigating an often conflicting pull between glamour and restraint, modernity and tradition.
