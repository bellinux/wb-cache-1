2500|$|A {{biosafety}} level {{is a set}} of biocontainment precautions required to isolate dangerous biological agents in an enclosed laboratory facility. The <b>levels</b> of <b>containment</b> range from the lowest {{biosafety level}} 0 (BSL-0) to the highest at level 4 (BSL-4). In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have specified these levels. In the European Union, the same biosafety levels are defined in a directive. In Canada the four levels are known as <b>Containment</b> <b>Levels.</b> Facilities with these designations are also sometimes given as P1 through P4 (for Pathogen or Protection level), as in the term [...] "P3 laboratory".|$|R
50|$|Zoonotics/Emerging Diseases (Special Pathogens) - This is the <b>Containment</b> <b>Level</b> 4 (CL4) Section of NCFAD. CL4 {{is where}} {{scientists}} can work safely {{with the most}} serious viruses. The Section provides expertise {{in the area of}} special pathogens, particularly the CL4 agents and zoonotic <b>containment</b> <b>level</b> 3 agents of veterinary importance such as Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Ebola virus and Rift Valley fever virus. The Section maintains a state of readiness for emergencies or outbreak situations through research, technical development, training and scientific consultation. Protected by positive pressure suits, bench work with infectious agents is conducted in a highly specialized CFIA <b>containment</b> <b>level</b> 4 laboratory. Attached directly to this laboratory is a containment cubicle that allows work with large animals under the CL4 conditions. The staff members receive extensive training prior to work in CL4 and CL3 zoonotic.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to operating a <b>Containment</b> <b>Level</b> (CL) 2 laboratory {{as well as}} extensive CL3 laboratories, NCFAD also operates a <b>Containment</b> <b>Level</b> 4 laboratory, which provides the capability to work safely with the most serious viruses. A Level 4 laboratory is designed for agents that usually produce very serious and untreatable diseases, which can be spread easily through airborne or casual contact. All animal diseases classed as Level 4 are zoonotic, meaning that they can transfer to humans. Staff wear pressurized biosafety suits which are disinfected after each session. All air and waste are sterilized on exit.|$|E

Laboratory work with GMOs classified as low risk, which include knockout mice, are carried out in PC1 lab. This is the case for modifications that do not confer an advantage to the animal or doesn't secrete any infectious agents. If a laboratory strain that is used isn't covered by exempt dealings or the inserted DNA could code for a pathogenic gene, it must be carried out in a PC2 laboratory.|$|E

30|$|From the {{evaluation}} of the data presented for the three assessment categories in GM maize applications, we conclude {{that there is a need}} for an improvement of the ERA and its data base if cultivation is envisaged. This requires a broader ERA concept that includes a thorough exposure analysis and the scientific evaluation of the whole GMP at different <b>containment</b> <b>levels</b> guided by testable risk hypotheses. Risk conclusions should be based on relevant data specifically generated for and using the GM event in question. Basic information on the agronomic characteristics and the efficacy of the GMP as well as its environmental behaviour must be provided for the ERA. The corresponding herbicide and its agronomic and environmental consequences also need to be taken into account. Such an approach would significantly strengthen the risk conclusions and their credibility.|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} of crewed spacecraft requires identifying and evaluating chemical compounds that may present reactivity and compatibility risks with the environmental control and life support (ECLS) system. Such risks must be understood so that appropriate design and operational controls, including specifying <b>containment</b> <b>levels,</b> can be instituted or an appropriate substitute material selected. Operational experience acquired during the International Space Station (ISS) program has found that understanding ECLS system and environmental impact presented by thermal control system working fluids is imperative to safely operating any crewed space exploration vehicle. Perfluorocarbon fluids are used as working fluids in thermal control fluid loops on board the ISS. Also, payload hardware developers have identified perfluorocarbon fluids as preferred thermal control working fluids. Interest in using perfluorocarbon fluids as thermal control system working fluids for future crewed space vehicles and outposts is high. Potential hazards associated with perfluorocarbon fluids are discussed with specific attention given to engineering assessment of ECLS system compatibility, compatibility testing results, and spacecraft environmental impact.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a delay compensation algorithm for a Gaze-contingent video Compression System (GCS) with a robust Targeted Gaze Containment (TGC) performance. The TGC parameter allows varying compression levels of a gaze-contingent video stream by controlling its perceptual quality. The delay compensation model {{presented in this}} paper is based on the Kalman filter framework that models human visual system with eye position and velocity data. The model predicts future eye position and constructs a high quality coded Region of Interest (ROI) designed to contain a targeted amount of gaze samples while reducing perceptual quality in the periphery of that region. Several model parameterization schemes were tested with 21 subjects and the delay range of 0. 02 - 2 s and targeted gaze containment of 60 - 90 %. The results indicate that the model was able to achieve targeted gaze <b>containment</b> <b>levels</b> with compression of 1. 4 - 2. 3 times for TGC= 90 % and compression of 1. 8 - 2. 5 for TGC= 60 %.

40|$|Greenhouses are a well-accepted {{containment}} {{strategy to}} grow and study genetically modified plants (GM) before release into the environment. Various <b>containment</b> <b>levels</b> are requested by national regulations to minimize GM pollen escape. We tested the amount of pollen escaping from a standard greenhouse, {{which can be used}} for EU containment classes 1 and 2. More specifically, we investigated the hypothesis whether pollen escape could be minimized by insect-proof netting in front of the roof windows, since the turbulent airflow around the mesh wiring could avoid pollen from escaping. We studied the pollen flow out of greenhouses with and without insect netting of two non-transgenic crops, Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and Corn (Zea Mays). Pollen flow was assessed with Rotorod® pollen samplers positioned inside and outside the greenhouse’ roof windows. A significant proportion of airborne pollen inside the greenhouse leaves through roof windows. Moreover, the lighter pollen of Lolium escaped more readily than the heavier pollen of Maize. In contrast to our expectations, we did not identify any reduction in pollen flow with insect netting in front of open windows, even under induced airflow conditions. We conclude that insect netting, often present by default in greenhouses, is not effective in preventing pollen escape from greenhouses of wind-pollinated plants for containment classes 1 or 2. Further research would be needed to investigate whether other alternative strategies, including biotic ones, are more effective. ...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} 2002, an {{outbreak}} of a new viral respiratory illness, called SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus), occurred in China. The disease spread over Asia, North America, Europe and Africa. In response to the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated an international collaboratorion that included clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory investigations, and initiated efforts to control the spread of SARS. As in other countries, Belgium has been decided to establish biosafety guidelines and recommendations with particular emphasis on handling clinical specimens associated with SARS for research, production, and clinical laboratories. Taking into account that there is so far no SARS case reported in Belgium {{as well as in}} other countries in the world, and based on a scientific risk assessment related to the contained use of biological agents, the SARS-CoV was classified as a Risk Group 3 agent. In relation to the reported biosafety assessment, the SARS-CoV should be handled in appropriate biosafety <b>containment</b> <b>levels</b> to avoid laboratory-acquired infections and spread of the disease in the human population and the environment. Therefore, diagnostics activities with inactivated clinical specimens associated with SARS cases and with specimens originating in countries where SARS is documented but associated with SARS cases should be performed under Biosafety Level 2 (BSL- 2) conditions. Diagnostic activities involving non activated clinical specimens associated with SARS should be carried out under biosafety BSL- 2 containment with BSL- 3 safety equipment and work practices.

CL3 emphasizes additional primary and secondary barriers to minimize the release of infectious organisms into the immediate laboratory and the environment. Additional features to prevent transmission of CL3 organisms are appropriate respiratory protection, HEPA filtration of exhausted laboratory air, and strictly controlled laboratory access. Examples include tuberculosis; West Nile virus; and pandemic H1N1 influenza.|$|E

50|$|A small {{percentage}} of laboratory space (3.6%) is devoted to <b>Containment</b> <b>Level</b> 4 (CL4) at NML. These agents {{have the potential for}} aerosol transmission, often have a low infectious dose and produce very serious and often fatal disease; there is no licensed treatment or vaccine available. This level of containment represents an isolated unit independent of other areas. CL4 emphasizes maximum containment of the infectious agent by completely sealing the facility perimeter with confirmation by negative pressure testing; isolation of the researcher from the pathogen by an enclosed positive pressure suit; and decontamination of air and all other materials. Examples include Ebola; Nipah; Marburg; and 1918 pandemic influenza.|$|E
40|$|Effective {{containment}} of arthropod vectors {{of infectious diseases}} is necessary to prevent transmission of pathogens by released, infected vectors and to prevent vectors that escape from establishing populations that subsequently con-tribute to increased disease. Although rare, past releases illustrate what can go wrong and justify the need for guide-lines that minimize risks. An overview of recommendations for insectary facilities, practices, and equipment is provided, and features of four recently published and increasingly rigorous arthropod <b>containment</b> <b>levels</b> (ACLs 1 - 4) are sum-marized. ACL- 1 is appropriate for research that constitutes the lowest risk level, including uninfected arthropods or vectors that are infected with micro-organisms that do not cause disease in humans, domestic animals, or wildlife. ACL- 2 is appropriate for indigenous and exotic arthropods that represent a moderate risk, including vectors infected or suspected of being infected with biosafety level (BSL) - 2 infectious agents and arthropods that have been genetically modified in ways that do not significantly affect their fe-cundity, survival, host preference, or vector competence. ACL- 3 is recommended for arthropods that are or may be infected with BSL- 3 infectious agents. ACL- 3 places greater emphasis on pathogen containment and more re-stricted access to the insectary than ACL- 2. ACL- 4 is in-tended for arthropods that are infected with the most dangerous BSL- 4 infectious agents, which can cause life-threatening illness by aerosol or arthropod bite. Adherence to these guidelines will result in laboratory-based arthropod vector research that minimizes risks and results in important new contributions to applied and basic science.
