40|$|This article aims at {{improving}} {{the analysis of}} Cukierman（ 1992 ）on the role of central bank independence on economic performance of developing countries by recognizing the importance of <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> of central bank law in terms of clarity of objective（s）, accountability, tranparency, coordination and contingency measures of the central bank. For this purpose, we construct a <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> index. Our empirical study suggests that increasing the level of legal central bank independence {{is associated with the}} reduction in long-term average inflation rates. From short-term analysis, beyond central bank independence, <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> is discovered as another significant independent factor that has implications on macroeconomic performance. In the short-term, while increasing central bank independence may cause tradeoffs on real growth and unemployment, promoting <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> tends to lead only to benefits. Moreover, exchange rate regime also plays a significant role in influencing the nature of tradeoffs of central bank independence and benefits of <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> on macroeconomic variables. Our main recommendation for developing countries where in the average inflation rates are not excessive is that the emphasis should be placed more on <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> of central bank law than on legal central bank independence for a preferable short-term macroeconomic performance...|$|R
40|$|Did the EU {{pressure}} improve <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> in the Czech and Slovak Republics? The paper {{analyzes the}} current state of the Czech and Slovak quality of <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> in a context of the European Union accession. We looked at different kinds of corruption indicator data, such as statistics of revealed and clarified malfeasance connected with corruption per 100 capita and the composite indexes. These indicators suggest that the quality of the <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> in the Czech and Slovak Republics has not improved after joining the European Union. More precisely, it can be argued that in spite of implementation of anti-corruption public policies proposed by EU institutions, perceived corruption of public officials has remained the same, which means that trustworthiness of <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> responsible for deterrence and reduction of corruption remained the same as well. Therefore, in order to improve the quality of the <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement,</b> reduction of barriers to entry and deeper legal reforms is suggested.

40|$|The {{evidence}} suggests that relational contracting and legal rules {{play an important role}} in credit markets but on the basis of the prevailing field data it is difficult to pin down their causal impact. Here we show experimentally that relational incentives are a powerful causal determinant for the existence and performance of credit markets. In fact, in the absence of <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> and reputation formation opportunities the credit market breaks down almost completely while if reputation formation is possible a stable credit market emerges even in the absence of <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> of debt repayment. Introducing <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> of repayments causes a further significant increase in credit market trading but has only a surprisingly small impact on overall efficiency. The reason is that <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> of debt repayments weakens relational incentives and exacerbates another moral hazard problem in credit markets – the choice of inefficient high-risk projects. credit markets, relationship lending, reputation formation, <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement...</b>|$|R

The important legal {{problem to}} study is how <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> towards environmental destruction as result of illegal limestone mining in Gunungkidul Regency {{and what are}} barriers in <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> towards environmental destruction as result of illegal limestone mining in Gunungkidul Regency. The purpose {{of this research was}} to know on <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> towards environmental destruction as result of illegal limestone mining in Gunungkidul Regency, to know the barriers faced in <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> towards environmental destruction as result of illegal limestone mining in Gunungkidul Regency. The method of research was empirically conducted by primary data. The method of information collection was directly conducted with concerning parties on the object understudied of which is used as primary data and secondary data gained from literature could be in other regulations, Constitution of 1945, The Act Number 11 of 1967 on Primary Determination of Mining, The Act Number 4 of 2009 on Mineral and Coal, Regional Regulation Number 11 of 2003 on Efforts of Mining Material. From the result of this research, it shows that <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> towards the illegal limestone mining has not been conducted maximally on the ground of the lack of local society’s comprehension on license in mining field as a result of relatively still low educational level, the limitation on socialization of regulations or legislation from the government to the society, the limited personal to conduct supervisory and order thus there are still society that conduct illegal mining. Thus the advice given is socialization of regional regulation to governmental apparatus, the apparatus relating to the authority, the license granting to society on the importance of license and its method, includes in managing license, opening new working field, hopefully the government becomes firmer in conducting enforcement of regional regulation, it is established a particular institution whose task is supervising mining process...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we test {{different}} theories on debt maturity {{that can be}} ascribed to either the demand or the supply side of the market. Firm risk, asymmetric information, agency costs are all aspects {{that should be considered}} in the analysis. We also include leverage in the firm decision process regarding debt maturity, relying on a simultaneous equations approach. Among Italian industrial firms, theories based on lenders using debt maturity to address information problems and default risk seem to have strong explanatory power. The demand side of the market appears to be less important in determining debt maturity. The role of the supply side of the market is confirmed when considering <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> of loan contracts. Where <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> is low, the negative consequences of asymmetric information are worse for lenders and this explains why they give more importance to asymmetric information proxies in determining debt maturity. corporate finance, debt maturity, <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement...</b>|$|R

40|$|Corruption is {{believed}} to be a major factor impeding economic development, but the importance of <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> versus cultural norms in controlling corruption is poorly understood. To disentangle these two factors, we exploit a natural experiment, the stationing of thousands of diplomats from around the world in New York City. Diplomatic immunity means there was essentially zero <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> of diplomatic parking violations, allowing us to examine the role of cultural norms alone. This generates a revealed preference measure of government officials' corruption based on real-world behavior taking place in the same setting. We find strong persistence in corruption norms: diplomats from high corruption countries (based on existing survey-based indices) have significantly more parking violations, and these differences persist over time. In a second main result, officials from countries that survey evidence indicates have less favorable popular views of the United States commit significantly more parking violations, providing non-laboratory evidence on sentiment in economic decision-making. Taken together, factors other than <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> appear to be important determinants of corruption. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} financial structure based {{on the degree of}} legal protection of creditors and on <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> costs. It has implications for the structure of debt, the threat of financial crises, and the role of monitoring by banks. When legal protection of creditors is weak, monitored lending is required and this leads either to bank-oriented financial systems or family firms. The legal environment to discipline banks (e. g., bank regulation) is a key {{to the success of the}} financial system. When <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> is costly or corrupt, financing must be short-term. The strength of legal protection and the costs of enforcement determine whether banks or firms issue the short-term debt...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relation between}} the quality of <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> of credit contracts and the allocation of credit to households both at a theoretical and empirical level. The theoretical part provides a model of household credit market with secured debt contract, where the judicial system affects the cost that banks face to enforce their right to repossess the collateral. Based on this assumption, the model shows that the working of the judicial system affects both the probability of being credit constrained and the equilibrium amount of debt. In the empirical part, we test our theoretical predictions using data on Italian households and data on the performance of judicial districts. In line with the model, we find that, other things being equal, giving the best degree of <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> in the sample to households living in high-cost judicial districts as Campobasso or Caltanissetta (in southern Italy) reduces the probability of being credit constrained by 70 % and 63 %, respectively. Moreover, the amount of debt of non-rationed households decreases if the quality of judicial enforcement worsens.

The model will focus on the available time-series data during 1992 - 2002 in Egypt. This time period was chosen due to the paucity of quantitative data concerning the model. The institutional environment is examined according to the New Institutional Economics (NIE) to illustrate the legal framework, the informal constraints and the enforcement authorities to support the empirical model. Analytical results show that efficient enforcement of property rights does not only imply increasing <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> through imposing more severe punishments and prosecutions, as decreasing the prices of software plays a much bigger role. Thus relying on <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> authorities alone is not always economically optimal, as it will not be able to deter IPR infringement on its own.

Using a sample of 6, 456 firm-year observations of 1, 084 EU firms during the 1995 to 2006 period, I find evidence that, on average, mandatory introduction of IAS significantly reduces the cost of equity for mandatory adopters by 48 basis points. I also find that this reduction is present only in countries with strong <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement,</b> and that both increased disclosure and enhanced information comparability help explain why IAS reduces the cost of equity.

40|$|The authors {{develop a}} <b>legal</b> {{contract}} <b>enforcement</b> {{theory of the}} own versus lease decision. The allocation of ownership rights will minimize enforcement costs when the legal system is inefficient. In particular, when <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> of contracts is costly, {{there will be a}} shift from arrangements that rely on such enforcement (such as a rental agreement) toward other forms that do not (such as direct ownership). The authors then test this prediction and show that costly enforcement of rental contracts hampers the development of the rental housing market in a cross-section of countries. They argue that this association is not the result of reverse causation from a developed rental market to more investor-protective enforcement and is not driven by alternative institutional channels. The results provide supportive evidence on the importance of <b>legal</b> contract <b>enforcement</b> for market development and the optimal allocation of property rights. ...|$|R

When <b>legal</b> <b>enforcement</b> is poor, consumers connect more with one another to improve informal enforcement. In contrast, a well-connected network of consumers reduces producers'incentives to bribe.
