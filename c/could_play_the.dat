5|$|Although Johnson was {{recruited}} by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, {{he decided to}} play close to home. His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote told him he <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> point guard position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.|$|E
5|$|Like her sisters, she <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> piano {{to a high}} {{standard}} at an early age. Other interests included science and technology, shared by her father Prince Albert, and horseback riding and boating, two of her favourite childhood occupations. However, Helena became a middle daughter following the birth of Princess Louise in 1848, and her abilities were overshadowed by her more artistic sisters.|$|E
50|$|The rules {{concerning}} the play-the-ball were also changed. Only two players <b>could</b> <b>play</b> at <b>the</b> ball, with one player from each side {{being allowed to}} stand immediately behind, and all other players having to stay behind that second man until the ball was heeled. Previously any number of players <b>could</b> <b>play</b> at <b>the</b> ball, and by 1925 play-the-balls had become a real mess.|$|R

[...] Pianist Jay McShann, {{not known}} for {{showering}} compliments on his rivals, said [...] "Art <b>could</b> really <b>play</b> <b>the</b> blues. To me, he was the world's greatest blues player, and I think few people realized that." [...] Tatum's repertoire, however, was predominantly Broadway and popular standards, whose chord progressions and variety better suited his talents.|$|R
5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who {{got the idea for}} the misanthropic title {{character}} from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E

In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard. This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed. The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial.

5|$|Immediately after Ben Silverman {{was named}} {{co-chairman}} of NBC's entertainment division in 2007, he asked Greg Daniels {{to create a}} new comedy series. Silverman and Daniels previously worked together on The Office, a half-hour comedy Daniels adapted from the British comedy of the same name by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Daniels wrote the pilot for what eventually became Parks and Recreation along with series co-creator Michael Schur, who had served as a writer on The Office. Daniels and Schur had been considering ideas for a possible show with cast members Rashida Jones and Aziz Ansari, but the concept for the series did not form until they learned Amy Poehler <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> lead character. Once that casting was determined, the script for the pilot episode was first written in the summer of 2008 revolving around her as a city bureaucrat seeking to turn an enormous construction pit into a park. They also decided the script would include the mockumentary comedy style of The Office and, like that show, would allow for improvisation on set. However, they did not consider the script an Office spin-off and NBC officials vehemently insisted to media outlets that the show was a completely separate series, despite the similarities between the two shows.|$|E
5|$|Luzzaschi's book of madrigals for one, two, {{and three}} sopranos with {{keyboard}} accompaniment, published in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music {{may have been}} kept back from publication {{in order to maintain}} the secrecy of Alfonso's musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding to requests from Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both that male singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means of filling in the counterpoint.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Cadbury parodied the Olympic Games {{by using}} Creme Eggs instead of athletes. The first advert was 31 seconds long and {{consists}} of an Opening Ceremony, performed by stripped and packed Creme Eggs. Each other advert contained a Creme Egg trying to ‘release the goo’ whilst in an Olympic event. An online game was created by Cadbury, so the public <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> ‘Goo Games’. Six events were available to play {{and each of them}} was shown as a cartoon sketch.|$|E

25|$|All ribozymes were {{originally}} {{thought to be}} metallo-enzymes, {{in the sense that}} they were assumed to require the presence of divalent cations, such as Mg2+, for both folding and catalysis. It was presumed that hexahydrated magnesium ions, which exist in equilibrium with magnesium hydroxide, <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> roles of general acid and general base, in a way analogous to those played by two histidines in RNase A. An additional role for divalent metal ions has also been proposed in the form of electrostatic stabilization of the transition-state.|$|E
25|$|The Albion Band {{survived by}} {{becoming}} involved in theatre productions and, from 1993 by shifting down to a small acoustic outfit that <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> still extensive network of folk clubs. This move was also significant in indicating {{the way in which}} electric folk personnel had become assimilated into the folk revival. It is notable that almost all the members of Fairport Convention have toured the folk club circuit solo or in smaller units and the line up at Cropredy includes as many acoustic acts as electric.|$|E
25|$|In {{a senior}} career {{spanning}} 22 seasons, Bradley was renowned {{as one of}} the games tireless champions, and in particular his amazing fitness that meant he <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> physically demanding game of Australian rules football until the age of 38. For much of his career, Bradley played as an outside midfielder, rotating into the forward line during games, where his nous allowed him both to score and assist many goals through his career. In his final few seasons, Bradley spent more time acting as a loose, sweeping half-back flanker, and much of Carlton's drive forward came from his play through the wings.|$|E

The PC version allows up to sixteen people to play together, while the Xbox version allows four players, either via Xbox systemlink or Xbox Live. Unlike the previous games, Serious Sam 2 does not support split-screen gameplay on the PC nor the Xbox.|$|E
25|$|Born into {{a peasant}} family, Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov {{became the first}} artistic {{director}} of the ensemble, choirmaster, conductor, teacher and the public figure who wrote the music to the National Anthem of the Soviet Union. He came from a musical background of hymns and folk songs, <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> viola and had perfect pitch, so he sang in the church choir and performed at festivals. He was heard singing at the village school by PA Zalivuhin, a soloist in the choir at Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg. Zalivuhin persuaded Alexandrov's parents to let the child go to St Petersburg to learn music. In 1898, the young peasant boy became a pupil of the Saint Petersburg Court Chapel.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of the setting, there are several {{different}} types of Exalted, any type of which <b>could</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> role of protagonist or antagonist of the game. The Exalted of Creation can be divided into two categories: Terrestrial Exalted and Celestial Exalted. Celestial Exalted, being the chosen of the Celestial Incarnae, are significantly more powerful than Terrestrial Exalted, and can live for millennia, but their numbers are limited by a fixed number of Exaltations passing from mortal life to mortal life at any given time. Terrestrial Exalted are the chosen of the Elemental Dragons, children of the primordial Gaia, who govern the elemental underpinnings of Creation. While less powerful, Terrestrial Exalted (commonly known as the Dragon-Blooded) can pass on their Exaltation to their children, much like one would pass on other genetic features.|$|E
