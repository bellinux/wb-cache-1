40|$|One of {{the basic}} goals of the EU justice policy is to ensure an {{efficient}} and effective legal protection, particularly in cross-border disputes and cases concerning the violation of rights guaranteed under the EU legislation. In order to accomplish this goal, the EU embarked on a horizontal harmonization of civil procedure in some sectors and reinforced the institutional cooperation of Member States {{in the field of}} civil justice. Concurrently, there were some legal interventions in the field of civil procedure, which contributed to establishing a number of European procedural mechanisms, such as: the European Small Claims Procedure (2007), the European Payment Order Procedure (2006), etc. Many studies and analyses show that procedural mechanisms of collective legal protection are essential for ensuring an efficient and effective legal protection of rights guaranteed by the EU law. The idea of introducing the collective legal protection instruments into the EU law has been present for more than two decades. It has been endorsed by the European Economic and Social Committee, which has played the key role in its promotion. In June 2013, after extensive consultations, the European Commission adopted the Recommendation on common principles for injunctive and compensatory collective redress mechanisms in the Members States concerning violations of rights guaranteed under the EU law. This document has provided a coherent horizontal framework for the collective legal protection at the EU level by establishing the common European principles for collective redress mechanisms which the Member States should incorporate into their national systems. Analysis of the common principles governing the collective legal protection shows that the European approach to shaping the collective redress claims is significantly different from the American class action model, which is considered to be incompatible with the European legal tradition and deemed to provide a wide margin for abuse. The common European principles are universal because they refer to the collective protection of all rights guaranteed under the EU law, including the rights in the area of consumer protection, unfair competition, environment protection, etc. On the other hand, these principles are significant not only for the collective judicial protection but also for the collective protection which is exercised by using out-of-court (alternative) dispute resolution methods. Within the framework of collective judicial protection, the Recommendation includes two basic procedural mechanisms: the injunctive collective action and the compensatory collective action. The former is aimed at prohibiting the harmful or unlawful conduct; the latter enables a number of persons affected by the commission of an unlawful act to seek redress (damages) in a judicial proceeding, which is particularly important in cases where the damage is disproportional to the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The Member States are expected to incorporate the common European principles into their national systems within a period of two years. After four years, in order to ensure a uniform implementation of the Recommendation, the European Commission will assess the need for introducing additional legislative measures...|$|E

40|$|The State Enterprises Act and the Act of Workers Self Management in State Enterprises, both of September 25, 1981, (the Polish Law Gazette — Dz. U. nr 24, section 122 and 123) {{gave rise}} to new types of litigations related to the {{economic}} reform. A principle of independence and of self-financing of State enterprises is evoked in this statutory regulation {{and the rule of}} self management of the enterprises is reflected in constituting bodies of the workers' self management. In order to secure administration's non-contravention of these principles under the valid legislation all disputes between the administration acting in the capability of a founding organ and bodies of an enterprise (director and worker's council) are brought before the general courts. Similarly, inside the enterprise, the issues between its director and the worker's council are resolved before the courts. The disputes between the founding organ and the bodies of the enterprise can concern appointing, recalling and suspending the manager; upholding, revoking or changing a decision of the founding organ regarding operation of the enterprise and liability of the founding organ for damage incurred in implementation of its decisions. The disputes between the director and the worker's council can concern revoking or changing a resolution of the council or a decision of the director. Having analysed a legal character of the issues the author contends that the above are all civil cases and consequently, he finds legitimacy for bringing them before civil courts. The cases are to be tried under the regulation of the Code of Civil Proceedings under the legal process. They are amenable to the material jurisdiction of the district courts and to the territorial jurisdiction of the courts of defendant's seat. A public prosecutor can participate under general rules in hearing of these new cases bringing an action or acceding to the proceedings pending the action. A capacity to be a party in a lawsuit is to be conceded to the director of the enterprise and to the worker's council on the strength of explicit provisions of the Act. In the legal proceedings the council acts via its presidium under the resolution of the whole council. The same prerequisite is also required to grant a power of attorney. Next, the author analyses a capacity to appear in court in various types of the new cases. A plaintiff is legally bound to carry through obligatory conciliatory proceedings in most of the cases. Short terms (1 - 2 weeks) of taking legal action are also fixed by the statute. Breaking the terms results in nonsuit although in exceptional cases, the term can be restored. It is also the case of the term ôf instituting preliminary proceedings before laying an action in court. <b>Costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> are incurred by the enterprise in litigations between the worker's council and the director. Therefore, there is no need of delivering cost decisions. High efficiency of the proceedings affording quick findings becomes a necessity in lawsuits concerning the enterprises. Particular regulations, however, having that end in view are not numerous. In the new cases the courts are not bound with a-statement of claim by virtue of the regulation of the section 321 of the Code of Civil Proceedings. Accordingly, the worker's council and the director are to be treated as the units of socialized economy. The court finds the new cases delivering a judgement. The State Enterprises Act introduced certain limitations of appealing against some of the legal decisions.

40|$|The 1928 law of {{criminal}} procedure previously regulating proceedings {{in cases of}} juveniles did not clearly define the judicial status of parents and guardians in that proceedings. The scope of rights of those persons {{was considered to be}} narrow. They were supposed to be summoned before a court, provided that the service of the documents was not creating particular difficulties. Yet, the court was entitled to demand the obligatory appearance at the hearing, in case of evading that obligation coercive measures provided for witnesses were applied. At the trial, those persons wese vested with the right to make statements and motions. The new act of Oct, 26, 1982 bestowed those persons with the status of litigant parties and extended their rights in a considerable way. The rights of parents and guardians as parties in litigation are autonomous, resulting from the fact of a defined consanguinity or from excercising a guardianship upon a juvenile, established judicially or existing factually. They are not resulting from the statutory representation of a juvenile. Parents and guardians as the litigant parties act in their own name and not {{in the name of a}} juvenile, they do not also have to act on his behalf although they usually do so, the results of their acts do not have to concern a juvenile, as parents and guardians can act in the proceedings in their own favor. It is a different question that usually there is a commutation observed m the roles of a litigant party and a statutory representative of a juvenile whose case is under trial. Applying new judicial provisions is not simple though, as the judicial status of parents and guardiand as the litigant parties is presently determined by the three normative acts. Apart of the mentioned act of 1982 on proceedings in cases of juveniles the regulations provided in Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure has also to be applied. Provisions of civil law procedure of nonlitigious mode are employed in case of examination and clarification proceedings, in guardian's and educational proceedings, in cases of applying medical and educational measures and partly in appeal proceedings. But if the evidence taking acts are performed by the Citizens' Militia provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure must be applied then, irrespectively of the stage and mode of the proceedings. Provisions of that Code also apply in reformatory proceedings and partly in appeal proceedings if the decision of reformatory measure is being appealed against or if the appeal demands applying that measure, as well as in criminal proceedings when it is conducted against a juvenile on exceptional bases in cases defined in the act. The detailed discussion of the scope of rights and obligations of parents and guardians in the proceedings in cases of juveniles as well as various complexities observed in the new regulation can be found in the published article. The author discusses, among the other things, the acceptable direction of parents' and guardians' acts in the proceedings in cases of juveniles, concurrence with the status of injured party, measures to be applied directly to the parents as eg. imposition of a duty to redress the damage, caused by a juvenile, burdening with <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings,</b> etcDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E
40|$|Naše je vreme obeleženo imperativom ubrzanja pravozaštitnih postupaka i smanjivanja njihove cene koštanja. Ista je pojava prisutna, manje ili više, kako u domenu “javne”, tako i “privatne” pravde. Rad predstavlja pokušaj analize mera racionalizacije vremena i smanjivanja utrošaka novca sadržanih u novim arbitražnim pravilima ICC 2012. Ove mere uređuju (i) ročišta za izvođenje dokaza na kojima se, po pravilu, pojavljuju svedoci i veštaci kao dokazna sredstva za utvđivanje činjenica slučaja, a ponekad i za utvrđivanje pravnih normi. Kao takvi oni su dragoceni i nezaobilazni činioci u procesu donošenja arbitražne odluke pa se postavlja pitanje isplativosti racionalizacije u ovome domenu. Pitanje je, dakle, mogu li se u dokaznom postupku, najzahtevnijem sa aspekta vremena i utroška novca, postići uštede uz zadržavanje zadovoljavajućeg kvaliteta odluka?The {{necessity}} {{of increasing the}} speed of judicial and para-judicial proceedings and reducing their costs appears as a major concern of all arbitral institutions and represents a priority issue in their agendas. The same is true {{in the realm of}} “public” justice and the means for protection of rights before State courts. Given that ICC arbitration {{is one of the biggest}} and the most renowned arbitral institutions in the world, and that it is committed to rendering its proceedings more efficient and less costly, in this paper the author tried to analyze its measures aimed at improving time management and reducing <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> introduced in the new 2012 ICC Arbitration Rules. These measures include, inter alia, evidentiary hearings at which both witnesses and experts appear and help establishing the facts of the case and sometimes even the content of the applicable law. Due to their role, witnesses and experts are indispensable actors in the process of making the arbitral decision, so it is necessary to explore the options for rendering their participation more efficient. Firstly, it is legitimate to assume that a speedier evidence-gathering procedure might have repercussions on the quality of the arbitral awards (good justice, like wine, takes time). In that respect, some commentaries have already opened a sensitive issue of the relationship between the quality and efficiency of legal protection. The author seeks to establish whether the evidentiary procedure, as the most time- and money-consuming stage of the proceedings, may be subject to rationalization while keeping the satisfying level of quality of the awards. Secondly, the new 2012 ICC Arbitration Rules clearly seek to promote the individualization of disputes by, among other methods, increasing the amount and the scope of preparatory activities of the tribunal (various Case Management Conferences, Case Management Techniques, Pre-Hearing Conferences). This leads to a conclusion that the creators of the ICC 2012 Rules consider that a more thorough preparation of the proceedings and their individualization in the preparatory stage, before evidentiary hearings, will result in hearings that are more efficient. Therefore, a question arises: is the desired result achievable? Despite being an avid supporter of the individualization of disputes, the author provides a skeptical answer to this question. As far as the costs of arbitration services are concerned: if the inputs of pricing are the same and if the demand remains stable, but the number of operations that need to be performed in order to reach a decision increases due to the changes in the technology of decision-making process, there is no place for reduction of costs. As far as the time-aspect is concerned: the advantage that arbitration has over ordinary courts is already so big that it puts the fairness of their “competition” into question. Namely, what “sells” ICC dispute resolution products is the fact that the awards of this institution are not subject to a second-degree review by any institution and that the New York Convention guarantees their efficient enforcement. If these observations are correct, then the evidentiary hearing appears not to be the appropriate aspect of the proceedings where possible reduction of costs may be sought. Along with the quality and the impartiality of arbitrators, this guarantees the quality of the awards and contributes to further promotion of the reputation of the institution in the name of which the awards are rendered. As it is usually upon the parties to choose the arbitrators, the arbitral institutions (including the ICC system) should do all they can to allow that all facts are properly established, whatever the costs and the duration of the evidentiary hearing may be...|$|E

In <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> this progressive and enlightened finding, it is disappointing that the legislature has failed to adopt a more resolute approach under the Companies Act 71 of 2008 ('the Act') to <b>the</b> vexed issue <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b> If <b>the</b> new liberalised derivative action is to be a success, the courts must face this obstacle head on. It is vital that the remedy is not unwittingly suffocated by the courts, through <b>the</b> imposition <b>of</b> adverse <b>costs</b> orders on shareholder litigants. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> topic <b>of</b> {{this thesis}} are rights and {{obligations}} of a liquidator. Specifically, there are compared {{rights and obligations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquidator appointed by the court and the liquidator appointed by the company. The topic is restricted to a limited liability company. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis analyses {{the conditions under which}} the liquidator is appointed by the company and the court. <b>The</b> main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis compares rights and obligations that these liquidators do not have in common, but also the rights and obligations that they share, but which differ significantly in their content and meaning. Firstly, the liquidator's right to resign is discussed. Subsequently, it is analysed how the liquidator identifies the company's assets, in particular the contact with the creditors and the right to request co-operation. A significant part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis is devoted to <b>the</b> procedure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquidator in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> bankruptcy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company in a situation in which {{it is not possible to}} pay an advance on <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insolvency <b>proceedings.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> liquidator's right to remuneration and the obligation to submit a final report on the liquidation process are discussed.

40|$|Everyone {{acknowledges}} that {{freedom of speech}} is vitally important in a free society, {{but at the same}} time most people believe that they should have a right to protection against false allegations which damage their reputation. The libel laws should safeguard both of these freedoms, but in Britain today they do not protect either of them effectively. Our present libel laws do not guarantee justice to either defendants or plaintiffs; in fact, it is almost as if they have been deliberately designed to give us <b>the</b> worst <b>of</b> both worlds. On one hand, rich crooks can use the law to cover up their crimes, while on the other hand, ordinary people who find themselves <b>the</b> victims <b>of</b> smear campaigns are left with no means <b>of</b> redress. <b>The</b> libel laws have three main defects: <b>the</b> burden <b>of</b> proof, <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> damages, and <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>proceedings.</b> <b>THE</b> BURDEN <b>OF</b> PROOF A lot of people do not realise that if you are charged with libel...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the American Indian Movement (AIM), national newspaper and television media, and <b>the</b> Trail <b>of</b> Broken Treaties caravan in November 1972 and the way media framed, or interpreted, AIM 2 ̆ 7 s motivations and objectives. The intellectual and political currents present in the 1960 s, including <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> Vine Deloria, Jr., and <b>the</b> successes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil Rights Movement, influenced <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> AIM 2 ̆ 7 s ideas about militant tactics and the role media played in social movements. AIM entered the national stage with <b>the</b> occupation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bureau <b>of</b> Indian Affairs in late 1972 and used television broadcasts and print media to disseminate their ideas for federal policy reform. Media often missed <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trail <b>of</b> Broken Treaties, instead focusing their narrative around a different set of political issues. Early reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trail <b>of</b> Broken Treaties were sparse until the occupation led to a substantial increase in coverage, though what was considered “newsworthy” by the media differed from the issues activists hoped to raise. Final reports focused on <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occupation, legal <b>proceedings</b> in <b>the</b> aftermath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occupation, and high-level changes in <b>the</b> hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bureau <b>of</b> Indian Affairs and Department of Interior.

Mirabeau not only succeeded in {{reversing}} <b>the</b> sentence <b>of</b> death against him, but also got {{an order for}} Sophie's husband to pay <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole law <b>proceedings.</b> It was thought Mirabeau would come out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lawsuit in Aix ruined: [...] his past convictions in prison, scandalous relationships with women, and the bad relationship with his father the Marquis all gave him a terrible reputation among judges and adversaries. [...] However, despite being condemned by the judge, his reputation was greatly enhanced in <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public. [...] He had withered his opponents, crushed the opposing lawyer and turned the cards in his favor regarding the death sentence. From this day forward, Mirabeau became regarded as a man <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people. Upon his release, he found that his Sophie had consoled herself with a young officer, after whose death she had committed suicide. From Pontarlier he went to Aix-en-Provence, where he claimed the court's order said that his wife should return to him. She naturally objected, and he finally lost in <b>the</b> third appeal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case when Emilie's father produced to the court compromising letters from Mirabeau addressed to the marquess. Mirabeau then intervened in the suit between {{his father and mother}} before <b>the</b> parlement <b>of</b> Paris and attacked the ruling powers so violently that he had to leave France and return to the Dutch Republic, where he tried to live by writing.

HOOTS {{addresses}} fundamental principles and important innovations in the definition, analysis, {{and application of}} operational semantics for higher order languages and calculi. HOOTS 99 took place on September 30 and October 1, 1999, as part <b>of</b> PLI 99, <b>the</b> colloquium on Principles, Logics, and Implementations of High-Level Programming Languages, a collection of conferences and workshops held in Paris, at the Maison de la Chimie. Andrew Gordon and Andrew Pitts co-chaired <b>the</b> programme committee <b>of</b> HOOTS 99. <b>The</b> programme committee selected 9 papers from 25 submissions. Each paper was reviewed by three or more committee members or their subreferees. <b>The</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HOOTS 99 programme committee were: 				Roberto Amadio(University of Provence) Andrew Gordon(Microsoft Research) obert Harper(Carnegie Mellon University) Alan Jeffrey(DePaul University) Jean-Jacques Lévy(INRIA Rocquencourt) Andrew Pitts(University of Cambridge) David Sands(Chalmers University) Carolyn Talcott(Stanford University) We thank Søren B. Lassen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Cambridge for delivering an invited lecture on Trees and bisimulation for the pure lambda-calculus. The PLI 99 workshops, of which HOOTS 99 was one, were organized by the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA), with <b>the</b> sponsorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), France Telecom, Microsoft Research, the Ministère de l'Education nationale, de la Recherche et de la Technologie, and Trusted Logic. We thank Didier Rémy and Annick Theis-Viemont of INRIA for their organisational help. HOOTS 99 was also affiliated to the ESPRIT Working Group 26142 on Applied Semantics (APPSEM); we thank the CEC for funding <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> participants from APPSEM sites and <b>the</b> production <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings</b> that was distributed at the workshop. We also thank Mike Mislove, editor of Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, for his help with preparing <b>the</b> <b>proceedings.</b> There have been two previous HOOTS workshops. The first HOOTS workshop was organised by Andrew Gordon and Andrew Pitts on October 28 - 30, 1995 as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events within the 6 -month research programme on Semantics <b>of</b> Computation at <b>the</b> Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge.

40|$|Under the TRIPS Agreement (Art. 41 para. 5) {{countries}} {{are given the}} option to create specialised intellectual property (IP) courts. On this basis, {{countries are}} free to decide what types of judicial body or bodies have the jurisdiction to hear IP disputes. Although IP disputes are sometimes primarily viewed as relating to <b>the</b> enforcement <b>of</b> intellectual property rights against counterfeiters (specifically in the copyright and trademark areas), the reality and <b>the</b> landscape <b>of</b> IP disputes are much more complex. <b>The</b> diversity <b>of</b> IP disputes {{makes it difficult to}} give a simple and unique answer to <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> whether it is advantageous or necessary to establish specialised IP courts. This diversity is also reflected {{in the way in which}} national or regional lawmakers and regulators have structured their IP dispute resolution systems. While recent studies demonstrate that there is no unique global system or even a prevailing system, a trend towards specialisation or centralisation of certain types of IP disputes seems perceivable at the global level. However, this trend does not eliminate the differences which remain, particularly regarding <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jurisdictional power <b>of</b> specialised IP courts. There are various advantages and disadvantages in establishing a specialised IP court. Improvements in <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> justice, time and <b>cost</b> efficiencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings,</b> as well as consistency and uniformity, are among the advantages that are generally identified. In terms of disadvantages, reference is generally made to <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> establishing and of operating a specialised IP court. In addition, some have expressed concerns that such a court may become subject to political or economic influences and may develop ‘tunnel vision’ deriving from mainstream legal and societal movements. Given <b>the</b> diversity <b>of</b> legal systems and regimes, there is no single method for establishing an efficient IP court system that promotes innovation and social welfare. Similarly, there is no clear evidence that specialised IP courts more effectively promote innovation vis-à-vis non-specialised courts in all circumstances. However, it is clear that a sufficient level of experience and expertise among the courts and judges can significantly improve <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> justice in IP disputes. How advantageous or necessary it is to establish specialised IP courts in a given jurisdiction depends on a number of factors which are not limited to IP issues. Rather, this determination will take into account more general factors, including economics, the legal system and societal characteristics. Thus, <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> specialised IP courts cannot be recommended in all circumstances. A decision relating to <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> specialised IP courts must consequently be made on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a fully informed, transparent and unbiased analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation which prevails in the relevant territory...|$|R
