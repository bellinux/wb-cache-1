5000|$|The Closure Compiler is a {{tool for}} making JavaScript {{download}} and run faster, {{at the expense of}} human readability. It does not <b>compile</b> <b>from</b> JavaScript to machine code, but rather <b>compiles</b> <b>from</b> JavaScript to more efficient JavaScript. It parses JavaScript, analyzes it, removes dead code and rewrites and minifies what's left. It also checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common JavaScript pitfalls. It supports transpiling some ECMAScript 6 code to ECMAScript 3, so that programmers can write JavaScript that uses those features, and run it in browsers or other environments that don't yet support them. (The Traceur Compiler is another Google project that supports transpiling ES6 to ES3.) Closure source code can be compiled in three ways: ...|$|R
