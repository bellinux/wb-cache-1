5|$|After {{returning}} from Kyoto, Keitarō and Naru decide to retake the exams. After a while, Mutsumi moves to Tokyo, {{and the three}} begin to study together. During this period, Naru becomes convinced that Mutsumi is Keitarō's promised girl, but Mutsumi states that she made a childhood promise with Naru, not Keitarō. During {{the next round of}} Tokyo University exams, Keitarō believes he has failed them once again and runs away before finding out his results. After learning of this, Naru chases after him without <b>checking</b> <b>her</b> exam results either, and they are followed {{by the rest of the}} residents of Hinata House who announce that Keitarō and Naru both passed the exams along with Mutsumi. Unfortunately for him, Keitarō has an accident at the Tokyo University opening ceremony and is unable to attend classes for three months. After recovering from his injuries, Keitarō decides to study overseas with Noriyasu Seta. As Keitarō is about to leave, Naru finally confesses her feelings to him at the airport and decides to wait for him to return.|$|E
2500|$|Rihanna {{has worked}} with music video {{director}} Anthony Mandler on {{more than a dozen}} music videos, the first being [...] "Unfaithful" [...] (2006). [...] "We've done 16 videos together; they're not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, I'm known for the 'Disturbia's and the 'Russian Roulette's and things like that, but 'Only Girl (In the World)' is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video," [...] Mandler said. Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, [...] "Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues". Jon Bream of the Star Tribune commented [...] "n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the '00s... Rihanna has perfected the pout, the long-legged strut and trend-setting hairdos that keep women and men alike <b>checking</b> <b>her</b> out on YouTube." [...] George Epaminondas of InStyle considers Rihanna's music videos to be [...] "cinematic" [...] due to her [...] "blend of lush island rhythms and swinging pop and... mischievous sensuality." [...] Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy listed [...] "Disturbia" [...] at number five on the [...] "Buzzworthy's Top 5 Most Paranoid Music Videos" [...] and said that [...] "Paranoia never looked so supernaturally sexy!".|$|E

60|$|That {{he should}} have {{interfered}} {{in the affairs of}} Ruth and Kirk at this time was, it must be admitted, unselfish of him, for just now he was having troubles of his own on a somewhat extensive scale.

Being very much in love, he shrank from the former task and adopted the other way out of the difficulty.|$|E

60|$|<b>Checking</b> <b>her</b> sobs, {{and drying}} her swollen eyes, and endeavouring {{to calm the}} {{agitation}} of her manner, {{so as to avoid}} attracting notice, Florence, resolving to keep to the more quiet streets as long as she could, was going on more quietly herself, when a familiar little shadow darted past upon the sunny pavement, stopped short, wheeled about, came close to her, made off again, bounded round and round her, and Diogenes, panting for breath, and yet making the street ring with his glad bark, was at her feet.|$|E

60|$|Of {{course there}} was pretty {{constant}} question of Kendricks {{in the management of}} Miss Gage's amusement, for that was really what our enterprise resolved itself into. He showed from the first the sweetest disposition to forward all our plans in regard to her, and, in fact, he even anticipated our wishes. I do not mean to give the notion that he behaved from an interested motive in going to the station the morning Mrs. Deering left, and getting her ticket for her, and <b>checking</b> <b>her</b> baggage, and posting her in the changes she would have to make. This was something I ought to have thought of myself, but I did not think of it, and I am willing that he should have all the credit.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Clive Newcome {{burst out}} into fierce {{laughter}} {{when he saw}} the cocoa-nut tree; he laughed so loud that baby woke, and his mother-in-law called him a brute, and the nurse ran to give its accustomed quietus to the little screaming infant. Rosey's eyes poured forth a torrent of little protests, and she would have cried yet more loudly than the other baby, had not her husband, again fiercely <b>checking</b> <b>her,</b> sworn with a dreadful oath, that unless she told him the whole truth, [...] "By heavens she should leave the house with nothing but what covered her." [...] Even the Campaigner could not make head against Clive's stern resolution; and the incipient insurrection of the maids and the mistresses was quelled by his spirit. The lady's-maid, a flighty creature, received her wages and took her leave: but the nurse could not find it in her heart to quit her little nursling so suddenly, and accompanied Clive's household in the journey upon which those poor folks were bound. What stolen goods were finally discovered when the family reached foreign parts were found in Mrs. Mackenzie's trunks, not in her daughter's: a silver filigree basket, a few teaspoons, baby's gold coral, and a costly crimson velvet-bound copy of the Hon. Miss Grimstone's Church Service, to which articles, having thus appropriated them, Mrs. Mackenzie henceforward laid claim as her own.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed you are mistaken. I {{have no such}} {{injuries}} to resent. It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must {{be affected by the}} wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of <b>checking</b> <b>her</b> exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible {{that they will not be}} censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?" ...|$|E
