25|$|In {{the first}} of these {{equations}} the ratio tends toward A'n/B'n as z tends toward zero. In the second, the ratio tends toward A'n/B'n as z tends to infinity. This leads us to our first geometric interpretation. If the <b>continued</b> <b>fraction</b> converges, the successive convergents A'n/B'n are eventually arbitrarily close together. Since the linear fractional transformation Τn(z) is a continuous mapping, there must be a neighborhood of z = 0 that is mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of Τn(0) = A'n/B'n. Similarly, there must be a neighborhood of the point at infinity which is mapped into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of Τn(∞) = A'n-1/B'n-1. So if the <b>continued</b> <b>fraction</b> converges the transformation Τn(z) maps both very small z and very large z into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of x, the value of the <b>continued</b> <b>fraction,</b> as n gets larger and larger.|$|E

Institute of Computer Science of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Abstract: The central notion of this presented thesis {{is the concept}} of <b>continued</b> <b>fractions.</b> The origin of this concept as one of the oldest mathematical methods is shown here in its historical connections. The technique of <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> belongs to classical parts of mathematics. Although the general theory of <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> is manifold and layered considerably, in textbooks it is usually treated according to the intended purpose of its use. In the present text we have summarized the foundations of the general theory of convergence of <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> with an emphasis on the theory of simple <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> and their most common applications. We show several possibilities how the concept of <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> can be generalized to other structures such as the Gaussian integers or polynomial <b>continued</b> <b>fractions.</b> In the chapter devoted to matrix <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> we shall demonstrate the possibility how to extend it to non-commutative algebraic structures.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} {{convergence}} of the important type of a multidimensional generalization of <b>continued</b> <b>fractions,</b> the branched <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> with independent variables, is considered. This fractions are an efficient apparatus for the approximation of multivariable functions, which are represented by multiple power series. When variables are fixed these fractions are called the branched <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> of the special form. Their structure is much simpler then the structure of general branched <b>continued</b> <b>fractions.</b> It has given a possibility to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions of convergence of branched <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> of the special form with the positive elements. The received result is the multidimensional analog of Seidel's criterion for the <b>continued</b> <b>fractions.</b> The condition of convergence of investigated fractions is the divergence of series, whose elements are <b>continued</b> <b>fractions.</b> Therefore, the sufficient condition of the convergence of this fraction which has been formulated by the divergence of series composed of partial denominators of this fraction, is established. Using the established criterion and Stieltjes-Vitali Theorem the parabolic theorems of branched <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> of the special form with complex elements convergence, is investigated. The sufficient conditions gave a possibility to make the condition of convergence of the branched <b>continued</b> <b>fractions</b> of the special form, whose elements lie in parabolic domains...|$|R
