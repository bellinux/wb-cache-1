40|$|It is {{surprising}} that the prevailing performance taxonomy for scientists (Star versus Non-Star) focuses only on individual output and ignores social behavior since, innovation is often charac-terized as a communal process. To address this deficiency I expand the traditional taxonomy that focuses solely on productivity and add a second, social dimension to the taxonomy of scien-tists: helpfulness to others. Using a combination of academic paper publications and citations to capture scientist productivity and the receipt of academic paper acknowledgements to mea-sure helpfulness, I classify a group of 149 immunologists into four distinct categories of human capital quality: All-Stars who have both high productivity and helpfulness; Lone Wolves who have high productivity but average helpfulness; Mavens who have average productivity but high helpfulness; and Non-Stars who have both average productivity and helpfulness. Looking at the change in quality-adjusted publishing output <b>of</b> an immunologist’s <b>coauthors</b> after the im-munologist’s death, I find that the productivity <b>of</b> <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> All-Stars decreases by 16 %, and <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> Mavens decreases by 14 %, all relative to the decrease in productivity <b>of</b> <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> Non-Stars. The productivity <b>of</b> <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> Lone Wolves, however, is not statistically dif-ferent from the decrease in productivity <b>of</b> <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> Non-Stars. These findings suggest that our current conceptualization of star scientists, which solely focuses on individual productivity, is both incomplete and potentially misleading as Lone Wolves may be systematically overvalued and Mavens undervalued...|$|R
