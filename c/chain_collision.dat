Furthermore, the inherent transition to reach full technology penetration in the market requires to study how the system of vehicles will behave at different stages of deployment and how different relaying mechanisms may affect the general functionality of the system and what is the influence of background data traffic which can obviously worsen the successful delivery rate (SDR) of warning notification messages.

Timely delivery of the safety information must be catered to ensure that enough time is reserved for the surrounding vehicles to react to the event. In [22], it is estimated that the driver reaction time (which is defined as the time from seeing the brake light from the car in front, to stepping on the brake) typically ranges from 0.7 to 1.5 seconds and 60 % of road collisions could be avoided if the driver was given warning of at least 0.5 s prior to its collision. Article [23] showed that a delivery latency of less than 0.4 s is required to avoid <b>chain</b> <b>collision</b> on highways.

Meanwhile, CAM is used to periodically communicate routine vehicular status such as GPS coordinates, speed, direction and vehicle class. It is expected that the two types of safety messages share the same CCH [4, 19, 20]. It is also reasonable to assume that the ACN in CCH suffers no interference from background unicast traffic that is usually transmitted in service channels (SCHs). Therefore, interference is only due to the CAM messages.|$|E

The crash surrogate, which {{is defined as the}} measure of crash proximity, is widely accepted as an alternative to crash data by taking advantage of many merits. With the increased travel demand, freeways frequently operate at capacity or even in a state of synchronized flow with high speed and small headway. Under this kind of state, even a slight disturbance might result in a rear-end crash or even a <b>chain</b> <b>collision</b> (multi-vehicle collision), which could consequently lead to serious health, economic and environmental problems. However, the traditional surrogate measures could not perform very well in this state due to some limitations.

With the hypothetic disturbance, ACI can be applied to any car following scenario without any restricted conditions.

When a vehicle detects an event {{that may lead to}} an imminent accident, the vehicle disseminates emergency messages to alert other vehicles that may be endangered by the accident.

This paper presents a more efficient context aware multicast protocol that disseminates messages only to endangered vehicles that may be affected by the emergency event. The endangered vehicles can be identified by calculating the interaction among vehicles based on their motion properties. To ensure fast delivery, the dissemination follows a routing path obtained by computing a minimum delay tree. The multicast protocol uses a generalized approach that can support any arbitrary road topology. The performance of the multicast protocol is compared with existing broadcast protocols by simulating <b>chain</b> <b>collision</b> accidents on a typical highway.

The cluster is based upon several criteria, which define {{the movement of the}} vehicles, namely, the directional bearing and relative velocity of each vehicle, as well as the intervehicular distance.

To swiftly circulate the emergency notifications to collocated vehicles to mitigate the risk of <b>chain</b> <b>collisions,</b> the medium-access delay of each vehicle is set as a function of its emergency level.

40|$|Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 134 {{was located}} in {{the central part of}} the New Hebrides Island Arc, in the Southwest Pacific. Here the d'Entrecasteaux Zone of ridges, the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge and South d'Entrecasteaux Chain, is colliding with the arc. The region has a Neogene history of {{subduction}} polarity reversal, ridge-arc collision, and back-arc spreading. The reasons for drilling in this region included the following: (1) to determine the differences in the style and time scale of deformation associated with the two ridge-like features (a fairly continuous ridge and an irregularly topographic seamount chain) that are colliding with the central New Hebrides Island Arc; (2) to document the evolution of the magmatic arc in relation to the collision process and possible Neogene reversal of subduction; and (3) to understand the process of dewatering of a small accretionary wedge associated with ridge collision and subduction. Seven sites were occupied during the leg, five (Sites 827 - 831) were located in the d'Entrecasteaux Zone where collision is active. Three sites (Sites 827, 828, and 829) were located where the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge is colliding, whereas two sites (Sites 830 and 831) were located in the South d'Entrecasteaux <b>Chain</b> <b>collision</b> zone. Sites 828 (on North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge) and 831 (on Bougainville Guyot) were located on the Pacific Plate, whereas all other sites were located on a microplate of the North Fiji Basin. Two sites (Sites 832 and 831) were located in the intra-arc North Aoba Basin. Results of Leg 134 drilling showed that forearc deformation associated with the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge and South d'Entrecasteaux <b>Chain</b> <b>collision</b> is distinct and different. The d'Entrecasteaux Zone is an Eocene subduction/obduction complex with a distinct submerged island arc. Collision and subduction of the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge results in off scraping of ridge material and plating of the forearc with thrust sheets (flakes) as well as distinct forearc uplift. Some offscraped sedimentary rocks and surficial volcanic basement rocks of the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge are being underplated to the New Hebrides Island forearc. In contrast, the South d'Entrecasteaux Chain is a serrated feature resulting in intermittent collision and subduction of seamounts. The collision of the Bougainville Guyot has indented the forearc and appears to be causing shortening through thrust faulting. In addition, we found that the Quaternary relative convergence rate between the New Hebrides Island Arc at the latitude of Espiritu Santo Island is as high as 14 to 16 cm/yr. The northward migration rate of the d'Entrecasteaux Zone was found the be ~ 2 to 4 cm/yr based on the newly determined Quaternary relative convergence rate. Using these rates we established the timing of initial d'Entrecasteaux Zone collision with the arc at ~ 3 Ma at the latitude of Epi Island and fixed the impact of the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge upon Espiritu Santo Island at early Pleistocene (between 1. 89 and 1. 58 Ma). Dewatering is occurring in the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge accretionary wedge, and the wedge is dryer than other previously studied accretionary wedges, such as Barbados. This could be the result of less sediment being subducted at the New Hebrides compared to the Barbados...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Among the safety-related {{applications}} of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), the Cooperative/Chain Collision Avoidance (CCA) techniques have received special attention in recent years. With CCA systems a fast dissemination of warning {{messages to the}} vehicles in the platoon enables them to promptly react in emergency situations. In this way the number of car accidents and the associated damage to drivers and passengers can be significantly reduced. These systems are usually evaluated through simulation. However, {{to cope with the}} drawbacks of simulating accidents with current tools based on car-following characterizations, we propose the use of a stochastic model as an alternative to simulation for the design and evaluation of such applications. The model allows the computation of the average number of collisions that occur in a platoon of vehicles, the probabilities of the different ways in which the collisions may take place, as well as other statistics of interest. As shown in this paper, the model enables the evaluation of different scenarios and communication technologies, characterized by using the appropriate distributions for its parameters. The main practical utility of this approach lays on its ability to quickly assess numerically the influence of different parameters on the collision process without the need to resort to complex simulations at a first stage. Such an evaluation provides relevant guidelines for the design of vehicular communication systems. To exemplify it, we provide an evaluation of different types of CCA applications in two scenarios, a freeway and an urban scenario.

40|$|Abstract—The {{distributed}} {{coordination function}} (DCF) of IEEE 802. 11 standard adopts the binary exponential backoff (BEB) for collision avoidance. In DCF, the contention window is reset to an initial value, i. e., CWmin, after each successful trans-mission. Much {{research has shown}} that this dramatic change of window size may degrade the network performance. Therefore, backoff algorithms, such as gentle DCF (GDCF), multiplica-tive increase–linear decrease (MILD), exponential increase– exponential decrease (EIED), etc., have been proposed that try to keep the memory of congestion level by not resetting the contention window after each successful transmission. This paper proposes a multichain backoff (MCB) algorithm, which allows stations to adapt to different congestion levels by using more than one backoff <b>chain</b> together with <b>collision</b> events caused by stations themselves as well as other stations as indications for choosing the next backoff chain. The performance of MCB is analyzed and com-pared with those of 802. 11 DCF, GDCF, MILD, and EIED backoff algorithms.

In this regard, a promising research perspective considered by the Academia and the Industry is to use communications to build a complex interoperable vehicular network that would serve as a means to provide autonomous robotic-guided vehicles with additional status information that might not be collected from sensors on board. With properly configured processing schemes, this additional stream of information can be used to help vehicles anticipate and react conveniently to potentially risky situations that might cause an accident if not previously considered. Particularly, in this Thesis we use these premises to propose and evaluate collision avoidance policies under two specific fashions: i) Design and evaluation of a Cooperative <b>chain</b> <b>Collision</b> Avoidance (CcCA) 1 strategy to reduce the impact of multiple rear-end collisions in a platoon of vehicles when evasive maneuvering is not possible, and ii) Analysis and optimization of different strategies for Cooperative Collision Avoidance (CCA) by evasive maneuvering. The CcCA application allows us to study how communication protocols, both by one-hop transmissions as well as by relaying (multi-hop) schemes, can help reduce the number of accidents, or at least minimize their impact, in cases where vehicles cannot execute sudden maneuvers to skip cars ahead, but only brake. Simulations are validated by using an advanced stochastic model which rigorously describes the behavior of vehicles in this type of situations. Among other aspects, results show that real implementations of CcCA must take into account with special relevance those vehicles that might be humanly driven, and guarantee that during the transition stage (until a complete penetration of the technology is achieved) safety is preserved enough. Regarding CCA for evasive maneuvering, we provide an exhaustive optimization analysis for the calculation of optimum trajectories in cases where vehicles at high speeds are at risk of colliding with one or more obstacles appearing ahead. By reorienting trajectories through the lateral free spaces that might exist between the obstacles and the crash barriers (if the specific scenario allows it), vehicles can avoid crashing and simultaneously improve driving comfort even under such unpredictable circumstances. On the whole, despite much further effort is still required on these matters, results in this Work show that communications can help autonomous vehicles to make decisions in a cooperative fashion that will not only assist individuals to follow the best riding strategy, but also the traffic system as a whole to evolve according to the best possible behavior in terms of safety and comfort.

50|$|The Kessler syndrome, {{a runaway}} <b>chain</b> {{reaction}} of <b>collisions</b> exponentially {{increasing the amount}} of debris, has been hypothesized to ensue beyond a critical density. This could affect useful polar-orbiting bands, increases the cost of protection for spacecraft missions and could destroy live satellites. Whether Kessler syndrome is already underway has been debated. The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the space industry.|$|R
