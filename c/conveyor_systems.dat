5|$|GM halted {{production}} for about one {{month at the}} Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant by mid June 2011 to complete some upgrades, including the installation of new tooling, equipment and overhead <b>conveyor</b> <b>systems</b> throughout the facility. These upgrades allowed GM to triple the rate of Volt production and prepared the plant for 2012 Volt and Ampera production. After the plant retooling, the production rate reached 150 units per day {{four days a week}} by August 2011. The Volt plant was also down during January 2012 in preparation for building the California lower-emission version. A four-week shutdown due to slow sales took place between March and April 2012. GM said it had around 3,600 Volts in inventory and needed to reduce dealer inventories as production is expected to meet market demand. GM also extended the traditional two-week summer vacation by an extra week at the Hamtramck plant. GM closed its Detroit-Hamtramck plant from September 17 until October 15, 2012, affecting roughly 1,500 workers on downtime while the plant was retooled to assemble the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala alongside the 2013 Volt. This was the second time in 2012 that GM has halted Volt production.|$|E

40|$|Based on Indonesian National Standard (SNI) No 3926 : 2008, {{egg weight}} is {{classified}} into three classifications: small (60 g). Nowadays egg grading process in Indonesia was still done manually. The {{objective of this}} research was for designing, constructing, and performance testing of egg sorting machine. The machine testing includes performance accuracy, machine capacity, and egg crack of the sorting result. The egg sorting machine consisted of five main parts: <b>conveyor</b> <b>system,</b> steering <b>conveyor</b> <b>system,</b> sorting <b>conveyor</b> <b>system,</b> and exit <b>conveyor</b> <b>system.</b> Test result showed that the machine could sort the egg with accuracy of 83 % without any cracking in eggshell. The machine capacity was most affected by the speed of sorting <b>conveyor</b> <b>system.</b> The variables which influence the speed of sorting <b>conveyor</b> <b>system</b> were initial speed rotation (Na), work speed rotation (Nb), and length of the track on initial speed rotation path (L). The maximum machine capacity was 61 eggs per minute and obtained by configuration of Na, Nb, and L of 15. 5 rpm, 24. 5 rpm, and 6 cm respectively...|$|R
50|$|A {{stone picker}} has digging teeth, a <b>conveyor</b> <b>system,</b> a sieve or screen, and a stone bin. The digging teeth {{are at the}} leading edge of the stone picker and removes soil, which is placed on the <b>conveyor</b> <b>system.</b> If the sieve is not {{combined}} with the <b>conveyor</b> <b>system,</b> the <b>conveyor</b> <b>system</b> transports the stones and large rocks to a bin or hopper for periodic dumping. Some stone pickers use a large tractor, generally over 100 horsepower, equipped with hydraulics and power take-off driven mechanisms. PTO pump driven equipment can use 60 horsepower tractors. The tractor's hydraulics control the depth to which the stone picker digs to excavate soil material; whereas, the PTO controls the movement of the <b>conveyor</b> and picking <b>system.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Until the twenties, all condoms were {{individually}} hand-dipped by semiskilled workers. Throughout {{the decade}} of the 1920s, advances in automation of condom assembly line were made. Fred Killian patented the first fully automated line in 1930 and installed it in his manufacturing plant in Akron, Ohio. Killian charged $20,000 for his conveyor system - as much as $2 million in today's dollars. Automated lines dramatically lowered the price of condoms. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased <b>conveyor</b> <b>systems,</b> and small manufacturers were driven out of business. [...] The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market.|$|E

The project should be started by means of research on metallic waste sorting machines in the market like magnetic <b>conveyor</b> <b>system.</b> A <b>conveyor</b> <b>system</b> is mechanical handling equipment that moves materials from one location to another and magnetic pulley has been used to separate metal and non-metal waste. Standard design process flow is to be followed e. g. conceptual design and detailed design to be produced prior to the fabrication. Design of the conveyor is using Solidworks Software and analysis is using Ansys Software. Analysis equipment has been done by doing calculation such as calculation of gear and motor torque prior to fabrication.

5000|$|The {{downtime}} of belt <b>conveyor</b> <b>systems</b> {{leads to}} stoppage of transportation of bulk materials, influencing subsequent material processing and production, and consequently causing serious financial loss. In a mining plant, for example, {{sixty percent of}} the plant downtime was attributed to conveyor problems (Steinberg, 1983). The downtime cost of belt <b>conveyor</b> <b>systems</b> may vary from one application to another. The financial loss due to the downtime of belt <b>conveyor</b> <b>systems</b> can be in a range of 100,000 to 200,000 Euro per hour, considering the loss of the revenue from material conveying, and shutdowns of subsequent material processing facilities (Lodewijks, 2015).|$|E
