40|$|Abstract. The Chi-Chi {{earthquake}} caused significant loss {{of property}} and life. This phenomenon disclosed many design-related in the construction industry. The first condition {{that we would like}} to determine is whether the earthquake affected the final strength of newly-cast concrete if the fresh concrete was cast just before the earthquake struck, particularly when the fresh concrete was cast just before its initial or final setting. This study aims to investigate the effects of an earthquake on fresh concrete. Twenty specimens were fabricated to investigate the effects of strong ground motion on concrete. Of the 20 specimens, 9 were lightweight-concrete-filled CFT (Concrete Filled Tube) <b>columns,</b> 9 <b>were</b> <b>CFT</b> <b>columns</b> filled with concrete of normal weight, and the remaining two were pure steel hollow tubes. The specimens were leveled on a shaking table to simulate the strong ground motion caused by an earthquake.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} a numerical study {{to investigate the}} performance of circular high-strength steel tubes filled with concrete (CFT) under monotonic axial loading. A model is developed to implement the material constitutive relationships and non-linearity. Calibration against previous experimental data shows good agreement. A parametric study is then conducted using the model and compared with codes provisions. Strength and ductility of confined concrete are of primary concern. Variables considered are yield stress of steel tube and column diameter. The assessment of <b>column</b> performance <b>is</b> based on axial load carrying capacities and enhancements of both strength and ductility due to confinement. Two parameters namely strength enhancement factor (Kf) and ductility index (μ) are clearly defined and introduced for assessment. Results indicate that both concrete strength and ductility of <b>CFT</b> <b>columns</b> <b>are</b> enhanced but to different extents. The ductile behaviors are significantly evident. The increase in yield stress of steel tube has a minimal effect on concrete strength but pronounced effect on concrete ductility. However, reduction in ductility is associated with using high-tensile steel of Grade 70. The overall findings indicate {{that the use of}} high-strength tube in <b>CFT</b> <b>columns</b> <b>is</b> not promising. This finding may seriously be considered in seismic design...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the <b>CFT</b> <b>column</b> base <b>is</b> {{designed}} {{in a similar}} manner as the steel column base in Japan. There <b>are</b> three <b>column</b> base designs used in Japan. Of the three, the base plate connection has been used for the longest time. The Japanese steel <b>column</b> base design <b>was</b> changed twice in its past after 1978 and 1995 earthquakes. After the 1995 earthquake, the moment resisted by the base plate is estimated considering its rotational stiffness. Ductile design is possible if ductile anchor bolts are used.

40|$|Concrete-filled steel tubular (<b>CFT)</b> <b>columns</b> <b>are</b> {{widely used}} as columns in many {{structural}} systems {{and a common}} failure mode of such tubular <b>columns</b> <b>is</b> inelastic outward local buckling near a column end.

This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental study into the behaviour of large-scale FRP-confined <b>CFT</b> (CCFT) <b>columns</b> under combined axial compression and lateral loading. The test parameters included the stiffness of the FRP jacket and the loading scenario. The test results showed that the FRP jacket can effectively delay or even prevent outward local buckling {{at the end of a}} cantilevered <b>CFT</b> <b>column,</b> leading to significantly improved structural performance under combined constant axial compression and cyclic lateral loading.

The stress can be induced due to the confinement action inside a special-shaped steel tube having multiple cavities.

The influence of cross-sectional shape, of cavity construction, of stiffening ribs and of reinforcement in cavities has been considered in the model.

40|$|UnrestrictedComposite {{materials}} {{composed of}} Concrete filled steel tube (CFT) {{have been widely}} applied in high strength column design due to their advantages such as high strength, stiffness, ductility and better seismic resistance.

40|$|Concrete filled steel tubular (<b>CFT)</b> <b>columns</b> can {{employ the}} {{advantages}} of both materials: steel and concrete. Connection to such <b>columns,</b> however, <b>is</b> problematic. This is especially so if the required connection is both bolted and moment-resisting. To address this issue, a novel blind-bolted and moment-resisting connection to <b>CFT</b> <b>column</b> has <b>been</b> developed. This connection uses an innovative blind- bolt, introduced in previous research at the University of Nottingham and is termed the Extended Hollobolt (EHB). The EHB has been developed to provide sufficient tensile resistance and stiffness for the connection to develop resistance to moment.

(2013) is employed to simulate the fire behavior of <b>CFT</b> <b>columns</b> within non-sway frames. Parametric studies are performed to analyze the influence of the different factors affecting the problem. Consequently, the opposite effects that the restraining frame has on the fire response of <b>CFT</b> <b>columns</b> <b>are</b> corroborated. On one hand, the restrained thermal elongation induces restraining forces which negatively affects the column. However, a beneficial effect is produced by the rotational restraint which positively modifies the boundary conditions of the heated column. Besides, another favorable effect comes from the gradual redistribution of the internal forces as the heated column loses its mechanical capacity, resulting in higher FRR. In a second step, current provisions given by Eurocode 4 Part 1. 2 (EC 4) are analyzed together with those given in the UK National Annex to Eurocode 4. Finally, these values are also used in the assessment of the simple calculation model presented by the authors in a previous paper Ibañez et al.

Standing at 280 m, the 66 -storey Republic Plaza building {{is one of}} the tallest buildings in Singapore. The structural system of the building comprises a reinforced concrete core wall and a structural steel frame. The steel tube columns, filled with concrete, form an external ring, while the horizontal steel frame systems simply supported at the core wall support a composite slab at each floor. A large number of stress and strain gauges were embedded inside the core wall and the concrete filled tube (<b>CFT)</b> <b>columns.</b> At selected floors, strain gauges were mounted in the steel beams. During construction, the trends observed in stress and strain measurements of the core wall and the <b>CFT</b> <b>columns</b> <b>are</b> generally consistent with the increasing dead loads, while the tends in strain data for the floor beams are more complex. An ambient vibration survey (AVS) was conducted after the completion of the structure. From the AVS measurements of dynamic lateral response, natural frequencies and mode shapes for lower lateral and torsional modes have been obtained. Results of the finite element models for the core wall/steel framing system agree reasonably well with the measured translational fundamental frequencies. However, without a high level of refinement, the finite element models cannot reflect the torsional behaviour.

The statistical analysis of the created response databank indicates that the number of stories, beam strength ratio, material strength and ground motion characteristics strongly influence structural damage. Nonlinear regression analysis is employed in order to derive simple formulae, which reflect the influence of the aforementioned parameters and offer a direct estimation of the damage indices used in this study. More specifically, given the characteristics of the structure and the ground motion, one can calculate the maximum damage observed in column bases and beams.
