It also has textile {{research}} institutes like the South Indian Textiles Research Association (SITRA), Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR)- Southern Regional station, and the Sardar Vallabhai Patel International School of Textiles and Management. The city also houses two of the Centers Of Excellences (COE) for technical textiles proposed by Government of India, namely Meditech, a medical textile research centre based at SITRA, and InduTech based in PSG College of Engineering and Technology. The Coimbatore region is famed for the quality of its cotton and dyed fabric. Documented records reveal that the traditional weavers perfected the art of quality dyeing and that woven fabric from here was known for its <b>colourfastness</b> and vivid patterning. Today, Coimbatore is hailed as the region with the highest concentration of textile activity in the world. It has numerous centres that specialize in spinning, weaving, powerlooms and knitwear. A large produce of the manufacture is exported to different countries. Exports include knitwear, woven apparel and home furnishings.The growth of textiles naturally led to the inception of textile machinery manufacturing. Today, some of the best known global brands in textilemachinery and component manufacturing are home - grown enterprises. Even in the late 1800s, Coimbatore district had cotton cleaning and pressing factories and was exported to Mumbai (then Bombay) and England. A spinning mill was established around this time and even back then, the textile industry employed over 300 people. The Southern India Mills' Association (SIMA) was established in 1933, is very active in the Coimbatore region and governs most of the textile industry in South India. SIMA has a membership spread across the southern states and protects the interests of the textile mills and its workers.|$|E

40|$|In this study, a novel idea {{of using}} ozone {{oxidation}} {{at the end of}} reactive dyeing process was explored in order to achieve zero discharge dyeing. An advanced oxidative treatment was given during the dyeing process to remove unfixed and hydrolyzed reactive dyes from cotton substrate. Three different shades were dyed using vinylsulphone reactive class of dyes. At the end of fixation step, washing of fabrics was carried out using appropriate quantities of ozone in the process. Ozone oxidation continued until the liquor was decolorized around 95 - 100 % and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) was reduced about 80 - 90 %, thus achieving zero liquid discharge dyeing process. The decolouration efficiency of wastewater was regarded as an indicative of removal of dyes from the textile materials because fabric was being washed continuously in the same liquor. Fabric samples dyed with conventional and new methods were compared in terms of change in shade, <b>colourfastness</b> properties, colour stripping, and fabric appearance. Overall results showed that the use of ozone during reactive dyeing can result in less water consumption, reduced process time, and zero discharge of coloured effluents from textile dyeing factories...|$|E
40|$|Reactive dyeing {{of cotton}} {{textiles}} generates {{high levels of}} dissolved solids and oxygen demands in the disposed effluent due {{to the use of}} inorganic salt (sodium chloride or sodium sulphate) and alkali (sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide). Considerable efforts are being undertaken within the textile industry to reduce effluent loads and to comply with environmental regulations. This paper presents results where the inorganic salt (sodium chloride) and alkali (sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate) are replaced by a biodegradable organic chemical, tetrasodium ethylene diamine tetra-acetate also known as sodium edate. The dyeing method selected for the study was pad-steam in which the solution containing the dye, the salt and the alkali is applied on cotton fabric by impregnating the fabric in the solution following squeezing the fabric to a designated pick-up of solution and steaming to achieve penetration and fixation of the dye to the fibres within the fabric. The study showed that the colour yield, dye fixation and ultimate <b>colourfastness</b> achieved by using sodium edate were closely comparable to those obtained using inorganic salt and alkali.

A review of literature revealed that several studies had conducted {{research in the area of}} Oxygen (02) plasma and surface etching, but little work had been published in the area of the effects of O 2 plasma on the printing process. The research analysed low pressure plasma as a pre-treatment to modify the surface of PET. Surface roughness and chemical functionalization were determined for the different discharge powers and exposure times. The experimental methodology utilised a low-pressure radio frequency (RF) oxygen plasma using 4 discharge powers and a constant exposure time. Further experiments were conducted at 600 W for 2, 4, 6 and 8 minutes to determine the level of etching.

40|$|This study {{primarily}} {{focuses on}} the reduction of salts during the dyeing of cotton. Cotton fabrics were pretreated with Chitosan and Cibafix ECO respectively, and then dyed with reactive and direct dyes with various amount of salt in a dye bath, to determine the optimum pre-treatment conditions of a reduced salt concentration. Cotton fabric was dyed with two different classes of reactive dyes and a direct dye with 100 %, 75 %, 50 % and 0 % of the recommended amount of salt. Various methods of pre-treatment application were trialed to determine {{the most effective and}} efficient method, as well as to determine the optimum conditions of the pre-treatments. Exhaustion levels of the dye bath as well as Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) levels were measured. Colour strength measurements were also studied along with <b>colourfastness</b> properties. It was found that cotton fabric pre-treated with Cibafix ECO and dyed with 25 % less salt was more effective than fabric pre-treated with Chitosan and dyed with 25 % less salt. Any greater reduction in salt has detrimental effects on the levelness of dyeing. When using only 75 % of the recommended amount of salt, the pre-treated fabrics showed higher extents of exhaustion compared with samples dyed without the pre-treatment. At optimum pre-treatment conditions a saving of 25 % salt usage was observed for cotton dyed with direct and reactive dyes. In addition these samples also showed moderate to very high fastness properties...|$|E

Nowadays, the handloom fabrics are much preferred due to development of innovative designs and their comfort in wearing Due to increased environmental awareness the use of natural dyes are much preferred in dyeing of handloom fabrics. But, khadi cotton has some major shortcomings like less dyeability. Keeping in view that the pretreatment of khadi cotton with cellulases, swelling agents and combination of cellulases {{and swelling}} agents before dyeing improves the colour strength properties, the present study was planned. The khadi cotton samples were treated with optimized conditions of enzymes and swelling agents. The optimum pH, concentration, treatment time and temperature selected for the acid cellulase enzyme treatment were 5. 5, 1. 5 % (owf), 45 minutes and 50 °C, respectively whereas in case of neutral cellulase enzyme, it was 7. 5, 2. 0 % (owf), 70 minutes and 70 °C respectively. The optimum concentration, treatment time and temperature selected for sodium hydroxide treatment were 20 % w/v, 60 minutes and 60 °C, respectively. In case of ethylenediamine, 80 % w/v, 60 minutes and 70 °C were selected as optimum concentration, treatment time and temperature, respectively. In case of zinc chloride treatment, the optimum concentration, treatment time and temperature were selected as 80 % w/v, 60 minutes and 70 °C. 5 g Butea frondosa dye extracted for 75 minutes gave best results on khadi cotton when dyeing was carried out for 90 minutes It was observed that out of various concentrations of mordants used with Butea frondosa dye, best shades of colour were obtained by using 0. 04 g of Alum, 0. 01 g of Copper sulphate, 5 g each of Babool bark.

40|$|Fabric {{has always}} been {{prominent}} throughout history. In the last 70 years new synthetic fabrics have been developed which mimic the natural fibres but have increased strength, durability and stretchability. Common fibres include Polyester, Nylon and Lycra(R). These fibres can be blended to incorporate the properties of both the individual fibre types. Gold nanoparticles {{have been found to}} give the stable deep red colour found in stained glass but the science was not understood until the quantum mechanical work of Mie in 1908 on the interaction of electromagnetic radiation (visible light) with fine particles of matter. It is proposed that gold nanoparticles can be used as stable colourants bound to synthetic fibres and other textiles due to its chemical unreactivity. The most common formation method is the use of a reductant such as poly(ethylene imine), sodium citrate or tannic acid. This thesis reports the research and development of new, novel hybrid materials created by combining the interesting properties of both the synthetic fabrics and gold nanoparticles. Twenty five different methods (broken down into four general categories - pre-made colloids, in-situ reduction, use of external reductant after uptake of gold solution and growth of seed particles) were attempted resulting in fabrics that were a variety of shades and colours including pink, purple, tan and gold. The synthetic fabric-gold nanoparticle hybrid samples were analysed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet/visible reflectance spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and ColourQuest measurements. A sample was also subjected to industry standard "abrasion" and <b>colourfastness</b> tests in which it gained the highest mark possible, showing no staining of other fabrics under dry rub conditions. Atomic absorption measurements were performed on solutions after the fabric was removed in order to confirm the amount of gold uptake by the fabric samples. Analysis showed that a range of nanoparticle sizes and shapes were produced which influenced the visual colour of the fabric. The purple samples produced are caused by small particles (500 nm) that are either made up of small spheres fused together or are large plates (trigonal, hexagonal); therefore, Mie's laws do not appear to apply. Light coloured samples generally have a few small particles (< 100 nm) that are spaced out over the fibre surface...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of studies into the effectiveness of biodegradable alkaline organic salts as alternatives to traditional nonbiodegradable inorganic electrolytes and alkalis used in pad-steam dyeing of cotton with reactive dyes. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} develop improved environmentally sustainable dyeing systems. A difluorochloropyrimidine and a bis(sulphatoethylsulphone) dye were used in this study. After early encouraging results using alkaline polycarboxylic sodium salts, it became clear that current literature and dyeing theories on the role of the electrolyte cations and anions needed further explanation for pad dyeing methods. Accordingly, studies were carried out on a range of electrolytes of different cations and anions. These studies have resulted in a new theory for dyeing of cotton with anionic dyes using electrolytes. Traditionally, industry and dye research laboratories have determined the optimum concentration for an electrolyte, in grams per litre, via laboratory tests. This research has shown that for a given cation the required concentration of an alternative electrolyte can be determined by its ionic strength, i. e. µ = ½ ∑ [molar concentration of the salt x (ionic charge) 2]. In other words, having determined the optimum concentration for, say, sodium chloride, the optimum concentration of any other sodium salt is the concentration required to give the same ionic strength. These findings also lead to an improved understanding of the use of electrolytes. The driving force for dye diffusion and also dye exhaustion (exhaust dyeings) is the dyebath ionic strength; i. e. it is independent of the type of electrolyte and alkali. In pad dyeing of cotton, dye fixation and ultimate colour yield significantly depend on the dye diffusion and the subsequent uniformity of distribution of dye molecules throughout the fibre. A hypothesis for a new and simple method of determining the extent of dye diffusion in pad dyeing of cotton with reactive dyes was proven. The new method is based on reflectance measurements for quantifying the dye diffusion. The new theory on the role of electrolyte cations and anions and the new method for determining the extent of dye diffusion were then used in the study on a range of biodegradable alkaline organic salts as alternatives to traditional nonbiodegradable inorganic electrolytes and alkalis for pad-steam of dyeing of cotton with reactive dyes. The research presents results where any of the three biodegradable alkaline polycarboxylic sodium salts, tetrasodium ethylene diamine tetra-acetate, trisodium nitrilo triacetate and tetrasodium N,N-bis(carboxylatomethyl) -L-glutamate can be used as alternatives to traditionally used inorganic electrolyte and alkali in the pad liquor. The optimum concentrations of the organic salts were determined for dye diffusion, dye fixation and colour yield. The dye fixation, colour yield and ultimate <b>colourfastness</b> achieved by using alkaline polycarboxylic salts were closely comparable to those obtained by using inorganic electrolyte and alkali. More interestingly, the dyeing effluent showed considerable reductions in total dissolved solids content with the organic salts. In order to examine the applicability of the alkaline polycarboxylic salt, an industrial trial was carried out using sodium edate which gave similar encouraging results...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to appraise the fastness properties of some natural dyes of plant origin on cotton fabric. Owing to the growing trend of going "green" throughout the world, a renewed international interest has developed in the dyeing of textiles with natural colourants. These dyes exhibit better biodegradability and are usually well compatible with the environment. They contain natural colouring matter which is generally non-allergic, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and non-hazardous to the user and environment. Common drawbacks of natural dyes are their non-uniform shades and poor to moderate <b>colourfastness.</b> In this research project, solvent extracted dyes from alkanet (Alkana tinctoria), cutch (Acacia catechu), madder (Rubia tinctorum) and ready to use dyes from marigold flower (Tegetes erecta L) and Turkey red (Rubia cordifolia) have been applied on cotton fabric through pad-steam dyeing procedure. To evaluate the possibility of increasing their colour fastness, various dyeing auxiliaries (mordants, UV absorbers, cationizing agents, crosslinkers, etc.) have been applied by pre-treatment and post-treatment techniques. Metallic mordants included aluminium sulphate, copper sulphate, ferric chloride, potassium dichromate and hydrated potassium aluminium sulphate or alum. Better fastness (wash, light, crocking), colour coordinates (lightness, chroma, hue and colour strength) as well as improvement in tensile strength was achieved with postmordanting of copper sulphate on most of these dyes. Pre-mordanting of potassium dichromate brutally damaged the tensile strength of the alkanet dyed sample. Cationization of cotton with quaternary ammonium compound (Albafix WFF) has improved the fastness properties, tensile strength as well as relative colour strength (K/S) of cotton dyed with alkanet, cutch and marigold flower dyes. Post-padding of reactive UV absorber based on oxalanilide (UV-SUN) and UV absorber Rayosan C (heterocyclic compound) greatly increased the light fastness of cotton fabric, dyed with these dyes. Similarly, post-treatment of soft polyurethane emulsion (Dicrylan) has enhanced the light and wash fastness as well as retained the tensile strength of natural dyed cotton. The use of crosslinkers could not bring further enhancement in the K/S value of cotton dyed with alkanet and generally, they yielded lighter shade. Cutch root extract yielded variety of beautiful brown shades with different mordants. It made an excellent demonstration of the colour fastness and tensile strength of cotton. Improved fastness properties and tensile strength have resulted from the postpadding of crosslinkers i. e., Knittex (modified dihydroxyethylene urea) and Fixapret F ECO (modified dimethyloldihydroxyethylene urea) on cutch dyed cotton. Pre-treatments of most of the metallic mordants have decreased the tensile strength of Turkey red dyed cotton to a great extent. Madder was the least successful dye in terms of fastness and tensile properties. The post-padding of crosslinkers glyoxalmonourein (Fixapret CPF) on marigold flower dyed sample imparted good fastness properties in addition to improving the tensile strength of the fabric. However, the shade of sample was lighter (pale yellow) than the other dye formulations. Among the two types of treatments, post padding proved significantly better in most of the dyeing recipes...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{opportunities}} {{exist for}} the development of innovative multifunctional textiles for high value market applications. Composites that combine the inherent properties of their all precursor components in a synergistic manner in particular are sought after. Thus the unique chemical and physical properties of silver or silver halide nanoparticles are combined with the traditional properties of wool, thereby producing an innovative multifunctional composite. The prepared wool - silver or - silver halide nanoparticle composites retain the elasticity, thermal insulation and softness of the wool, whilst the colour, conductivity and antimicrobial properties owing to the nanoparticles are also incorporated. Due to the multi functions of silver the resulting high quality, high value product has numerous applications within the fashion and interior furnishings industries. The wools employed for the preparation of wool - silver or - silver chloride nanoparticle composites are merino wool and crossbred wool. Merino wool provides the main focus of the research. The experimental approach for the colouring of merino by silver or silver halide nanoparticles follows a novel and proprietary approach. The preparation of wool - silver nanoparticle composites includes two different procedures: 1) the synthesis of nanoparticles in the presence of wool fibres, using an external reducing agent/stabilising agent (trisodium citrate (TSC)), with the in situ binding of nanoparticles {{to the surface of the}} fibre; and 2) the synthesis of nanoparticles in the presence of the merino wool substrate, using the reducing nature of wool, with the in situ binding of nanoparticles within the fibre. Merino wool - silver nanoparticle composites range in colour from very pale yellow, through gold to tan and brown. The successful preparation of wool - silver halide nanoparticle composites includes the in situ precipitation of nanoparticles within the wool fibre. This is accomplished by doping the wool, with one of the halides, Cl⁻, Br⁻ or I⁻, prior to treatment with a silver containing solution. The colour of merino wool - silver halide nanoparticle composites can be tuned from pink to peach to purple. The colour of the wool - silver or - silver halide nanoparticle composites is due to surface plasmon resonances, i. e. the interaction of electromagnetic radiation of visible light with the nanoparticles. The reflected colour is dependent upon the size and shape of the nanoparticle, in addition to the refractive index of the stabilising agent surround the particle. The refractive index of silver chloride or silver bromide differs to that of the reducing/stabilising agent implemented, TSC, or merino, and thus the reflected colour is altered. The colour of silver iodide nanoparticles appears to be due to the interaction of light with the formed nanoparticles themselves and not due to the formation of silver nanoparticles within the silver iodide nanoparticles. In addition to the colour being measured by UV-vis in reflectance mode, the characterisation of the hues of the prepared composites were monitored by obtaining CIE L*, a*, b* values via the HunterLab Colourquest. The morphological characterisation of merino wool coloured by silver or silver chloride nanoparticles was undertaken using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When merino wool - silver nanoparticle composites are prepared using an external reducing agent, the formed nanoparticles predominantly bind to the wool fibres surfaces only. When the reducing nature of wool is used for composite preparation, nanoparticles are formed within the fibre and are dispersed throughout the fibres core, with few being present on the surface. Comparable studies of merino wool - silver halide nanoparticle composites showed that silver halide nanoparticles are formed and stabilised just below the fibres surface. The confirmation of silver or silver halide species within the prepared composites was undertaken using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning transmission spectroscopy (STEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). <b>Colourfastness</b> tests to washing, rubbing and exposure to chlorinated swimming pool water were undertaken to assess the robustness of the prepared composites in terms of their colour. These tests indicate that the colours of both merino wool - silver and - silver chloride nanoparticle composites are very stable. The leaching of silver during the washing process was noted to be insignificant, suggesting a strong and stable bond between the fibre substrate and the nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to elucidate the chemical bonding between the wool fibre substrate and the silver or silver halide nanoparticles. The <b>colourfastness</b> of merino wool - silver or - silver halide nanoparticle composites to light however, was not observed. When exposed to UV light for extended periods, a distinct change in colour occurs. Silver nanoparticle composites lighten considerably, whereas their silver chloride nanoparticle counterparts are noted to become grey in their colour. XPS was used in an attempt to determine what leads to the discolouration of the composites. Further research is required however, in order to reduce or halt the colour degradation of merino wool - silver or - silver chloride nanoparticle composites. Silver iodide nanoparticles, on the other hand, show great potential as colourants for wool, exhibiting stable colours over a long time period to light. A range of desirable colours are obtained through the colouring of wool by silver or silver halide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are strongly bound to the fibres and thus the colours are stable to washing and rubbing, exhibiting insignificant leaching of silver during such processes. Additionally, the prepared silver and silver halide nanoparticle composites tested positive for their antistatic properties, and their antimicrobial activity, providing a high value multifunctional material. Numerous applications within fashion and interior furnishing industries are therefore apparent. However, the evident setback for applications in these fields is the colour instability to light of silver, silver chloride and silver bromide nanoparticles, and thus further studies are required to eliminate this problem. Alternative options {{exist for the}} exploitation of the photosensitivity of silver halide nanoparticles within the merino wool composites, or the possibility of using silver or silver halide nanoparticles in combination with other strong dyes for the production of coloured woollen fabrics...|$|E
