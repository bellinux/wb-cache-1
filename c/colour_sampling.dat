40|$|A {{multispectral}} imaging system, after necessary calibration, {{can measure}} the spectral reflectances of <b>colour</b> <b>samples</b> accurately {{at a high}} spatial resolution. A limitation is that agreement of its measurements with those of a reference spectrophotometer {{is affected by the}} reflective characteristics of sample materials. The state-of-the-art methods aim to improve interinstrument agreement using the spectral values of neighbouring bands. However, it is observed that non-neighbouring bands are more effective in modelling interinstrument agreement. Inspired by this observation, the present paper proposes a method for eliminating material dependency by least-squares regression among non-neighbouring spectral bands. The fundamental issue of band selection is solved using a binary differential evolution algorithm. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method is effective in reflectance correction in terms of both spectral and colorimetric accuracy.

40|$|Abstract: Colour harmony {{has been}} an {{important}} factor for colour planning. A general consensus has been reached in the definition of colour harmony, as suggested by Judd and Wyszecki [1] that ‘when two or more colours seen in neighbouring areas produce a pleasing effect, they are said to produce a colour harmony’. In the present study, a psychophysical experiment was carried out to study colour harmony, in which <b>colour</b> <b>samples</b> were systematically {{selected on the basis of}} Berlin and Kay’s 11 universal colour names [2]—black, white, grey, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, and brown. These <b>colour</b> <b>samples</b> generated a total of 1431 colour pairs to be assessed in the experiment, which was conducted on a properly calibrated CRT display at a dark room. The colour pairs were shown one by one on the display as two colour squares placed next to each other, with a uniform medium grey as the background colour. In the experiment, a 10 -point scale of harmonious-disharmonious assessment was adopted for data collection on the forced-choice basis. Seventeen subjects, including 11 males and 6 females, each with normal colour vision, took part in the experiment. Experimental results indicate that colour harmony was affected by the three colour-appearance attributes, hue, lightness, and chroma. From these attributes, four colour-harmony factors were revealed and were used to develop a colour science based colour-harmony model for 2 -colour combinations...|$|R
40|$|Hitherto, {{methods for}} visual {{assessment}} of colour appearance {{have not been}} developed {{for use in the}} study of rooms. We seek a practical method that allows one or two observers to characterize a room by identifying the perceived colours. Verbal descriptions are necessary, but lack precision. A magnitude estimation method may enable a more precise location in colour space. However, the need of a group of well-trained observers makes it impractical for room studies. A method involving matches between reference <b>colour</b> <b>samples</b> and the perceived room colours would be ideal. But, reference <b>colour</b> <b>samples</b> require a standard illumination; otherwise, the <b>sample</b> changes <b>colour</b> due to different room light. Hence, a method involving a colour reference box was developed. The colour reference box with its standard source of illumination provides a reference situation, where <b>colour</b> <b>samples</b> can be visually compared with the colours of the room. The study presented is an evaluation of this colour reference box. The crucial problem is that the same color sample in the box is perceived differently, as the observer adapts to various lighting conditions. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate if these different perceptions of the samples could be described and controlled. In the study, 18 observers were asked to visually assess the hue of 15 – 66 samples, and mark its place in the NCS hue circle. The assessment of the samples was made in two different room lights: incandescent light and simulated daylight. The result of the study showed a clear tendency for the samples, perceived in the box, to shift colour in simulated daylight compared to incandescent light. It was concluded that the problem with the observer's adaptation to the room light can be described and controlled, although complementary studies are needed to quantify the adaptation effect with more accuracy, and to investigate differences in nuance. Thus, it seems that the colour reference box can be used to visually evaluate and describe the differences in colour appearance in different rooms. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|Introduction Classical colour {{prediction}} models do {{not take}} fluorescence into account, and their predictions fail if fluorescent substances are contained in the inks.

The method is based on a "one channel" modelization of the phenomenon where only one direction of propagation is taken into account. This model is used to compute the transmittance spectra of uniform <b>colour</b> <b>samples.</b> The proposed prediction model requires measuring the transmittance spectra, the quantum yields, the absorption bands and the emission spectra of the fluorescent inks.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the problem of {{colorimetric}} fidelity of digitized colour slides representing fine al? paintings. This consists of a comparison between colour measurements provided by spectrophotometry on fourteen original <b>colour</b> <b>samples,</b> which are uniformly painted square-shaped patches and those taken on digitized colour slides of the same <b>colour</b> <b>samples.</b> Digital acquisition of slides were performed by a 3 CCD detector and a combination of colour correction filters. The obtained R-cam, G(cam), and B-cam values were then corrected and transformed into X-cam, Y-cam, and Z(cam) values based on the CIE 1931 XYZ colorimetric system. The colour difference, Delta E-CMC*, in the CMC uniform colour space is also calculated and found to be equal to seven, Delta E-CMC* = 7, in average value, when colour compensating filters are used. This method is finally applied to four art works reproduced on different slides, and colour results were qualitatively compared as an indication to these resulting from Ostwald disk and saturation diagrams of previous research studies related to paintings that are created br the same artists. This comparison led to the same conclusions that were already proposed by the previous researchers. The results clearly demonstrate the contribution of the method to a computer-aided study of art works through image data banks that are realized by slides, taking into consideration, however, that this study consists of a first approach, offering a promising {{solution to the problem of}} colour accuracy of slides.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{one and the same}} {{interior}} colouring will appear different in rooms with windows facing north or facing south, but it is not known how natural daylight from these two compass points affects perceived colour {{and the ways in which}} colour is experienced. The objective is to describe the perceived colours to be expected in rooms with sunlight and diffused light, and thus develop a tool for colour design. Two empirical investigations provide the basis for six attached papers. The model is exploratory with a qualitative character. One hundred and ninety-one studies were carried out with 79 observers in full-scale rooms, with double-glazed transparent room windows facing north or south. The NCS <b>colour</b> <b>sample</b> collection and <b>colour</b> terminology were used, with three yellow, red, blue and green hues in two nuances: whitish 1010 and more chromatic 1030. The walls were painted in a total of 23 selected inherent colours with each colour observed in up to 10 studies. Colour matching was achieved using a colour reference box and results were analysed with the aid of the terms inherent colour and identity colour. The colour reference box was tested in a separate study to investigate any methodological problems. Room character was described using semantic differentials, and data was processed using the SPSS statistics program. Verbal description using own words was applied in a descriptive and reflecting method to find sensory differences and precise, yet ordinary descriptions. Colour differences between rooms were assessed using verbal description of hue and nuance, and a supplementary method with specified <b>colour</b> <b>samples.</b> Emotional impressions of colour and rooms were assessed using a method describing primary emotions and the results were compared with results from another study using small <b>colour</b> <b>samples.</b> The <b>colouring</b> that enhanced or neutralised room light situation was compared as regards emotional impression and thereafter compared with results from another study. Daylight from the different compass points caused a clear shift in hue and nuance. The perceived colour was consistently more chromatic and more blackish than the inherent colour used. Nuance 1010 shifted more in chromaticness than nuance, while 1030 instead increased most in chromaticness. Even minor colour differences resulted in major differences in colour experience. The north-facing room in yellowish colours shifted towards reduced yellowishness in both hue and chromaticness. Indications were that north-facing rooms in reddish blue become more reddish than south-facing rooms. QC 2010071...|$|R
