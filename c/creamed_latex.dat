500|$|The filmmakers {{intended}} {{to create a}} very mobile Batsuit {{that would allow the}} wearer to move easily to fight and crouch. Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restrictive of full head movement. Costume designer Lindy Hemming and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed [...] "Cape Town", a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London. The Batsuit's basic design was a neoprene undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded <b>cream</b> <b>latex</b> sections. Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam's durability.|$|R
5000|$|Treculia africana {{is a large}} {{tree and}} {{is part of the}} family Moraceae. It grows in wet areas and forests. The species can grow up to a height of 30 m. The girth of the stem can attain 6 m. The bark is grey and {{discharges}} a <b>cream</b> <b>latex.</b> The leaves are large and dark green above and lighter below. Trees dioecious (sexes on separate trees) or sometimes monoecious. Leaves in two ranks; stipules amplexicaul (enclosing the bud). Inflorescences unisexual, sometimes bisexual, globose, borne in the leaf axils or on the older wood and branches. Pistillate (female) flowers lining the outer surface of a large receptacle (‘bread fruit’). The flowering period is from October until February. The fruit is big, round and greenish yellow. The texture of the fruit is spongy when it is ripe and it contains abundant seeds, which are the edible part of this fruit. Under good environmental conditions, the yield from one tree attains 200 kg dried seeds. Seeds are dicotyledonous ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fresh field latex (FL) of Hevea brasiliensis was {{centrifuged}} {{to separate}} the major compartments: (i) the cream, (ii) the skim plus the C-serum, and (iii) the bottom fraction. Cream was dispersed in distilled water to prepare <b>cream</b> washed <b>latex</b> or CL sample. Skim was collected together with C-serum to prepare the skim latex or SKL sample. Then, films were made from FL, CL and SKL. The mesostructure (macromolecular structure and aggregates or gel) of the natural rubber films was studied by size exclusion chromatography coupled to a multiangular light scattering detector (SEC-MALS). The mesostructure was analyzed on fresh films and on films stored in the laboratory for three months (slow structuring). This study showed that FL and CL films had bimodal elution profiles of long and short polyisoprene chains as revealed by the two peaks on the chromatograms at low and high elution volumes, respectively. On the contrary, SKL films exhibited unimodal elution profiles at low elution volume and a highly abnormal molar masses elution profiles. After 3 months storage, the mesostructure of FL evolved dramatically especially the number-average molar masses (Mn), which increased by 60 %. The mesostructure of CL films evolved at a lesser extent and, the mesostructure of SKL films exhibited no significant change. These results indicated (i) the skim rubber particles are not prone to slow structuring during storage in presence of serum and (ii) some constituents either in the serum or/and in the bottom fraction could still be present with cream and {{be involved in the}} slow structuring of <b>cream</b> particles <b>latex...</b>|$|R
50|$|Lactarius scrobiculatus {{produces}} large agaricoid fruiting bodies which {{arise from}} soil. The cap has an eye-catching orange to yellow coloration and {{is covered with}} small scales arranged in indistinctive concentric rings. The surface is wet, glossy and slimy especially in wet weather. The cap may be wide, with a large diameter (about 15 cm in mature specimens), but with a depressed centre and slightly inrolled margin. The gills are crowded and coloured cream to yellow, with darker patches being present sometimes. When cut, the gills bleed copious amounts of a white to <b>cream</b> milk (<b>latex),</b> which soon darkens to yellow. The stem, {{in relation to the}} cap, is quite short and stubby. The surface is cap-coloured but the presence of small pits, filled with fluid, is a key identifying feature. The stem is hollow. The spores are coloured creamy with an elliptical-globular shape.|$|R
