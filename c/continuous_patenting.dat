5000|$|Throughout {{the decade}} (1920-30) he was {{developing}} the various elements of his Delacommune procedure always perfecting them, realizing <b>continuous</b> <b>patents</b> {{of the various}} components, materials and methods to be used. In the case of greater expansion and potentiality of the system could control from nine to twelve different devices, but in a very unstable and simple way.With the advent of sound cinema, his live performance technique ended up making a great contribution to the later techniques of dubbing, since his procedure and device (especially the element called Kinematic band [...] ) are an immediate precedent of the so-called rhythmographic paper-band, basic tool of those works until recently, and its subsequent substitution by digital systems.|$|R
40|$|A rapid <b>continuous</b> <b>patented</b> {{process is}} {{described}} for the extraction {{at ambient temperature}} of juice from shredded cane in three stages. In each stage air is displaced from the cane bed by upward flow of displacement juice ('Meichage') followed by downward displacement of the enriched juice in true plug flow by lower brix juice pumped from the succeeding stage. In the third (final) stage the displacement is by a mixture of presswater and imbibition water. Megasse from the final stage is conventionally dewatered. Total processing time including dewateringldrying is about two minutes. Pol extraction of 98 % has been achieved in laboratory tests. The theory on which the design is based, a flow diagram, brix balance, typical layout drawing and comparative costings of a Rivibre Juice Extractor and other methods of juice extraction are presented...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} patent related theses and {{dissertations}} from the universities in Taiwan until {{the academic year}} 2007. First, the research trends are analyzed by the life cycle model of the annual published works, and then the cluster analysis is carried out based on the similarities among the keywords set for each thesis or dissertation. Finally, the evolution of research trends is explored from the social, economic and industrial development perspectives. The result shows {{that the development of}} Taiwanâ€™s patent related researches can be divided into three stages: (1) beginning stage before 1994 : The majority of subjects are on the aspect of law, such as modification of patent system, infringement and licensing. (2) introduction stage from 1995 to 1999 : Besides legal issues, the subjects include management of intellectual property and application of patent analysis. (3) growth stage since 2000 : The patent related researches have been intensified in a remarkable manner, and the topics cover the legal, management, commercial, financial, and engineering aspects. On the whole, the patent related researches from the universities in Taiwan deal with the management and legal issues more than others. The <b>continuous</b> <b>patent</b> related studies in the engineering field just appear at the growth stage, and still remain in a small scale, which indicates the academics requires more efforts on the upstream of patent process...|$|R

His process was introduced in the US and UK, but is now used for commercial beer production only in New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Today, most {{sidewalk}} ribbons {{are constructed}} with cross-lying strain-relief grooves placed or sawn {{at regular intervals}} typically 5 ft apart. This partitioning, an improvement over the <b>continuous</b> slab, was <b>patented</b> in 1924 by Arthur Wesley Hall and William Alexander McVay, who wished to minimize damage to the concrete {{from the effects of}} tectonic and temperature fluctuations, both of which can crack longer segments. The technique is not perfect, as freeze-thaw cycles (in cold-weather regions) and tree root growth can eventually result in damage which requires repair.|$|R
25|$|Engineers in {{the nineteenth}} century {{understood}} that a bridge that was continuous across multiple supports would distribute the loads among them. This would result in lower stresses in the girder or truss and meant that longer spans could be built. Several nineteenth century engineers <b>patented</b> <b>continuous</b> bridges with hinge points mid-span. The use of a hinge in the multi-span system presented the advantages of a statically determinate system and of a bridge that could handle differential settlement of the foundations. Engineers could more easily calculate the forces and stresses with a hinge in the girder.|$|R
50|$|The Hoffman brickworks {{was founded}} by Jenkin Collier and James McKenzie with Messrs Barry Owen and Rourke. Initially it {{employed}} Pratt brick presses, and constructed Hoffman <b>patent</b> <b>continuous</b> firing kilns, developed by Friedreich Hoffman in Stettin, Prussia in 1859. In 1887 the company had ordered Bradley & Craven Ltd automatic brick presses, which were fabricated by Langlands foundry {{and a year later}} purchased another at the centennial exhibition. The first kiln was circular, but the company rapidly expanded and added at least five oblong Hoffman Kilns between 1880 and about 1914.|$|R
50|$|The Patent Office was {{established}} by the Patents Law Amendment Act 1852 and opened on 1 October that year. Patents had been awarded prior to this date - indeed Britain has a <b>continuous</b> history of <b>patent</b> regulation dating back {{at least as far}} as the fifteenth century; however, by the mid-nineteenth century the process of application had become extremely complicated. This act consolidated patent scrutiny and awards into a single office serving the whole of the United Kingdom (where previously a petitioner had had to apply and pay fees to several offices, and to obtain separate patents for each of the UK's constituent nations).|$|R
2500|$|In {{its earlier}} {{versions}} however, {{it was a}} batch process, rather than <b>continuous,</b> and many <b>patents</b> were {{to follow in the}} USA and Europe, though not all were practical. In 1924, a delegation from the American Sinclair Oil Corporation visited Shukhov. Sinclair Oil apparently wished to suggest that the patent of Burton and Humphreys, in use by Standard Oil, was derived from Shukhov's patent for oil cracking, as described in the Russian patent. If that could be established, it could strengthen the hand of rival American companies wishing to invalidate the Burton-Humphreys patent. In the event Shukhov satisfied the Americans that in principle Burton's method closely resembled his 1891 patents, though his own interest in the matter was primarily to establish that [...] "the Russian oil industry could easily build a cracking apparatus according to any of the described systems without being accused by the Americans of borrowing for free".|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present results}} on microwave, millimeter-wave, and millimeter-wave-driven plasma-assisted {{processing}} of materials. The research is primarily {{based on two}} systems- a 2. 45 GHz, 6 kW S-band system and an 83 GHz, 15 kW gyrotron-based quasi-optical system. The S-Band system is used to synthesize nanophase metals, metal mixtures, and metal oxides by our <b>patented</b> <b>continuous</b> microwave polyol process, which has potential for large scale and low cost production. This system is also being investigated to develop techniques for titanium melting and sintering. The 83 -GHz system is used for rapid sintering of ceramic powder compacts to produce polycrystalline materials with limited grain growth. An important application is {{to the development of}} polycrystalline laser host materials for high power solid-state lasers, where the requirement is for transparency with high optical quality and good lasing efficiency. We are currently investigating solid-state reactive sintering of Nd-doped YAG (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet) from commercial oxide powders. This has thus far yielded translucent samples with good fluorescence lifetime of the lasing state. Techniques for further reducing light scattering by residual pores are being investigated. Finally, the millimeter-wave system is being used in the development of millimeter-wave plasma-assisted diamond deposition, as the quasi-optical system has significant advantage...|$|R
40|$|Argonne National Laboratory has {{developed}} a <b>patented,</b> <b>continuous</b> process for the recovery of flexible polyurethane foam (PUF) from auto shredder residue (ASR). To test the process, Argonne researchers conceived of, designed, and built a continuous foam washing and drying system that was pilot-tested at a shredder facility for six months. Economic analysis of the process, using manufacturers' quotes and operating data from Argonne's pilot plant, indicates a payback of {{less than two years}} for a plant producing about 1, 000 ton/yr of foam. Samples of clean foam were shipped to three major foam reprocessors; all three indicated that the quality of the PUF recovered by the Argonne process met their requirements. Tests of the recovered foam by an independent testing laboratory showed that the recycled foam met the specifications for several automotive applications, including carpet padding, headliner, and sound-suppression support materials. Recovery of foam reduces the mass and the volume of material going to the landfill by about 5 % and 30 %, respectively. Annually, recovery will save about 1. 2 x 10 {sup 12 } Btu of energy, cut the amount of solid waste being landfilled by about 150, 000 tons, and eliminate the emission of about 250 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la: " 3 rd International Conference on Superconductivity and Magnetism" celebrada en Estambul (Turquia) del 29 de abril al 4 de mayo de 2012. Texture {{control in}} oxide superconductors {{has been studied}} intensively since the {{discovery}} of High temperature superconductivity. Efforts to induce texture with laser heating have been widely published in the literature, using systems, which usually made no use of external heating to avoid microcrack formation due to excessive thermal stress around the laser incidence area. The typical cylindrical geometry, most often used in Laser Float Zone Melting (LFZ) hindered the development of appropriate heating devices, thus efforts were launched in order to design a Laser Zone Melting system where the effect of external heating of the superconductor could be ascertained {{in order to obtain}} textured superconducting material in planar geometries. A number of papers have thus appeared in the literature based on Laser Zone Melting of Bi- 2212. Recently, the method has been improved {{with the use of a}} <b>patented</b> <b>continuous</b> Laser Furnace, which will be described here. Combination of colloidal processing and continuous Laser Furnace has been used to fabricate superconducting coatings on different ceramics substrates. In particular we will present results about the optimization of colloidal processing of Bi- 2212, RE- 123, RE- 211 and Cu 5 Ba 3 O 8 green tapes as well as BaZrO 3 substrates. Surface modification of the substrates and texture of the superconducting materials have been reached using a continuous Laser Furnace. The effects of the laser parameters and the temperature of the furnace on the microstructure and physical properties of the samples are also presented. Results show the potential of these processing techniques in the controlled modification of the microstructure and properties of different ceramic materials. Peer reviewe...|$|R
