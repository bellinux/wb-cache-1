5|$|Most alto {{and bass}} {{clarinets}} {{have an extra}} key to allow a (written) E3. Modern professional-quality bass clarinets generally have additional keywork to written C3. Among the less commonly encountered members of the clarinet family, contra-alto and <b>contrabass</b> clarinets may have keywork to written E3, D3, or C3; the basset clarinet and basset horn generally go to low C3.|$|E
5|$|The {{orchestra}} frequently {{includes two}} clarinetists playing individual parts—each player is usually {{equipped with a}} pair of standard clarinets in B and A, and clarinet parts commonly alternate between B and A instruments several times {{over the course of a}} piece, or less commonly, a movement (e.g., 1st movement Brahms' 3rd symphony). Clarinet sections grew larger during the last few decades of the 19th century, often employing a third clarinetist, an E or a bass clarinet. In the 20th century, composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, and Olivier Messiaen enlarged the clarinet section on occasion to up to nine players, employing many different clarinets including the E or D soprano clarinets, basset horn, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and/or <b>contrabass</b> clarinet.|$|E
5|$|Some {{instruments}} {{fall into}} more than one category: for example, the cello may be considered tenor, baritone or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble, and the trombone may be alto, tenor, baritone, or bass and the French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range {{as part of their}} name: soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone horn, alto flute, bass guitar, etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, <b>contrabass</b> clarinet. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C3 to F♯6, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.|$|E

5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and <b>contrabass</b> clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E

25|$|The lowest sizes (larger {{than the}} bass flute) {{have all been}} {{developed}} in the 20th century; these include the sub-bass flute, which is pitched inF, between the bass and contrabass; subcontrabass flute (pitched in G orC), contra-alto flute (pitched in G, one octave below the alto), and double <b>contrabass</b> flute inC, one octave lower than the <b>contrabass.</b> The flute sizes other than the concert flute and piccolo are sometimes called harmony flutes.|$|E

25|$|The two valves on a bass {{trombone}} {{can either}} be independent or dependent. Double rotor dependent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1950s, and double rotor independent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Dependent means that the second valve only works when used {{in combination with the}} first, as it is located directly on the F- or E-attachment tubing. Newer bass trombones have independent (in-line) valves instead, meaning that the second valve is located on the neckpipe of the instrument and can therefore operate independently of the other. <b>Contrabass</b> trombones also can have valve attachments. <b>Contrabass</b> trombones in the key of F typically have two valves tuned to C and D respectively. <b>Contrabass</b> trombones in B on the other hand typically only have one valve, which is tuned to F, though some have a second valve tuned to G.|$|E
