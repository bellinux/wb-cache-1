5|$|However, {{even though}} on a per-individual basis, many other species are {{actually}} more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or {{as effectively as}} honey bees—in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The <b>commercial</b> <b>viability</b> of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the beekeeping industry.

Sensitivity limit of NEMS oscillators was also considered in a statistical framework. Subsequently, suspended gold nanowire NEMS devices were magnetomotively actuated in vacuum and liquid. Secondly, electromechanical properties of gold nanowires were carefully studied and the observed size effect was found to agree with theory, which predicted small changes of electromechanical property compared with bulk gold materials. Finally, it is well recognized that continuous development of new NEMS devices demands novel materials. Mechanical properties of new two-dimensional hexagonal Boron Nitride films with a few atomic layers were studied.

5|$|The turn of {{the decade}} brought Scorsese's {{black-and-white}} Raging Bull (cowritten by Schrader); an acknowledged masterpiece—the American Film Institute ranks it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time—it is also a retreat, telling {{a story of a}} boxer's moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambience noir dramas such as Body and Soul (1947) and Champion (1949). From 1981, the popular Body Heat, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, invokes a different set of classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting; its success confirmed the <b>commercial</b> <b>viability</b> of neo-noir, {{at a time when the}} major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The mainstreaming of neo-noir is evident in such films as Black Widow (1987), Shattered (1991), and Final Analysis (1992). Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double-entendre than Basic Instinct (1992), directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. The film also demonstrates how neo-noir's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir.

40|$|Abstract. Silicon carbide brings {{well known}} highly {{desirable}} physical and electrical properties to components for power conversion applications. While many esoteric low volume applications are being explored in the aerospace and specialized industries, more widespread commercial success will {{be dependent on}} several factors, including the development of devices ideally suited for targeted high volume applications for which existing semiconductor solutions fall short of the achievement of system performance targets. The challenge in accomplishing this is addressing both the immediate application technical issues, addressing <b>commercial</b> cost <b>viability,</b> and also surmounting market perceptions regarding the suitability of high voltage semiconductors in high reliability applications as diverse as computing server and telecom power supplies, or automotive hybrid vehicle power conversion. Clear cut advantages are achieved with SiC for power conversion in the 400 - 600 V area, resulting {{in the ability to}} drastically scale power density and thermal density in "consumer" grade systems. Details of the component requirements and the affect on system configuration and performance will be discussed for power conversion applications in both offline AC power and automotive applications, and industry inputs regarding component reliability and de-rating will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Typical {{measures}} of goodness of construction price forecasts are {{the mean and}} standard deviation, coefficient of variation and root mean square of the deviations between forecasted and actual values. This can only be valid, however, if the pain, or loss, incurred {{as a result of}} such deviations is directly proportional to the square of their value. Two approaches are used to test this. The first of these analyses 10 sets of data collected from around the world, while the second explores the use of a postal questionnaire survey to elicit construction industry client disutilities. The results of the first analysis mitigate against any general view that projects tend to be overestimated but do clearly suggest asymmetric under/overestimates for the measures used. The second analysis results in an approximated loss function although in ordinal terms only. This also suggests that the functional form varies between building types, with Commercial and Residential being the most asymmetric and Schools and Industrial being less asymmetric. The work to date indicates that, for construction price forecasting, the loss functions involved are asymmetric, with the degree of asymmetry increasing according to the level of <b>commercial</b> financial <b>viability</b> at stake.

30|$|Here, we {{determine}} {{the suitability of}} various standard cell viability assays for a MNP with a particle size of 100 nm. As MNP surface properties especially surface charge {{is an important factor}} in determining their biocompatibility [19, 20], the surface of commercial MNPs was modified with poly(ethylenimine) [MNP-PEI] and further conjugated with poly(ethylene glycol) [MNP-PEI-PEG]. PEI polymers have been reported to increase solution properties of nanoparticles and provide a platform for further modification, such as targeting or solubilisation moieties [21 – 23]. PEG has been widely accepted for nanostructure modification and drug delivery due to its biocompatibility and stealth properties in vivo [24 – 27]. Through surface modification, we obtained two types of MNPs with controlled difference on their surface charges, MNP-PEI having a higher positive charge than MNP-PEI-PEG, and used them as models to analyse the ability of various assays in discriminating the subtle difference in the level of effect those nanoparticles could impose to cells. Another consideration in assessing the sensitivity of the cell viability assays is MNP concentration. Concentrations of MNPs closer to physiological conditions and much lower than that reported in most studies were used in the present study. We validated the cell viability data obtained from commonly used MTS, CellTiter-Blue and CellTiter-Glo assays by comparing them with that obtained with traditional trypan blue exclusion to evaluate the suitability of those <b>commercial</b> cell <b>viability</b> assays for nanotoxicity studies. The validated data were further complemented by measurement of a number of cellular events in response to MNPs including cell membrane integrity, reactive oxygen species [ROS] production and lipid peroxidation [LPO] to give a more comprehensive safety profile.|$|R

Recent misgivings concerning the antroprogenic discharge of desalination effluent (i. e. high temperature and high saline water) into the semi-enclosed, epicontinental waters of the Arabian Gulf question the sustainability of this process.
