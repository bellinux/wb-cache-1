The per-capita annual income of rural residents was 3325rmb with an increase of 5% compared to that of 2007. High quality rice plants area of the town was about 23,000 mu in 2008, sharing 98% of the town’s rice farms. The grain total output in 2008 was 11 thousand tons with an increase of 1.9%. Till now, the newly planted Castanea mollissima is over 1000 mu, and the total Chinese chestnut plant area in the town is 3600 mu, which results in an increase of 2,200,000 rmb of farmer’s income per year. Many villages such as Dabei, Fumei and Hushi village are now planting tobacco, which can realize out value of about 530,000 rmb per year on average.

The aim of this study was to identify the most important <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> for Lithuanian economy in terms of economic importance, supply and environmental risks. The methodology used in the study relies on three sustainability dimensions accordingly expressed by three indicators: Economic Importance (Economic dimension); Supply Risk (Social dimension); Environmental Country Risk (Environmental dimension). The methodology used to define these indicators on imported resources for Lithuanian industry was adapted from report on <b>critical</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> for European Union (Report of the Ad-hoc Working Group on defining <b>critical</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> 2010) published by European Commission in June 2010. <b>Critical</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> are considered to be economically important and the subject to a higher risk of supply interruption.

We exemplify that morphological indices, such as Topographic Position Index (TPI), and spatial coordinates are crucial parameters to improve the accuracy of carbonate classification as much as 10 %. The resulting lithological map shows the spatial distribution of the ridge forming carbonatite dyke, the fenitization zone, syenite plugs and mafic intrusions. In a second step, the internal zones of the carbonatite complex were identified using the Multi-Range Spectral Feature Fitting (MRSFF) algorithm and a specific decision tree.

The Al 2 SiO 5 host matrix, obtained in nano-sized crystals belonging to the high temperature phase known as sillimanite, allows to narrow down the presence of rare earth elements exclusively to the dopants, thus providing a promising solution to the <b>critical</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> concern.

This was achieved without any loss in coverage (as determined by backlight and SEM) even when lower temperature Electroless Copper plating was utilised.

The results obtained by our model (the integrated model) show that the production level should be no larger than the production level obtained by solving the traditional (nonintegrated) models, and that major savings are obtained by solving the integrated model.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of global phosphorus (P) use {{is emerging as}} a major societal goal to secure future food, energy, and water security for a growing population. Phosphate rock (PR) is a <b>critical</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> whose inefficiency of use is leading to widespread eutrophication and uncertainties about supplies of affordable fertilizers. Green chemistry and green engineering {{can be applied to}} help close the global P cycle by addressing three sustainability challenges: (1) consume less PR and with greater efficiency, (2) minimise P losses and generation of waste P that can no longer be re-used, and (3) set economically, socially and environmentally acceptable P sustainability targets to lower P demand. Greater precision in P use by the agriculture sector (the main P flow) supported by smarter PR mining and processing technology could greatly improve global P use efficiency. Emerging bio-based and green chemical technologies could be more widely applied to enhance first- and second-generation valorization of low-grade PR ores, manures, by-products and residues to provide renewable secondary sources of P and other essential elements and compounds.

40|$|Circular economy {{approaches}} aim {{to close}} material cycles along the value chain. As such, the circular economy {{can be a}} long-term strategy to mitigate the risks of <b>critical</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> (CRM) supply. Tantalum, with a current end-of-life recycling rate of less than 1 %, has been intermittently discussed as critical. Even though the specificity of tantalum applications and high-mass fractions of tantalum in relevant components provide good boundary conditions, recycling barriers hinder the successful implementation of recycling technologies. With this case study, we identify potentials and barriers for implementing the recovery of CRM, using the example of tantalum. To this end, information about visually identifiable tantalum capacitors (VICs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs) in various equipment types was obtained by disassembly campaigns for mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, notebooks, desktop personal computers, flat screen monitors, servers, etc., and the chemical analyses of resulting fractions. Results show great differences {{in the application of}} tantalum in various equipment types. Because of this, the tantalum potential of put-on-market (POM) or of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) devices differs between products and regions. Worldwide, the highest POM tantalum flows originate from desktop computers, but in Germany they originate from notebooks. A focus on particular products leads to higher yields in recycling and supports circular economy approaches. Recycling of tantalum from WEEE is generally possible. But an accurate separation of tantalum from PCBs is not feasible solely by separation of VICs. This process also leads to the loss of silver. Further, this study reveals potential miniaturization trends, decreasing the use of VICs, with an anticipated substitution of tantalum with niobium. These barriers impede long-term recycling strategies for tantalum aimed at establishing a circular economy...|$|E
