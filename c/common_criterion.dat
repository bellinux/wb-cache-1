2500|$|Another {{significant}} distinction can be {{made between}} what medical statisticians call incidence and prevalence. For example, even if two studies agree on a <b>common</b> <b>criterion</b> for defining a sexual orientation, one study might regard this as applying to any person who has ever met this criterion, whereas another might only regard him/her as being so if they had done so during {{the year of the}} survey. According to the American Psychological Association, sexual orientation refers to an [...] "enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes", as well as to [...] "a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions."

The controversial force of this part of the attack simply lay in the piercing thoroughness with which the irreconcilable discrepancies between the seventeenth century notion of demonstration, and that notion in the eighteenth, were forced upon the reader's attention.|$|E
