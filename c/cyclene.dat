40|$|Abstract: Synthetic {{protocols}} for the palladium-catalyzed arylation {{of various}} linear and cyclic polyamines and polyoxapolyamines has been worked out. Pd(0) and Pd(II) complexes with such phosphine ligands as dppf, BINAP, PPF-OMe, P(tBu) 3, 2 -ditert-butylphosphino- 1, 1 â€²-biphenyl have been explored {{in the catalytic}} amination reactions. Monoamination of chloro-, bromo-, and iodoarenes with di-, tri-, and tetraamines have been carried out, condi-tions for di- and polyarylation of linear polyamines have been elaborated. Successful aryla-tion of 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane (<b>cyclene)</b> and 1, 4, 8, 11 -tetraazacyclotetradecane (cy-clam) have been conducted. Intramolecular diamination of dihaloarenes such a...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{compounds}} combining a luminescent aza crown ether and 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane (<b>cyclene)</b> or bis- (pyridin- 2 -ylmethylamine) (bpa) metal complexes were prepared. These synthetic receptors {{signal the}} presence of peptidic ammonium phosphates in buffered aqueous solution by changes in their emission intensity. Reversible phosphate ion coordination to the metal complex binding sites decreases the emission intensity of the phthalic ester fluorophore. Structurally suitable ammonium phosphates, such as the Cterminal domain of RNA polymerase II or the protein kinase G target sequence, bind to the synthetic receptors by an additional intramolecular interaction between the ammonium ion and the aza crown ether. The binding of the ammonium ion to the aza crown ether increases the emission intensity of the fluorophore. In aqueous solution, this weak interaction can only occur within aggregates of phosphates and metal complex receptors of matching geometry;therefore, it allows the distinction of structurally related phosphorylated peptides in buffered aqueous solution. ...|$|E
