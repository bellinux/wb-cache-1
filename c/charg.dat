Let G be a finite group and let <b>Char(G)</b> denote the subring of the ring of complex-valued class functions of G consisting of integer combinations of irreducible characters. <b>Char(G)</b> {{is known as the}} character ring of G, and its elements are known as virtual characters (alternatively, as generalized characters, or sometimes difference characters).

40|$|AbstractTo permit direct {{functional}} {{analyses of}} neural circuits, {{we have developed}} a method for stimulating groups of genetically designated neurons optically. Coexpression of the Drosophila photoreceptor genes encoding arrestin- 2, rhodopsin (formed by liganding opsin with retinal), and the α subunit of the cognate heterotrimeric G protein—an explosive combination we term “chARGe”—sensitizes generalist vertebrate neurons to light. Illumination of a mixed population of neurons elicits action potentials selectively and cell-autonomously in its genetically <b>chARGed</b> members. In contrast to bath-applied photostimulants or caged neurotransmitters, which act indiscriminately throughout the illuminated volume, chARGe localizes the responsiveness to light. Distributed activity may thus be fed directly into a circumscribed population of neurons in intact tissue, irrespective of the spatial arrangement of its elements...|$|R
5000|$|The {{proof of}} Brauer's {{induction}} theorem exploits the ring structure of <b>Char(G)</b> (most proofs also {{make use of}} a slightly larger ring, Char*(G), which consists of -combinations of irreducible characters, where &omega; is a primitive complex |G|-th root of unity). The set of integer combinations of characters induced from linear characters of Brauer elementary subgroups is an ideal I(G) of <b>Char(G),</b> so the proof reduces to showing that the trivial character is in I(G). Several proofs of the theorem, beginning with a proof due to Brauer and John Tate, show that the trivial character is in the analogously defined ideal I*(G) of Char*(G) by concentrating attention on one prime p at a time, and constructing integer-valued elements of I*(G) which differ (elementwise) from the trivial character by (integer multiples of) a sufficiently high power of p. Once this is achieved for every prime divisor of |G|, some manipulations with congruencesand algebraic integers, again exploiting the fact that I*(G) is an ideal of Ch*(G), place the trivial character in I(G). An auxiliary result here is that a -valued class function lies in the ideal I*(G) if its values are all divisible (in [...] ) by |G|.|$|E

40|$|We give a group theoretic {{proof of}} the {{splitting}} of sharply 2 -transitive groups of characteristic 3. Key Words: Sharply 2 -transitive groups, Permutation groups. A sharply 2 -transitive group is a pair (G;X), where G is a group acting on the set X {{in such a way}} that for all x; y; z; t 2 X such that x 6 = y and z 6 = t there is a unique g 2 G for which gx = z and gy = t: From now on, (G;X) will stand for a sharply 2 -transitive group with jXj 3. We x an element x 2 X. We let H: = fg 2 G: gx = xg denote the stabilizer of x. Finally we let I denote the set of involutions (elements of order 2) of G. It follows easily from the denition that the group G has an involution; in fact any element of G that sends a distinct pair (y; z) of X to the pair (z; y) is an involution by sharp transitivity. It is also known that I is one conjugacy class and the nontrivial elements of I 2 cannot x any point (See Lemma 1 and Lemma 4). Then one can see that I 2 cannot have an involution if H has an involution. In case H has no involution, one says that <b>char(G)</b> = 2. Let us assume that <b>char(G)</b> 6 = 2. Then I 2 n f 1 g is one conjugacy class [1, Lemma 11. 45]. Since I 2 is closed under power taking, either the nontrivial elements of I 2 all have order p for some prime p 6 = 2 or I 2 has no nontrivial torsion element. One writes <b>char(G)</b> = p or <b>char(G)</b> = 0 depending on the case. One says that G splits if the one point stabilizer H has a normal complement in G.
