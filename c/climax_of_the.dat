5|$|The Iron Age (1200 – 333 BCE) in Lebanon saw the <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Phoenician civilization, which {{culminated in}} its {{maritime}} expansion and the transmission to other {{cultures of the}} alphabet (which was attributed by the Greek legend to the Tyrian Cadmus).

5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to the <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because {{if she were to}} marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E

25|$|The play's {{short run}} was {{immediately}} followed by larger roles in live TV plays on Kaiser Aluminum Hour, The United States Steel Hour and Matinee Theater.

50|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> {{screaming}} {{in any given}} song or album could vary widely from band to band, with some bands using it very infrequently, often at <b>climaxes</b> <b>of</b> songs. <b>The</b> Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Thursday, My Chemical Romance, Finch, Taking Back Sunday, The Used and Story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year are examples of bands achieving widespread success who only occasionally made use of screaming, as opposed to bands like Atreyu, Asking Alexandria, and Underoath, who use screaming rather frequently.Some post-hardcore acts don't use screamed vocals, such as the band Hands Like Houses.|$|R
5|$|As {{the chorus}} progresses, Harket's voice hits ever higher notes, {{reaching}} a falsetto {{and hitting the}} song's highest note (E5, the dominant note) at the end. There is a temporary change of markings in the drum pattern in the chorus, where for two bars the drums play in half time, returning to the same rhythm as before for the <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vocal line. A mix of a drum machine, the LinnDrum, acoustic guitars and electronic instrumentation serves as the song's backing track.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event, a crate {{filled with}} disco records was blown {{up on the}} field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers.

25|$|Some {{scholars}} assume, as mentioned, {{that the}} story had existed independently before it was integrated into its current context. Willem Beuken think that the original tale was not about the king's wisdom - The concluding note about Solomon's wisdom is considered secondary - but about a woman who, by listening to her motherly instinct, helped the king {{to break through the}} legal impasse. Beuken notes additional biblical stories which share <b>the</b> motif <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman who influenced the king: Bathsheba, <b>the</b> woman <b>of</b> Tekoa, and Solomon's foreign wives who seduced him into idolatry. Beuken concludes that the true mother exemplifies the biblical character type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wise woman. He proposes an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literary structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story, according to which the section that notes <b>the</b> compassion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true mother (verse 26b) constitutes one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>climaxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story, along with the section that announces Solomon's divine wisdom (verse 28b). According to this analysis, the story in its current context gives equal weight to <b>the</b> compassion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true mother and to the godly wisdom that guided Solomon in the trial.|$|R
50|$|Accumulatio is {{a figure}} of speech, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broader group <b>of</b> enumeratio, in which the points made {{previously}} are presented again in a compact, forceful manner.

5|$|Executive {{producer}} and head writer Steven Moffat wrote the episode as an introduction for Amy {{into the role}} of the Doctor's companion. The episode showcases her first adventure away from her home world and her first time in space. The <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode, where the Doctor decides the best thing he can do is kill the Star Whale as painlessly as possible but Amy comes up with an alternative solution that is more humane, was designed to stand out in the Doctor's memory as a failure of a huge scale. It also reinforced the Doctor's need for a companion and showed how important Amy would be to him.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Shaw {{was chosen}} for the small but crucial role of unmasked and dying Anakin Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, {{the third and final}} film in the {{original}} Star Wars trilogy. Although David Prowse played the costumed scenes and James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader, just as they had in the first two films, Shaw was cast in a single scene with Mark Hamill, during the moment aboard Death Star II when Luke Skywalker unmasks his dying father. Since the scene was unquestionably the emotional <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the final}} was {{broadcast}} by ITV Sport with commentary provided by Clive Tyldesley and Ron Atkinson. The broadcast attracted {{an average of}} 15.5million viewers, with a peak audience of 18.8million at 21:30, just as Manchester United scored their two goals. The <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game was voted as the fourth-greatest sporting moment ever by Channel 4 viewers in a 2002 poll. In Germany, the match was shown on RTL Television, and was seen {{by an average of}} 13.59million people {{over the course of the}} broadcast. In Spain, the match was shown on TVE.|$|E
50|$|Despite <b>the</b> {{popularity}} <b>of</b> some advertisements, {{many consider}} {{them to be}} an annoyance for a number <b>of</b> reasons. <b>The</b> main {{reason may be that}} <b>the</b> sound volume <b>of</b> advertisements tends to be higher (and in some cases much higher) than that <b>of</b> regular programming. <b>The</b> United States Congress passed a bill on September 30, 2010, called the CALM Act, to reduce <b>the</b> sound volume <b>of</b> advertisements, and loudness rules set by the FCC are effective as of December 13, 2012. In the UK, <b>the</b> Broadcast Committee <b>of</b> Advertising Practice has a similar regulation. <b>The</b> increasing number <b>of</b> advertisements, as well as overplaying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same advertisement, are secondary annoyance factors. A third might be that television is currently the main medium to advertise, prompting advertising campaigns by everyone from cell-phone companies, political campaigns, fast food restaurants, to local businesses, and small businesses, prompting longer commercial breaks. Another reason is that advertisements often cut into certain parts in the regular programming that are either <b>climaxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot or a major turning point in the show, which many people find exciting or entertaining to watch.|$|R
50|$|However, {{whether there}} would be war and whether the Third Front Movement was {{necessary}} had been under discussion even after the Third Five-Year Plan was passed. There was a famous episode of conversation when Mao was visiting Tianjin. Mao asked whether the Third Front Movement will be unnecessary and wasteful. The local cadre answered: ”No. Even the enemies will not come, the Third Front Movement will still be useful to economic development.” Mao was happy with the answer. In fact, investment in the Third Front region was largely affected by the security situation. <b>The</b> two <b>climaxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Front region, was between 1965 and 1967 after the Gulf the Tokin Incidence, and between 1970 and 1971 after the Conflict over the Zhenbao Island in 1969 with the Soviet Union. Between 1964 and 1980, more than 1,100 large and medium-sized projects were established in the Third Front region. Thousands of plants {{and hundreds of thousands}} of workers moved from big coastal cities to the mountains in the west. In early stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cultural Revolution, the Third Front region was also <b>the</b> destination <b>of</b> many rusticated youths.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century the rhyme has been seen as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most popular and well known in the English-speaking world. It has also been {{referenced}} in both literature and popular culture. It was used by T. S. Eliot at <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> his poem <b>The</b> Waste Land (1922). <b>The</b> final line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verse was probably the inspiration for <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> Lerner and Loewe's 1956 musical My Fair Lady. The tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants.|$|R
