The concept of social business described by professor Yunus is insufficient to put “poverty in museums” because the social businesses can not provide the incentives required for the entrepreneurs to stretch their business for the poor people beyond their existing business pace.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} recent anglicisms, i. e. borrowings and loanwords {{which have}} appeared in the last three decades in the Italian language. The data are taken from Nicola Zingarelli’s “Vocabolario della lingua italiana”. The attention is focussed <b>on</b> <b>borrowings,</b> because they are prevailing in this dictionary. Along with Betz’ and Gusmani’s model, a fundamental distinction is made between the diffusion (German “Einbürgerung”) of a borrowing in everyday use and its phonological and morphological integration (German “Einlehnung”) in the system of the Italian language. The analysis of the borrowings registered in Zingarelli’s dictionary show that “diffusion without integration” is typical for nouns and adjectives, whereas verbs are always integrated, at least morphologically. This observation allows the conclusion that the structure of the Italian language {{does not seem to be}} particularly influenced by anglicisms...|$|R

This indicates that all the <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> C has been transferred to the container, and has exactly neutralized the opposite <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the inside surface of the container, leaving only the <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the outside.
