50|$|On 12 September 2015, he {{was arrested}} and charged with <b>causing</b> a <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>negligence</b> due to driving under the {{influence}} of alcohol. Allegedly, he drove his car at high speed—the wrong way into the oncoming traffic for 7 kilometers—on Novopriozerskoye highway between villages Kerro and Agalatovo in the Vsevolozhsky District, in the St. Petersburg metropolitan area, hitting two cars and seriously injuring the people in those, before hitting a third car head-on and killing two passengers in that third car. The victims were a 28-year-old house painter Sergei Selivanov from St. Petersburg (a father of five children) and a 27-year-old engineer Maksim Kayumov.|$|R
5000|$|Because of a {{reluctance}} by juries to convict when {{the charge was}} manslaughter, a statutory offence of [...] "causing <b>death</b> <b>by</b> dangerous driving" [...] was introduced. Following the Road Traffic Law Review Committee (1988), the Road Traffic Act 1991 abandoned recklessness in favour of the pre-statutory objective test of [...] "dangerousness", i.e. did the driving fall far below the standard of the competent and careful driver. The Committee also recommended that manslaughter should be an optional charge for the more serious driving cases. There {{is the possibility of}} charging an aggravated taking without consent for less seriously dangerous driving where death results. An equivalent, in many American states, to motor manslaughter, is vehicular homicide. An equivalent to <b>causing</b> <b>death</b> <b>by</b> dangerous driving in Canada under the Criminal Code is <b>Causing</b> <b>death</b> <b>by</b> criminal <b>negligence.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Involuntary manslaughter: (sometimes {{referred}} to as fourth-degree murder), a killing that stems {{from a lack of}} intention to <b>cause</b> <b>death</b> but involving an intentional, or negligent, act leading to death. A drunk driving-related death is typically involuntary manslaughter (see also vehicular homicide, <b>causing</b> <b>death</b> <b>by</b> dangerous driving, gross <b>negligence</b> manslaughter and <b>causing</b> <b>death</b> <b>by</b> criminal <b>negligence</b> for international equivalents). Note that the [...] "unintentional" [...] element here refers to the lack of intent to bring about the death. All three crimes above feature an intent to kill, whereas involuntary manslaughter is [...] "unintentional", because the killer did not intend for a death to result from their intentional actions. If there is a presence of intention it relates only to the intent to cause a violent act which brings about the death, but not an intention to bring about the death itself.|$|R

A sentence of greater than 14 years, on the death-by-dangerous-driving charge, can only otherwise be imposed {{if any of the}} remaining charges of which the offender is convicted carry a maximum prison sentence of more than 14 years (e.g. a conviction for <b>Causing</b> <b>death</b> <b>by</b> criminal <b>negligence,</b> as in R v Smith, because that charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment) or the judge decides to sentence the offender to serve a sentence, on a different charge (e.g. hit and run), consecutively to the death-by-dangerous-driving sentence.|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} the two streams {{of law that}} can lead to a conviction for manslaughter under the Criminal Code 1899 (Qld).

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the {{enactment}} of new legislation governing corporate liability for <b>death</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> gross <b>negligence</b> through business activities. The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 has been heralded as an important development in corporate criminal liability. Our research examines {{the potential impact of}} the Act, upon companies and their directors in the UK. The paper considers recent cases where there has been a fatality in the workplace due to gross negligence of the management, and examines the evolving approach of the prosecuting authorities and courts. From our investigations {{it would appear that the}} potential net of corporate criminal liability has now been spread further. If prosecutions are successful, large corporations may face severe fines; however it is small companies and their directors that will usually bear the burden of increased penalties for corporate failure...|$|R
