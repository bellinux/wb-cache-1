50|$|The Silver Hawk {{was similar}} to Macklin's {{previous}} Eric-Campbell design. It had a stylish aluminium body, external exhaust and used a tuned and lightened 1,498cc side-valve engine made by Coventry-Simplex rated at 10/35 hp that drove the rear wheels through a cone clutch and three or four speed transmission. The suspension used semi elliptic leaf springs at the front and <b>cantilever</b> <b>springs</b> at the rear.|$|R

50|$|After trials with Rotax and Volkswagen engines, Lambert {{chose the}} Belgian 61 kW (82 hp) ULPower UL260i {{flat-four}} {{to power the}} M106. The development period also produced changes to the undercarriage, which initially had V-strut main legs and half-axles. These were replaced with <b>cantilever</b> <b>spring</b> glass fiber legs. The standard M106 has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, though tricycle gear is an option. The wheels may be faired. A glass cockpit electronic flight instrument system is standard equipment.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the jump}} method, the top {{cylinder}} is mounted {{to a pair}} of <b>cantilever</b> <b>springs,</b> while the bottom cylinder is brought up towards the top cylinder. While the bottom cylinder approaches the top, there comes a point when they will [...] "jump" [...] into contact with each other. The measurements, in this case, are based on the distance from which they jump and the spring constant. These measurements are usually between surfaces 1.25 nm and 20 nm apart.|$|R
50|$|Only {{six of the}} automobiles, {{called the}} V6, which confusingly used a V-twin ohv JAP engine of 728cc, were ever built. Drive to the rear wheels was via a four speed gearbox. The floor pan acted also as the chassis and the {{suspension}} was by transverse leaf spring at the front and <b>cantilevered</b> <b>springs</b> at the rear.

50|$|Conventional bridges are bridges {{that are}} done with {{extensive}} tooth reduction, obtain primary retention through retentively shaped preparation and secondary retention by luting cement. Unlike conventional bridges, Resin Retained Bridges require little to none tooth reduction {{which is much}} preferred due to the irreversible damage caused by drilling of teeth. The 3 designs of conventional bridges are fixed-fixed, <b>cantilever</b> (<b>spring</b> cantilever as a subclass), and fixed-movable. They are named depending {{on the way the}} pontic (false teeth) is attached to the retainer (indirect restoration on the abutment teeth/tooth).|$|E
50|$|This composite-construction {{aircraft}} features three lifting surfaces: A {{front wing}} with approximately half {{the span of}} the main wing and a classical cruciform empennage. Front and main wings are connected {{by a pair of}} struts with square cross-section which also serve as fuel tanks. Both wings carry Fowler flaps on part of their span for STOL. The fixed tail-wheel undercarriage has four low-pressure, small-diameter main-wheels, on two <b>cantilever</b> <b>spring</b> struts,with a spring mounted tail-wheel assembly. The four-seat cabin is completely enclosed with a combination of flat, squared and outward-bulged tear-drop shaped windows.|$|E
50|$|Two prototypes were built, {{the first}} flying ion 13 September 1973. This had a fully {{retracting}} tricycle undercarriage with mainwheels retracting rearwards into the tail booms and the nosewheel rearwards into the fuselage pod. The second prototype, which flew in 1976, retained the retractable nosewheel but had fixed, spatted mainwheels on thin, <b>cantilever,</b> <b>spring</b> steel legs {{mounted on the}} lower fuselage to save weight and reduce complexity. The extra drag reduced the glide angle from 31.4 to 30 and increased the minimum sink rate from 0.76 m/s to 0.85 m/s.|$|E
50|$|The chassis of the Phantom II was {{completely}} new. The front axle was mounted on semi-elliptical leaf springs as on earlier 40/50 hp models, but the rear axle was now also mounted on semi-elliptical <b>springs</b> instead of <b>cantilever</b> <b>springs.</b> This, {{along with the}} drivetrain changes, allowed the frame to be lower than before, improving the handling. The 4-wheel servo-assisted brakes from the Phantom I were continued, and the Bijur centralized lubrication system from the Springfield-built Phantom I was included on all Phantom II chassis.|$|R
50|$|The {{surface force}} {{apparatus}} (SFA) is a scientific instrument which measures the interaction force of two surfaces {{as they are}} brought together and retracted. One surface is held by a <b>cantilevered</b> <b>spring,</b> and the deflection of the spring {{is used to calculate}} the force being exerted. The technique was pioneered by D. Tabor, R.H.S. Winterton in the late 1960s at Cambridge University. By the mid-1970s, J.N. Israelachvili had adapted the original design to operate in liquids, notably aqueous solutions, while at the Australian National University.|$|R
50|$|The Eric-Campbell 10 (10/22 in 1924) was {{assembled}} from bought-in components with a Coventry-Simplex 1498 cc, four cylinder, {{side valve}} engine driving {{the rear wheels}} through a cone clutch and three speed Moss gearbox. The engine was tuned with a special camshaft and lightened pistons. Half elliptic leaf springs were fitted at the front whilst at the rear <b>cantilever</b> <b>springing</b> was used. A top speed of 55 mph was guaranteed and 60 mph claimed as possible. Two seat polished aluminium bodies were fitted with a simulacrum of a Rolls-Royce radiator.|$|R
50|$|The underwing cabin of the Sirius has {{a single}} piece windscreen, glazed side doors, rear side windows and an upper rear transparency. A choice of flat four engines offers either the 59.6 kW (80 hp) Rotax 912UL or the 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912 ULS. The Sirius is fitted with a fixed {{tricycle}} undercarriage with mainwheels fuselage mounted on composite <b>cantilever</b> <b>spring</b> legs. The nosewheel is steerable and the mainwheels have brakes; all wheels are almost completely enclosed in spats. The company has also developed a float installation for the TL-3000 to allow water operations.|$|E
50|$|The {{teardrop}} shaped pod {{is mounted}} below the wing and braced to it, {{with a single}} faired lift strut on each side from its lower part.

50|$|The Pretty Flight is a {{conventionally}} laid out, high-wing monoplane of all-metal construction, {{fitted with}} a single engine and seating two in side by side. The wing is braced with a single, faired lift strut on either side. Its skin is mostly metal apart from the rear part of the wings and the control surfaces. The wing tips are upturned and the fin swept. The wing carries full span flaperons, later replaced with conventional ailerons and flaps. It has a horn-balanced rudder. The cabin seats two in side-by-side configuration. Its tricycle landing gear has <b>cantilever</b> <b>spring</b> main legs and a cantilever nose leg, with wheels in fairings. The Pretty Flight has a ballistic recovery parachute.|$|E
50|$|The Akro has a 180 hp (134 kW) Avco Lycoming AIO-360-A1A {{air-cooled}} {{flat-four engine}} in the nose, driving a two blade metal fixed pitch propeller. Its fuel {{is stored in}} a fuselage tank between the single seat cockpit and the engine. The cockpit has a fixed screen and a rearward sliding bubble canopy. In addition, {{there is a large}} window in the forward cockpit floor. There is a fixed, conventional undercarriage, with the mainwheels under glass fibre fairings on <b>cantilever</b> <b>sprung</b> steel legs. Hydraulic disc brakes are fitted. The tailwheel is steerable.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} Viper {{is powered}} by a 60 kW (81 hp) Rotax 912UL flat four engine but the more powerful 75 kW (100 hp) Rotax 912ULS is an option. The forward fuselage is a monocoque, the rear a tube structure with an aluminium skin. The cockpit seats two in side-by-side configuration under a framed single piece canopy, with further transparencies in the fuselage immediately aft. The main undercarriage legs are <b>cantilever</b> <b>springs.</b> The mainwheels are faired and fitted with hydraulic brakes; the nosewheel is also faired and may, as an option, be steerable. Other options include instrumentation, ballistic parachute and towing gear.|$|R
50|$|This type of {{intrusion}} arch {{was developed}} by Shroff et al. in 1992. This arch also has 3 segments in one arch. The anterior segment has a vertical bend distal to the lateral incisors with a posterior extension to which the intrusion <b>cantilever</b> <b>springs</b> are engaged bilaterally. This type of intrusion was developed to achieve retraction and intrusion simultaneously in a treatment where upper first premolars are extraction. The retraction can be performed by using either an elastomeric chain or Niti Coil Spring which connects the distal extension of the anterior segment and the hook on the posterior molar tube.|$|R
50|$|A {{child with}} {{posterior}} crossbite {{should be treated}} immediately if the child shifts his mandible on closing which is often seen in a unilateral crossbite as mentioned above. The best age to treat a child with crossbite is in their mixed dentition when their palatal sutures have not fused to each other. Palatal expansion allows more space in an arch to relieve crowding and correct posterior crossbite. The correction can include any type of palatal expanders that will expand the palate which resolves the narrow constriction of the maxilla. There are several therapies {{that can be used}} to correct a posterior crossbite: braces, 'Z' spring or <b>cantilever</b> <b>spring,</b> quad helix, removable plates, clear aligner therapy, or a Delaire mask. The correct therapy should be decided by the orthodontist depending on the type and severity of the crossbite.|$|E
5000|$|With some {{automatic}} transmissions, it {{was possible}} to place the shift selector at any point, either in an intended gear or between a gear. Because of the possible safety issue of this, and because driving a vehicle not fully in a gear {{over a long period of}} time could damage the transmission, automakers developed what is called the [...] "detent system." [...] The system of detents was often used in conjunction with the [...] "push button" [...] shifters used on many automatics in the 1950s. Typical detent systems use either a detent spring and ball or a <b>cantilever</b> <b>spring</b> and this spring moves up and down over a series of teethed gears (called a [...] "rooster comb" [...] for how it looks, or an [...] "inner manuel lever") turning the rooster comb to fine center the transmission in the intended gear position at the bottom of each gear.|$|E
50|$|Current Fascinations are {{all-composite}} aircraft, with a {{low wing}} of trapezoidal planform. The ailerons have external balance trim tabs and sealed nosegaps. Inboard, there are electrically operated Fowler flaps. The fuselage becomes slender towards the tail, where the trapezoidal tailplane is set at mid-height, the elevators having a small cutout for rudder movement. The fin is swept but the rudder has vertical edges; it extends {{to the bottom of}} the fuselage. The cockpit seats two in side-by-side configuration under a one-piece bubble canopy, lever hinged from the rear; behind the seat backs there is luggage space. Until 2008, all Fascinations had a retractable tricycle undercarriage. The main wheels, mounted from the fuselage on <b>cantilever</b> <b>spring</b> legs, retract electrically outward into the wing and the nosewheel retracts rearwards. The fixed wheel option has wheel fairings. The main wheels have brakes and the nosewheel power steering. A Stratos Magnum 501 ballistic recovery parachute is fitted.|$|E
50|$|Although the sturdily {{constructed}} chassis {{was based}} on that from earlier Sunbeams, the hitherto characteristic semi-elliptical leaf springs were, at the back, replaced by <b>cantilever</b> rear <b>springs</b> which {{during the second half}} of the decade became a Sunbeam hallmark.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for {{controlling}} the growth orientation of individual carbon nanotube (CNT) microstructures on a silicon wafer substrate. Our method controls the CNT forest orientation by patterning the catalyst layer {{used in the}} CNTs growth on slanted KOH edges. The overlap of catalyst area on the horizontal bottom and sloped sidewall surfaces of the KOH-etched substrate enables precise variation of the growth direction. These inclined structures can profit from the outstanding mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties of CNTs and can therefore improve the performance of several MEMS devices. Inclined CNT microstructures could for instance be used as <b>cantilever</b> <b>springs</b> in probe card arrays, as tips in dip-pen lithography, and as sensing element in advanced transducers. status: publishe...|$|R
