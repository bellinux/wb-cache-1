Methods. The polymorphisms were genotyped in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 100 [*]KC and 100 [*]FECD patients as well as 150 controls with PCR-RFLP. Results. The G/T genotype of the c. - 61 G>T polymorphism was associated with significantly increased frequency occurrence of KC (<b>crude</b> <b>OR</b> 2. 99, 95 % CI 1. 75 – 5. 13).

40|$|Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) {{regulate}} the activation of Natural Killer cells through their interaction with human leukocyte antigens (HLA). KIR and HLA loci are highly polymorphic and certain HLA-KIR combinations {{have been found}} to protect against viral infections. In this study we analyzed whether the KIR/HLA repertoire may influence the course of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Fifty-seven subjects with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 44 subjects with resolved HBV infection, and 60 healthy uninfected controls (HC) were genotyped for KIR and their HLA ligands. The frequency of the HLA-A-Bw 4 ligand group was higher in CHB (58 %) than subjects with resolved infection (23 %) (<b>crude</b> <b>OR,</b> 4. 67; P< 0. 001), and HC (10 %) (<b>crude</b> <b>OR,</b> 12. 38; P< 0. 001). Similar results were obtained for the HLA-C 2 ligand group, more frequent in CHB (84 %), than subjects with resolved infection (70 %) (<b>crude</b> <b>OR,</b> 2. 24; P< 0. 10), and HC (60 %) (<b>crude</b> <b>OR,</b> 3. 56; P< 0. 01). Conversely, the frequency of KIR 2 DL 3 was lower in CHB (81 %) than in subjects with resolved infection (98 %) (<b>crude</b> <b>OR,</b> 0. 10; P< 0. 05). These results suggest a detrimental role of HLA-A-Bw 4 and HLA-C 2 groups, which are associated with the development of CHB, and a protective role of KIR 2 DL 3. A stepwise variable selection procedure, based on multiple logistic regression analysis, identified these three predictive variables as the most relevant, featuring high specificity (90. 9 %), and positive predictive value (87. 5 %) for the development of CHB. Our results suggest that a combination of KIR/HLA gene/alleles is able to predict the outcome of HBV infectio...|$|R

Shortly there after, the south and north residences were added inside the curtain wall. The original castle entrance was to the southeast.
