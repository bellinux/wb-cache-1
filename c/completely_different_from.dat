My interpretation could end up being <b>completely</b> <b>different,</b> <b>from</b> both David and the audience. But I did have to reconcile all of that, and people seem to think it works.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} caterpillars and pupae used for classification are <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of adults; different classification schemes are sometimes provided separately for classifying adults, larvae and pupae. The characteristics of immature stages are increasingly used for taxonomic purposes as they provide insights into systematics and phylogenies of Lepidoptera {{that are not}} apparent from examination of adults.|$|E
5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and creative director Neil Druckmann {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, simultaneously performing the motion capture work for their characters. Various characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the initial vision. The relationship of the characters received praise from several gaming publications, and the acting has resulted in multiple awards, including two BAFTAs and a DICE Award.|$|E

5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|Cross-fertilization between {{board games}} {{and video games}} continued. For example, some aspects of Master of Orion III were drawn from {{the first edition of}} the board game Twilight Imperium. Even Sins of a Solar Empire was {{inspired}} by the idea of adapting the board game Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century into a real-time video game. Going in the opposite direction, Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of Sid Meier's Civilization in 2002, <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the board game that had inspired the computer game in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we cannot speak about God, and {{proposed}} that this view {{is no different from}} the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|The last fort to be {{built in}} Malta was Fort Campbell, which was built near Mellieħa between late 1937 and 1938. The design of the fort is <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the earlier fortifications in Malta as it was {{designed}} to counter the new threat of aerial bombardment. It had an irregular plan and its perimeter was guarded by machine gun posts and a few rifle loopholes. The buildings inside were scattered so as not to create a concentration of buildings. The fort still exists, although it is largely in ruins.|$|E
5|$|The {{locations}} in the film are separated visually from the shots of Madonna, who is singing in a darkened studio. Unlike her previous videos, Madonna portrays a narrator, whose song comments on the story, appearing in shots <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the narrative action. She appears {{to speak for the}} character, addressing his problems directly, like the chorus of a classical tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Ericsson's revolutionary turret, {{although}} not without flaws, {{was a unique}} concept in gun mounting that was soon adapted and used on naval ships around the world. His Monitor design employed over forty patented inventions and was <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> any other naval warship at the time. Because Monitor was an experimental craft, urgently needed, hurriedly constructed and almost immediately put to sea, {{a number of problems}} were discovered during her maiden voyage to Hampton Roads and during the battle there. Yet Monitor was still able to challenge Virginia and prevent her from further destroying the remaining ships in the Union flotilla blockading Hampton Roads.|$|E

5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had met that {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible. In {{a letter to his}} superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied {{a large part of the}} ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.|$|E
5|$|Though Ellie was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} Joel's daughter, the team found this to be too limiting in terms of further character development. The team chose Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson to portray Joel and Ellie, respectively. Providing both the voice and motion capture of the characters, Baker and Johnson assisted the team to develop the characters and help refine the story. The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the central focus of the game, and all other elements were developed around it. Various other characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the initial vision.|$|E
5|$|Ibrox Park, as it {{was known}} between 1899 and 1997, is almost <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Ibrox Stadium of today. It {{followed}} the model of most Scottish stadiums of the time, comprising an oval track around the pitch, with a pavilion and one stand along one side. The ground had a capacity of 40,000. Celtic Park, Ibrox and Hampden Park all competed {{with each other to}} host Scottish Cup Finals and Scotland matches, one of which could generate up to £1,000 in revenue for the host club. To aid their chances of gaining that revenue, Rangers constructed a large terracing, holding 36,000 people, behind the western goalmouth. The terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch, was formed by wooden planks bolted onto a framework made of iron. A similar wooden terracing was constructed at the eastern end, giving a total capacity of 75,000.|$|E

5|$|Other {{scholars}} such as Hazra and Rocher {{state that}} the Puranas are not a reliable source for dating Krishna or Indian history, because the content therein about kings, various peoples, sages, and kingdoms is highly inconsistent across the manuscripts. They state that these stories are probably {{based in part on}} real events, in part on hagiography, and in part embellished by expansive imagination. A high degree of inconsistency and manuscript corruption occurred particularly from the 12thcentury onwards, evidenced by cross referencing the texts; Matsya Purana, for example, stated that Kurma Purana has 18,000 verses, while Agni Purana asserts the same text has 8,000 verses, and Naradiya attests that the Kurma manuscript has 17,000 verses. The Puranic literature has gone through slow redaction and text corruption over time, as well as sudden deletion of numerous chapters and its replacement with new content to an extent that the currently circulating Puranas are <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those that existed before the 11thcentury, or 16thcentury. For example, a newly discovered palm-leaf manuscript in Nepal has been dated to be from 810CE, but is quite different from versions of the same Purana text that have been circulating in South Asia since the colonial era.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus are <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those in the lower atmosphere. At altitudes 90–150km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere. The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90–120km. The temperature of this layer—230K (−43°C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere—100K (−173°C). The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1Δg), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27μm. This radiation from the altitude range 90–100km is often observed {{from the ground and}} spacecraft. The nightside upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus is also the source of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible for the low temperature of the nightside thermosphere.|$|E
