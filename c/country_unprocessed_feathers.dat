5000|$|High tariffs {{are imposed}} on {{agriculture}}: in high-income countries, the average tariff rate on agriculture is {{almost double the}} tariff for manufactures. And more than {{one third of the}} European Union's agricultural tariff lines, for instance, carry duties above 15% http://www.WorldTradeOrganization.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/special_study_6_e.pdf. Tariff peaks within agriculture occur most frequently on processed products and temperate commodities, rather than the major export crops of least developed <b>countries</b> (<b>unprocessed</b> fruits and vegetables and tropical commodities). However, many developing countries in temperate zones have the potential of competing as lower-cost producers in temperate commodities. Thus liberalization could open up new development-through-trade possibilities.|$|R
40|$|Feather meal protein {{contains}} {{high level}} of keratin, which consists of 14 % disulphide cystine, therefore feather meal protein is difficult to be digested by proteolytic enzymes. Feather meal must be processed before {{being used in the}} ration, because the digestibility of <b>unprocessed</b> <b>feather</b> meal is very low (5. 8 %). There are four processing methods of feather meal, i. e. physical, chemical, enzymatic and microbiological. The aim of these processings is to alleviate or break down the bonds in the keratin such as disulphide, ionic, ester and hydrogen bonds. Processed feather meal is known as hydrolyzed feather meal (HFM). Although the processing methods of feather meal produce different quality of HFM, the utilization of HFM in ruminant ration results in a better response than conventional protein resources. HFM has higher level of crude protein content (74 – 92 %), rumen undegradable protein (70 %) and post rumiral digestibility (57 – 78 %) than soybean meal has. The utilization of HFM in ration up to 8 % of dry matter can substitute soybean meal and the use of 2 – 3 % HFM improved milk production in dairy cow and daily gain in sheep and cattle...|$|R
40|$|The chicken {{feathers}} (CFs)  consist {{of up to}} 10 % {{of total}} chicken dry mass and they have many potential industrial applications. CFs contains protein fibers named as keratin, which is an insoluble protein. Primary sanitization phases are complex {{because of the presence}} of lots of blood born microbes, pathogens and parasites in raw biomass. The extraction process of keratins from the <b>unprocessed</b> <b>feathers</b> is also a challenging task. Prior to the extraction cleaning/sanitization of feathers is a very necessary step. Thus, the present work was conducted to optimize  an efficient surfactant  for the cleaning process of the  CFs by using ionic and non-ionic surfactants. The experiment was conducted by the washing of feathers with double distilled water (ddH 2 O), detergents, ether and lastly with boiling water. The washed feathers treated with surfactants and the effect of each surfactant was analyzed by a microbiological test which tells about the extent of  the presence of different bacteria on the treated feathers. SEM, EDX, FTIR were used to study the morphology and composition of  untreated and treated CFs. SEM showed there was no detectable fiber damage after treatment. Cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) (t 3) was one of the best surfactant for the treatment of CFs among all the surfactant used. The present study described the best treatment method  for the CFs...|$|R
25|$|Pellagra is {{most common}} to populations within {{developing}} {{countries in which}} corn is the dietary staple. The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries, yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa. This is {{in part due to}} the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains, which is not readily absorbed into the human body. The processes involved in making corn tortillas, can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form. Pellegra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way, but is a problem in other <b>countries</b> where <b>unprocessed</b> corn is main source of caloric intake.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Every year billion {{kilograms}} of unused feathers {{result from the}} poultry industry worldwide, which in effect impose a difficult disposal process to the environment. Chicken feathers are considered as a valuable and renewable keratin protein source, {{which could be used}} advantageously in a number of applications as alternatives to feather meal and feather disposal. Although the potential applications of keratin derived from chicken feathers have been investigated, the initial purification phase has not been fully described in the literature. Original chicken feathers contain many biological organisms along with other contaminants after plucking. <b>Unprocessed</b> chicken <b>feathers</b> are considered as potentially hazardous biological materials due to the presence of blood borne pathogens; therefore, the decontamination process is very important. The purpose of this work is to compare the effects of different purification techniques on chicken feathers prior to keratin isolation. These processes include surfactant washing, soxhlet extraction with ethanol, ozone, and sodium chlorite solutions. Thermogravimetric analysis, vibrational spectroscopy, and wide angle X-ray scattering were used to characterise the purified feathers prior to keratin extraction...|$|R
40|$|Chicken {{feathers}} are an abundant, inconvenient and troublesome {{waste product}} from the poultry industry {{that can be}} utilised {{as a source of}} keratin. The keratin exists in α-helix conformation in feather wool, and as pleated sheet in barbs and rachis. In addition to keratin, feathers contain other fatty and waxy substances. Whilst investigations have been conducted exploring potential use of keratin derived from chicken feathers, the initial purification phase is important for isolating the keratin from other materials. An original chicken feather contains many biological organisms together with other dirt from when they were plucked from chickens. <b>Unprocessed</b> chicken <b>feathers</b> are potentially biologically hazardous, due to the presence of blood borne pathogens, so it is imperative that they are decontaminated upon receipt. The aim of this work is conduct a comparative study of different purification methods to decontaminate chicken feathers prior to keratin isolation. These methods were: washing the original chicken feathers using an anionic surfactant, sodium lauryl sulphate and a non-ionic surfactant, a poly(ethylene glycol). Soxhlett extraction with ethanol was performed, together with bleaching using ozone and sodium chlorite solutions. Visual observation, infrared spectroscopy, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterise the feathers and residues after extraction...|$|R
40|$|Keratin {{derived from}} chicken {{feathers}} is an inconvenient waste {{product of the}} poultry-farming industry, and therefore it is presently {{the subject of much}} investigation. Feathers contain some fatty and waxy substances, other than keratin that exists in an α-helix conformation in feather barbs and barbules, and as ß-sheet in calamus and rachis. Although investigations have been conducted exploring potential use of keratin derived from chicken feathers, the initial purification phase is important for isolating the keratin from other materials. An original chicken feather contains many biological organisms together with other extraneous material from the time it was plucked from a chicken. <b>Unprocessed</b> chicken <b>feathers</b> are potentially biologically hazardous, caused by the presence of blood borne pathogens, thus it is important that they are decontaminated upon receipt. The aim of this study is conduct a comparative analysis of different purification techniques to decontaminate chicken feathers prior to keratin isolation. These processes include surfactant washing using an ionic and a non-ionic surfactant, soxhlet extraction with ethanol, ozone and sodium chlorite solution bleaching. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, optical microscopy, pH and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterise the feathers and residues after purification and extraction. FTIR analysis confirmed that there are no significant changes in the chemical structure of fibers after each wash treatment.

5000|$|Certain <b>countries</b> {{trade in}} <b>unprocessed</b> [...] Some {{have complained that}} the {{ultimate}} fate of recyclates sold to another country is unknown and they may end up in landfills instead of reprocessed. According to one report, in America, 50-80 percent of computers destined for recycling are actually not recycled. There are reports of illegal-waste imports to China being dismantled and recycled solely for monetary gain, without consideration for workers' health or environmental damage. Although the Chinese government has banned these practices, {{it has not been}} able to eradicate them. In 2008, the prices of recyclable waste plummeted before rebounding in 2009. Cardboard averaged about £53/tonne from 2004-2008, dropped to £19/tonne, and then went up to £59/tonne in May 2009. PET plastic averaged about £156/tonne, dropped to £75/tonne and then moved up to £195/tonne in May 2009.|$|R
40|$|Poor {{countries}} are {{and will remain}} for some time vulnerable to external shocks, whether to export prices or from natural disasters. The lowest-income countries have {{a higher incidence of}} shocks than other developing countries and tend to suffer larger damages when shocks occur. For the poorest countries, the average number of disasters between 1997 and 2001 has been one every 2. 5 years. Commodity price shocks are also more severe for poor countries. Low-income countries experience this type of shock on average every 3. 3 years. About 26 highly-indebted countries have an export concentration of more than 50 per cent in three or fewer commodities, while 62 per cent of the total exports of the least developed <b>countries</b> are <b>unprocessed</b> primary commodities. Exogenous shocks on commodity prices have significant direct adverse effects on growth and the multiplier effects of negative terms of trade shocks can also be large. Collier and Sewn (2001) show, for a sample of cases where the direct income loss averaged 6. 8 per cent of GDP, the total correlated loss of income amounted to about twice that much, to 14 per cent of GDP. Research shows that these negative shocks increase the incidence of poverty. The shocks also {{have a significant impact on}} fiscal and external balances. An IMF study shows that terms-of-trade shocks and adverse weather conditions have played an important role in exacerbating debt problems 3. ...|$|R
30|$|Heightening {{interest}} in safer and healthy food products are prompting governments, health practitioners, and consumers particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa to more carefully select nutritious and healthy indigenous food {{resources such as}} “tiger nuts” for processing and consumption which currently are consumed raw and unwholesome (Mordi et al. 2006). Improved consumption of processed tiger nut (Cyperus esculentus) will not only provide remedies to major nutritional and health problems of society but could {{also serve as a}} potential source of improve incomes to farmers and other value chain actors such as processors and marketers. Health problems will be solved because a study by Adebajo (1993) has reported the existence of aflatoxins at toxicologically unsafe levels on tiger nuts sold on streets while Bankole and Adebanjo (2003) also observed the presence of mycotoxins on the nuts. In fact, majority, representing 70 % of tiger nuts produced in the <b>country</b> are consumed <b>unprocessed</b> with a lot of contaminations such as stones, animal droppings and some food-borne diseases such as aflatoxins and mycotoxins (Adebajo 1993; Bankole and Adebanjo 2003; Mordi et al. 2006). A number of factors, such as direct contact of nuts with the soil, unhygienic handling, and the use of contaminated water for irrigation, could have accounted for the contamination observed. Meanwhile, the small amount that are processed into porridges (locally known as “atadwe” milk) are carried out under rudimentary technologies without adherence to strict food safety compliances (Tetteh and Ofori 1998).|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Two-thirds of all {{households}} in developing <b>countries</b> depend on <b>unprocessed</b> biomass fuel for cooking. Traditional stoves have poor combustion capacity which produce heavy smoke and numerous harmful pollutants. Switching to Improved Cooking Stove (ICS), a well-designed earthen made stove {{equipped with a}} chimney could be beneficial for health. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the efficacy of ICS on maternal health in rural areas of Bangladesh. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was adopted to conduct the study. This study selected 150 Households from 5 villages (intervention) and 150 Households from 2 villages (control) from the Manikgonj District of Bangladesh during January 1, 2012 to July 30, 2012. Differences between control and intervention group were examined by applying t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The conventional cut-off value of 0. 05 was taken as statistical significance. Stata (version 13) was used to do the analysis. Results: Most of the respondents (62 %) were less than 30 years of age. About 94 % participants resided in tin-shaded houses, and 51 % kitchens were small. After the intervention period, the measured mean concentrations of Particulate Matter (PM 2. 5) for the intervention and control group was 259 µg/m 3 and 1285 µg/m 3, respectively (p 0. 05). Conclusion: ICS reduced the incidence of respiratory illness among the intervention group, however, did not demonstrate significant changes in LFT during the six months of the follow-up period. Therefore, this study found ICS might have the potential to be used to improve the maternal health in rural Bangladesh. However, more longitudinal investigations are expected to demonstrate the efficacy and impact of ICS on maternal health to support the statemen...|$|R
