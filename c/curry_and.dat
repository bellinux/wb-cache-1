Curry sent the matter to the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington, D.C., where Secretary James Guthrie declared the move invalid unless acted on by the United States Congress. Thereafter, <b>Curry</b> <b>and</b> Oregon Secretary of State Benjamin Harding moved back to Salem.|$|E

5|$|British {{documents}} {{show that the}} British government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused {{about whether or not}} to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. <b>Curry</b> <b>and</b> others in British government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{of the set}} {{began on}} December 5, 1994, on Paramount Stage 16. The set's {{construction}} pushed the episode's cost over its budget. This was considered normal for a new series and the next four episodes also exceeded their budgets. Despite {{the high cost of}} the manor set, the crew designed it for repeated use {{over the course of the}} series. This was more appealing than shooting several sequences of a covered wagon on location in the countryside. Curry took special care to merge the blue-screen effects with Kolbe's footage seamlessly to achieve the effect of the manor transforming back into the holodeck. <b>Curry</b> <b>and</b> Kolbe had worked together on previous projects that required similar special effects.|$|E

5|$|Scar {{was created}} in 1989 and was created by screenwriters Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton, and {{animated}} by Andreas Deja. The Pride Lands' reclusive heir presumptive, Scar is introduced in the first film as the uncle of Simba and younger brother of Mufasa. Originally first-in-line to Mufasa's throne until he is suddenly replaced by nephew Simba, Scar decides to lead an army of hyenas in his plot to take the throne by killing Mufasa and exiling Simba, ultimately blaming his brother's death on his nephew. Loosely based on King Claudius, the main antagonist of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Scar's villainy was additionally inspired by Adolf Hitler. As the character's supervising animator, Deja based Scar's appearance on that of Irons himself, {{as well as the}} actor's Academy Award-winning performance as Claus von Bülow in Reversal of Fortune (1990). Before Irons was cast, the directors had considered offering the role to actors Tim <b>Curry</b> <b>and</b> Malcolm McDowell.|$|E
