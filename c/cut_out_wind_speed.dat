40|$|AbstractCyclone Xaver (5 December 2013; North Sea) was {{an extreme}} weather event which {{affected}} northern Europe, yielding a record of wind power generation. The most striking aspects of this atmospheric phenomenon were the gale-force winds and the upcoming abrupt increase of the wind power over the North Sea. The main objective {{of the study is}} the analysis of the impact of Xaver on offshore wind power production. In this way, the WRF numerical model was used to simulate the cyclone in a fine horizontal resolution (5 km x 5 km). The focus of the simulation is on the extended region of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The evaluation of the model outputs against observational data from 3 offshore locations denotes a sufficient agreement (SI≈ 0. 12) and supports a realistic analysis of the wind field. The simulation exposed much higher values for wind speed over the North Sea compared to the neighboring regions during the passage of the cyclone. The wind speed at the 100 m level ranged within 11 - 25 m/s (rated output wind speed) for 40 hours over the North Sea and 70 hours over the Baltic Sea. On the other hand, the wind speed at 100 m exceeded 25 m/s (<b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed)</b> for ca 30 hours over the North Sea. In addition, comparison of wind power density between two different height levels (100 m and 200 m) is presented. The model results indicate 15 % to 20 % higher wind power density at 200 m than for 100 m for the largest part of the North Sea. For some regions the difference exceeds 25 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{intermittent}} {{nature of}} wind energy generation {{has introduced a}} new degree of uncertainty to the tactical planning of energy systems. Short-term energy balancing decisions are no longer (fully) known, {{and it is this}} lack of knowledge that causes the need for strategic thinking. But despite this observation, strategic models are rarely set in an uncertain environment. And even if they are, the approach used is often inappropriate, based on some variant of scenario analysis—what-if analysis. In this paper we develop a deterministic strategic model for the valuation of electricity storage (a battery), and ask: “Though leaving <b>out</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> uncertainty clearly is a simplification, does it really matter for the valuation of storage?”. We answer this question by formulating a stochastic programming model, and compare its valuation to that of its deterministic counterpart. Both models capture the arbitrage value of storage, but only the stochastic model captures the battery value stemming from <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> uncertainty. Is the difference important? The model is tested on a case from Lancaster University’s campus energy system where a wind turbine is installed. From our analysis, we conclude that considering <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> uncertainty can increase the estimated value of storage with up to 50 % relative to a deterministic estimate. However, we also observe cases where <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> uncertainty is insignificant for storage valuation...|$|R

It {{is a particular}} problem for wind turbine measurements because these cannot be carried <b>out</b> when the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> is low. <b>Wind</b> shields can be used, but often the sound level from the turbine is low {{and even the most}} efficient shields may not provide sufficient attenuation of the microphone wind noise. This study starts by quantifying the effect that microphone wind noise has on the accuracy of two commonly used Amplitude Modulation (AM) metrics. A wind noise simulator and synthesised wind turbine sounds based on real measurements are used. The simulations show that even relatively low <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> of 2. 5 m/s errors of over 4 dBA can result. Microphone wind noise is intermittent, and consequently one solution is to analyse only uncorrupted parts of the recordings. This paper tests whether a single-ended wind noise detection algorithm can automatically find uncorrupted sections of the recording, and so recover the true AM metrics. Tests showed that doing this can reduce the error to ± 2 dBA and ± 0. 5 dBA for the time and modulation-frequency domain AM metrics respectively. The paper goes on to validate the simulation approach by applying the automatic detection to near field recordings from various adjacent microphones in combination with high quality meteorological mast measurements within 40 m of the microphones and wind turbines...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{includes a}} survey whether the wind set-up formula is valid and accurate {{in case of}} irregularly shaped lakes with a strong varying water depth. The formula is designed for a pure theoretical situation, {{the question is whether}} the formula is valid in situations that differ a lot from the theoretical one. The research is carried <b>out</b> with data (<b>wind</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>wind</b> direction and water depth), from the Grevelingenmeer (Netherlands, province Zeeland). First several assumptions are made with respect to the relevant <b>wind</b> directions and <b>speeds</b> for the different measure stations. Wind set-up won’t be generated when the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> is very low. The relevant <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> are the mean values per hour above 13 meter per second. The relevancy of the wind directions does depend on the location of the measure station. The mean values of all the data are calculated in order to correct for the setting time of the lake, to arrive at a more or less stationary situation. The fetch is defined as the length of the lake parallel to the wind direction. It is not easy to model the water depth, shallow water does give a higher value for wind set-up in comparison to deep water. However, the water depth of the Grevelingenmeer is strongly varying, so an assumption had to be made. The mean value of the water depth is assumed, in order to balance the varying base of the lake. It is a rough assumption, but possible errors in this approximation are compensated by the friction coefficient kappa. The conclusion of the main research is that the wind set-up formula is valid and relatively accurate. The order of magnitude of the wind set-up is 10 centimeter, the standard deviation is in the order of 1 centimeter. The dispersion of the wind set-up is independent of the <b>wind</b> <b>speed.</b> Using the original wind set-up formula gives the mean value of the wind set-up. In order to compute the design value of the wind set-up, depending on the allowed probability of exceedance, there has to be added an additional value of wind set-up. So, the dispersion is not caused by a scatter of kappa. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} meet the minimum {{recommended}} capacity factor (25 %) for electricity generation, the following design parameters are suggested: wind turbine model with a minimum hub height of 55 m, cut-in <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of less than 3.5 m/s, rated <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of around 12 m/s and cut-out <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of 25 m/s are recommended for Enugu; for Owerri, wind turbine with a minimum height of 75 m, cut-in <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of less than 3.5 m/s, rated <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of around 8.5 m/s and cut-out <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of 20 m/s are recommended; while a system with a minimum hub height of 65 m, cut-in <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of less than 3.5 m/s, rated <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of around 9 m/s and cut-out <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of 20 m/s are recommended for Onitsha.|$|R
30|$|When the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> {{is between}} the rated <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and the cut <b>wind</b> <b>speed,</b> i.e. v ∊ (Vr, Vout), the wind power is holding at the maximum value. Therefore, the {{probability}} value of wind power is the cumulative probability of <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> v ∊ (Vr, Vout).|$|R
