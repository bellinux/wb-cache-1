Various HMA mixes were included in the DT test program and the results were compared with those of the Overlay Tester, also conducted at ambient temperature. Up to 23 commonly used Texas HMA mixes with different mix design characteristics were evaluated and are discussed in this paper.

While recent studies on laser welding of Al 5 xxx series and Al 6 xxx series alloys have examined weldability, the laser autogenous welding usually results in low gap bridging capability and weld defects such as porosity, underfill, cracking, and so on. In this study, we evaluated the gap bridging capability and the crack sensitivity during laser autogenous welding, laser welding with filler wire, and laser-arc hybrid welding, respectively. Al 5 J 32 and 6 K 21 sheets were used as the base metal and Al 4 xxx series and Al 5 xxx series wires were used as the filler metal.

40|$|AbstractFor {{a cracked}} plane {{specimen}} submitted to mixed load, experimental {{studies have shown}} that a transition from Tensile type fracture to Shear type fracture exists. This transition is controlled by the critical value of the mixity parameter, which can be expressed in term of a ratio of the stress intensity factors. The crack will propagate by Tensile type fracture following the direction of the maximum circumferential stresses, and by Shear type fracture along slip bands. Discrete element simulation has been employed within a simulation box in order to investigate the local aspect of the crack initiation. The boundary conditions of the simulation box containing the crack tip were chosen as the displacement field close to the crack tip in a Brazilian <b>crack</b> <b>test.</b> Referring to this approach, a local fracture criterion is carried out.

40|$|Abstract: RC beams shear {{strengthened}} with FRP fully {{wrapped around}} the member usually fail due to rupture of FRP, commonly preceded by gradual debonding of the FRP from the beam sides. To {{gain a better understanding}} of the shear resistance mechanism of such beams, particularly the interaction between the FRP, concrete and internal steel stirrups, nine beams were tested in the present study: three as control specimens, three with bonded FRP full wraps, and three with FRP full wraps left unbonded to the beam sides. The use of unbonded wraps was aimed at a reliable estimation of the FRP contribution to shear resistance of the beam and how bonding affects this contribution. The test results show that the bonded and unbonded FRP wraps have nearly the same shear strength contribution, and that their strain distributions along the critical shear crack are both close to parabolic at the ultimate state. FRP rupture of the strengthened beams occurred at a value of maximum FRP strain considerably lower than the rupture strain found from tensile tests of flat coupons, which may be attributed to the effects of the dynamic debonding process and deformation of the FRP wraps due to the relative movements between the two sides of the critical shear <b>crack.</b> <b>Test</b> results also suggest that while the internal steel stirrups are fully utilized at bea...|$|E

40|$|The mixed mode loading {{configuration}} {{occurs in}} many civil engineering and mechanical applications. In wood material, {{the study of}} this problem is very important due to the orthotropic character and the heterogeneity of the material. In order to study the mixed mode loading in wood material, Moutou Pitti et al [1] have proposed a new specimen called Mixed Mode Crack Growth (MMCG). The main goal of this geometry is to propose a decrease of the energy release rate during the crack growth process.

Values of elastic-plastic fracture toughness, here {{characterized by the}} crack tip opening displacement (CTOD), are presented for square (cross-section) three-point bend specimens with a/W ratios of 0. 15 and 0. 50 throughout the lower-shelf and lower-transition regions. Three-dimensional, finite-element analy-ses are employed to correlate the measured load and crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) values to the corresponding CTOD values, thus eliminating {{a major source of}} experimental difficulty in previous studies of shallow crack specimens. In the lower-tran-sition region, where extensive plasticity (but no ductile crack growth) precedes brittle frac-ture, critical CTOD values for short crack specimens are significantly larger (factor of 2 - 3) than the CTOD values for deep crack specimens at identical temperatures. Short crack specimens are shown to exhibit increased toughness at the initiation of ductile tear-ing and decreased brittle-to-ductile transition temperatures. Numerical analyses for the two a/W ratios reveal large differences in stress fields ahead of the crack tip at identical CTOD levels which verify the experimentally observed differences in critical CTOD val-ues.

40|$|AbstractAdditive {{manufacturing}} or 3 D printing have strongly {{been developed}} {{the last years}} and currently propose several solutions. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a layer additive manufacturing process that uses a thermoplastic filament by fused deposition which builds its geometry along trajectories generated by slicing. This process leads to a locally heterogeneous structure because of the weld lines between the deposed threads. These trajectories (and then the weld lines) are predefined and not necessarily based on the specific mechanical constraints from product’s use. As a consequence, the weld lines can be found oriented in bad directions that reduce the mechanical strength of the printed sample. In this work we used finite elements simulation to identify the principal directions of the stress in a standard <b>Crack</b> <b>Test</b> C-T sample. The aim is to reproduce the principal stress directions inside the internal structure of cracking sample realized in extrusion deposition by 3 D printing {{in order to improve}} the fracture toughness. Several samples made from Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene were printed and tested. We analyze the outcomes by comparing a C-T standard tensile test procedure with classical and optimized filament depositions. The tests show improved mechanical characteristics and thus provide a method to deposit a filament along a trajectory adapted to the mechanical stresses. Crack branching is observed through a heterogeneous structure and then discussed. On the basis of these results, the cracked specimen will define a new strategy to reinforce the specimen by a specific fused deposit lines...|$|E
