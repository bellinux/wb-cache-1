The plot revolves around an amnesiac outlaw (Craig), a wealthy <b>cattleman</b> (Ford), and a mysterious traveler (Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople abducted by aliens. The screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, based on a screen story by the latter two along with Steve Oedekerk. The film was produced by Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Kurtzman, Orci and Rosenberg, with Steven Spielberg and Favreau serving as executive producers.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 1840s into the 1870s, Texas stockmen drove their beef cattle through {{southern}} Arizona on the Texas–California trail. Texans {{were impressed with}} the grazing possibilities offered by the Gadsden Purchase country of Arizona. In {{the last third of}} the century, they moved their herds into Arizona and established the range cattle industry there. The Texans contributed their proven range methods to the new grass country of Arizona, but also brought their problems as well. Texas rustlers brought lawlessness, poor management resulted in overstocking, and carelessness introduced destructive diseases. But these difficulties did force laws and associations in Arizona to curb and resolve them. The Anglo-American <b>cattleman</b> frontier in Arizona was an extension of the Texas experience.|$|E
5|$|Though the Teton Range {{was never}} {{permanently}} inhabited, pioneers began settling the Jackson Hole valley {{to the east}} of the range in 1884. These earliest homesteaders were mostly single men who endured long winters, short growing seasons and rocky soils that were hard to cultivate. The region was mostly suited for the cultivation of hay and cattle ranching. By 1890, Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60. Menor's Ferry was built in 1892 near present-day Moose, Wyoming to provide access for wagons to {{the west side of the}} Snake River. Ranching increased significantly from 1900 to 1920, but a series of agricultural related economic downturns in the early 1920s left many ranchers destitute. Beginning in the 1920s, the automobile provided faster and easier access to areas of natural beauty and old military roads into Jackson Hole over Teton and Togwotee Passes were improved to accommodate the increased vehicle traffic. In response to the increased tourism, dude ranches were established, some new and some from existing cattle ranches, so urbanized travelers could experience the life of a <b>cattleman.</b>|$|E

The acreage west of the 96th Meridian was known as the Cherokee Outlet, or Cherokee Strip. When <b>cattlemen</b> began leasing grazing land on the Outlet, the Cherokees levied taxes on the <b>cattlemen.</b> Some of the <b>cattlemen</b> ignored the levies, and began building fences made of Outlet timber. In 1883, the Interior Department forced removal of the fences. The <b>cattlemen</b> formed the Cherokee Strip Livestock Association to work with the tribes.|$|R

5000|$|For decades {{prior to}} 1909, sheepmen and <b>cattlemen</b> had been {{fighting}} for control of America's vast unsettled grasslands. The conflicts usually began as disputes over grazing rights, but the <b>cattlemen</b> also complained that the sheepmen destroyed the open range and made it unsuitable for cattle. For example, <b>cattlemen</b> claimed that sheepmen let their flocks overgraze, or that the sharp hooves of the sheep were cutting up the grass {{to a point where}} it wouldn't grow back. Sheepmen were also said to have polluted the water sources so badly that cattle could not drink from them without becoming sick. Generally, the <b>cattlemen</b> were the stronger of the two factions and they controlled the range by establishing a type of border called [...] "deadlines" [...] and hiring gunmen to prevent sheepherders from crossing them.|$|R

25|$|Most of Carlsbad's {{development}} {{was due to}} irrigation water. Local <b>cattleman</b> recognized the value of diverting water from the Pecos River to the grazing lands on Eddy's Halagueno Ranch. Many construction projects were undertaken to establish an irrigation system within the town. The Avalon Dam was constructed upstream of town, and canals diverted the water into town. Conflict arose when the canals met the river downstream; as a result, the Pecos River Flume was built, first out of wood and later concrete (the flume is often titled {{the only place where}} a river crosses itself).|$|E

25|$|With the New York Trust Company's {{takeover}} of the Spade Ranch following the Nebraska Land and Feeding Company's foreclosure {{the future of the}} Spade was in question. In late 1923 Edward M. Brass, and his business partner, Edward P.

Brass and Meyers seemed to have uncanny foresight of economic change. Prior to 1922 they had sold most of their cattle at good prices and then leased their ranches out then with cattle prices low in 1923-24, they bought back into the cattle business. Beginning in 1924 management of the ranch was given to Lawrence Y. Bixby, <b>cattleman</b> and former employee of the Nebraska Land and Feeding Company.|$|E
25|$|In {{the strictest}} sense, English folk music has existed since {{the arrival of}} the Anglo-Saxon people in Britain after 400 CE. The Venerable Bede's story of the <b>cattleman</b> and later ecclesiastical {{musician}} Cædmon indicates that in the early medieval period it was normal at feasts to pass around the harp and sing 'vain and idle songs'. Since this type of music was rarely notated, we have little knowledge of its form or content. Some later tunes, like those used for Morris dance, may have their origins in this period, but it is impossible to be certain of these relationships. We know from a reference in William Langland's Piers Plowman, that ballads about Robin Hood were being sung from at least by the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material we have is Wynkyn de Worde's collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.|$|E

25|$|In August 1907, news {{articles}} {{appeared in}} Canada and the U.S. claiming that J.E. Duffy, {{a member of}} a Michigan cavalry troop that dealt with Quantrill's raiders during the Civil War, had met Quantrill at Quatsino Sound, on northern Vancouver Island while investigating timber rights in the area. Duffy claimed to recognize the man, living under the name of John Sharp, as Quantrill. Duffy said that Sharp admitted he was Quantrill and discussed in detail raids in Kansas and elsewhere. Sharp claimed that he had survived the ambush in Kentucky, though receiving a bayonet and bullet wound, making his way to South America where he lived some years in Chile. He returned to the U.S., working as a <b>cattleman</b> in Fort Worth, Texas. He then moved to Oregon, acting as a cowpuncher and drover, before reaching British Columbia in the 1890s, where he worked in logging, trapping and finally as a mine caretaker at Coal Harbour at Quatsino.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} military, Brodie {{worked as a}} <b>cattleman</b> in Kansas and miner in Dakota Territory before enlisting in the U.S. Cavalry at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri in August 1883. His {{enlistment}} returned him to Arizona Territory, where he was discharged in February 1884. Remaining in the territory, Brodie established a permanent residence in Prescott while working around the territory as a civil and mining engineer. From 1887 till 1890 he worked as superintendent and chief engineer of the Walnut Grove Dam on the Hassayampa River north of Wickenburg. As the dam was nearing completion, in February 1890, a flood caused the dam to collapse, causing 70 deaths {{and millions of dollars}} in damage. Brodie himself was held innocent of wrongdoing in the failure as he had publicly called for higher construction standards on the project.

25|$|Sheriff Masterson got {{his term}} {{off to a}} roaring start on February 1, 1878, by {{capturing}} Dave Rudabaugh and Ed West, who were wanted for an attempted train robbery. Two more of the train robbers were caught by Bat and brother Ed on March 15, but the tandem law-enforcement effort {{came to an abrupt}} end when 25-year-old City Marshal Edward J. Masterson was shot and killed {{in the line of duty}} on April 9, 1878. Ed was shot by a cowboy named Jack Wagner, who was unaware that Ed Masterson's brother Bat was in the vicinity. As mortally wounded Ed stumbled away from the scene, Bat Masterson responded from across the street with deadly force, firing on both Wagner and Wagner's boss Alf Walker, who was holding a gun. Wagner died the next day, but Walker was taken back to Texas and recovered. The local newspapers were ambiguous about who shot Wagner and Walker, and this led some later historians to question whether Bat Masterson was involved. However, the rediscovery of two court cases in which Bat Masterson testified under oath that he had shot both men adds credence to the idea that Bat avenged his brother. More violence followed on October 4, 1878, when a variety actress named Dora Hand, known professionally as Fannie Keenan, was shot and killed by James Kenedy, son of the wealthy Texas <b>cattleman</b> Miflin Kenedy (1818–1895). Sheriff Masterson's posse, which included Wyatt Earp and Bill Tilghman, captured Kenedy the following day after Bat used his rifle to shoot him in the left arm, and other posse members killed his horse.|$|E
