50|$|A 2002 {{study of}} the {{intestinal}} flora of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients found that in patients who had ulcerative colitis, a form of IBD, 21% of the total bacteria in the colon were Clostridium histolyticum. <b>Control</b> <b>specimen</b> did not contain this species at all. In healthy adults, the amount of clostridia species in the feces is rarely higher than 106 cells/g feces, less than 1% of the total flora.

A detailed discussion of the strengthening technique used and of the mechanical properties of the specimens studied under cyclic loading is presented. It is highlighted that, referring to the case of external beam-column assemblages that are not yet extensively studied in the literature, the steel cage is an effective reinforcing technique to increase the flexural and shear strength of beams and columns, also increasing the energy capacity dissipation and reducing the stiffness degradation...|$|E
40|$|The {{laboratory}} diagnosis of lupus anticoagulants (LA) remains difficult despite internationally accepted guidelines for its detection. Several interlaboratory surveys have shown poor agreement between laboratories. Further standardization of LA testing will {{to a large}} extent depend on better insights on the mechanisms by which LA affect phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays {{as well as on the}} availability of well characterized and internationally accepted reference materials and <b>control</b> <b>specimens.</b> We recently raised a series of murine monoclonal antibodies against human beta 2 GPI (anti-beta 2 GPI moabs), a phospholipid-binding protein directly involved in the interaction between certain lupus anticoagulants and phospholipids. In this study we report on the use of LA positive anti-beta 2 GPI moabs as easy to handle reference and control material. The relative LA responsiveness of various phospholipid-dependent clotting assays was determined on plasmas spiked with such moabs and compared well with that determined on LA positive plasma samples. Plasmas spiked with LA positive anti-beta 2 GPI moabs were also used as <b>control</b> <b>specimens</b> to study the interlaboratory precision of LA testing.

However, very limited research is available on the effect of fatigue loading on the bond behaviour between CFRP and steel. This paper attempts to fill the knowledge gap in this area.

40|$|Abstract. Generally, slab-column frames show lower stiffness, drift capacity, and {{ductility}} {{as compared}} to beam-column frames. Under combined gravity and lateral cyclic loading, the lower initial stiffness and stiffness degradation lead to poor structural performance. Therefore, in the current codes, slab-column frames are recommended only for Intermediate Moment Frames with dual systems. The objective {{of this study is}} to modify slab-column connection details to enhance seismic performance such that the system can also be used with Special Moment Frames. Four specimens of interior slab-column connection models with the same dimensions and flexural reinforcement were tested under gravity and cyclic lateral loads. One specimen, constructed as <b>control</b> <b>specimen,</b> was designed using standard orthogonal stud rails. The other specimens used newly designed stud rails.
