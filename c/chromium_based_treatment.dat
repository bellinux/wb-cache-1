Current research efforts {{have concentrated on}} developing protective technologies for multiple applications. Such properties would enable manufacturers to address both corrosion and bacterial threats {{in areas such as}} fuel tanks and delivery systems. The present study explores the anticorrosion properties of 1, 2 -dihydro 1, 2, 4, 5 tetrazine- 3, 6 -dicarboxylic acid (H 2 DCTZ) on a copper rich aerospace aluminium alloy (AA 2024 -T 3). Furthermore the antimicrobial activity of the tetrazine is evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, both capable of inducing corrosion. The protective action of the tetrazine was investigated at different concentrations in a chloride ion rich environment (3. 5 % (w/v) NaCl) utilising electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results over a 72 h period proved that an optimum concentration was 500 ppm. FTIR and SEM elemental mapping of the surface confirmed the nitrogen rich tetrazine affinity for the copper rich intermetallic sites, through coordinate bonds, which delayed corrosion onset and reduced pit formation. Moderate antibacterial tetrazine activity was observed against Escherichia coli and 100 % efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus at 250 ppm was achieved. The damage of the bacterial cell envelope at the critical concentrations (250 ppm) is proposed as a possible mechanism for antibacterial action...|$|R

40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} {{electrochemical}} power sources, that directly convert {{the energy of}} a chemical reaction into electrical energy. By this, they {{have the potential for}} an efficient and ecologically friendly supply of energy. Fuel cells are subject to research to make the introduction of the fuel cell technology possible by improvement of processes and materials. Aim of this study was the development of materials for the interconnect of a solid oxide fuel cell. The interconnect separates the gas atmospheres and provides conduction of electrical charges to allow the use of the energy won by the fuel cell. During this study two materials were studied with respect to their suitability as interconnect materials: <b>chromium</b> <b>based</b> alloys and cermets of nickel alloy and alumina. <b>Chromium</b> <b>based</b> alloys possess a good electrical conductivity and a high oxidation resistance. By addition of yttria the oxidation resistance can be further improved. During this study the <b>chromium</b> <b>based</b> alloys were processed by mechanical alloying. The effect of the manufacturing parameters and of the composition on the microstructure and the properties of the alloys are described. It is shown, that the manufacturing parameters significantly influence the oxidation behaviour of the alloys. The microstructure has more effect on the oxidation behaviour than the exact composition of the alloy. By use of cermets of nickel alloy and alumina the thermal expansion of the interconnect can be adjusted to that of the other components of the fuel cell. Cermets were processed by pressureless sintering. Even as the melting points of the components greatly differ, relative densities of more than 95 % of theoretical density were achieved by optimising the starting materials and the parameters of sintering.

40|$|The {{operation}} of solid oxide fuel cells requires gas tight and stable sealing materials. Glass ceramic materials {{have been established}} to seal different stack designs and can be optimized to match the requirements of components and joining conditions. It is known that glass based sealants {{are sensitive to the}} formation of undesired chromia species in contact with ferritic steels used as interconnects. Their formation depends on the earth alkaline type and content in the glass as well as the chromium content of the interconnect. A robust interconnect material is the <b>chromium</b> <b>based</b> sinter alloy CFY with > 93 wt. % chromium what in turn enforces the formation of chromia phases. SOFC stacks with <b>chromium</b> <b>based</b> interconnects and electrolyte supported cells (ESC) with 10 SCSZ electrolyte are a candidate for SOFC systems with high efficiency in a wide power range. This study presents results on the development of sealing glasses adapted for the CFY by optimizing the glass components BaO, CaO, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3. Depending properties like crystallization behavior, thermal expansion, adhesion and reactivity in contact with CFY have been regarded. The glasses have been tested under operating conditions of SOFC (dual atmosphere, electric potentials) in samples as well as in real stacks. It has been shown that optimized glass compositions especially regarding a limited BaO-content combine a good joining behavior and minimized BaCrO 4 formation in contact with the CFY alloy...|$|R
