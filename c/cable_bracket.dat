5000|$|On 28 September 2006 a Chief crashed while hovering, {{with minor}} {{injuries}} {{to the pilot}} and passenger. The National Transportation Safety Board report stated, [...] "The amateur built helicopter impacted the ground during a test flight following {{the failure of a}} welded joint at a cyclic control <b>cable</b> <b>bracket</b> resulting in a loss of control authority. A post impact fire ensued destroying the helicopter. The pilot reported he was in a low hover when the tail came up and the helicopter tilted. One of the skids subsequently caught the ground causing the helicopter to roll over. Examination of the helicopter revealed that a welded joint failed at a cyclic control <b>cable</b> <b>bracket</b> on the main rotor mast. Failure of the welded bracket caused the loss of input control authority from the cyclic control to the main rotor." ...|$|E
5000|$|The cables {{around the}} target stand are {{vulnerable}} to bullets. This can especially {{be a problem in}} speed shooting competitions where some of the shots may miss the target. To protect the <b>cables,</b> <b>brackets</b> made of hardened steel have been used in stangskyting and felthurtigskyting.|$|R
40|$|Concept allows routing easily changed. No custom {{hardware}} {{required in}} concept. Instead, standard brackets {{cut to length}} and installed at selected locations along cable route. If cable route is changed, brackets simply moved to new locations. Concept for "universal" <b>cable</b> <b>brackets</b> {{make it easy to}} route electrical cable around and through virtually any structure...|$|R
50|$|Certain parts, {{especially}} springs, <b>cables,</b> bottom <b>brackets,</b> {{and spring}} anchor plates, are under extreme tension. Injuries can occur if parts under tension are removed.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} Sunbursts {{suffered}} structural failures {{that resulted in}} fatal accidents. The cause was traced to <b>cable</b> attachment <b>brackets</b> that were made with rough holes that over time in service sawed through the cable thimbles and caused the flight cables to break. This was addressed by replacing the brackets.|$|R
40|$|From {{flight and}} mockup {{drawings}} of Spacelab 2 (SL 2) experiments and hardware, shop ready mockup drawings were produced. Floor panels {{were the first}} items considered for fabrication. Cold plate and orthogrid mockups were designed and fabricated. Experiment and other hardware mockups were fabricated of aluminum or plywood, depending on size and configuration. Eighty-three <b>cable</b> routing <b>bracket</b> mockups were fabricated of aluminum and delivered for painting...|$|R
2500|$|The {{front part}} of the hub {{contained}} a nearly spherical landing capsule [...] in diameter and weighing [...] Compared to previous (failed) Venera probes, the capsule contained an improved heat shield which could withstand temperatures up to [...] Instead of the previous liquid-based cooling design, a simpler and more reliable gas system was installed. The durability of the capsule was checked by exposing it to high temperatures, pressures and accelerations using three unique testing installations. The heat resistance was checked in a high-temperature vacuum system emulating the upper layers of the atmosphere. The capsule was also pressurized up to 25 atmospheres. (The surface pressure on Venus was unknown at the time. [...] Estimates ranged from a few to hundreds of atmospheres). Finally, it was subjected to accelerations of up to 450 g in a centrifuge. The centrifuge test caused cracking of electronic components and <b>cable</b> <b>brackets,</b> which were all replaced shortly before launch. The timing for launch was rather tight, {{so as not to}} miss the launch windowâ€”the days of the year when the path to the destination planet from Earth is energetically least demanding.|$|R

40|$|A non-proprietary, cable {{guardrail}} {{system is}} currently under {{development for the}} Midwest States Pooled Fund Program. A cable guardrail end terminal was necessary to accompany the cable guardrail system. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for the cable end terminal. Bogie testing that was previously completed on a design concept indicated delayed cable release, which was an undesired performance that led to vehicle instabilities. Several design changes were recommended for better end terminal performance and to reflect the changes made to the cable median barrier. An LS-DYNA model of the modified cable end terminal was developed. Simulations of 0 - and 15 -degree impacts {{on the end of}} the <b>cable</b> anchor <b>bracket</b> with a bogie model indicated that the cables would release easily and not induce vehicle instabilities. This behavior still needs to be verified through bogie and full-scale crash testing. Simulations of a 25 -degree reverse impact between post nos. 2 and 3 with small car models indicated that cables did not release easily and may interlock around the car resulting in excessive vehicle decelerations or instabilities. Simulations of various line post designs found that the MWP and weakened MWP have lower forces and energies during impact than the S 3 x 5. 7 posts used in previous three-cable end terminals. This finding would suggest improved performance with respect to vehicle override and instability. However, vehicle simulations with multiple line posts impacted were inconclusive. Further design modifications, evaluation, and testing are recommended...|$|R
