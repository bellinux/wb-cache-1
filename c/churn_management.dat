40|$|Autonomic {{managers}} {{are the main}} architectural building blocks for constructing self-management capabilities of computing systems and applications. One of the major challenges in developing self-managing applications is robustness of management elements which form autonomic managers. We believe that transparent handling {{of the effects of}} resource <b>churn</b> (joins/leaves/failures) on <b>management</b> should be an essential feature of a platform for self-managing large-scale dynamic distributed applications, because it facilitates the development of robust autonomic managers and hence improves robustness of self-managing applications. This feature can be achieved by providing a robust management element abstraction that hides churn from the programmer. In this paper, we present a generic approach to achieve robust services that is based on finite state machine replication with dynamic reconfiguration of replica sets. We contribute a decentralized algorithm that maintains the set of nodes hosting service replicas in the presence of churn. We use this approach to implement robust management elements as robust services that can operate despite of churn. Our proposed decentralized algorithm uses peer-to-peer replica placement schemes to automate replicated state machine migration in order to tolerate churn. Our algorithm exploits lookup and failure detection facilities of a structured overlay network for managing the set of active replicas. Using the proposed approach, we can achieve a long running and highly available service, without human intervention, in the presence of resource churn. In order to validate and evaluate our approach, we have implemented a prototype that includes the proposed algorithm. ...|$|R

The perceived characteristics of distributed storage systems depend on their configuration parameters and on various dynamic conditions. For a given set of conditions, one specific configuration may be better than another with respect to measures such as resource consumption and performance.

40|$|Autonomic {{computing}} aims {{at making}} computing systems self-managing by using autonomic managers {{in order to}} reduce obstacles caused by management complexity. This thesis presents results of research on self-management for large-scale distributed systems. This research was motivated by the increasing complexity of computing systems and their management. In the first part, we present our platform, called Niche, for programming self-managing component-based distributed applications. In our work on Niche, we have faced and addressed the following four challenges in achieving self-management in a dynamic environment characterized by volatile resources and high churn: resource discovery, robust and efficient sensing and actuation, management bottleneck, and scale. We present results of our research on addressing the above challenges. Niche implements the autonomic computing architecture, proposed by IBM, in a fully decentralized way. Niche supports a network-transparent view of the system architecture simplifying the design of distributed self-management. Niche provides a concise and expressive API for self-management. The implementation of the platform relies on the scalability and robustness of structured overlay networks. We proceed by presenting a methodology for designing the management part of a distributed self-managing application. We define design steps that include partitioning of management functions and orchestration of multiple autonomic managers. In the second part, we discuss robustness of management and data consistency, which are necessary in a distributed system. Dealing with the effect of <b>churn</b> on <b>management</b> increases the complexity of the management logic and thus makes its development time consuming and error prone. We propose the abstraction of Robust Management Elements, which are able to heal themselves under continuous churn. Our approach is based on replicating a management element using finite state machine replication with a reconfigurable replica set. Our algorithm automates the reconfiguration (migration) of the replica set in order to tolerate continuous churn. For data consistency, we propose a majority-based distributed key-value store supporting multiple consistency levels that is based on a peer-to-peer network. The store enables the tradeoff between high availability and data consistency. Using majority allows avoiding potential drawbacks of a master-based consistency control, namely, a single-point of failure and a potential performance bottleneck. In the third part, we investigate self-management for Cloud-based storage systems with the focus on elasticity control using elements of control theory and machine learning. We have conducted research on a number of different designs of an elasticity controller, including a State-Space feedback controller and a controller that combines feedback and feedforward control. We describe our experience in designing an elasticity controller for a Cloud-based key-value store using state-space model that enables to trade-off performance for cost. We describe the steps in designing an elasticity controller. We continue by presenting the design and evaluation of ElastMan, an elasticity controller for Cloud-based elastic key-value stores that combines feedforward and feedback control.

Autonomic management was applied to the peer-to-peer (P 2 P) and data retrieval components of ASA, a distributed storage system. The effects were measured experimentally for various workload and <b>churn</b> patterns. The <b>management</b> policies and mechanisms were implemented using a generic autonomic management framework developed during this work. The motivation for both groups of experiments was to test management policies with the objective to avoid unsatisfactory situations with respect to resource consumption and performance. Such unsatisfactory situations occur when either the P 2 P layer or the data retrieval mechanism is configured statically. In a statically configured P 2 P system two unsatisfactory situations can be identified. The first arises when the frequency with which P 2 P node states are verified is low and membership churn is high. The P 2 P node state becomes inaccurate due to a high membership churn, leading to errors during the routing process and a reduction in performance. In this situation it is desirable to increase the frequency to increase P 2 P state accuracy. The converse situation arises when the frequency is high and churn is low. In this situation network resources are used unnecessarily, which may also reduce performance, making it desirable to decrease the frequency. In ASA’s data retrieval mechanism similar unsatisfactory situations can be identified with respect to the degree of concurrency (DOC). The DOC controls the eagerness with which multiple redundant replicas are retrieved. An unsatisfactory situation arises when the DOC is low and there is a large variation in the times taken to retrieve replicas. In this situation it is desirable to increase the DOC, because by retrieving more replicas in parallel a result can be returned to the user sooner. The converse situation arises when the DOC is high, there is little variation in retrieval time and there is a network bottleneck close to the requesting client. In this situation it is desirable to decrease the DOC, since the low variation removes any benefit in parallel retrieval, and the bottleneck means that decreasing parallelism reduces both bandwidth consumption and elapsed time for the user. The experimental evaluations of autonomic management show promising results, and suggest several future research topics. These include optimisations of the managed mechanisms, alternative management policies, different evaluation methods, and {{the application of}} developed management mechanisms to other facets of a distributed storage system. The findings of this thesis could be exploited in building other distributed storage systems that focus on harnessing storage on user workstations, since these are particularly likely to be exposed to varying, unpredictable conditions.

40|$| {{rule-based}} classification techniques. Since monotonicity {{is guaranteed}} during a postprocessing step, the RULEM {{approach can be}} combined with any rule- or tree-based classification technique. In a first step, the RULEM algorithm checks whether a rule set or decision tree violates the imposed monotonicity constraints. Existing violations are resolved in a second step by inducing a set of additional rules which enforce monotone classification. The algorithm is able to handle non-monotonic noise, and {{can be applied to}} both partially and totally monotone problems with an ordinal target variable. Based on the RULEM algorithm, two novel justifiability measures are introduced. The RULEMS and RULEMF measures allow to calculate {{the extent to which a}} classification model is in line with domain knowledge expressed in the form of monotonicity constraints. Both measures provide an intuitive indication of the justifiability of a rule set, and can be calculated in a fully automated manner. An extensive benchmarking experiment has been set up to test the impact of the RULEM approach on the predictive power and the comprehensibility of the resulting rule set. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed approach preserves the predictive power of the original rule induction techniques while guaranteeing monotone classification, at the cost of a small increase in the size of the rule set. Hence, the RULEM algorithm is shown to yield accurate, comprehensible, and justifiable rule based classification models. The predictive power of the final rule set therefore depends on the selected rule induction technique that RULEM is combined with. New insights into churn prediction in the telecommunication sector: a profit driven data mining approachCCP models are typically evaluated using statistically based performance measures, such as for instance top decile lift or AUC. However, as shown in Chapter 4 of this thesis, this may lead to suboptimal model selection, and consequently to a loss in profits. Therefore, in the first part of Chapter 4, a novel, profit centric performance measure is developed. Optimizing the fraction of included customers with the highest predicted probabilities to attrite yields the maximum profit that can be generated by a retention campaign. Since reducing the costs or losses associated with customer churn is the main objective of a CCP model, this chapter advocates the use of the maximum profit (i. e., the maximum reduction in costs or losses) that can be generated by using the output of the model as a measure to evaluate CCP models. In the second part of the fourth chapter a large benchmarking experiment is conducted, including twenty-one state-of-the-art predictive algorithms that are applied on eleven data sets from telco operators worldwide. The benchmarking experiment allows to rigorously analyze and assess the impact of classification technique, oversampling, and input selection on the performance of a CCP model. The results of the experiments are tested using the appropriate test statistics, and evaluated using both the novel profit centric based measure and statistical performance measures, leading to the following conclusions:Applying the maximum profit criterion and including the optimal fraction of customers in a retention campaign leads to substantially different outcomes. Furthermore, the results of the experiments provide strong indications that the use of the maximum profit criterion can have a profound impact on the generated profits by a retention campaign. Secondly, the effect of oversampling on the performance of a CCP model strongly depends on the data set and the classification technique that is applied, and can be positive or negative. Therefore, we recommend to adopt an empirical approach, and as such to consistently test whether oversampling is beneficial. Third, the choice of classification technique significantly impacts the predictive power of the resulting model. Alternating Decision Trees yielded the best overall performance in the experiments, although a large number of other techniques were not significantly outperformed. Hence, other properties of modeling techniques besides the predictive power have to be taken into account when selecting a classification technique, such as comprehensibility, justifiability, and operational efficiency. Rule induction techniques, decision tree approaches, and classical statistical techniques such as logistic regression and Naive Bayes or Bayesian Networks score well on all three aspects, and result in a powerful, yet comprehensible model that is easy to implement and operate. Therefore these techniques are recommended to be applied for CCP modeling. Comprehensibility or interpretability is an important aspect of a classifier which allows the marketing department to extract valuable information from a model, in order to design effective retention campaigns and strategies. The comprehensibility of a model however also depends on the number of variables included in a model. Clearly a model including ten variables is easier to interpret than a model containing fifty variables or more. This leads to a fourth conclusion, i. e., input selection is crucial to achieve good predictive power, and six to eight variables generally suffice to predict churn with high accuracy. Consequently, from an economical point of view it may be more efficient to invest in data quality, than in gathering an extensive range of attributes capturing all the available information on a customer. Furthermore, the input selection procedure has shown that usage attributes are the most predictive kind of data. However, also socio-demographic data, financial information, and marketing related attributes are indispensable sources of information to predict customer churn. Moreover, marketing related attributes such as the hand set that is provided to a customer by the operator, are important sources of actionable information to design effective retention campaigns. Finally, this chapter also provides benchmarks to the industry to compare the performance of their CCP models. Social network analysis for customer churn predictionThe fifth chapter develops a range of new and adapted relational learning algorithms for customer churn prediction using social network effects, designed to handle the massive size of the call graph, the time dimension, and the skewed class distribution typically present in a customer churn prediction setting. Furthermore, an innovative approach to incorporate non-Markovian network effects within relational classifiers is presented, i. e., the weight product, which allows to upgrade the network neighborhood of the weight matrix. The weight product can be applied complementary to existing relational classifiers, and is shown to be the equivalent operation for weighted networks to the distance product for distance networks. Finally, a novel parallel model setup to combine a relational and non-relational classification model is introduced, which selects a top-fraction of the customers with the highest predicted probabilities to churn of both models. The performance of the newly proposed techniques is experimentally tested, and the profit driven evaluation methodology presented in Chapter 4 is applied to assess the results of two real life case studies on large scale telco data sets, containing both networked (call detail record data) and non-networked (customer related) information about millions of subscribers. The experiments indicate the existence of a significant impact of social network effects on the churn behavior of telco subscribers. Interestingly, also non-Markovian social network effects are observed: the churn behavior of not only the friends, but also the friends of friends have an impact on the churn behavior of telco subscribers. Relational and non-relational classifiers, which are built using respectively networked and non-networked information, are found to detect different groups or types of churners, hinting towards a great potential of social network analysis for customer churn prediction. A propositionalization approach to incorporate social network information within a non-relational model by including network variables yields the best performing stand-alone CCP model. However, the novel parallel modeling setup, resulting in a non-integrated model, outperforms all other approaches to combine a relational and non-relational model and generates significant gains in profit compared to integrated models, including the propositionalization approach. Hence, the main finding of this chapter with strong consequences for the practice of customer relationship management is that applying relational classifiers in combination with the current generation of CCP models can generate significant profit gains. This results from the fact that relational and non-relational CCP models detect different types of churners. Finally, including second order network effects by upgrading the network neighborhood using the weight product, is shown to improve classification power and to further increase the generated profits compared to a model that restricts the impact of the network to first order effects.

The proposed model of this paper has been implemented on some data and the results are compared based on five criteria including prediction accuracy, errors’ type I and II, root mean square error and mean absolute deviation. The preliminary results indicate that the proposed model of this paper performs better than alternative methods...|$|E
40|$|Telecommunication sector {{generates a}} huge amount of data due to {{increasing}} number of subscribers, rapidly renewable technologies; data based applications and other value added service. This data can be usefully mined for churn analysis and prediction. Significant research had been undertaken by researchers worldwide to understand the data mining practices {{that can be used for}} predicting customer churn. This paper provides a review of around 100 recent journal articles starting from year 2000 to present the various data mining techniques used in multiple customer based churn models. It then summarizes the existing telecom literature by highlighting the sample size used, churn variables employed and the findings of different DM techniques. Finally, we list the most popular techniques for churn prediction in telecom as decision trees, regression analysis and clustering, thereby providing a roadmap to new researchers to build upon novel <b>churn</b> <b>management</b> models...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} SPLAY, {{an integrated}} system that facilitates the design, deployment {{and testing of}} largescale distributed applications. Unlike existing systems, SPLAY covers {{all aspects of the}} development and evaluation chain. It allows developers to express algorithms in a concise, simple language that highly resembles pseudocode found in research papers. The execution environment has low overheads and footprint, and provides a comprehensive set of libraries for common distributed systems operations. SPLAY applications are run by a set of daemons distributed on one or several testbeds. They execute in a sandboxed environment that shields the host system and enables SPLAY to also be used on nondedicated platforms, in addition to classical testbeds like PlanetLab or ModelNet. A controller manages applications, offering multi-criterion resource selection, deployment control, and <b>churn</b> <b>management</b> by reproducing the system’s dynamics from traces or synthetic descriptions. SPLAY’s features, usefulness, performance and scalability are evaluated using deployment of representative experiments on PlanetLab and ModelNet clusters. ...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{interactions}} in social networks {{has emerged as}} a new research paradigm in modern marketing. It focuses not on modeling behavior of the individual but rather than on the measurement and analysis of its relationships and interactions with other users within the network. Measurement and analysis of these interactions can help understand the structure and dynamics of social networks and their impact on consumer choice. In this paper we present a data mining approach to measure and analyze the interactions in social networks between clients of mobile telecommunication networks. Our goal is to demonstrate how to use Call Data Records (CDR) to build predictive choice models (e. g. to predict customer churn). The approach and methodology can be applied to analyze the customer choice behavior in other markets where customer interactions are tracked automatically and saved electronicallysocial network analysis, <b>churn</b> <b>management,</b> direct marketing, predictive analytics and modeling, data mining, knowledge discover...|$|E
40|$|This report {{lays the}} first {{theoretical}} foundations for a research program on analytical <b>churn</b> <b>management.</b> In the current hypercompetitive business scenario, firms have {{to bend over}} backwards in their strategies both to retain their customers and to lure those from the competition. For this reason, understanding how customer loyalty construction mechanisms work, anticipating the customer’s intention to abandon a service provider, becomes a critical business acumen to ensure a company’s continuity in the market. To this end, in this report we propose a complete customer loyalty management model referred to as Customer Continuity Management. This type of knowledge can always be qualitatively obtained, but quantitative analysis of actual customer data should increase the certainty on its reliability and business actionability. This is why Data Mining techniques, applied to market surveyed information, can provide valuable assistance to churn (customer attrition) management processes. This report focuses on the prevention side of customer loyalty management and, especially, on customer satisfaction and switching barriers. Some of principals existing explanatory models of customer loyalty building are review in detail. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Globalization {{processes}} and market deregulation policies are rapidly changing the competitive environments of many economic sectors. The appearance of new competitors and technologies {{leads to an}} increase in competition and, with it, a growing preoccupation among service-providing companies with creating stronger customer bonds. In this context, anticipating the customer’s intention to abandon the provider, a phenomenon known as churn, becomes a competitive advantage. Such anticipation can be the result of the correct application of information-based knowledge extraction in the form of business analytics. In particular, the use of intelligent data analysis, or data mining, for the analysis of market surveyed information can be of great assistance to <b>churn</b> <b>management.</b> In this paper, we provide a detailed survey of recent applications of business analytics to churn, with a focus on computational intelligence methods. This is preceded by an in-depth discussion of churn within the context of customer continuity management. The survey is structured according to the stages identified as basic for the building of the predictive models of churn, as well as according to the different types of predictive methods employed and the business areas of their application.

40|$|For {{customer-centric}} firms, churn prediction plays {{a central}} role in <b>churn</b> <b>management</b> programs. Methodological advances have emphasized the use of customer panel data to model the dynamic evolution of a customer base to improve churn predictions. However, pressure from policy makers and the public geared to reducing the storage of customer data has led to firms' ‘self-policing’ by limiting data storage, rendering panel data methods infeasible. We remedy these problems by developing a method that captures the dynamic evolution of a customer base without relying on the availability past data. Instead, using a recursively updated model our approach requires only knowledge of past model parameters. This generalized mixture of Kalman filters model maintains the accuracy of churn predictions compared to existing panel data methods when data from the past is available. In the absence of past data, applications in the insurance and telecommunications industry establish superior predictive performance compared to simpler benchmarks. These improvements arise because the proposed method captures the same dynamics and unobserved heterogeneity present in customer databases as advanced methods, while achieving privacy preserving data minimization and data anonymization. We therefore conclude that privacy preservation does not have to come at the cost of analytical operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of classifiers which are profitable {{is becoming more}} and more important in real-life situations such as customer <b>churn</b> <b>management</b> campaigns in the telecommunication sector. In previous works, the expected maximum profit (EMP) metric has been proposed, which explicitly takes the cost of offer and the customer lifetime value (CLV) of retained customers into account. It thus permits the {{selection of}} the most profitable classifier, which better aligns with business requirements of end-users and stake holders. However, modelers are currently limited to applying this metric in the evaluation step. Hence, we expand on the previous body of work and introduce a classifier that incorporates the EMP metric in the construction of a classification model. Our technique, called ProfLogit, explicitly takes profit maximization concerns into account during the training step, rather than the evaluation step. The technique is based on a logistic regression model which is trained using a genetic algorithm (GA). By means of an empirical benchmark study applied to real-life data sets, we show that ProfLogit generates substantial profit improvements compared to the classic logistic model for many data sets. In addition, profit-maximized coefficient estimates differ considerably in magnitude from the maximum likelihood estimates. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Churn</b> <b>management</b> {{is one of}} the {{key issues}} handled by mobile {{telecommunication}} operators. Data mining techniques can help in the prediction of churn behavior of customers. Various supervised learning techniques have been used to study customer churn. However, research on the use of unsupervised learning techniques for prediction of churn is limited. In this article, we use two-stage hybrid models consisting of unsupervised clustering techniques and decision trees with boosting on two different data sets and evaluate the models in terms of top decile lift. We examine two different approaches for hybridization of the models for utilizing the results of clustering based on various attributes related to services usage and revenue contribution of customers. The results indicate that the use of clustering led to improved top decile lift for the hybrid models compared with the benchmark case when no clustering is used. It is also shown that using cluster labels as inputs to the decision trees is a preferred method of hybridization. Out of the five unsupervised clustering techniques used, none is found to dominate others. But interesting attributes and rules that can help marketing experts identify churners from the data are obtained from the best hybrid models. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
