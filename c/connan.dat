500|$|The {{album was}} not {{finished}} until {{the night before}} mastering. Chater had a flight to New York City at 7:30 in the morning. Di Blasi stated, [...] "so we’re in the studio till 6:30 that morning till he literally was like ‘I gotta go man, I gotta hop on the plane.’ We were like, ‘we think it sounds good. Fuck it.’" [...] Many tracks the Avalanches considered for Wildflower {{did not make it}} into the album because they did not contribute to its overall style. Collaborators on these songs included Jens Lekman, <b>Connan</b> Mockasin, [...] August Darnell, and Luke Steele. Once the style was more defined, they picked from tracks they had worked on which fell in line with others, similar to making a mix tape. The group intends to release these recordings that were closely related to Wildflower [...] "within a year or so" [...] of the album's release. This will help them [...] "clean the slate" [...] for new music to be made.|$|E
