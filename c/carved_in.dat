5|$|The {{interior}} of the church houses an original wooden iconostasis {{in front of the}} altar. <b>Carved</b> <b>in</b> {{the second half of the}} 14th century, the iconostasis has a basic shape. It is constructed of thick beams and wooden boards, on which traces of painting are visible, and has three openings.|$|E

5|$|As {{previously}} planned, {{most of the}} Texians {{fell back}} to the barracks and the chapel. Holes had been <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> the walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west wall headed west for the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.|$|E

50|$|He had {{rejected}} {{the idea of an}} academic career even before a conversion experience in 1974, when the sight of a Grinling Gibbons <b>carving</b> <b>in</b> a London church turned him towards woodcarving.

5|$|Elaborate lattices {{are found}} in Indian Jaali work, <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> marble to adorn tombs and palaces. Chinese lattices, always with some symmetry, exist in 14 of the 17 {{wallpaper}} groups; they often have mirror, double mirror, or rotational symmetry. Some have a central medallion, and some have a border in a frieze group. Many Chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by Daniel S. Dye; he identifies Sichuan as {{the centre of the}} craft.|$|E
5|$|Geometric motifs are <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> the Price Building's stone cladding, {{especially}} {{over the}} first few levels. The building is topped by a more classical, specifically Ch칙teauesque, steepled copper roof, the final composition showing Beaux-Arts influences. The main exterior decorative themes are pilasters topped with palm motifs, pinnacles and a large vaulted arch with extrados over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|Highway 35, {{like many}} {{highways}} that begin at Lake Ontario and eventually cross into the Canadian Shield, began as several trails connecting settlements. Most {{of the southern}} portion of the highway follows various sidelines and concessions. Between Lindsay and Fenelon Falls, Highway 35 follows the former Fenelon Road, while north of there it follows The Cameron Road, a trail <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> the 1850s between Fenelon and Minden. North of Minden, the highway generally follows The Bobcaygeon Road, a colonization road built {{as far north as}} Dwight in the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds of stelae {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Maya region, displaying a wide stylistic variation. Many are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or more faces, with available surfaces sculpted with figures <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> relief and with hieroglyphic text. Stelae in a few sites display a much more three-dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at Cop치n and Tonin치. Plain stelae {{do not appear to}} have been painted nor overlaid with stucco decoration, but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the house}} has nine {{bathrooms}} and one elevator, which {{were taken from the}} Mellon Mansion. Also taken from the Mellon Mansion were two fireplaces. The one was <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> Italy from lava of Mt. Vesuvius and is located in the community room. The other, located in the dining room on the first floor, was carved out of red Michigan sandstone by an Italian-American sculptor.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} to the structure itself, the inner city is notable for the audience hall, which is an important representation of Serbian medieval architecture. High in the stone wall on the Danube side, four sets of double-arched windows are <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> a combination of Gothic and Romanesque styles. This is where a merchant contract between the Republic of Venice and the Serbian Despotate was signed.|$|E

5|$|Jahangir's Quadrangle {{occupies}} the northeastern {{corner of the}} fort. Though named for Jahangir, construction on the site began in 1617 or 1618 {{during the reign of}} Akbar, but was completed in 1620 under Jahangir. Akbar's syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle, as it employs column brackets <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> the form of animals. The quadrangle's layout differs from other Mughal quadrangles which are based upon the layout of a Persian paradise garden, and instead is formed by concentric rectangles with a fountain in its centre.|$|E
5|$|Just {{above the}} gate, {{there are three}} coats of arms <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> relief into the arch; {{from left to right}} they are the arms of the Wardeux, Dalyngrigge, and Radynden families. The Wardeux family was that of Edward Dalyngrigge's wife; the Radyndens were {{relations}} of the Dalyngrigges. Above the arms is a helm bearing a unicorn head crest. Three coats of arms also decorate the postern gate; the central arms is that of Sir Robert Knolles, who Edward Dalyngrigge had fought for in the Hundred Years' War, but those flanking it are blank.|$|E
5|$|Kingship had its ritual aspects. The {{kings of}} D치l Riata were inaugurated by putting their {{foot in a}} {{footprint}} <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> stone, signifying that they would {{follow in the footsteps}} of their predecessors. The kingship of the unified kingdom of Alba had Scone and its sacred stone at the heart of its coronation ceremony, which historians presume was inherited from Pictish practices. Iona, the early centre of Scottish Christianity, became the burial site of the early kings of Scotland until the eleventh century, when the House of Canmore adopted Dunfermline near Scone.|$|E
