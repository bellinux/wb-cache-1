5|$|The {{elaboration}} of the cerebral cortex <b>carries</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> changes to other brain areas. The superior colliculus, which {{plays a major}} role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex. The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex, which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice <b>carries</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
5|$|The novel's protagonist is Lucius, {{a man who}} {{has been}} magically {{transformed}} into a donkey. In the eleventh and last book of the novel, Lucius, after falling asleep on the beach at Cenchreae in Greece, wakes to see the full moon. He prays to the moon, using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco-Roman world, asking her to restore him to human form. Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself the greatest of all goddesses. She tells him that a festival in her honor, the Navigium Isidis, is taking place nearby, and that the festival procession <b>carries</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them. After Lucius becomes human again, the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess, and that he will now be free of the inquisitiveness and self-indulgence that drew him into many of his earlier misadventures. Lucius joins the local temple of Isis, becomes her devoted follower, and eventually undergoes initiation.|$|E

25|$|Legalization of {{the organ}} trade <b>carries</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> its {{own sense of}} justice as well.

25|$|According to this approach, {{it is not}} {{necessary}} to assign any value to the probability of a hypothesis, although one must certainly take into account the probability of the data given the hypothesis, or given a competing hypothesis, when deciding whether to accept or to reject.

25|$|Traditionally, {{individual}} markings {{are called}} motifs {{and groups of}} motifs are known as panels. Sequences of panels are treated as archaeological sites.

25|$|One main {{disadvantage}} of HA {{is that it}} needs to be covered with exogenous material, such as sclera, polyethylene terephthalate, or vicryl mesh (which has the {{disadvantage of}} creating a rough implant tissue interface that can lead to technical difficulties in implantation and subsequent erosion of overlying tissue with the end stage being extrusion), as direct suturing is not possible for muscle attachment. Scleral covering <b>carries</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> the risk of transmission of infection, inﬂammation, and rejection.|$|E
25|$|The Walibri of Australia also exhibit {{third party}} costly punishment. The local {{community}} determines whether {{an act of}} homicide, adultery, theft, etc. was an offense.

Data from the Aranda foragers of the Central Desert in Australia suggest this punishment can be very costly, as it <b>carries</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> the risk of retaliation from the family members of the punished, which can be as severe as homicide.|$|E

Upon reaching its final destination, the ventral pancreatic bud fuses with the much larger dorsal pancreatic bud. At this point of fusion, the main ducts of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds fuse, forming the main pancreatic duct. The duct of the dorsal bud regresses, leaving the main pancreatic duct.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} law of thermodynamics, {{there is no}} trivial passage of {{physical}} conception from the closed system view to an open system view. For closed systems, the concepts of an adiabatic enclosure and of an adiabatic wall are fundamental. Matter and internal energy cannot permeate or penetrate such a wall. For an open system, there is a wall that allows penetration by matter. In general, matter in diffusive motion <b>carries</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> some internal energy, and some microscopic potential energy changes accompany the motion. An open system is not adiabatically enclosed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 1 in 25,000 babies born in the United States will {{have some form of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that only individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are affected. (The exception is MPS II, or Hunter syndrome, in which the mother alone passes along the defective gene to a son.) When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy <b>carries</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> a one in four chance that the child will be affected. The parents and siblings of an affected child may have no sign of the disorder. Unaffected siblings and select relatives of a child with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the recessive gene and could pass it to their own children.|$|E

25|$|In February 2007, {{a review}} by the Indianapolis Star of votes in the House of Representatives {{for the past decade}} showed that Burton had missed all votes during the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic golf tournament for five years between 2001 and 2007.

Since 2004, Burton has played in a guest spot of the Eisenhower Medical Center, the primary charitable beneficiary of the event. The slot <b>carries</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> a commitment to donate $10,000 to the event; Burton has made arrangements with the hospital to do this over a period of time.

He also appointed a Knight of the Order of the Garter on 16 September 1963 and Constable of the Tower on 1 August 1965.

25|$|Like Plato, Mazzoni {{was very}} {{concerned}} with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure and delight {{in the perception of}} the believable images.” Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.” In part, {{this has to do with}} the idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, <b>carries</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.|$|E
