5000|$|Phase II of this project, {{completed}} in November 2002, {{consisted of the}} construction of new station facilities {{on the other side of}} Woodbourne Road, adjacent to the new parking lot. The new low level platform accommodates a six-car train and a large canopy/shelter is located near its center. New gooseneck style lighting fixtures were installed throughout the station area. Accessibility features include new tactile edging, a mini-high level platform, signage, and an AVPA system. Due to the configuration of this three-track territory (2 passenger tracks and one freight track), <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> boarding platforms were installed in order to reach the center (outbound) passenger track. [...] The location of the old station has since become a popular location for local railfans to watch and film trains from.|$|E

The efforts involved an international team of scientists. Some parties explored the glaciers and others the valleys on the ice shelf.

The technique allowed measurements to be taken from the air; allowing a criss <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> of 35,000 km to be covered; compared with a 3,000 km track from previous seismic sounding on the ground. More detailed surveys were executed between 1973 and 1978.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the slopes}} in Val Thorens face north and north-west, {{providing}} for good snow conditions. This {{means that the}} slopes are not as sunny, so the resort tends to attract a crowd more interested in skiing than [...] "terracing". However, the resort itself faces south, and many people enjoy sitting outside in the sunshine when they have finished skiing. Val Thorens has a total of 68 marked runs, and several terrain parks. The main snow park sees top level freestyle competitions every winter as it hosts a stage of the national SFR Slopestyle Tour, and the ski cross arena is frequently visited by the FIS Skier X World Cup.

50|$|By early August, Siegfried Battery and Grosser Kurfürst Battery {{were fully}} {{operational}} as {{were all of}} the Army’s railway guns. Seven of the railway guns, six 28 cm K5 guns and a single 21 cm K12 gun {{with a range of}} 115 km, could only be used against land targets. The remainder, thirteen 28 cm guns and five 24 cm guns, plus additional motorised batteries comprising twelve 24 cm guns and ten 21 cm guns, could be fired at shipping but were of limited effectiveness due to their slow traverse speed, long loading time and ammunition types. Land-based guns have always been feared by navies because they are on a stationary platform and are thus more accurate (and can be larger, with more ammunition stowage) than those on board ship. Super-heavy railway guns can only be traversed by moving the entire gun and its carriage along a curved track, or by building a special <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> or turntable. This, combined with their slow rate of fire (measured in rounds per hour or even rounds per day), makes {{it difficult for them to}} hit moving targets. Another problem with super-heavy guns is that their barrels (which are difficult to make and expensive to replace) wear out relatively quickly, so they could not be fired often.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the radial and <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> errors of artificial earth satellites is {{discussed in terms of}} the interference of two one-dimensional celestial mechanical wave trains. Resulting equations for these tracking errors describe the behavior of the uncertainties in the orbital parameters as oscillatory in nature, with a rapidly oscillating term, which {{is a function of the}} sum of the observed and computed orbital frequencies, modulated in amplitude by a slowly varying oscillation. This latter term is itself a function of either the difference between these orbital frequencies or between the values of the computed and observed right ascensions, depending upon whether it is the radial or <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> case under consideration. These results indicate that the <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> calculation describes the behavior of uncertainties in the right ascension of the ascending node and the inclination, while the radial calculation gives information on uncertainties in the semi-major axis, the eccentricity, and the argument of perigee.

40|$|A {{human-in-the-loop}} {{high fidelity}} flight simulation experiment was conducted, which investigated and compared breakout procedures for Very Closely Spaced Parallel Approaches (VCSPA) with {{two and three}} runways. To understand the feasibility, usability and human factors of two and three runway VCSPA, data were collected and analyzed on the dependent variables of breakout <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> error and pilot workload. Independent variables included number of runways, cause of breakout and location of breakout. Results indicated larger <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> error and higher workload using three runways as compared to 2 -runway operations. Significant interaction effects involving breakout cause and breakout location were also observed. Across all conditions, <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> error values showed high levels of breakout trajectory accuracy and pilot workload remained manageable. Results suggest possible avenues of future adaptation for adopting these procedures (e. g., pilot training), while also showing potential promise of the concept. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{autonomous}} catamaran, {{based on}} a modified Prindle- 19 day-sailing Catamaran, was built to test the viability of GPS-based system identification for precision control. The catamaran was fitted with several sensors and actuators to characterize the dynamics. Using an electric trolling motor, and lead ballast to match all-up weight, several system identification passes were performed to excite system modes and model the dynamic response. LQG controllers were designed {{based on the results}} of the system identification passes, and tested with the electric trolling motor. Line following performance was excellent, with <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> error standard deviations of less than 0. 15 meters. The wing-sail propulsion system was fitted, and the controllers tested with the wing providing all forward thrust. Line following performance and disturbance rejection were excellent, with the <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> error standard deviations of approximately 0. 30 meters, in spite of wind speed variations of over 50 % of nominal value...|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) imaging {{technology}} based on antenna array {{is one of}} the most important 3 D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) high resolution imaging modes. In this paper, a novel 3 D imaging method is proposed for airborne down-looking sparse array SAR based on the imaging geometry and the characteristic of echo signal. The key point of the proposed algorithm is the introduction of a special squint model in <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> processing to obtain accurate focusing. In this special squint model, point targets with different <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> positions have different squint angles at the same range resolution cell, which is different from the conventional squint SAR. However, after theory analysis and formulation deduction, the imaging procedure can be processed with the uniform reference function, and the phase compensation factors and algorithm realization procedure are demonstrated in detail. As the method requires only Fourier transform and multiplications and thus avoids interpolations, it is computationally efficient. Simulations with point scatterers are used to validate the method...|$|E
