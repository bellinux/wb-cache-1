Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (<b>CARET)</b> study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer.

40|$|Aim. This {{paper is}} a report of a study to examine the {{complexities}} of informal caregiving for people with chronic heart failure. Background. Little is known of the activities involved and underlying informal care. Heart failure is a common and burdensome condition in which <b>carets</b> play an important management role. Method. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 30 informal <b>carets</b> nominated by patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure (24 spouses, four children, one sibling and one neighbour). Interviews examined knowledge of heart failure, its effects, reported management practices and concerns, decision making and support. The data were collected in 2001. Findings. The management of heart failure was a shared and ongoing responsibility between the carer and patient. Carets' clinical knowledge of the condition and management was often limited, but they developed extensive knowledge of its personal effects on the patient. Invisible care activities included monitoring signs of symptom exacerbation and energy boundaries against perceived current and future demands and priorities. Visible care activities included medication management, dressing, bathing and help-seeking. <b>Carets</b> responded to patients' capacities, and adopted philosophies that sought to foster independence while facilitating as normal a life for the patient as was possible and safe. Conclusion. Interventions for informal caters around effective chronic heart failure management should address both visible and invisible informal caring Future. {{research is needed to}} develop interventions with carers to improve quality of care, reduce costs and improve patient quality of life. More research is needed to explore the complexities of lay caregiving and to explore the invisible dimensions of informal care further...|$|R

40|$|Background. Although carers' {{reactions}} to schizophrenic illness {{in a close}} family member may {{have important implications for}} the patient and for themselves, little is known of factors that influence the way carers. respond. In the area of physical health problems, people's models of their illness or illness representations {{have been found to be}} related to the ways they react and cope with their illness. This study examines the use of a modified form of the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) to investigate illness models in a sample of <b>carets</b> of schizophrenia patients. Methods. Forty-seven <b>carets</b> participated. The psychometric properties of the modified IPQ were examined, and a number of carer and patient outcomes were investigated in relation to carer scores on the illness identity, consequences, control-cure and timeline subscales of the modified IPQ. These outcomes included measures of carer distress and burden, expressed emotion dimensions, and patient functioning. Results. The modified IPQ was found to be a reliable measure of carers' perceptions of schizophrenia. Carer functioning, the patient-carer relationship and patient illness characteristics were associated with different dimensions of illness perceptions. Conclusions. The findings support the proposal that carer cognitive representations of the illness may have important implications for both carer and patient outcomes in schizophrenia...|$|R
