40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{understanding}} the coevolution of star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M*), and oxygen abundance (O/H) in galaxies up to redshift z= 3. 7, we have compiled the largest available dataset for studying Metallicity Evolution and Galaxy Assembly (MEGA); it comprises roughly 1000 galaxies with a common O/H <b>calibration</b> <b>and</b> <b>spans</b> almost two orders of magnitude in metallicity, a factor of 10 ^ 6 in SFR, and a factor of 10 ^ 5 in stellar mass. From a Principal Component Analysis, {{we find that the}} 3 -dimensional parameter space reduces to a Fundamental Plane of Metallicity (FPZ) given by 12 +log(O/H) = - 0. 14 log (SFR) + 0. 37 log (M*) + 4. 82. The mean O/H FPZ residuals are small (0. 16 dex) and consistent with trends found in smaller galaxy samples with more limited ranges in M*, SFR, and O/H. Importantly, the FPZ is found to be redshift-invariant within the uncertainties. In a companion paper, these results are interpreted with an updated version of the model presented by Dayal et al. (2013). Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|The {{total and}} static {{pressure}} of the DSTO Transonic Wind Tunnel (TWT) are each measured by a Paroscientific Digiquartz ® pressure transducer. As part of the on-going quality management system these transducers have been recalibrated by the National Measurement Institute according to the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) standards. From {{the results of the}} <b>calibration,</b> zero <b>and</b> <b>span</b> adjustment parameters are determined. These parameters are then applied to the calibration equations supplied by the original equipment manufacturer to correct for the pressure reading.
