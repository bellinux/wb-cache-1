[...] Cobb cautiously did not state {{how long it would take}} to train 100,000 people. He had no idea.

2500|$|The Pennsylvania Nautical School’s <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> was two years, {{at the end}} {{of which}} time cadets {{graduated}} as Third Officers and were eligible for an officer’s position aboard any American merchant Ship. PNS cadets studied navigation, theoretical and practical marine engineering, and seamanship, were taught by Navy Officers, and received their training aboard a schoolship, a retired naval ship which was repurposed as a training ship. [...] Coursework was divided into port and sea terms. The schoolship was typically anchored at the port of Philadelphia during port terms and cadets could apply for permission for a leave of absence during the weekends. The sea terms were spent in cruise in foreign or home waters. During sea terms, the schoolship sailed to ports in the United States, Europe, South America and the West Indies. The ship stayed a short time in each of the ports visited so that the cadets could go on shore and see the countries and their people. During the sea terms, cadets devoted most of their time to practical work such as steering, heaving the lead, and handling boats under oars and sail. Athletics also played an important part in the curriculum. Cadets formed baseball, football, swimming, boxing, and track teams. Team uniforms and gear were provided by the school.|$|E

60|$|I beg, then, {{that it will}} be {{understood}} that I do not by any means inculcate hare-brained recklessness, or a <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> that will foster that state of mind. On the contrary, the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> which I should like to see universally practised would naturally tend to counteract recklessness, for it would enable a boy to judge correctly as to what he could and could not do. Take an illustration. A naturally bold boy has been unwisely trained to be exceedingly careful of himself. He does not know the extent of his own courage, or the power and agility of his own muscles; he knows these things to some extent indeed, but owing to restraint he does not know them fully. Hence he is liable both to over and under estimate them.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis {{is focused on the}} process of aging of cognitive functions, the brain, memory and its division, dementia syndrome, memory <b>training</b> and methods <b>of</b> memory <b>training,</b> the description <b>of</b> the Centre for the Elderly PATUP and <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> memory <b>training.</b> The main objective of the research part was to assess the <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> memory <b>training</b> in this centre at the faculty of Health and Social Studies of the University of South Bohemia. Partial objective 1 was to assess satisfaction of the elderly ? the participants - with the <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> memory <b>training</b> in the Centre for the Elderly PATUP. Partial objective 2 was to assess the <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> memory <b>training</b> from the trainers´ point of view. Partial objective 3 was to assess the <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> memory <b>training</b> in the Centre for the Elderly PATUP from the sponsor?s point of view. Partial objective 4 was to write a manual for memory trainers with a video recording with a sample lesson <b>of</b> the memory <b>training</b> <b>course.</b> To realize the research part of the thesis, qualitative research, the method of questioning, the technique of a semi-conducted interview and a technique of a focus group were applied. The research set consisted of 28 people who were divided according to the research questions in three groups ? memory trainers, the elderly (participants <b>of</b> the memory <b>training</b> <b>courses)</b> and the sponsor of the Centre for the Elderly PATUP. The research results, processed by SWOT analysis, showed clearly strong and weak points <b>of</b> the memory <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> and also showed recommendations from all respondents (the elderly, the trainers and the sponsor) leading to improvements <b>of</b> memory <b>training</b> <b>courses.</b> The thesis will contribute to creating methodology of the Centre for the Elderly PATUP and a methodological manual <b>of</b> MTC (memory <b>training</b> <b>courses).</b> The thesis also contributes to making MTC more efficient and will serve as educational material for memory trainers in the Centre for the Elderly PATUP...|$|R

60|$|Of course, it {{required}} {{a great deal}} of practice and much skill to perform successfully such feats as these; and there were many other branches of the huntsman's art, as practiced in those days, which could only be acquired by a systematic and special <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> One of the most difficult things was to train the horses so that they would advance to meet tigers and other wild beasts without fear. Horses have naturally a strong and instinctive terror for such beasts, and this terror {{it was very difficult to}} overcome. The Mongul huntsmen, however, contrived means to inspire the horses with so much courage in this respect that they would advance to the encounter of these terrible foes with as much ardor as a trained charger shows in advancing to meet other horses and horsemen on the field of battle.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{was aware}} that, {{although}} {{the principle of}} obedience is seldom or never entirely obliterated from the hearts of children--that is, that the impression upon their minds, which, though {{it may not be}} absolutely instinctive, is very early acquired, that it is incumbent on them to obey those set in authority over them, is seldom wholly effaced, the sentiment had become extremely feeble in the minds of Adolphus and Lucia; and that it was like a frail and dying plant, which required very delicate and careful nurture to quicken it to life and give it its normal health and vigor. Her management was precisely of this character. It called the weak and feeble principle into gentle exercise, without putting it to any severe test, and thus commenced the formation of a habit of action. Any one will see that a <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> on these principles, patiently and perseveringly continued for the proper time, could not fail of securing the desired end, except in cases of children characterized by unusual and entirely abnormal perversity.|$|E
60|$|The {{scene of}} this tale is laid {{on an island}} in the Malay Archipelago. Philip Garland, a young animal {{collector}} and trainer, of New York, sets sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities. The vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured by the apes that overrun the place. The lad discovers that the ruling spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with whose instruction he had been especially diligent. The brute recognizes him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master through the same <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> he had himself experienced with a faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey recollection. Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man escapes death. Mr. Prentice has certainly worked a new vein on juvenile fiction, and the ability with which he handles a difficult subject stamps him as a writer of undoubted skill.|$|E
