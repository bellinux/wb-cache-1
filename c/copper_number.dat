In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effect of laundering by detergent containing bleaches on cotton fabrics, two detergents with and without bleaches were used during laundering, and the changes in structures and properties of cotton fabrics were investigated after laundering. The structure of the cotton before and after laundering was evaluated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and field scanning electron microscopy (FSEM). Meanwhile, the tensile strength, <b>copper</b> <b>number</b> and dyeing properties of cotton fabric have been studied for evaluating the chemical damage. The results showed that the damage of fabric laundering by detergents containing bleaches is more serious than that by detergents without bleaches. FTIR and <b>copper</b> <b>number</b> results revealed that the C- 6 hydroxyl groups of the glucose repeating unit of cellulose were oxidized. XRD, FSEM and dyeing results indicated that the cotton fabrics have been damaged during laundering with detergents containing bleaches...|$|E

Some parameters depended on the particle size: O/C ratio and hydroxyl number had local maxima at 315 - 630 μm, while gammasd increased steadily with the decrease of particle size. These relationships were explained by fiber disintegration, destruction of waxy surface layer, exposure of cellulosic components, increase of surface area and crystalline imperfections...|$|E

The process parameters (pH, ozone dose and treatment time) were optimized, and the best whiteness (60 – 62) and quality of bleached fabric was obtained at pH 5, 45 min treatment time and room temperature. A strongly acidic environment and longer ozonation time decreased the quality of fabric by producing a higher <b>copper</b> <b>number</b> (0. 18) and DP loss (51. 5 %). Statistical analysis of the experimental data using analysis of variance confirmed that process parameters significantly affected the bleaching efficiency.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reactivity}} towards cellulose {{of various}} volatile compounds commonly released by paper was studied. Sheets of Whatman No. 1 (W 1) and No. 40 (W 40) {{were exposed to}} various concentrations of these compounds in vapour phase ranging from 20 to 80 ppm in closed vessels for 52 days in controlled ambient conditions, after which they were hygrothermally aged. The measured properties of the paper were <b>copper</b> <b>number,</b> degree of polymerization, zero-span breaking length, pH and yellowness index. The results showed that hydrogen peroxide was the most aggressive among the volatile compounds tested as it severely degraded W 1 cellulose. The exposure of W 1 to formic acid led to significant degradation, designating this volatile organic compound (VOC) as the most reactive toward cellulose among the carboxyl and carbonyl functionalized VOCs tested. On the other hand, acetic acid was found comparatively less reactive. Nitrogen oxides, which were produced up to 3 ppm from a side-reaction of the carboxylic acids with the magnesium nitrate used to control the relative humidity in the closed vessels, appeared to contribute significantly to the degradation despite their low concentration. Antagonistic effects were evidenced in binary vapour mixtures where the presence of aldehydes (formalde-hyde and acetaldehyde) counteracted substantially the degradation induced by the most reactive compounds. It was also shown that acetaldehyde, hexanal and furfural in individual exposures had little to no reactivity.

The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the presence, variations and the fate of lipophilic extractives during all the stages in the dissolving pulp production process. Lipophilic wood extractives which include fatty acids, sterols, hydrocarbons, steroid hydrocarbons and ketones are organic compounds present in the wood and dissolving pulp which are soluble in organic solvents. Their presence in wood and pulp has negative effects on both the pulping process and the quality of the produced dissolving pulp. Comparison of two Eucalyptus species (E. grandis and E. dunnii) at three different sites (Richmond, Umvoti and Ixopo in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa) revealed that lipophilic extractives were higher in E. dunnii than in E. grandis in all the sampled sites and that the woods at the Ixopo site were found to have the highest amount of lipophilic extractives. The quantitative variation of lipophilic extractives in wood was found to be significantly affected by respective sites and tree species. The principal component analysis (PCA) model, which was used to correlate soil parameters and amount of lipophilic extractives in woods per each site, revealed that high amounts of lipophilic extractives were found in trees grown at sites with a high composition of clay soil and organic matter. Thus if the industry is to avoid the high levels of lipophilic extractives in wood, sandy sites should be the choice to grow the trees. Partial least squares (PLS) modelling revealed that sterols and saturated fatty acids significantly influence the quality parameters (Kappa number, viscosity, <b>copper</b> <b>number,</b> cellulose yield and retained carbohydrates) of dissolving pulp, whereas unsaturated fatty acids and unsaturated sterols in particular were found to positively correlate with the Kappa number, thus affecting its measurement.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the application of}} ozone to bleach raw cotton fabric using both laboratory scale set up and pilot plant. The quality of ozone bleached fabric was determined in terms of CIE whiteness, absorbency, degree of polymerisation (DP), <b>copper</b> <b>number</b> (CN) and tendering factor (TF) {{with regard to the}} conventionally bleached fabric (reference material). The application of ozonation process was also extended for color stripping of dyed cotton fabric at laboratory scale. The efficiency of ozone stripping process was measured in terms of lightness (L*), lightness difference (Ã„L*) and total color difference (Ã„E*) with respect to reference (conventionally stripped fabric samples). In case of laboratory scale application of ozone bleaching process, the maximum CIE whiteness (60 - 62) and best quality of bleached fabric was obtained at an ozone dose of 6 g/h, pH 5 and exposure time of 45 min. Strong acidic environment (pH 2 - 3) and exposure time longer than 45 min though marginally improved the degree of whiteness but deteriorated the quality of the fabric as indicated by higher <b>copper</b> <b>number</b> (0. 19) and TF (0. 94). Statistical analysis of experimental data confirmed that process parameters (ozone dose, pH and treatment time) significantly affected the efficiency of ozone bleaching process and pH had the greatest effect on whiteness and DP of bleached fabric followed in turn by ozone dose and treatment time. The dyeing quality of ozone bleached fabric in terms of colour difference (Ã„L*, Ã„a*, Ã„b* and Ã„E*) and wash fastness properties was almost similar to the reference. The ozone bleaching waterbath was also reused several times to bleach multiple lots of raw cotton fabric and results demonstrated that CIE whiteness (60) remained stable even at 20 th reuse of same waterbath. This approach reduced the pollution load of effluent and saved water and chemicals. Since the efficiency of ozone bleaching process at pilot scale was not in parallel with its laboratory scale performance, various additives were used to enhance process efficiency. The best results in terms of whiteness (63. 79), absorbency (10 sec) and strength of bleached fabric were achieved with an addition of 2 g/l of surfactant at optimal process conditions (ozone dose of 50 g/h, pH 5 and ozone treatment time of 45 min). However, other additives (peracetic acid and H 2 O 2) did not show promising results. Dyed ozone bleached fabric samples were a bit lighter (Æ’Â¢L* > 0. 4) than reference. The values of Æ’Â¢L*, Æ’Â¢a* and Æ’Â¢b* showed minor color difference between ozone bleached fabric and reference. However, total color difference values (Æ’Â¢E* = 0. 13. 1. 06) were within acceptable limit (Æ’Â¢E*< 1). Wash fastness properties of ozone bleached fabric were identical to the reference. The whiteness of ozone bleached fabric, however, did not stand firm with increasing storage time due to the presence of aldehyde groups and ozone residues. Among various treatments performed (hot washing at 50. C, rinsing at 80. C, reductive treatment) to avoid the decrease in degree of whiteness of ozone bleached fabric, washing with sodium borohydride was proved {{as one of the best}} treatments for color stability. Ozone color stripping efficiency was a function of pH, ozone dose and treatment time and maximum color stripping was achieved at an ozone dose of 10 g/h, pH 5 and treatment time of 45 min. The stripping efficiency decreased as the % owf of dyed fabric increased from 2 % to 4 % which implied that deceolorization of dyed fabric with higher initial dye concentration required higher ozone dose and/or longer exposure time. The color stripping efficiency of ozone for fabric samples dyed at different shades was almost similar to the reference (conventional stripping method). The ozone bleaching process was proved to be environmentally friendly because it decreases water consumption (no rinsing and neutralizing treatment), it is less energy intensive (applicable at ambient temperature), and reduces effluent load (involves no chemicals) ...|$|E

The electrochemical investigations showed that MPD gives sufficient inhibition against copper corrosion in 3. 5 % NaCl solutions. Potentiodynamic polarization measurements have shown that the MPD inhibit both the cathodic and anodic processes and thus it classified as mixed-type inhibitor. EIS measurements indicate that the values of constant phase elements (CPEs) tend to decrease and both charge-transfer resistance and inhibition efficiency tend to increase by increasing the inhibitor concentration.

40|$|The deoxygenated form of hemocyanin, {{containing}} a dinuclear Cu(I) active site, emits luminescence {{in the red}} with maximum around 1. 54 mu m(- 1) (650 nm). The luminescence of deoxyhemocyanin (deoxy-Hc) from arthropod species is detectable at room temperature, the quantum yield being 2. 4 - 2. 7 X 10 (- 3); in contrast, the emission from molluscan proteins can be detected only at liquid nitrogen temperature. The luminescence emission is an inherent property of the bis[Cu(I) -(histidine) (3) ] complex of the deoxygenated form of the protein to which both Cu(I) ions contribute equally to the overall emission. Luminescence is not observed with the oxygenated and the oxidized forms of hemocyanin, in which the metal is in the Cu(II) state, and in the metal-depleted or apo-Hc form.

50|$|Ever {{since the}} early 17th century a large influx of Japanese merchants entered {{southern}} Vietnam through Hội An as the demand for silver and copper imported by the Nguyễn lords was high {{due to the lack}} of resources present in that region. Nguyễn Phúc Trăn requested several tmes to import a huge <b>number</b> <b>copper</b> coinage to Southern Vietnam as the Trịnh-Nguyễn War caused them to use a lot of copper for creating canons, the Nguyễn ran out of the resource. As Japanese merchants had been exporting banned low-quality “Bitasen” coins for high profits (as a string of coins would ony get 1 tael of silver in Japan while it would get 10,5 in Vietnam) the export of copper coins proved to profitable to continue denying this request and finally in 1659 Nagasaki trade coins were cast for the Vietnamese and the Dutch East India Company (which also sold Nagasaki trade coins on the Vietnamese market, and exported them to Europe through the Netherlands).|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to investigate the effect of copper (Cu) levels in irrigation water on the growth and production of rice variety IR 64. The experiment was arranged in randomized complete block design with six replications. The Cu treatments were: 0, 300, 600 and 900 mg Cu L- 1 of irrigation water. The results showed that Cu content significantly decreased rice growth and production. Copper level of 600 mg L- 1 decreased plant height, tiller number and leaf <b>number.</b> <b>Copper</b> level of 300 mg L- 1 decreased panicle length, number of grains per panicle, empty grain weight, 100 grains weight, milled grain weight, and shoot dry weight. This experiment implies that remediation treatments should be considered when Cu level in irrigation water was more than 300 mg Cu L- 1. Copper level of 300 mg L- 1 {{could be used as}} a critical level for rice screening for Cu tolerant varieties in the plant breeding program...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCopper {{content in}} grape and wine from 16 wine-farms in Italy was studied during {{the harvest of}} 2003. The {{influence}} of number of applications, days between last application and harvest and total copper applied was studied. Of {{the total number of}} grape and wine samples analysed, 13 % and respectively 18 % exceeded the MRL. Total <b>copper</b> applied and <b>number</b> of days between the last application and harvest were the two factors that best explained the concentration of copper in grape (r= 0. 66). In order to decrease the probability of copper residue close to MRL, the time after last application and harvest should be more than 40 days if the dose exceeds 3. 1 kg/ha. Furthermore, copper content in grape and wine does not depend on the pest strategy of the farm (conventional, integrated and organic). More important factors ultimately influencing the copper residual level may be that the applications are made depending on the prediction of out-brake of the disease rather than the followed pest strategy. No difference in copper content between red and white grape and wine was noted...|$|R
