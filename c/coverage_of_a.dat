5|$|It was in Brockville {{that the}} 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, CFJR, a local radio station, hired {{him as a}} member of its news department; many of his stories, {{including}} his <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local train wreck, were picked up by the CBC. By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH-TV, then a new television station in Ottawa. When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for Vue, a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen, a dance show similar to American Bandstand.|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} of Chandra Levy {{became a national}} topic {{of the news media}} in the summer of 2001, with 63 percent of Americans closely following the case. The media swamped Levy's parents from the moment they decided to go to Washington, D.C. in search of their daughter. According to Condit, there were about a hundred reporters camped out in front of his apartment during the morning of September 11, 2001, but they all left after news spread about that day's terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Media critics and cable news executives later cited the Levy case, as well as the concurrent sensationalist <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> string of shark attacks, as a reflection of the manner of news coverage in the United States before the September 11 attacks had taken priority.|$|E
5|$|The first live <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Belgian {{sporting}} event occurred on 3May 1931, when journalist Gust De Muynck commentated {{on the football}} game between Belgium and the Netherlands on radio. Later, football broadcasts were also televised. As 60 per cent of Belgians speak Dutch and 40 per cent French, commentaries for the national team matches are provided in both languages. The games are not broadcast in German—Belgium's third official language. During Belgium's tournament appearances in the 1980s and the early 1990s, Rik De Saedeleer crowned himself the nation's most famous football commentator with his emotional and humorous reports.|$|E

5|$|After dark, the 48th Battalion {{took over}} the line from the {{remainder}} of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, desultory artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two companies could make out German infantry advancing through the fog. They approached without the <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles slung. The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and with a little more fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two days passed relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies through the front line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March.|$|E

SFTF responded by an official letter to the government questioning why the pilots were represented in the commission, as this could pose a potential conflict of interest. Both parties were criticized for speculating about the cause of the accident before the conclusion of the commission.|$|E

25|$|But on July 11, 1966, CBS preempted Password {{in favor}} of CBS News' live <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> press conference held by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara on the {{progress}} of the Vietnam War. Because the other two networks did not grant their news divisions anywhere near the power that CBS did in making programming decisions, they went ahead with their regular schedules instead of the conference. A new show beginning that day on ABC—The Newlywed Game—caused some frustrated Password fans to begin defecting immediately; NBC also benefited from the CBS programming decision, experiencing success with their recently launched soap opera Days of Our Lives.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} often arise {{in relation to}} investment banks' equity research units, which have long {{been part of the}} industry. A common practice is for equity analysts to initiate <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> company in order to develop relationships that lead to highly profitable investment banking business. In the 1990s, many equity researchers allegedly traded positive stock ratings for investment banking business. Alternatively, companies may threaten to divert investment banking business to competitors unless their stock was rated favorably. Laws were passed to criminalize such acts, and increased pressure from regulators and a series of lawsuits, settlements, and prosecutions curbed this business to a large extent following the 2001 stock market tumble after the dot-com bubble.|$|E

30|$|The {{basic idea}} <b>of</b> the <b>coverage</b> {{adjustment}} scheme {{is to compare}} the number of estimated positions {{with the number of}} registered identifications within the <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> identification sensor. If the approximated radius <b>of</b> <b>an</b> identification sensor is accurate enough, the number of the estimated positions is mostly equivalent to the number of the registered identifications. Otherwise, it means that the approximated coverage differs from the actual <b>coverage.</b> The radius <b>of</b> <b>an</b> identification sensor is adjusted by checking the difference between them. In some cases, the system needs to check the farthest or closet estimated position from the center <b>of</b> <b>an</b> identification sensor. For example, when the number of the estimated positions is equivalent to the number of the registered identifications, the <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> identification should be adjust to the farthest estimated position. Then, the problem in the coverage adjustment scheme is to determine how degree the radius is adjusted by at each sampling time. Since the <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> identification sensor can vary temporally, the large change of the radius may cause a reverse effect and the association performance may degenerate. Thus, we use the average speed of tracked objects measured by the association system as the degree of the radius adjustment to be unsusceptible to the object dynamics.|$|R
