40|$|The {{economic}} crisis spread in 2008 {{through the world}} and reached Serbia, rendered the repayment of banking loans indexed in foreign currencies, mostly in CHF at the time, even more difficult. The growing number of non-performing loans inevitably led {{to an increase in}} number of the court proceedings in which the debtors made attempts to have the loan contracts declared null and void. In these proceedings, the courts needed to take a stand on some typical clauses in loan contracts and on some banking practices that the debtors considered to be contrary to the principle of good faith, which, before the crisis, was hardly ever given judicial epilogue. In the majority of cases, two types of clauses proved to be unlawful: a clause establishing a right of the bank to subsequently, i. e. after the formation of the contract, and unilaterally, i. e. without a specific consent of the debtor, change (regularly increase) the interest rate {{for the remainder of the}} credit period; and a clause establishing the right of the bank to apply different exchange rates, i. e. the buying rate to the disbursement of the loan, and the selling rate to the value of credit installments. These clauses certainly existed even before the crisis, but the difficulties in performing the loans caused by the crisis was the social propelling force that brought these cases within the sight of the judiciary. In this paper the author analyzes the reaction of courts, and subsequently that of the legislator, to the clause in loan contracts entitling the bank to unilaterally increase the variable interest rate after the formation of contract. The application of this clause was usually conditioned on significant changes in international financial markets or changes in the costs of the sources of financing, while in some cases the conditions of the application of the clause were simply changes in the business policy of the bank or the need to operate with profit. In any case, these are circumstances which the debtor could not influence. In most cases the bank could have influenced these circumstance or at least taken them into consideration at the time of the formation of contract. If not, they still fall within the bank's sphere of control or the bank bears the risk of their occurrence. The uniform approach of the courts, both in respect to credit contracts in which the debtor is a consumer, and contracts in which the debtor does not qualify as consumer, is that these clauses in loan contracts are null and void, since they are contrary to principles of good faith and equal value of reciprocal obligations, on the one hand, and make the object of the contract unascertainable, on the other. The courts, however, hardly ever declare the <b>contract</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> in its entirety, but rather apply the rules on partial invalidity. Until the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Financial Services Consumers in 2011, the courts could render their decisions based only on the rules of general contract law pursuant to the Law on Obligations from 1978. The Law on the Protection of Financial Services Consumers explicitly forbids the modification of variable interest rate due to changes in the business policy or internal acts of the bank and prescribes that only officially published data or criteria may be used as variable elements of the interest rate. By this means, stipulating the right of the bank to subsequently, unilaterally and, in fact, freely increase the interest rate, a practice frequently applied in cases in which it was not economically justified, became statutorily forbidden...|$|E

Similarly, if he made a vow to enter a particular religious institute or become a priest, but instead entered a different institute or decided to marry, the religious profession or the marriage, despite being a violation of his vow, was still considered valid.

40|$|Gharar (excessive risk or uncertainty) is {{prohibited}} in Islam and {{its presence in}} financial contracts makes these <b>contracts</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> The prohibition of gharar can also extend to investing in stocks. Very few studies have investigated how gharar affects stocks in investing. Consequently, very few studies suggest tactics and strategies that can be employed for gharar reduction {{in the case of}} stock investing. The thesis attempts to investigate the topic of gharar in terms of stock investing. The thesis is far from developing a theory of gharar in terms of stock investing, however it is an attempt to establish the foundation for rationalising and understanding gharar in terms of stock investing. For this purpose, the thesis employs qualitative analysis, and depends on different types of secondary sources of information. The thesis extensively interprets and presents findings, and analyses the data derived from scholarly writings on the topic of gharar, which can be found in journal articles, books and several conference papers. The thesis also examines a sample of the screening criteria of Islamic Equity Funds (IEFs), since it is the only indicator explaining the guidelines Muslims pursue when tending to invest in stocks. In this regard, the sampling strategy employed is Critical Case Sampling. The thesis examined all Islamic Equity Indexes and a number of the major Islamic Equity Funds. It has been found that the screening criteria of Islamic Equity Funds is limited to two matters: (1) excluding firms that are associated with impermissible activities and operations e. g. financial services firms and casinos, and (2) excluding firms highly involved with interest-rate based transactions. Despite the fact that screening criteria of Islamic Equity funds are supposed to be strictly derived from the basic tenets of Islamic law, thus far, gharar is excluded from these screens. For the purpose of incorporating gharar into the screening criteria of Islamic Equity Funds, the thesis first suggests a definition of gharar in terms of stock investing, which is based on the commonalties found in the different interpretations of Muslim scholars of gharar. Muslims need to focus on avoidable (controllable) risk in a proper manner, and attempt not to rely on pure chance in achieving the desired profit or return. Secondly, the thesis suggests a number of conventional strategies for risk reduction that can be successfully used for gharar reduction. Thirdly, the thesis explores the different conventional stock valuation models e. g. Value Investing, Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Derivatives. It has been observed that the different types of derivatives in Islam are prohibited for several reasons. Several tactics and ratios derived from Value Investing and MPT can be successfully used to for gharar reduction purposes. In regards to Value Investing, the following ratios and tactics can be used for gharar reduction: different Multiple ratios, long-term investing, intrinsic value and fundamental analysis. Two main issues can be beneficially derived from MPT: the portfolio approach and beta ratio. However, note that several modifications have been performed on these suggested ratios and tactics in order to comply with the basic tenets of Islamic contract law. Last but not the least, both the Value Investing and MPT fall short of assessing any non-financial but nevertheless fundamental activities of the firm...|$|R
