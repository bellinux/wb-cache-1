The purpose of this in-vivo study was to evaluate the histopathological inflammatory reaction incited by four different kinds of <b>catgut</b> <b>suture</b> materials. Materials and methods: Twenty five adult New Zealand White rabbits, weighing approximately 2 - 3 kg, were divided into 5 groups of 5 rabbits in each group. Four types of catgut sutures were implanted in the dorsum and thigh muscles. After 2, 7, 14, 21 and 60 days, the animals were sacrificed and the sutures, subcutaneous and muscle tissues were removed from the implanted areas. Results: Statistical analysis for comparison of each two suture materials showed significant differences between groups (p< 0. 05) while ETHICON suture showed minimum inflammatory reaction and was considered the best.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the histopathologic {{reaction}} of four suturing materials: silk, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyglycolic acid, and catgut in the oral mucosa of albino rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The twenty-one male mature albino rabbits which were used in this study were randomly divided into three groups of seven each. Silk, PVDF, polyglycolic acid and <b>catgut</b> <b>suture</b> materials were tested in the oral mucosa of these animals. The animals were sacrificed 2, 4, and 7 days after suturing. Two pathologists evaluated the samples by determining the presence and level of inflammation, granulation tissue, and fibrosis formation. Data were statistically analyzed by Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Histological features of the samples showed that PVDF and plain <b>catgut</b> <b>suture</b> materials produced more fibrous tissue (favorable response) on the fourth day in comparison with silk suture (P= 0. 02). Also, in the 7 -day samples PVDF sutures produced the mildest inflammation when compared with the silk sutures (P= 0. 015). CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, it can be convey that PVDF suture materials created mild tissue reactions and can be a reasonable candidate for suturing oral tissues...|$|E

Initially chromic <b>catgut</b> <b>suture</b> was used for the anastomosis in 96 patients with ten complications developing (10. 4 %). Because of the high incidence of anastomotic leakage (8. 3 %) with chromic <b>catgut</b> <b>suture,</b> the next 101 pyeloureterostomies were constructed using 7 - 0 Tevdek. Although urinary leakage occurred in only five of these patients (4. 9 %), late stone formation occurred along the suture material in three patients (2. 9 %), influencing the conversion to 7 - 0 Prolene for this anastomosis. With this suture material, only two complications have occurred in 63 subsequent pyeloureterostomies (3. 1 %), neither related to the anastomosis. In comparison, eight complications developed in 111 patients who underwent reconstruction with the Politano-Leadbetter method of ureteroneocystostomy (7. 2 %).

Therefore, he combined it with a traditional ear pinning method by pulling the upper and middle (conchal) third of the ear towards the head with sutures that were anchored in the ear cartilage and periosteum of the mastoid. This corresponds to the conventional Furnas Method.He also sometimes combined with a technique of the traditional methods for correcting protruding earlobes, by opening the back of the earlobe and removing soft tissue from it.

The rats were categorized into 2 groups, as control group (n= 24) and streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic group (n= 24). For each group, incision wounds were created on the inner cheeck mucosa of the animals and wounds were closed primarily with three different types of sutures. These materials were sized 3 - 0 monocryl (polyglecaprone 25), silk and catgut sutures swaged on. Excisional biopsies were performed at 2 nd, 7 th, 14 th and 21 st day (2 rats per day) from the initial surgical procedure. Effects of these suture materials on wound healing and NOS (nitric oxide synthase) activities were compared immunohistochemically in the study. eNOS and iNOS (Endothelial and induced nitric oxide synthase) activities were classified as mild (+), moderate (++) and severe (+++). Results: Mild eNOS activities were seen in both diabetic and control groups at 2 nd day specimens. Activities of silk and catgut were similar both in diabetic and control groups at 14 th day, this activity in monocryl was mild. 21 st day specimens revealed that monocryl has mild eNOS activity than silk and catgut sutures. iNOS activities in diabetic group were greater than control groups and the degrees of the activity in monocryl, silk and catgut sutures were mild, severe and moderate at the 7 th day. At the 14 th day there was no iNOS activity in diabetic monocryl group. Conclusion: All of the materials have the potential capacity to be well tolerated however monocryl seemed to have more benefical effects on wound healing in diabetic subjects...|$|E

METHODS: The rats (n= 23) were divided into three groups: sham (SG/n= 8), without intervention; stretching (STCG/n= 8), treated with static stretching; and neural mobilization (NMG/n= 7), treated with neural mobilization. The animals underwent an experimental model of sciatica by compression of the right ischiatic nerve with <b>catgut</b> <b>suture</b> thread. There were five consecutive sessions of treatment that began {{on the third day}} after lesion. The pain caused by the sciatica was evaluated by a functional incapacitation test that measured paw elevation time (PET), and values over 10 s were indicative of pain. PET was measured at the following moments: before the lesion (M 1), immediately before (M 2) and after the first session (M 3), immediately after the last session (M 4) and 24 h after the last session (M 5). ANOVA was applied with repeated measures and unrepeated measures for intra- and inter-group comparison, respectively. RESULTS: In the SG, post-lesion PETs were greater than M 1 (p< 0. 001), suggesting persistence of pain. In the STCG, post-lesion PETs were greater than M 1 (p< 0. 001), but lower when comparing M 3 vs. M 4 (p< 0. 05) and M 3 vs. M 5 (p< 0. 01) suggesting {{the effectiveness of}} the treatment.

40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsPeripheral neuropathic pain is {{described}} as a pain state caused by an injury or dysfunction of the nervous system, and could have clinical manifestations such as hyperalgesia, allodynia and spontaneous pain. The development of neuropathic pain may depend on long-term forms of neuronal plasticity in the spinal cord (SC). Expression of the immediate early gene proteins (IEGPs) Arc, Zif 268, and c-Fos are implicated in establishment of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by conditioning stimulation (CS) of primary afferent fibres. However, the impact of the neuropathic state (Bennett's model) on CS-induced expression of IEGPs has not been studied. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the levels of Arc, c-Fos and Zif 268 immunoreactivity prior to and after conditioning stimulation in animals with developed neuropathic pain, with sham operated, non-ligated controls. MethodsTwenty-four animals were divided equally into the neuropathic and non-neuropathic groups. Neuropathic pain was induced in all animals by conducting a loose ligation of the sciatic nerve with Chromic <b>Catgut</b> 4. 0 <b>sutures</b> 7 days prior to conditioning stimulation or sham operation. The loose ligation was performed by placing sutures around the sciatic nerve compressing the nerve slightly just enough to reduce but not completely diminish the perineural circulation. A state of neuropathy was confirmed by a significant decrease in mechanical withdrawal threshold measured by von Frey's fibres. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on transverse sections obtained from the L 3 –L 5 segments of the SC at 2 and 6 h post-CS and IEGP positive cells were counted in lamina I and II of the dorsal horn. During statistical analyses, the groups were compared by means of analysis of variance (univariate general linear model). If significant differences were found, each set of animals was compared with the sham group with post hoc Tukey's multiple comparison test. ResultsStrikingly, all IEGPs exhibited a significant increase in immunoreactivity at both time points compared to time-matched, sham operated controls. Maximal IEGP expression was found 2 h after CS in neuropathic rats, and there was a smaller but still significant increase 6 h after CS. The unstimulated side of the dorsal horn in stimulated animals did not show any significant change of the number of IEGP positive cells and was approximately at the same level as sham operated animals. The number of IEGP positive cells in sham operated controls (non-neuropathic and non-stimulated animals) showed same immunoreactivity in 2 and 6 h post sham operation. Conclusions and implicationsThe neurophysiological process of neuropathic pain development is complex and needs to be studied further in order to clarify its nature and components. This present study is meant to reveal a step towards further understanding the role of Arc, c-Fos and Zif 268 in neuropathic pain. Moreover, this study might contribute to the knowledge base for further research on better therapeutic possibilities for neuropathic pain...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{describe}} an alternative method of treatment of prolapsed rectum in the sows. This approach was used to treat rectal prolapse in four affected sows. A 23. 5 cm long Gerlach’s needle was used for sewing a circular suture {{around the base of}} prolapsed rectum. The horizontal U-suture was performed with a synthetic absorbable surgical fibre. Two fibres 25 – 30 cm long were placed into the needle eye, the needle was inserted under finger control into the rectal lumen and the prolapsed tissue was penetrated from the inside to the outside. Both ends of the first fibre were grasped by haemostatic forceps and fixed for the last stitch and the inner end of the second fibre was placed into the needle eye with the third fibre. Rectal tissue was penetrated in the same manner at the distance of 2 – 3 cm from the place of the first penetration. The first U-stitch was made by tying both ends of the second fibre after the needle removal. The inner end of the third fibre was placed into the needle eye with the fourth fibre and the procedure was repeated around the whole prolapse until the first fibre was reached and used for the last stitch. The prolapsed tissue was excised by a blade at the distance of approximately 2 cm from the suture. There was no haemorrhage due to ligation of the tissue. After placing the simple continuous <b>catgut</b> <b>suture</b> around the rectum, a spontaneous retraction of the stump occurred, and the purse-string suture was not required. This method is applicable in practice in sows suffering from large, oedematous and hard prolapse when simple reposition or use of another surgical correction is impossible. In addition, the method may be used also in other large animal species...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Coloboma is a Greek word, which {{describes}} the defect of all {{layers of the}} organ, {{and it can be}} congenital or as the result of an injury, operation, or some disease. Congenital upper eyelid coloboma is a rare anomaly, with the unknown incidence. The size of the defect is different, but it always involves all layers of the eyelid. This malformation is more frequent at the upper eyelid, and unilaterally, at the junction of the medial two thirds. Sometimes, it can also involve the eye, and may be a component of many syndromes (Goldenhar, Fraser, Manitoba, CHARGE, Cat eye). Case report. We are describing the case of the upper eyelid coloboma with the rare eyebrow anomaly at the three-month old girl, and the result of reconstruction. The baby was treated conservatively with lubricants and overnight patching. Pentagonal excision of the defect was performed in general anesthesia. Three layers of the eyelid were prepared: the skin, muscle and tarsoconjunctival layer. Because of orbicularis muscle malposition, reinsertion and reposition of the muscle fibres were performed. Then, lateral canthotomy was made and the suture of three layers of the eyelid. <b>Catgut</b> <b>suture</b> 7 - 0 was used for the conjunctiva and muscle. Nylon 6 - 0 was used for skin suture. Z-plasty was done on {{the upper part of the}} pentagonal excision in order to reduce skin tension at the suture line. The operation lasted about 60 minutes and the hospitalization three days. The occlusive dressing was applied for two days. The stitches were removed after seven days. The postoperative swelling of the upper and lower eyelid disappeared in five days. There were no complications in the postoperative period. Conclusion. The main principle of the treatment of eyelid coloboma is surgical reconstruction of all layers of the eyelid, in optimal period, using different surgical methods, which depends on the size of the defect. An early diagnosis is of the greatest importance, as well as the treatment of associated anomalies. Complications of the upper eyelid coloboma depend on the size of the defect, presence of the eye anomalies and the method of reconstruction...|$|E
