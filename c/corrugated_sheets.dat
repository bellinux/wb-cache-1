40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} is to analyze {{the performance of the}} Laminar Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger. The test samples were divided two groups, one is the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> with heat pipe, and the other is the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> only. By dipping these two group samples into hot water and to see the thermal image by Infrared thermal imager. The results shown the temperature risen of the sheet with heat pipe was faster than that of the sheet without heat pipe. In addition, the bigger of the temperature difference between hot water temperature and ambient temperature, the quicker of the temperature risen for the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet,</b> and the temperature of the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> were homogenous as well. For example, when the water temperature is 30 ℃, ambient temperature is 20 ℃, the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> with heat pipe rise rapidly to 26 ℃ within 1 minute, while the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> without heat pipe rise to 22 ℃ only, this temperature difference would be more obvious with the increasing of the hot water temperature. When the hot water temperature is up to 40 ℃, the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> with heat pipe rise rapidly to 31 ℃ within 1 minute, while the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> without het pipe is still rise up to 22 ℃ only. When the hot water temperature is up to 50 ℃, The metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> with heat pipe rise rapidly to 33 ℃ within 1 minute, while the sheet without heat pipe still keep at 22 ℃, the results shown the heat pipe affect the temperature rising speed is obvious, and it also implying heat pipe is a very important parameter for the heat transfer rate of the Laminar Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger...|$|R

40|$|The cooling {{tubes of}} both the {{aircraft}} have failed by fatigue.

After initiation, the cracks have propagated along the weld interface in the circumferential direction. There were no metallurgical abnormalities responsible for the fatigue crack initiation and fatigue appears to be stress related. The nature of fatigue striations suggests that the fatigue was of high cycle-low stress type. Shifting of the position of the mating fracture surfaces in the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> indicates that assembly and/or fabrication stresses could be the most probable reason for the fatigue crack initiation...|$|R
50|$|The ANT-20 was {{designed}} by Andrei Tupolev, using all-metal airframe technology devised by German engineer Hugo Junkers during the World War I years, as the largest-ever aircraft to use Junkers' original all-metal aircraft design techniques from 1918, being constructed between 4 July 1933 and 3 April 1934. It {{was one of two}} aircraft of its kind built by the Soviets. The aircraft was named after Maksim Gorki and dedicated to the 40th anniversary of his literary and public activities. The ANT-20 was the largest known aircraft to have used the Junkers aviation firm's late-World War I-devised design philosophy of <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal for many of the airframe's key components, especially the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal skinning of the airframe.|$|R

40|$|In {{practical}} engineering, {{the container}} building usually has an opening and stiffening process {{to meet the}} requirements of architectural design. So, the stiffness of the container with holes has been studied and stiffening member has been considered in the process of container stiffness enhancement. First, based on the paper “Theoretical and experimental studies on in-plane stiffness of integrated container structure,” the stiffness of <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> with window, door, and combined window has been derived and then the stiffness of <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> with above-mentioned holes has been derived. Thus, through stiffness distribution between frame and <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet,</b> the stiffness of container with holes has been derived. Second, through finite element software of Abaqus, full-size container model with holes has been established and combined with stiffening members. Through simulation, the load–displacement curve has been got and then compared with theoretical analysis. Finally, through full-size 20 - and 40 -ft containers with holes and stiffening members, corresponding experimental verification has been done, and by comparison of load–displacement curve with theoretical analysis and finite element simulation, the front study has been verified. Research result has made feasible in design and construction of container building and provided some references to corresponding specification preparation...|$|R

50|$|A {{limitation}} of common corrugated material {{has been the}} difficulty in applying fine graphic print for informative and marketing purposes.

Due to these characteristics of corrugated, it has been mainly printed using a flexographic process, which is by nature a coarse application with loose registration properties.|$|E
