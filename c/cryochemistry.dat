It overlaps with many other sciences, including chemistry, cryobiology, condensed matter physics, and even astrochemistry. <b>Cryochemistry</b> has been a topic of interest since liquid nitrogen, which freezes at −210°C, became commonly available. Cryogenic-temperature chemical interactions are an important mechanism for studying the detailed pathways of chemical reactions by reducing the confusion introduced by thermal fluctuations. <b>Cryochemistry</b> forms the foundation for cryobiology, which uses slowed or stopped biological processes for medical and research purposes.|$|E

It produced papers on the evolution, spectral properties and composition of organic matter in comets, interplanetary dust and asteroids. The second part covered <b>cryochemistry</b> and exobiology in planetary atmospheres (gas giant planets and their satellites) and in various astronomical ices...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of unusual compounds by techniques employing cryogenic cooling to retard their very extreme reactivity was investigated. Examples of such species that were studied are diimide (N 2 H 2), cyclobutadiene (C 4 H 4), cyclopropanone (C 3 H 4 O), oxirene (C 2 H 2 O), and many others. Special purpose cryogenically cooled inlet arrangements were designed {{such that the}} analyses incurred no warm-up of the cold, and frequently explosively unstable, compounds. Controlled energy electron impact techniques were used to measure critical potentials and to develop the molecular energetics and thermodynamics of these molecules and to gain some insight into their kinetic characteristics as well. Three and four carbon strained ring molecules were studied. Several reactions of oxygen and hydrogen atoms with simple molecules of H, N, C, and O in hard quench configurations were studied. And the quench stabilization of BH 3 was explored as a model system in <b>cryochemistry...</b>|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{chemical}} reactivity at ultracold conditions, thus enabling molecular syntheses via interstellar and atmospheric processes, {{is a key}} issue in <b>cryochemistry.</b> In particular, acid dissociation and proton transfer reactions are ubiquitous in aqueous microsolvation environments. Here, the full dissociation of a HCl molecule upon stepwise solvation by {{a small number of}} water molecules at low temperatures, as relevant to helium nanodroplet isolation (HENDI) spectroscopy, is analyzed in mechanistic detail. It is found that upon successive aggregation of HCl with H 2 O molecules, a series of cyclic heteromolecular structures, up to and including HCl(H 2 O) 3, are initially obtained before a precursor state for dissociation, HCl(H 2 O) 3 &# 183;&# 183;&# 183;H 2 O, is observed upon addition of a fourth water molecule. The latter partially aggregated structure can be viewed as an &# 8220;activated species&# 8221;, which readily leads to dissociation of HCl and to the formation of a solvent-shared ion pair, H 3 O + (H 2 O) 3 Cl &# 8722;. Overall, the process is mostly downhill in potential energy, and, in addition, small remaining barriers are overcome by using kinetic energy released as a result of forming hydrogen bonds due to aggregation. The associated barrier is not ruled by thermal equilibrium but is generated by athermal non-equilibrium dynamics. These &# 8220;aggregation-induced chemical reactions&# 8221; are expected to be of broad relevance to chemistry at ultralow temperature much beyond HENDI spectroscopy...|$|E
