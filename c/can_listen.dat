5|$|Radio Royal is the {{hospital}} radio {{service for the}} Forth Valley, broadcasting from studios at the Forth Valley Royal Hospital. It operates two radio stations, Radio Royal and Royal 2, 24 hours a day seven days a week, staffed {{by a team of}} around 50 volunteers. Founded in 1976, it originally broadcast from the old Royal Scottish National Hospital in Larbert. It was latterly based at Falkirk Royal Infirmary, before returning to Larbert on the opening of Forth Valley Royal. Radio Royal can be heard in the Forth Valley Royal Hospital restaurant, clinic waiting areas and refuge points. In-patients <b>can</b> <b>listen</b> via their bedside entertainment units on Freeview channels 8, 800 or 603. Radio Royal is available on the internet via www.radioroyal.org and through the Radio Royal App, available to download for free for Apple and Android devices.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver <b>can</b> <b>listen</b> for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
