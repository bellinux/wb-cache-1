40|$|This paper tests whether <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets</b> (both {{exchange-traded}} and non-exchange-traded) {{are integrated}} with stock markets using multifactor asset pricing models. The {{results support the}} hypothesis that the <b>market</b> for exchange-traded <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> companies, including REITs, is integrated with the market for exchange-traded (non-real-estate) stocks. Moreover, the degree of integration has significantly increased during the 1990 s. However, when appraisal-based returns (adjusted for smoothing) are used to construct <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> portfolio returns, the results fail to support the integration hypothesis, although this may reflect the inability of these estimated private market returns to accurately proxy for <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> returns.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 The recent {{development}} experience of modern economies demonstrates the increasing role and impacts of financial activities on {{regional and national}} economic systems, effects which remain largely overlooked by current theory and empirical work. This dissertation contributes to this gap in knowledge by addressing the geographical flow of capital into <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets.</b> Three main research questions are addressed: (1) does capital flow freely over space into <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets</b> in accordance with neo-classical expectations of market equilibrium or is the flow spatially uneven? (2) how and why have spatial patterns of capital flows changed over time, and (3) {{what are the implications}} of these changing spatial on local <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets</b> and regional economies? To answer these questions, the dissertation develops a theoretical framework to describe the decisions made by investors in their allocation of funds to particular places. This framework begins with a neo-classical process driven by spatial differences in rates of return on assets. Then, additional components are added which modify this simple process, including barriers and costs of distance, management of risk and uncertainty, organizational characteristics, industry specific factors and norms, path dependence, serendipity, and shocks and long-term structural change. Spatial outcomes are then tested empirically through analysis of investment behaviors by institutional, <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investment trusts (REITs), and foreign investors in the US over the 1980 to 1996 period. This evidence shows a high degree of spatial differentiation amongst these players in their investment and also demonstrates a dispersal of capital to smaller metropolitan areas. In addition, there is a convergence of capitalization rates across regions. Empirical work in Stockholm Sweden illustrates the dramatic effects of a regulatory barrier on local property markets and the regional and national financial system in addition to the channeled flow of investment, particularly to central London, when these barriers were suddenly removed. The dissertation concludes that structural change and shocks have led to the dispersal of capital across places, yet there is no end to geography, as changes in individual and organizational behavior and increasing financial complexity will never allow a state of spatial equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Price indices for <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets</b> are {{difficult}} to construct because assets are heterogeneous, they are spatially dispersed and they are infrequently traded. Appraisal-based indices are one response to these problems, but may understate volatility or fail to capture turning points in a timely manner. This paper estimates “transaction linked indices” for major European markets to see whether these offer a different perspective on market performance. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The assessed value method is used to construct the indices. This has been recently applied to <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> datasets in the USA and UK. The underlying data comprise appraisals and sale prices for assets monitored by Investment Property Databank (IPD). The indices are compared to appraisal-based series for the countries concerned for Q 4 2001 to Q 4 2012. Findings – Transaction linked indices show stronger growth and sharper declines {{over the course of}} the cycle, but they do not notably lead their appraisal-based counterparts. They are typically two to four times more volatile. Research limitations/implications – Only country-level indicators can be constructed in many cases owing to low trading volumes in the period studied, and this same issue prevented sample selection bias from being analysed in depth. Originality/value – Discussion of the utility of transaction-based price indicators is extended to European <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets.</b> The indicators offer alternative estimates of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>market</b> volatility that may be useful in asset allocation and risk modelling, including in a regulatory context...|$|R
