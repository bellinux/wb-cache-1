5|$|Barbera's {{first foray}} into {{television}} was a 1957 collaboration with Robert D. Buchanan, Colonel Bleep. The series, the first ever cartoon produced specifically for color television, would feature some of the futuristic designs and limited animation Barbera would later <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his other television productions. Barbera's involvement in Colonel Bleep (and with Buchanan) was apparently short-lived; his only known credited involvement was a creator credit.|$|E

5|$|The next title, Tomb Raider Chronicles, {{depicted}} the late Lara Croft via her friends' flashbacks. The game introduced stealth attacks, which would <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the next game, Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness. While the original development team worked on Chronicles, Core Design assigned {{a new team}} to develop Angel of Darkness for the PlayStation 2. Anticipating innovative changes from next generation consoles, Adrian Smith—co-founder of Core Design—wanted to reinvent the character {{to keep pace with}} the updated technology. Core Design conducted market research, including fan polls, to aid in Angel of Darknesss development. The development team felt it could not alter the character and instead opted to place her in a situation different from previous games. The PlayStation 2 hardware allowed for more manoeuvres and a more detailed character model; the number of polygons in Croft's model increased to 4,400. The team sought to add more melee manoeuvres to better match Lara Croft's portrayal as an expert fighter in her backstory. Movement control was switched from the directional pad to the analogue control stick to provide more precision. After the original team finished Chronicles, it joined the development of Angel of Darkness. Excess content, missed production deadlines, and Eidos's desire to time the game's launch to coincide with the release of the 2003 Tomb Raider film resulted in a poorly designed game; Croft was brought back to life without explanation and the character controls lacked precision.|$|E

25|$|The {{champion}} {{rolled the}} dice {{and attempted to}} remove the digits 1 through 9 from the board, with a large prize awarded for clearing them all. A larger gameboard was used, except on the 1978–80 series, which used the same board as the main game. Insurance markers were awarded for doubles, giving the contestant the opportunity to continue playing after making a bad roll. These markers did not <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the main game.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} can fly or drive through power-ups to collect them. These include rings that charge up the vehicle's shields, Smart Bombs, laser upgrades, wing repairs, and extra lives. Most stages also contain {{at least three}} gold rings - {{collecting}} three of these increases the vehicle's maximum shield level. If the player successfully collects three additional gold rings in the same stage, an extra life is awarded. Aside from the maximum shield boost, all power-ups <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the next stage. If the player runs out of lives, the game is over.|$|E

25|$|Zopiclone causes {{impaired}} driving skills {{similar to}} those of benzodiazepines. Long-term users of hypnotic drugs for sleep disorders develop only partial tolerance to adverse effects on driving with users of hypnotic drugs even after 1 year of use still showing an increased motor vehicle accident rate. Patients who drive motor vehicles should not take zopiclone unless they stop driving due to a significant increased risk of accidents in zopiclone users. Zopiclone induces impairment of psychomotor function. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided after taking zopiclone as effects can <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the next day, including impaired hand eye coordination.|$|E
25|$|In Henkin semantics, each sort of second-order {{variable}} has {{a particular}} domain of its own to range over, which may be a proper subset of all sets or functions of that sort. Leon Henkin (1950) defined these semantics and proved that Gödel's completeness theorem and compactness theorem, which hold for first-order logic, <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> second-order logic with Henkin semantics. This is because Henkin semantics are almost identical to many-sorted first-order semantics, where additional sorts of variables are added to simulate the new variables of second-order logic. Second-order logic with Henkin semantics is not more expressive than first-order logic. Henkin semantics are commonly {{used in the study}} of second-order arithmetic.|$|E

25|$|At UEFA Euro 2008, players may be {{suspended}} from playing in subsequent matches upon {{the collection of}} {{a certain number of}} yellow or red cards. If a player is shown a red card – whether as a result of two bookable offences or a straight red – that player is suspended from playing in his team's next match. If his team is eliminated from the competition before the end of his suspension, the games <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. A player is also suspended for one match for picking up two yellow cards in separate matches. However, any yellow cards accumulated are annulled once a team is eliminated from the tournament or reaches the semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|Mamoru {{struggles with}} his {{identity}} and function throughout the series, worrying first about his true nature, then later whether {{he gets in}} the way of the Sailor Soldiers. A fair amount of subtle characterization is made for Mamoru, and later extending his role within the manga as to who he is. He also is given the power of psychometry, which also showed up in the anime, but was not given a name. This manifests in his ability to see and read dreams (such as Chibiusa's), to heal people and to monitor the status of the Earth. This does not develop fully until the Black Moon arc, and is used occasionally throughout the series. Mamoru also has his left ear pierced in the manga, a trait that does not <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his anime counterpart.|$|E
25|$|In the single-player campaign, {{the player}} starts each mission {{with a group}} of soldiers, and must use that group to {{accomplish}} a specific goal or set of goals. These goals can involve killing a certain amount of enemies, defending a location, reaching a certain point on the map, escorting a unit safely to a certain area, or destroying a specific object or enemy. The focus of the single-player campaign is on a smaller force defeating a much larger enemy force; in every mission, the Light units are outnumbered by enemies, often vastly, and so the player must use the terrain, employ the specific skills of their individual units, and gradually decrease the enemy force, or attempt to avoid it altogether. Units in the single-player campaign acquire experience with each kill. Experience increases attack rate, accuracy, and defence, and any unit that survives a battle will <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the next battle with their accumulated experience (assuming the next battle features units of that type).|$|E

25|$|Five years later, veteran host Tom Kennedy {{starred in}} a new daily {{syndicated}} version, which also used the traditional half-hour format and was syndicated by The Television Program Source. Like the previous syndicated series, this version had a slightly larger budget than its daytime counterpart. A perfect bid during the One-Bids won that contestant a $500 bonus (compared to $100 awarded on the daytime show during the same period); this bonus would permanently <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the daytime show in 1998. This version used the same models as the daytime show as well as announcer Johnny Olson, who as noted above died during the season. Unlike the daytime series, which employed a series of guest announcers until a permanent replacement was decided upon, the syndicated series brought Gene Wood in to fill in for Olson. When the daytime series decided on Rod Roddy as the permanent replacement for Olson, {{he took over the}} syndicated series from Wood as well.|$|E
25|$|Rick Porcello pitched seven innings, {{struck out}} seven, and was aided by 13 runs as he cruised to his twentieth win {{of the season}} in the Friday opener, the first 20-game winner for the Red Sox since Josh Beckett in 2007. The hot bats did not <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> game two and Boston lost another one-run game. Eduardo Rodríguez went six innings and allowed three runs, two earned, on four hits. Game three saw {{eighteen}} pitchers used by both teams. The respective starters did not make it through the fourth inning, each allowing six runs. Toronto put a five-spot on the board in the third inning, to take a two-run lead, only to give it right away in the fourth and reclaiming it {{in the bottom of the}} inning. Hanley Ramírez made it a one-run game in the fifth on a solo shot and with runners on first and second in the sixth, John Gibbons summoned Joaquín Benoit from the bullpen to face David Ortiz, the same pitcher he hit a grand slam off in game two of the 2013 ALCS, which was the turning point of the series. Ortiz hammered the second pitch into the right field stands to put the Red Sox up for good in this game. He passed Jimmie Foxx in the all-time home run list with 535.|$|E
