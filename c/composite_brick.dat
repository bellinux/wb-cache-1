40|$|For the {{development}} of a composite main landing gear fitting in carbon fiber reinforced plastics the behavior and performance of Ultra Thick Laminate components is investigated. Material thicknesses exceeds 60 mm. For the purpose of validation a test program is arranged using T-cross sections subjected to multiple load cases. The components are manufactured entirely with non crimped fabrics (NCF) using an adapted open mould manufacturing process. In addition to these T-Sections large full scale subcomponents of the entire fitting are manufactured and tested. As main topic of this paper standard FE methods are investigated and validated for thick structures using the generated test results. Due to the presence of transverse shear and normal stresses a 3 D modeling approach is chosen. Transverse shear and normal stresses are indentified as main failure cause and failure is mainly initiated in the curved regions. Solid <b>composite</b> <b>brick</b> elements offer an efficient way to model thick structures. These are incapable of calculating accurate shear stresses on a ply level; usable results are however achieved by discretisation of the component with multiple elements over thickness.

Standard 3 D multilayered <b>composite</b> <b>brick</b> elements are employed to analyze UTL. For the purpose of validation several full-scale test components with T-cross section have been manufactured with thicknesses ranging from 60 - 90 mm. In a first approach single non interactive failure criteria have been used due to the uncertainty of out of plane material properties. Despite {{the fact that the}} used element type provides a simple mean of modeling and analyzing UTL, it is found that the element formulation strictly limits the accuracy of transverse shear stress prediction. The quadratic or even linear approximation of in plane displacements does not account for the irregular distribution in thickness direction [1]. Global deformations of the geometry can however be calculated with good results. Most failure modes experienced, are found to be dominated by transverse shear or out of plane peeling stresses. Particularly in the region of load introduction. For the analysis of the final landing gear fitting material restricted correction factors are introduced. In addition to the T-Sections, large so called ‘Double Corners’ are tested in both in plane and out of plane direction to develop effective countermeasures for premature failure modes, such as throat washers and load distribution plates. The utilized modified VAP cycle has significant benefits compared to closed mould processes, such as reduced tooling costs and high flexibility.

40|$|Passive cooling {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to keep the {{building}} cool and to reduce the load on air conditioner. Passive cooling demands the study of the thermal characteristics like admittance, transmittance, decrement factor, time lag, surface factor and surface factor time lags. These characteristics were determined for both homogeneous and composite walls. The buildings are built with composite wall. This demands the study of thermal characteristics of composite wall. In this study, five building materials like Laterite stone, Burnt brick, Mud brick, Reinforced brick and Fly ash bricks were selected as homogeneous building materials. Five local Insulating materials such as Saw dust, Rice husk, Coir board, Jute felt and Jute fiber were selected to form the composite wall along with building materials. The composite walls were framed using the combination of building materials and insulation materials. Total hundred combinations of composite walls, without insulation (Configuration-A) and with insulation material located at inner side (Configuration-D), insulation material at mid plane (Configuration-C) and insulation material at outer side (Configuration-B) of the composite wall were studied. To study the thermal characteristics of such configurations of composite wall, one dimensional heat flow diffusion equation was solved using matrix algebra under periodic boundary conditions. The penetration length of thermal waves, the phase velocity of the heat wave in the wall and optimum fabric thickness of the selected building and insulating materials were calculated. From this study it is found that the decrement factors of the fly ash brick (0. 401) and jute felt (0. 4) are the least and the time lags of the fly ash bricks (8. 15 h) and jute felt (8. 75 h) are the highest among all the studied homogeneous building and insulating materials. Hence these two homogeneous materials are more effective building and insulating materials at suppressing temperature swings. It is summarized that insulation located at the inner surface (Configuration D) of the composite wall gives the lower time lags and higher decrement factors. This is the worst condition of insulating the wall among all the studied configurations. It is also concluded that fly ash <b>brick</b> <b>composite</b> walls with jute felt insulation located at the mid plane of the wall give greater time lags (11. 17 h) and reinforced <b>brick</b> <b>composite</b> walls with rice husk insulation located at the inner side of the wall give lower time lag values (7. 37 h). It was also observed that fly ash <b>brick</b> <b>composite</b> walls with coir board insulation located at the outer side of the wall give the lowest value of decrement factor (0. 17) and reinforced <b>brick</b> <b>composite</b> walls with jute fiber insulation located at the inner side of the wall give higher decrement factors (0. 37). Fly ash <b>brick</b> <b>composite</b> walls with jute felt insulation located at the mid center plane of the wall are the most recommended composite walls among all the studied composite walls.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{three-dimensional}} model was proposed {{to analyze the}} response of bolted composite joints with and without lateral clamping forces from initial loading to ultimate failure. The effects of the clamping force, bolt stiffness, washer size on the response and failure of the joints were the major concern of the study. The model consists of a progressive failure analysis and a finite element stress analysis. For a given stress state in a joint, the progressive failure analysis predicts damage accumulated in composites {{by a set of}} failure criteria and estimates associated material degradation based on predicted modes of failure. To account for three-dimensional bearing damage in joints, the model assumed that the material suffering from bearing damage became incompressible under lateral bolt constraints provided by the washers. In the stress analysis, the commercial finite element code ABAQUS was adopted to provide three-dimensional stresses and strains which are needed for the pro-gressive failure analysis. A 3 -D <b>composite</b> <b>brick</b> element was used, and slip/friction/ contact conditions were applied between the elastic bolt and a composite plate, and between the composite plate and the elastic washers or side plates. In order to rein-force the incompressibility condition for bearing-damaged material, the condition was imposed through a penalty method in the framework of finite element analyses. The proposed model was implemented in a code, namely 3 DBOLT, in order to interface with the ABAQUS code. The code provides a user-friendly input deck, automatically generates a joint mesh, and produces output and graphics for displaying the stresses, strains, and deformations of the joints and for simulating the failure progression in joints during loading...|$|E
40|$|Composites are {{increasingly}} {{often used for}} thick and compact structures with the clear aim to reduce the overall weight and cost of an aircraft. But classic applications of composites are thinner structures with limited out of plane loads. Analysis and test methods are therefore commonly developed and used for thinner structures and neglect the special challenges involved with thicker laminates. In addition composites {{are increasingly}} becoming interesting for fittings and joints since the surrounding structures are either built or being developed in composites a well. Using metallic fitting and joints can cause additional thermal stresses and /or corrosion due to the material mix of composites and metals. Due to the enlarged field of application for composites, there is an increasing demand for suitable analysis, test and manufacturing methods. Compact and highly loaded composite structures are prone {{to be subjected to}} high and multidirectional loads. This causes an atypical load situation for composites, which usually are subjected to plane loads to best exploit the strength of the fibers. Due to the orthotropic nature of the material a large amount of design variables are introduced. The design of any composite part is highly manufacturing driven, meaning that the final shape is determined by manufacturing capabilities. Thick composites provide a cost effective alternative and can generate a distinct weight benefit over standard metallic components and hence will a {{play a significant role in}} future aircraft developments. Analysis, testing and manufacturing methods have to be developed and adapted for that purpose. A reliable analysis is only possible if accurate 3 D material properties are available. Analysis capabilities have to be assessed using empirical test data in order to judge the applicability. The presented work has its emphasis on the analysis and testing of structural components manufactured in thick composites. The generated data from a comprehensive manufacturing and test program is also used as basis for a cost and weight study under the assumption of a highly automized serial production. The results further underline the potential of thick composites.  In a first approach, standard 2 D finite element methods are used for a topology investigation. In order to fully capture the behavior of the material 3 D methods are quickly implemented. An extensive test program with full scale samples and coupons is used to improve and evolve the analysis. An open mold manufacturing cycle minimizes tooling costs and provides optimum flexibility for frequent design changes. A strong link between the analysis, the manufacturing and the design is maintained throughout the developments in order to generate a material suitable design solution. Although the ultimate goal is to manufacture a specific component, the topics are approached as generic as possible in order to provide a basis for future studies with similar boundary conditions. Despite the fact that the material creates countless design variables, an affordable approach for the analysis of thick composite structures is provided using standard 3 D <b>composite</b> <b>brick</b> elements. The initial problem of missing reliable 3 D material properties is counteracted with tests of full scale sub- components and modified short beam shear tests. A new cure cycle for thick laminates is presented and analyzed to assess process induced stresses and deformations. A large landing gear fitting component is designed and manufactured and can be regarded as an excellent demonstrator of ultra thick composites. With a maximum wall thickness of 90 mm, the component provides a weight reduction of 18 % and a cost benefit of approximately 20 % compared to the metallic counterpart. The potential of composites applied to a compact and highly loaded fitting is demonstrated and suitable analysis methods are established. A need for future tests to provide reliable and generic 3 D material properties is identified. To provide a weight and cost benefit it is crucial to find a design topology suitable for composites.

40|$|CD {{containing}} {{a copy of}} the thesis, software and extra documentation is held with print copy. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a relatively complex technique and normally requires expensive equipment. However, with advances in computing, electronics and permanent magnet technologies, NMR is becoming more feasible as a non-invasive tool for industry. The strength of NMR is its ability to probe at the molecular level and hence gain information about molecular structure, organisation, abundance and orientation. This thesis describes the development of an instrumentation platform technology that is compact and therefore portable. It has been produced to aid the development of NMR based tools or sensors for research and industry and will lead to a series of low cost, portable NMR systems for the non-destructive testing of materials such as polymer <b>composites,</b> rubber, timber, <b>bricks</b> and concrete. The instrumentation is largely electronics based and consists of a series of modules that can be interconnected to produce a solution. The first of two main modules is called the system core. What is common to all NMR applications is the generation of precisely timed signals, the capturing of signals and the processing/display of data. This has been implemented by developing a general purpose Digital Signal Processor (DSP) based instrumentation and control module that uses a Universal Serial Bus interface to communicate with a host computer. A graphical user interface is provided by an application running under Windows® XP. The second main module is a radio frequency transceiver that has been developed using digital receiver technology. The signals, after some amplification, are digitized with a 14 -bit, 62. 5 MH. z analogue to digital converter. The sampled signal is then mixed digitally with synthesized sine and cosine functions to generate lower frequency quadrature outputs which are then digitally filtered and decimated before being passed onto the DSP for further processing and storage. A direct digital synthesizer with an analogue output is used to generate any required excitation signals. All synthesizers have phase and frequency hopping capabilities and are phase locked to each other and the DSP. The system was designed to interface to a range of NMR probes. The type of probe is determined by the intended application and each probe has specific requirements such as the type of radio frequency power amplifier, duplexer and preamplifier needed. This results in a number of instrumentation variations and a modular instrument enclosure was used to cater for these variations. The instrument was first configured for an NMR probe called the NMR-MOUSE. Tests were performed with this probe to verify the correct operation and performance of the instrument. The instrument was then reconfigured for a new probe called the NMR-MOLE and further testing was performed. This probe was still undergoing development and had not been previously tested. Finally, a dedicated compact instrument measuring 360 x 240 x 55 mm and weighing 3. 6 kg was developed for the NMR-MOUSE probe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Brick</b> masonry, a <b>composite</b> of <b>brick</b> units bound {{together}} with mortar, {{is widely used}} for building construction in India. Burnt clay bricks are commonly used in construction of masonry structures since many years. But with growing environmental concern for conservation {{of natural resources and}} disposal of fly ash, bricks made with fly ash are emerging as a substitute to burnt clay bricks for construction of masonry structures. The behaviour of masonry structure isdependent on the properties of its constituents such as brick units and mortar separately and together as a unified mass. Brick properties vary largely from region to region as bricks are made with locally available raw materials with inherent randomness. Therefore, the analysis and design of brick masonry structures considering the mean values of material properties may underestimate or overestimate the structural capacity. In order to design a safer structure it is necessary to take in to consideration the randomness and variability of the material properties of brick masonry. This requires mathematical description of the variability in different material properties of brick masonry. The variability of mechanical properties related to steel and concrete is well researched, while the same for brick masonry has not received proper attention. The lack of data has led to ignorance of uncertainty in brick masonry while analysing structures. Under lateral loads, brick masonry is expected to undergo in-plane and out-of-plane forces. Resistance to out-of-plane forces in masonry structure is negligible and generally ignored in analysis and design. However, the in-plane forces which act parallel to the plane of wall is resisted by the bond between brick and mortar. Shear bond strength of masonry {{plays an important role in}} dealing with in-plane forces. The soaking of bricks prior to construction is very essential to achieve good shear bond strength. Bricks with higher initial rate of absorption must be pre-wetted prior to use in construction else they absorb more water from mortar inhibiting its hydration. But, the optimum duration of pre-wetting or the optimum moisture content of brick necessary to obtain higher shear bond strength is not available in published literatures. In present study, several experiments are carried out to determine mechanical properties such as initial rate of absorption, water absorption, dry density and compressive strength of brick units, compressive strength of mortar and masonry prism and shear bond strength of masonry triplet. Higher order analyses such as X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy are conducted to understand the morphological and microstructural differences in brick leading to variation in its compressive strength. Three different types of failure patterns such as vertical splitting, diagonal shear failure and crushing are identified for masonry prism under axial compression. The variability in the mechanical properties of brick masonry and its constituent materials is described using different probability distribution functions. Four two-parameter distribution functions namely normal, lognormal, gamma and Weibull distribution are chosen and their acceptability is evaluated using three goodness-of-fit tests such as Kolmogorov-Sminrov, Chi-square and log-likelihood test. All the distributions are found to be closely competing to fit the variability best. Lognormal is found to be common distribution function to best describe the variability for most of the mechanical properties studied. Weibull and gamma distributions are found to be most appropriate for other properties. However, in general, gamma distribution is found to be either the best or the next best distribution function to describe most of the mechanical properties studied. Therefore, lognormal or gamma distribution is recommended as the distribution function that best describe the variability of properties of brick masonry and its constituents. The morphological and microstructural analyses attributed the low and high strength in brick samples to the absence of certain chemical compounds and variation in surface texture. The presence of compounds of silica, aluminium, calcium, iron oxide and magnesium is observed to be helpful for bricks in attaining higher compressive strength. Simple mathematical equations are proposed to estimate the compressive strength of brick unit and masonry prism. The equations can be used for both clay and fly ash bricks. The proposed equations are validated by comparing the predicted value of the compressive strength with experimental value obtained from published literatures. The optimum moisture content in bricks at the time of construction to obtain higher shear bond strength is experimentally determined. It is observed from the failure pattern of triplets that shear bond failure depends on the strength of brick, mortar and their bond. IRA and moisture content of brick control the modes of failure indirectly through shear bond strength...|$|R
