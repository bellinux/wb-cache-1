5000|$|The {{idea for}} the Vectrex was {{conceived}} by John Ross of Smith Engineering in late 1980. He, Mike Purvis, Tom Sloper, and Steve Marking had gone to Electro-Mavin, a surplus warehouse in Los Angeles. They found a 1" [...] cathode ray tube and considered if a small electronic game could be made of this. A demonstration of a vector-drawing cathode ray tube display was made by <b>connecting</b> the deflection <b>yoke</b> in a standard television to the channels of a stereo amplifier fed with music program material. An axillary yoke was used to keep the raster television's horizontal fly-back high-voltage system running. The demo led to a system originally conceived as a handheld called the Mini Arcade, but as Smith Engineering shopped the idea around to developers, it evolved into a tabletop with nine-inch screen.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{features}} which distinguishes this axle from other high-performance or heavy-duty domestic solid axles is that unlike other axle designs, access to the differential gears is not through the rear center cover; rather, in the Ford 9 inch, the rear cover is welded to the axle housing, and access to internals is obtained by removing the center cover on the pinion (front) side of the axle through which the driveshaft <b>yoke</b> <b>connects,</b> with the differential assembly {{coming out of the}} axle as a unit attached to the cover.,, Although this requires disconnecting the driveshaft to access the internal gearset, it offers the advantage of being able to disassemble and reassemble the differential gears and adjust clearances conveniently on the benchtop, rather than with the restricted access of working within the axle housing under the car.|$|R
40|$|A Well Intervention Unit {{performs}} subsea {{intervention on}} different water depths ranging from approximately 800 - 3000 meters. During {{a change of}} operations sites, between two neighbouring wells at different water depths, {{the length of the}} riser must be adjusted. This procedure is time consuming, and excessive cost-rates are the motivation for evaluating a new solution that may reduce the rigging time. In this thesis, it is established a new handling sequence reducing the turnaround time by approximately 20 - 22 hours per trip. Estimated savings is thus 50 - 60 million NOK on a yearly basis. The suggested handling sequence is to elevate the Upper Riser Pack (URP) higher in the tower, leaving enough handling space underneath to retrieve riser elements. This eliminates the need of rigging down the surface stack, hence the turnaround time is reduced. To be able to disconnect riser elements efficiently, while the URP is in the tower, a second yoke is introduced to the handling system. A yoke is a passive lifting appliance, and has to be connected to the main hoisting system, which already holds the Upper Riser Pack. The most convenient solution is therefore to <b>connect</b> the <b>yoke</b> to the Surface Flow Tree, the lowest component in the riser stack (UPR). This indicates that the entire Upper Riser Pack has to be elevated together with the new yoke system during riser retrieval. Suggested commercial solution is a hydraulic lifting yoke provided by National Oilwell Varco. This yoke consists of two weld-less BJ links and a BX 5 elevator. Design specification together with relevant rules and regulations is used to define the load case. Normal operation, accidental heel, and an API-load is used when calculating and simulating the equipment. The API-load is the conservative estimate taken from the API 8 C standard of the rated load, i. e. the design load, multiplied with a safety factor of 2. 25. This is more conservative than DNV and will therefore be used as an additional test case. The new riser handling system were drawn and simulated in SolidWorks. The yoke consist of the elevator assembly and two links. The elevator is a component designed to hold riser elements. The links are connection arms that give the necessary handling space between the Surface Flow Tree and the risers. The final component is the adapter; this component is designed to <b>connect</b> the <b>yoke</b> and the Surface Flow Tree. This component is tailor made for the operation sequence and the existing equipment. It is designed so that no additional modifications have to be made to the Upper Riser Pack. Finally, a strength analysis of the new riser handling equipment is computed, and the results are presented. Some local yielding occurs, especially in the contact regions, but the overall impression is that the equipment satisfies the rules and safety requirements provided by both DNV and API...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new type}} of hybrid {{reluctance}} actuator is presented. This linear hybrid reluctance actuator is a two phase double sided actuator in which the stator is composed by four normalized U cores, each with a coil wrapped around the <b>yoke</b> <b>connecting</b> the two arms of the core or with two coils wound on each of the arms and a permanent magnet placed near the air gap between and in contact with both arms. The mover is comprised of rectangular poles without connecting iron pieces between them but mechanically joined by non-magnetic mounting parts. The magnets are arranged so that their flux is in parallel to the flux created when the coils are energized, both fluxes are added and the total reinforced flux links the stator and the mover. But when no currents flow through the coils no flux crosses the air gap, and the flux of the magnets is closed through the back iron that supports them. An analysis and simulation of the motor using 2 D finite element and MATLAB Simulink is carried out.

40|$|Spoke-type {{interior}} {{permanent magnet}} (IPM) machines are an attractive topology for high performance electric motors, especially designed for vehicle traction applications. In this paper, a special {{design for a}} spoke-type IPM motor is presented to enhance motor flux-weakening capability in the operation over a wide speed range. The proposed design consists of a simple and robust mechanical device that includes radially-displaceable rotor <b>yokes,</b> <b>connected</b> to the shaft by means of springs. At high speed, the centrifugal force prevails over the elastic one due to springs, causing the mobile yokes to displace radially and to establish a partial magnetic short circuit between permanent magnets. This increases permanent magnet leakage flux and consequently reduces the air-gap field. As a result, a mechanical flux weakening effect is achieved at high speed, which helps significantly reduce the demagnetizing d-axis current to be injected by the inverter, along with the related copper losses and demagnetization issues. The proposed design is investigated in the paper using an analytical model whose parameters are computed by finite-element analysis (FEA). The effectiveness of the solution being set forth is successfully proven by some testing on a laboratory prototype. Experimental results are compared to analytical predictions showing a satisfactory accordance...|$|R
5000|$|Tension {{testing in}} a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) {{is more complex}} due to a {{variation}} of loading methods and specimen attachment to the incident and transmission bar. [...] The first tension bar was designed and tested by Harding et al. in 1960; the design involved using a hollow weight bar that was <b>connected</b> to a <b>yoke</b> and threaded specimen inside of the weight bar. A tensile wave was created by impacting the weight bar with a ram and having the initial compression wave reflect as a tensile wave off the free end [...] Another breakthrough in the SHPB design was done by Nichols who used a typical compression setup and threaded metallic specimens on both the incident and transmission ends, while placing a composite collar over the specimen. The specimen had a snug fit on the incident and transmission side in order to bypass an initial compression wave. Nichols setup would create an initial compression wave by an impact in the incident end with a striker, but when the compression wave reached the specimen, the threads would not be loaded. The compression wave would ideally pass through the composite collar and then reflect off the free end in tension. The tensile wave would then pull on the specimen. [...] The next loading method was revolutionized by Ogawa in 1984. A hollow striker was used to impact a flange that is threaded to end on an incident bar. This striker was propelled by using either a gas gun or a rotating disk. The specimen was once again attached to the incident and transmission bar via threading.|$|R
40|$|On February 4, 1999 the Mars Global Surveyor {{spacecraft}} {{became the}} second spacecraft to successfully aerobrake into a nearly circular orbit about another planet. This paper will highlight {{some of the}} similarities and differences between the aerobraking phases of this mission and the first mission to use aerobraking, the Magellan mission to Venus. Although the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft was designed for aerobraking and the Magellan spacecraft was not, aerobraking MGS was a much more challenging task than aerobraking Magellan, primarily because the spacecraft was damaged during the initial deployment of the solar panels. The MGS aerobraking phase had to be completely redesigned to minimize the bending moment acting on a broken <b>yoke</b> <b>connecting</b> one of the solar panels to the spacecraft. Even if the MGS spacecraft was undamaged, aerobraking at Mars was more challenging than aerobraking at Venus for several reasons. First, Mars is subject to dust storms, which can significantly change the temperature of the atmosphere due to increased solar heating in the low and middle altitudes (below 50 km), which in turn can significantly increase the density at the aerobraking altitudes (above 100 km). During {{the first part of the}} MGS aerobraking phase, a regional dust storm was observed to have a significant and very rapid effect on the entire atmosphere of Mars. Computer simulations of global dust storms on Mars indicate that even larger density increases are possible than those observed during the MGS aerobraking phases. For many aerobraking missions, the duration of the aerobraking phase must be kept as short as possible to minimize the total mission cost. For Mars missions, a short aerobraking phase means that there will be less margin to accommodate atmospheric variability, so the operations team must be ready to propulsively raise periapsis by tens of kilometers on very short notice. This issue was less of a concern on Venus, where the thick lower atmosphere and the slow planet rotation resulted in more predictable atmospheric densities from one orbit to the next...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the PHyTIR (Prototype HyspIRI Thermal Infrared Radiometer) instrument, {{which is the}} engineering model for the proposed HyspIRI (Hyperspectral Infrared Imager) earth observing instrument. The HyspIRI mission would be comprised of the HyspIRI TIR (Thermal Infrared Imager), and a VSWIR (Visible Short-Wave Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer). Both instruments {{would be used to}} address key science questions related to the earth's carbon cycle, ecosystems, climate, and solid earth properties. Data gathering of volcanic activities, earthquakes, wildfires, water use and availability, urbanization, and land surface compositions and changes, would aid the predictions and evaluations of such events and the impact they create. Even though the proposed technology for the HyspIRI imager is mature, the PHyTIR prototype is needed to advance the technology levels for several of the instrument's key components, and to reduce risks, in particular to validate 1) the higher sensitivity, spatial resolution, and higher throughput required for this focal plane array, 2) the pointing accuracy, 2) the characteristics of several spectral channels, and 4) the use of ambient temperature optics. The PHyTIR telescope consists of the focal plane assembly that is housed within a cold housing located inside a vacuum enclosure; all mounted to a bulkhead, and an optical train that consists of 3 powered mirrors; extending to both sides of the bulkhead. A <b>yoke</b> <b>connects</b> the telescope to a scan mirror. The rotating mirror enables to scan- a large track on the ground. This structure is supported by kinematic mounts, linking the telescope assembly to a base plate that would also become the spacecraft interface for HyspIRI. The focal plane's cooling units are also mounted to the base plate, as is an overall enclosure that has two viewing ports with large exterior baffles, shielding the focal plane from incoming stray light. PHyTIR's electronics is distributed inside and near the vacuum enclosure, and in a nearby rack. The data acquisition technique would be to take measurements over a 51 deg wide swath in the cross spacecraft velocity direction, which is brought into view through the rotating scan mirror. A landscape mosaic thus can be assembled by overlaying rows of measurements. The paper briefly outlines the proposed HyspIRI mission and its data acquisition technique; it then {{describes the}} prototype PHyTIR instrument...|$|R
40|$|For {{thousands}} of years breakwaters have been built {{at or near the}} coast to protect harbors or coastlines from wave attack. One of the earliest known harbor protection schemes was devised in about 2000 B. C. for the Port of Pharos on the open coast of Egypt; it had a rubble-mound breakwater approximately 8500 ft long composed of large blocks of stone with smaller stone filling the spaces between blocks (Savile 1940). Until the development of experimental laboratory techniques to investigate the effect of waves on breakwaters, these structures were designed primarily from experience gained from other similar structures. It is the purpose of this review to discuss various aspects of the hydrodynamics of wave attack on such structures and the relation of certain analytic considerations and experimental results to the design of a rubble-mound. A breakwater built as a rubble-mound is constructed by placing material of various sizes layer by layer (or unit by unit) until the desired cross-section shape is achieved. Generally, the units are not structurally connected, so that the integrity of the rubble-mound depends on features such as the weight of the material, the interlocking nature of the material, and the cross section of the structure. Usually the structure is built with material graded from smaller sizes in the core to larger material armoring the face against wave attack. The armor layer may be composed of quarry-stone, if it is available in the required sizes and is economically feasible to use. When these conditions are not met, specially designed concrete units for armoring the face of the rubble-mound have been developed that tend to interlock better than rock when properly placed; hence, {{it may be possible to}} use armor units lighter than the required quarry-stone. Over the years numerous geometric shapes have been developed for such armor units, with each shape generally introduced in an attempt to improve on the interlocking characteristics of its predecessors. To mention only a few, various names used for different units are: tribars, tetrapods, quadripods, and dolosse. A brief description of two of these is presented; for a more detailed discussion of shape along with drawings of the units the interested reader is directed to CERC (1966) and Hudson(1974). Tribars, which consist basically of three circular cylinders <b>connected</b> by a <b>yoke</b> of three cylinders, are usually placed in a uniform geometric pattern on the face of the rubble-mound. Dolosse are shaped like the letter "H" with the vertical legs rotated 90 ° to each other, and are generally placed randomly on a rubble-mound face. It is the effective interlocking of dolosse that leads to the use of random placement techniques. Obviously an important aspect in the design of a rubble-mound is its stability under wave attack. This subject is discussed in detail, along with descriptions of the basis for certain design approaches currently used. The support of these design criteria as well as their limitations are discussed with reference to available experimental data. Three other aspects of the effect of waves on rubble-mounds are treated in this review: wave run-up, transmission, and overtopping. Run-up is defined as the vertical height above still water level to which waves incident upon a structure can be expected to travel up the face of the structure. Wave run-up is important in defining both the amount of wave energy transmitted over and through permeable rubble-mounds and also the quantity of water that may be expected to overtop the structure. In each of the following sections the discussion is directed toward understanding the fluid-mechanic aspects of the various problems and the features and the shortcomings of analytical and experimental models used in connection with the design of breakwaters constructed as rubble-mounds...|$|R
