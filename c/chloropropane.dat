40|$|Abstract. The {{poor wetting}} {{property}} between aramid fiber and resin {{results in the}} low interfacial performance due to the inertia and smooth surface of aramid. 60 Co gamma-ray was used to modify the surface of domestic aramid fiber in the medium of epoxy <b>chloropropane</b> and diethanolamine respectively. The properties of aramid/epoxy composites were characterized by interface shear strength (IFSS) {{and the effect of}} two graft polymerization systems on fiber surface was discussed. The results showed that in an irradiation dose of 400 kGy, when <b>chloropropane</b> and diethanolamine were used respectively as the graft system, the IFSS value of the composite material reached 86. 53 MPa and 70. 37 MPa, and compared with the untreated sample, each increase of 31. 23 % and 6. 72 %. High-energy radiation treatment increased the surface energy of aramid. The original smooth surface was disappeared. Oxygen content on fiber surface greatly risen, and aramid surface activity increased...|$|E

40|$|<b>Chloropropanes</b> are {{industrial}} chemicals {{that have been}} used as solvents, dry cleaning fluids, paint removers, metal degreasers, and for the synthesis of bulk chemicals such as pesticides, resins, dyes, adhesives, plasticizers and surfactants (van Agteren et al., 1998). 1, 2 -Dichloropropane (Propylene Dichloride; 1, 2 -DCP) has been used to prepare soil fumigants for nematodes and insecticides for stored grain (EPA, 2006). Releases of <b>chloropropanes</b> to the environment have occurred due to agricultural use, industrial emissions and disposal, and volatilization during use (van Agteren et al., 1998). Application of pesticides to soil has also resulted in groundwater contamination at many Sites (van Agteren et al., 1998). The EPA established a Maximum Contaminant level (MCL) of 5 ug/L (ppb) 1, 2 -DCP in drinking water.

The biotransformation of 1 -chloropropane, 1, 2 -dichloropropane, 1, 3 -dichloropropane and 1, 2, 3 -trichloropropane was studied using resting cell suspensions of Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b expressing soluble methane monooxygenase.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, {{approximately}} 95 percent of <b>chloropropanes</b> {{were being used}} as chemical intermediates. Chemical intermediates are industrial chemicals that are used {{as the starting point}} to produce other chemicals. 1,2,3-TCP is currently used as an intermediate in the production of polysulfone liquid polymers, the synthesis of hexafluoropropylene, and as a cross-linking agent in the synthesis of polysulfides. Polysulfone liquid polymers are used in the following industries: aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, electrical and electronic, health care, and in industrial equipment, such as compressor and pump valve components. Hexafluoropropylene is a fluorointermediate that is a key building block required to produce Teflon fluoropolymers; it has applications in the agrochemical, electronics, dyes/pigments, pharmaceutical, and specialty polymermarkets. Polysulfides are used as catalyst sulfidation agents and in the formulation of lubricant additives created for use in high-pressure environments or applications.|$|R
40|$|Spectra of the adsorbed species {{arising from}} contact of a V(2) O(5) -MoO(3) -TiO(2) model SCR {{catalyst}} with ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and dibenzofuran (DBF) and their evolution with the temperature are presented and discussed. Dichlorobenzene adsorbs weakly probably on Lewis acid sites through the chlorine atom. A very fast nucleophilic substitution on dichlorobenzene to a chlorophenate species occurs already at RT. On the contrary, adsorption of dibenzofuran is molecular, probably through the oxygen atom on Lewis sites. The aromatic rings of both molecules {{tend to be}} later oxidized to give carboxylate species. Parallel experiments with <b>chloropropane</b> show that dehydrochlorination occurs readily, hydrochloric acid is adsorbed quite weakly and that propene can be further oxidized. However, heavier oxidized species like cyclic anhydrides are also formed from <b>chloropropane.</b> The {{data suggest that the}} dechloration step of the phenyl ring could be not critical. On the contrary, the building-up of aromatic compounds from smaller molecules is possible and the oxidation of phenyl ring can be slow near reaction conditions. The possibility that the reaction between phenate species and chlorobenzenes give the "de novo" synthesis of dioxins is envisaged. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{anti-fungal}} {{derivative of}} rosin was synthesized. First, rosin was modified by acrylic acid and the modified rosin was esterified by epoxy <b>chloropropane</b> with the mole ratio of 1 : 3 for 3. 5 h at 90 ℃. The intermediate was bis 3 -rosin acyloxy- 2 - hydroxypropyl chlorine {{and the degree}} of esterification was 98. 81 %. Then, bisN-(3 -rosin acyloxy- 2 -hydroxyl) propyl-N,N dimethylamine was made from the intermediate under the following conditions: the intermediate and dimethylamine mole ratio of 1 : 2, reaction temperature of 80 ℃ and reaction time of 2. 5 h. The chemical structure of the product was identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The anti-fungal activity of the product was determined by paper-disc method with wood decay fungi such as Trametes versicolor, Gloeophyllum trabeum and wood stain fungi such as Aspergillus niger and Paecilomyces variot Bainier. The anti-fungal experiment results signified that bisN-(3 -rosin acyloxy- 2 -hydroxyl) propyl-N, N dimethylamine is active vs. these fungi, but less effective with Aspergillus niger. Since it is produced easily from rosin, which is renewable and not expensive, this product has a promising future as a potential wood preservative...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares four {{alternative}} approaches for deriving regulatory levels for reproductive toxicants by applying {{them to the}} available data on the human spermatotoxicant 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 <b>chloropropane</b> (DBCP). The alternatives examined include the Proposition 65 approach (application of a mandatory 1000 -fold uncertainty factor to a no-observed-adverse-effect level [NOAEL]), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approach (application of flexible uncertainty factors to a NOAEL), the Benchmark Dose approach (application of flexible uncertainty factors to a dose associated with a known level of change in a reproductive parameter), and the Quantitative Risk Estimation approach (using low-dose linear extrapolation and {{a model of the}} relationship between sperm count and infertility). Applied to DBCP, these approaches do not produce substantially different estimates of allowable exposure levels. However, the approaches do have different data requirements and provide different amounts of information on reproductive hazards to risk managers and the public. Neither the Proposition 65 nor the EPA approach provides information about the extent of health risk remaining at a regulatory level. In contrast, the Benchmark Dose approach can provide estimates of the magnitude of sperm count reduction at a regulatory level, and the Quantitative Risk Estimation approach can provide estimates of exposure-induced infertility...|$|E
40|$|Uniform small-sized (< 10 mu m) Konjac glucomanna (KGM) {{microspheres}} {{have great}} application prospects in bio-separation, drug delivery and controlled release. Premix membrane emulsification {{is an effective}} method to prepare uniform small-sized KGM microspheres. However, since KGM solution bears strong alkalinity, it requires the membrane to have a hydrophobic surface resistant to alkali. In this study, uniform small-sized KGM microspheres were prepared with epoxy-based polymer membrane (EP) we developed by premix membrane emulsification. It was found that emulsion coalescence and flocculation occurred frequently due to the high interface energy and sedimentation velocity of KGM emulsions. Emulsion stability had a significant influence on the uniformity and dispersity of the final KGM microspheres. To improve {{the stability of the}} emulsions, the effects of the concentration of the emulsifier, the viscosity of the KGM solution, the oil phase composition and the feeding method of epoxy <b>chloropropane</b> (EC) on the preparation results were studied.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the substrate specificity of ammonia monooxygenase in whole cells of the nitrifying bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea {{for a number of}} aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons. To determine the effect of the halogen substituent and carbon chain length on substrate reactivity, we measured the rates of oxidation of the monohalogenated ethanes (fluoroethane, chloroethane, bromoethane, and iodoethane) and n-chlorinated C 1 to C 4 alkanes by whole cells of N. europaea. For monohalogenated ethanes, acetaldehyde was the major organic product and little or none of any of the alternate predicted products (2 -halogenated alcohols) were detected. The maximum rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight from iodoethane to chloroethane (19 to 221 nmol/min per mg of protein). In addition, the amount of substrate required for the highest rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight. For the n-chlorinated alkanes, the rate of dechlorination, as measured by the appearance of the corresponding aldehyde product, was greatest for chloroethane and decreased dramatically for <b>chloropropane</b> and chlorobutane (118, 4, and 8 nmol of aldehyde formed per min per mg of protein, respectively). The concentration profiles for halocarbon oxidation by ammonia monooxygenase showed apparent substrate inhibition when ammonia was used as the reductant source. When hydrazine was used as the electron donor, no substrate inhibition was observed, suggesting that the inhibition resulted from reductant limitation...|$|E
