40|$|Wikipedia puts forward {{that each}} article gains more quality {{over time as}} the process of {{consensus}} building results in a neutral point of view. In this study we analyze the same article across different Wikipedia language versions, comparing the article titles, templates, tables of contents, particular content details, talk pages, editors’ names and locations, references and images. For the contentious articles in existence {{for at least five}} years, we found that they could be said to express rather national than neutral points of view. In the case in question, the Srebrenica massacre, the Bosnian, Dutch and Serbian article’s respective viewpoints can be attributed to specific sets of editors contributing in their own language version, and the references they employ. Editors of the various language versions participate in the English version, which results in a continually <b>contested</b> <b>article</b> often referred to (in the Serbian) as western. The Serbo-­‐ Croatian strives to be anti-­‐nationalist and apolitical, employing a variety of means to unify the Bosnian and Serbian points of view.

By presenting small states as a ‘problem’ to be ‘solved’, vulnerability discourses divert {{attention away from the}} existence of unequal power structures that, far from being the ‘natural’ result of smallness, are in fact contingent and politically <b>contested.</b> The <b>article</b> then explores these themes empirically through discussion of small developing and less-developed states in the Commonwealth and the World Trade Organisation (WTO), considering in particular how smallness has variously been articulated in terms of what small states either cannot or will not do...|$|R

What punishment entails exactly, however, and how {{it relates to the}} other aims of sentencing (crime reduction, rehabilitation, public protection and reparation), remains <b>contested.</b> This <b>article</b> outlines different conceptualizations of punishment and explores to what extent offenders subscribe to these perspectives. The analysis is supported by findings from two empirical studies on the subjective experiences of imprisonment and probation, respectively. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 male and 15 female prisoners and seven male and two female probationers. Two primary conceptualizations of punishment were identified: ‘punishment as deprivation of liberty’ and ‘punishment as hard treatment’. The comparative subjective severity of different sentences and the collateral (unintended) consequences of punishment are also discussed. It is shown that there are large individual differences in the interpretation and subjective experience of punishment, which has implications for the concept of retributive proportionality, as well as the function of punishment more generally...|$|R

Although the concept continues to enjoy widespread popularity in both scholarly and policy circles, its utility as an analytical tool is also heavily <b>contested.</b> This <b>article</b> adds to the literature critical of the ‘hybrid warfare’ concept. It argues that in addition to the fact that what is now described as a ‘hybrid’ approach to war is in fact nothing new, the problems pertaining to its utility for the study of contemporary Russia go deeper than this. ‘Hybrid warfare’ inadequately reflects the direction of Russian military modernisation and as such has led to a skewed understanding of Russian military capabilities. Moreover, the tendency to use ‘hybrid warfare’ not only to conceptualise developments in the Russian military, but in the country’s foreign policy in general, can lead to serious unintended consequences...|$|R
