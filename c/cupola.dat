5|$|<b>Cupola</b> furnace: American {{anthropologist}} Vincent C. Pigott of the University of Pennsylvania {{states that}} the <b>cupola</b> furnace existed in China at least by the Warring States period (403–221 BC), while Donald B. Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the blast furnace may have been cast directly into molds, but most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast furnace during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) was remelted in a <b>cupola</b> furnace; it was designed so that a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was dumped, the air becoming a hot blast before reaching {{the bottom of the}} furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting.|$|E
5|$|The roof is sharply angled {{toward its}} center, where a wooden <b>cupola</b> tops the building. It was {{completed}} after the building, in 1892. At {{each of the}} square shaped building's four corners are dormers, which serve {{to break up the}} monotony of the otherwise ridged roof. The dormers resemble the <b>cupola,</b> in that they are dormered as well as multi-gabled. The roof has had routine maintenance performed as required. The building's dominant feature, its <b>cupola,</b> sits on an oversized brick base with a terra cotta belt around its base top. It features blocked openings with multiple arches, double round arches, Corinthian pilasters, and organic corner detailing.|$|E
5|$|The tower's two namesake bronze bells {{hang in the}} <b>cupola</b> at {{its very}} top.|$|E
50|$|Alternative Johnson solids, {{constructed}} by rotating different <b>cupolae</b> of a rhombicosidodecahedron, are:the parabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron (J73) where two opposing <b>cupolae</b> are rotated, the metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron (J74) where two non-opposing <b>cupolae</b> are rotated and the trigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron (J75) where three <b>cupolae</b> are rotated.|$|R
50|$|The {{family of}} <b>cupolae</b> with regular polygons exists up to n=5 (pentagons), and higher if {{isosceles}} triangles {{are used in}} the <b>cupolae.</b>|$|R
50|$|The hypercupolae or {{polyhedral}} <b>cupolae</b> are {{a family}} of convex nonuniform polychora (here four-dimensional figures), analogous to the <b>cupolas.</b> Each one's bases are a Platonic solid and its expansion.|$|R
5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a <b>cupola</b> furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the <b>cupola</b> furnace to make cast iron. <b>Cupola</b> furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E
5|$|Starting in January 2005, {{the mansion}} closed {{for almost three}} years as it {{underwent}} the major restoration project. As part of the 2005–07 renovations, the drawing room and two bedchambers were completely refurbished. The drawing room's furnishings were extensively researched to reflect accurately the Mansion in the 1830–60 period. The ornate <b>cupola</b> atop the mansion was restored, including the spherical ornament above the <b>cupola,</b> which was refinished in gold leaf. The Hampton Mansion re-opened to the public on November 30, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{church of}} Maribojoc resembled a cross or {{cruciform}} with a low, four-sided pyramidical roof and octagonal <b>cupola.</b> Walls were consistently divided into {{thick and thin}} portions designed with finely cut coral stones on the sides.|$|E
50|$|The {{truncated}} cuboctahedron can be dissected into {{a central}} rhombicuboctahedron, with 6 square <b>cupolas</b> above each primary square face, 8 triangular <b>cupolas</b> above each triangular face, and 12 cubes above the secondary square faces.|$|R
50|$|A {{dissected}} truncated cuboctahedron {{can create}} a genus 5, 7 or 11 Stewart toroid by removing the central rhombicuboctahedron and either the square <b>cupolas,</b> the triangular <b>cupolas</b> or the 12 cubes respectively. Many other lower symmetry toroids can also be constructed by removing a subset of these dissected components. For example, removing half of the triangular <b>cupolas</b> creates a genus 3 torus, which (if they are chosen appropriately) has tetrahedral symmetry.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cupolas</b> {{often appear}} as small {{buildings}} {{in their own}} right. They often serve as a belfry, belvedere, or roof lantern above a main roof. In other cases they may crown a spire, tower, or turret. Barns often have <b>cupolas</b> for ventilation.|$|R
5|$|Christian Collett (1771–1833), a {{graduate}} of the Mining Academy at Kongsberg, designed the splendid Ulefoss manor, built between 1802 and 1807 by sawmill owner Niels Aall. This {{is one of the few}} brick houses in Norway, boasting a palladian layout, a central <b>cupola,</b> and a classical colonnade. Collett designed several other manors and town houses.|$|E
5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{the demands for}} {{charcoal}} used in the blast and <b>cupola</b> furnaces of the iron industry led to large amounts of deforestation of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese began using coke made from bituminous coal as fuel for their metallurgic furnaces instead of charcoal derived from wood.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Couzens {{building}} was demolished {{and the site}} was redeveloped as the James Couzens Memorial Park, dedicated to the victims. At {{the center of the}} park is the original Bath Consolidated School's <b>cupola,</b> which survived the disaster and remained on the school until the {{building was}} torn down.|$|E
50|$|The cuboctahedron can be {{dissected}} {{into two}} triangular <b>cupolas</b> {{by a common}} hexagon passing {{through the center of}} the cuboctahedron. If these two triangular <b>cupolas</b> are twisted so triangles and squares line up, Johnson solid J27, the triangular orthobicupola, is created.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cupolae</b> are a {{subclass}} of the prismatoids.|$|R
50|$|The bath {{house is}} deep, which {{is typical of}} bath-houses of whole the Absheron peninsula. Only <b>cupolas</b> were above the ground. The most biggest {{premises}} were covered with <b>cupolas.</b> Necessary temperatures of various premises had been tried to keep by an internal planning depending on their assignment.|$|R
5|$|In February 2000, {{a tree in}} the Adventureland section {{fell onto}} the DRR's Holiday Red freight train while it was in motion, {{damaging}} the awnings and their supports on the gondolas as well as knocking off the <b>cupola</b> {{on top of the}} caboose before the train came to a stop. No injuries occurred {{as a result of this}} accident.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} {{section of the}} fort, similar actions were taking place, as the airborne troops raced to destroy or otherwise disable the fortifications housing artillery pieces. Objective No. 13 was a casemate housing multiple machine-guns whose arcs of fire covered {{the western side of}} the Fort; to destroy the casemate, the airborne troops used a flamethrower to force the Belgian soldiers manning the weapons to retreat, and then detonated shaped charges against the fortification to disable it. Another observation <b>cupola</b> fitted with machine-guns, Objective No. 19, was destroyed, but two further objectives, Nos. 15 and 16 were found to be dummy installations. Unexpected complications came from Objective No. 23, a retractable <b>cupola</b> housing two 75mm artillery pieces. It had been assumed that the weapons in this fortification could not stop the airborne assault, but this assumption was found to be false when the weapons opened fire, forcing the airborne troops in the area to go to cover. The rapid fire of the weapons led to air support being summoned, and a Stuka squadron bombed the <b>cupola.</b> Although the bombs did not destroy the <b>cupola,</b> the explosions did force the Belgians to retract it {{throughout the rest of the}} fighting. Any exterior entrances and exits located by the airborne troops were destroyed with explosives to seal the garrison inside the Fort, giving the garrison few opportunities to attempt a counter-attack. The airborne troops had achieved their initial objective of destroying or disabling the artillery pieces that the fort could have used to bombard the captured bridges, but they still faced a number of small cupolas and emplacements that had to be disabled. A number of these included anti-aircraft weapons and machine-guns.|$|E
5|$|Kubah (literally <b>Cupola</b> or Dome) is an Indonesian novel {{written by}} Ahmad Tohari. It follows {{a poor man}} named Karman who becomes {{a member of the}} Indonesian Communist Party, only to find himself a victim of the ongoing {{political}} struggles in 1950s Indonesia. After the Party's destruction he spends twelve years as a prisoner at Buru before returning to his hometown and becoming a devout Muslim.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} Carolean {{features}} {{of the house is}} the balustrade and <b>cupola</b> surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The <b>cupola</b> at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, {{as is often the case}} in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|The Haynes' Building, 42-72 Princes St (cnr. Princes St and Moray Place) (Category I). Often {{now known}} as the Savoy Building after the {{restaurant}} which is its main tenant, this four-storey building was designed by Edmund Anscombe and completed in 1914. The building, with its distinctive <b>cupola,</b> is a major landmark of upper Princes Street, lying one block south of the Octagon.|$|E
5|$|The synagogue {{was built}} in 1890. Its {{architecture}} {{is typical of the}} region, with a square shape and discreet neo-romanesque ornaments. Its <b>cupola</b> was destroyed in 1940 by the Nazis and never rebuilt. The Jewish cemetery, located outside the old town, was opened in 1622. It has several 18th century gravestones showing a Christian artistic influence.|$|E

5|$|Victoria was christened privately by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Manners-Sutton, on 24June 1819 in the <b>Cupola</b> Room at Kensington Palace. She was baptised Alexandrina, {{after one}} of her godparents, Emperor Alexander I of Russia, and Victoria, after her mother. Additional names {{proposed}} by her parents—Georgina (or Georgiana), Charlotte, and Augusta—were dropped on the instructions of the Duke's eldest brother, George, the Prince Regent.|$|E
5|$|While {{acting as}} {{administrator}} of Nanyang in 31 CE, Du Shi (d. 38 CE) invented a water-powered reciprocator which worked the bellows {{of the blast}} furnace and <b>cupola</b> furnace in smelting iron; before this invention, intensive manual labor was required to work the bellows.|$|E
