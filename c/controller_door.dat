Due to massive problems mainly with the <b>door</b> <b>controllers,</b> which didn't work correctly because of the flexing floors, they were later used mainly on spur lines in north-eastern Switzerland (Kreis III). Despite being rarely used due to the problems, two trainsets (2001 and 2003) were rebuilt in 1990 and 1991, respectively, and got, among other things, a new NPZ-like livery. In 1992, all four units were defective. Instead of undergoing another revision, they were put on sidings in Glarus and were not used any more. In 1993, a single trainset was rented to the Mittelthurgaubahn, whereupon the B car was removed. The AB car had to stay, because it contained some of the trainset's systems.

50|$|In {{most cases}} an optical {{triangulation}} sensor is mounted {{near the top}} of the swinging door frame, inside a long extruded aluminum tube with an optical window facing the floor. An 880 nm LED light source emits a collimated light beam that is emitted from the sensor, bounces off the floor and is received by a photodiode positioned adjacent to the LED source. A second photodiode (or a linear array of photodiodes) is positioned farther along the length of the sensor. When the emitted beam bounces off the floor, the reflected energy is almost exclusively concentrated on the first adjacent photodiode. When a human or object moves into the optical path, the reflected beam bounces back from the object. Since the beam is no longer traveling the full optical path length to the floor, its reflected angle changes. One of the adjacent photodiodes then receives the optical energy and the sensor responds by sending a signal to the automatic <b>door</b> <b>controller.</b> At that point the door stops, slows or reverses, hence averting a collision and providing safety.|$|R

Attention was drawn to two Balloon cars, 714 and 725, which had been mothballed as they were in dire need of an overhaul. It was felt that these would be useful on the {{promenade}} during the summer due to their high seating capacity and reliability. So, with funds left over from their One-Man Operated (OMO) car programme the corporation set about rebuilding these old Balloons into [...] "Jubilee cars", named after the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977. The first to be rebuilt, 725, was stripped down to its shell and had its under-frame and body lengthened, <b>controllers</b> changed, <b>doors</b> and stairs relocated to the ends and its iconic pointed ends replaced with rectangular ones. The bogies were replaced with fabricated ones able to accommodate [...] "Metalastik" [...] rubber/ metal bonded suspension in the manner of the [...] "OMO" [...] vehicles and the tram officially entered service in 1979 after testing as Jubilee 761. Balloon 714 was later rebuilt in a similar fashion, though it retained its original central doors as well as the front ones to improve passenger flow at stops. 714 re-entered service in 1982 as Jubilee 762. Although a success and a big crowd-mover, no more were built either new or from the Balloons. Both cars were withdrawn in 2011 having become surplus to requirements due to the arrival of the Flexity 2 trams and were unsuitable for conversion to run alongside them. Therefore they entered preservation, with 761 being acquired by the Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust and 762 being donated to the National Tramway Museum at Crich. In May 2017, 761 was transferred from the Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust to Blackpool Heritage Trust.|$|R

40|$|Engineering {{faculty at}} Iowa State University have worked collaboratively with teacher {{education}} faculty since 1996 {{to offer an}} undergraduate course entitled Toying with Technology to {{elementary and secondary education}} majors 1, 2. The development of this technology literacy course provided students with an appreciation for the technological innovations that surround them. Studies have shown that students form many of their overall career and educational attitudes as early as elementary school. Elementary (and even secondary) schoolteachers who have an appreciation for technology will likely convey that appreciation to their students. This will, in turn, broaden the horizons of these students regarding the opportunities they may have regarding careers in scientific and engineering disciplines. Engineering faculty believe the Toying with Technology course is a component of the long-term recruitment of K- 12 students, particularly minorities and women, into technology-based fields 3, 4, 5. This course is designed to explain the principles behind many of the technological innovations in wide use today via a collection of hands-on laboratory experiences based upon simple systems constructed out of LEGOs and controlled by small computers. These laboratory experiences are designed to lead students, literally by their hands-on experimentation, through the use of technology in support of many everyday activities. The lab experiences are simple enough to isolate and illuminate the underlying basic principles and yet complex enough to represent real-world examples. Students typically design and construct simple models of real-world systems, including an elevator and its <b>controller,</b> a garage <b>door</b> and its opener, a computer-controlled car, and a house security system. A significant portion of this course is the many field experiences involving K- 12 students being facilitated in mobile robotics exercises by the pre-service teachers. The literature in recent years shows numerous papers on mobile robotics 1, 2, 6 - 8, many using LEGOs. There also are many references to engineering outreach efforts 3 - 5, 8 - 12. During the summer of 2000 a graduate course incorporating these mobile robotics and scanning electron microscope exercises was offered to in-service teachers and teacher education graduate students. Several of the in-service teachers who took this course are now partnered with the current undergraduate students to provide an on-going relationship among the practicing teacher, the pre-service teachers, the K- 12 students, and the engineering faculty. In effect, the practicing teacher’s classroom becomes the laboratory for the Toying With Technology course...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} I have {{designed}} {{a model of}} features, human behavior and intentions. The model suggests a set of features {{that can be used}} to describe the interaction between a human being and an automated sliding door. The model also defines symbols representing value sets for the features. The symbols are then combined in order to describe different events, mapping features to intentions. This model provides a framework guiding the capturing process as well as the reasoning process. Further, I have designed a mechanism for capturing human movement and extracting the features as suggested by the model of features, human behavior and intentions. The solution components are based on research done within computer vision, where different tools and algorithms were reviewed and evaluated. Parts of the suggested solution are provided as software libraries, while others had to be implemented. The solution includes using an Xbox Kinect as a sensor device, and the OpenNI framework together with the middleware NITE for Human body tracking and skeletal joint extraction. A reasoning mechanism was designed, that utilizes the designed model in order to reach a conclusion about the intention of a human interacting with the door. Different reasoning techniques were reviewed in context of the sliding doors problem. Based on the review I suggest using rule-based reasoning. By using the events described in the model and by giving values to the different symbols I was able to form the rules for the reasoning process. The designed mechanisms were put together in an implementation in C/C++ comprising depth and RGB image capture, body tracking, user handling and feature extraction, rule-based reasoning and door control. A motorized sliding door was built, together with a <b>door</b> <b>controller</b> allowing a computer to interface with the door, giving open and close commands. Finally, the door was tested both through a live demo and a laboratory style, structured observation. The door proved a superior performance to the traditional sliding doors when it came to identifying negative intentions, thus reducing the number of false positives drastically. However, both false positives and false negatives occurred, leaving room for improved accuracy. With my solution I have managed to interpret the intention of a user interacting with an automated sliding door. I have lifted the reasoning process to a symbolic level, dealing with symbols and events easy to understand. Although the model is limited to a very specific domain, and the solution has got some limitations and weaknesses, this is a good starting point for further work. </p...|$|R
