5|$|<b>Cats</b> <b>are</b> obligate carnivores: their {{physiology}} {{has evolved}} to efficiently process meat, {{and they have}} difficulty digesting plant matter. In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein. <b>Cats</b> <b>are</b> unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine, with taurine deficiency causing macular degeneration, wherein the cat's retina slowly degenerates, causing irreversible blindness.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cats</b> <b>are</b> {{ready to}} go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> neutered.|$|E
5|$|While the African wildcat is {{the ancestral}} {{subspecies}} from which domestic <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies {{of the same}} species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats {{on one hand and}} entirely wild animals on the other. The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. Feral <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food, but are typically wary of human interaction.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide range}} of health {{problems}} may affect cats, including infectious diseases, parasites, injuries, and chronic disease.

5|$|As {{domestic}} <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> little altered from wildcats, {{they can}} readily interbreed. This hybridization poses {{a danger to}} the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary and possibly also the Iberian Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|As of a 2007 study, <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> {{the second}} most popular pet in the US by number of pets owned, behind {{freshwater}} fish. In a 2010 study they were ranked the third most popular pet in the UK, after fish and dogs, with around 8 million being owned.|$|E

Both Cringer and Battle <b>Cat</b> <b>are</b> green with orange stripes, but Battle <b>Cat</b> <b>is</b> much larger and more muscular. In the 1980s series, Cringer speaks and is afraid of just about everything, hence the name.|$|R

5|$|As well {{as being}} kept as pets, <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> also used in the {{international}} fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets and stuffed toys; and shoes, gloves and musical instruments respectively (about 24 <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> {{needed to make a}} cat fur coat). This use has now been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cats</b> <b>are</b> common pets {{throughout}} the world, and their worldwide population exceeds 500million.

The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed <b>cat,</b> <b>is</b> its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|R
5|$|However, some pet <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> poorly socialized. In particular, older cats {{may show}} {{aggressiveness}} towards newly arrived kittens, which may include biting and scratching; {{this type of}} behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.|$|E
5|$|Several ancient {{religions}} believed <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> exalted souls, companions or {{guides for}} humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence {{decisions made by}} humans. In Japan, the maneki neko cat {{is a symbol of}} good fortune.|$|E
5|$|Since cats were venerated {{in ancient}} Egypt, they were {{commonly}} {{believed to have}} been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC). A genetic study in 2007 concluded that all domestic <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> descended from Near Eastern wildcats, having diverged around 8,000 BC in the Middle East. A 2016 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication independently in China around 5,500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domesticated populations of today. A 2017 study confirmed that domestic <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> descendants of those first domesticated by farmers in the Near East around 9,000 years ago.|$|E

5|$|A {{pedigreed cat}} is one whose ancestry is {{recorded}} by a cat fancier organization. A purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals {{of the same}} breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> exhibited as show cats. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry {{are referred to as}} domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired cats, by coat type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or mutt-cats.|$|E
5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.|$|E

Adoption is the ultimate goal, but unadoptable cats may live out their lives on the property as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They {{are often}} called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats {{when there is}} no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. <b>Cats</b> <b>are</b> often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.|$|E
5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> {{placed in front of}} a bowl of cat food. The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> each then recorded in seven different situations. The owners wager points on what their cat will do before each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of their points on the first two questions. For the remainder, they may wager any or all of their points. The cat and owner with the highest score win $25,000, and a chance to play the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E

50|$|Populations {{have also}} been {{documented}} along the coast in Thailand. Fishing <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> the least detected cats with only six photos obtained altogether in Kaeng Krachan National Park, Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park and Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area. In March 2003, a single fishing <b>cat</b> <b>was</b> photographed by a camera trap in Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary, northern Cambodia. In 2008, a fishing <b>cat</b> kitten <b>was</b> found in Botum-Sakor National Park, southwest Cambodia. In 2015, fishing <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> also recorded in a coastal wetland in Cambodia.|$|R
