40|$|This article {{argues that}} archaeologists have shown {{relatively}} little {{concern for the}} social, cultural, and economic changes in modern society associated {{with the introduction of}} new information technologies, despite our interest in such developments in past societies. As a consequence, there has been little discussion {{of the ways in which}} the application of information technologies may affect the practice of archaeology itself. Aspects investigated here include the 'scientific' reductionist processual approaches typically associated with the use of computers, the language and community of archaeological computing practitioners, the effects of distance and agents, issues of data recording and retrieval, and the implications of internet delivery of information. In the process, data may be wrenched from <b>context,</b> <b>argument</b> separated from evidence, interpretations transformed into 'facts', explicit knowledge separated from tacit knowledge, and push-button solutions substituted for knowledgeable actions...|$|E

Note: The article is presented in essentially the same form as it was pre-circulated prior to the workshop, other than minor corrections. However, in order to reflect on discussions that took place and to clarify some issues that arose, additional sections have been added throughout the text. These are broadly equivalent to footnotes in a traditional publication, but are here embedded in the body of the text and are hidden or revealed by the reader as desired. The reader can therefore see both the original paper as it was pre-circulated prior to the workshop, and the post-workshop version with additional reflections. The intention is thereby to provide a more historical perspective to the development of the ideas and arguments within the paper...|$|E

40|$|The Reserve Bank of New Zealandâ€™s (RBNZ) {{regulatory}} regime for banks {{relies on a}} combination of self, market and regulatory discipline. It follows a specific disclosure regime to support its reliance on market discipline, and this disclosure regime calls for the ready availability of two documents: the Key Information Summary and the General Disclosure Statement. The RBNZ points to retail depositors as essential market participants with the potential to exert market discipline on banks, but there are differing opinions as to their effectiveness in this role. This paper provides background comments and develops, in the New Zealand <b>context,</b> <b>arguments</b> in support of the Llewellyn & Mayes (2003) prerequisites for the exertion of effective market discipline by stakeholder monitors. We conduct empirical tests relative to some of the Llewellyn & Mayes (2003) prerequisites but find little evidence to support the proposition that they are being met among New Zealand retail depositors. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} work by {{a number}} of psychological theorists in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. It is organised in four chapters. The first gives an overview of the main issues and arguments in psychology in the mid-century and a detailed account of Henry Holland, a writer representative of the middle ground of opinion. Subsequent chapters detail the development of psychological theory by three writers - Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and G. H. Lewes - who were at the forefront of new work. However the broad <b>context</b> of <b>argument</b> is not lost. All three were polymaths who saw themselves not just as theoretical innovators, but as public spokesmen for a new and challenging attitude to the understanding of nature, society and human consciousness. Their commitment to the scientific analysis of human development questioned prevailing conceptions of the spiritual life, and the political and cultural implications of the new theory (as well as the personal commitments and backgrounds of the writers) brought them into conflict with intellectuals who possessed more orthodox outlooks. The detailed examination of psychological theory is therefore integrated with discussion of cultural <b>context.</b> <b>Arguments</b> and polemics are followed through the periodical press and other publications, including some literary material, especially by George Eliot. The intention is to produce an integrated account of the development of a body of theory in a specific cultural context and to demonstrate its growth through both the 'internal' dynamics of the search for answers to the problems set, and the 'external' cultural and social circumstances of the period in which those answers were sought...|$|R

40|$|Acceleration of {{metabolism}} {{is defined}} as a long-term increase of respiration, that is faster than the typical trajectory during the life cycle of an individual, from embryo to adult. The Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model is used to quantify the typical trajectory. All DEB parameters were estimated for over 300 animal species from most large phyla and all chordate classes. The goodness of fit is generally excellent, including embryo development (embryo weight, respiration, amount of yolk). Although many species match predictions for metabolic rates, particular taxa, including all those with larval development, but also ones with less clear larval stages, deviated and have a lower metabolic rate as embryo, compared to late juvenile and adult stages: they accelerate their metabolism during the life cycle. Five different types of acceleration are identified, examples are given, and methods are presented to recognise these different types. Associated life history traits are discussed in an evolutionary and ecological <b>context.</b> <b>Arguments</b> are presented for why accelerating species have an extra slow start of metabolism and why parental care evolved in endotherms.

40|$|The {{interplay between}} subject matter {{knowledge}} and pedagogical content knowledge, {{and the importance}} of both for the teacher, are widely acknowledged. This chapter examines the effect of a major policy initiative in England involving the introduction and embedding of government-funded pre-ITE subject knowledge enhancement courses (SKEs), with a focus upon mathematics. With reference to literature on subject knowledge in mathematics teaching, it is argued that the SKE occupies a key position in the mathematics education landscape and that this redefines our understandings of the nature of professional knowledge and the boundaries between training courses. Research demonstrates that SKEs have been successful in pre-ITE preparation, in that students who have followed an SKE route prior to teacher training have similar outcomes to those who have followed a traditional degree route. This chapter explores the argument that the existence and success of SKEs expose deficits in the traditional degree route to teacher training. The challenges posed by a rapidly shifting (im) balance between school-led and university-led teacher education could pose a threat to quality. In this <b>context,</b> <b>arguments</b> are laid out for the future of SKEs in ensuring that we continue to prepare teachers well for the demands of the classroom...|$|R
