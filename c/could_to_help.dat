5|$|On 31 January 2017, Jesé {{signed for}} Las Palmas on loan {{until the end}} of the season, with club {{chairman}} Miguel Ángel Ramírez revealing that the player had taken a massive pay cut in order to join his hometown club. The next day, he was presented in front of 9,000 fans at the Estadio de Gran Canaria, and pledged to do all he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the club qualify for European football. He debuted for the club on 6 February, coming on as a second-half substitute for Vicente Gómez in a 1−0 loss away to Granada, and made his first start the following week in a loss to Sevilla by the same scoreline.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> rescue those trapped in the flood waters {{and take care of}} the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E

Hester was {{rejected}} by the villagers even though she spent her life doing what she <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the sick and the poor.

He ordered that supplies of maize and wheat be kept in the public granaries to protect against future famines, and he ordered the storing of quantities of other provisions as well. He ordered that the Philippines ship mercury to New Spain, {{for use in the}} silver mines. Many mines had been closed for lack of mercury to extract the silver. He legalized the consumption of the mildly alcoholic drink pulque by the natives.|$|E
25|$|In June, {{after the}} last of the {{primaries}} had taken place, Obama secured the Democratic nomination for President, with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements (most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed). He was the first African American to win the nomination of a major political party in the United States. For several days, Clinton refused to concede the race, although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post-primary speech on June 3 in her home state of New York. She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7. She pledged her full support to the presumptive nominee and vowed to do everything she <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him get elected.|$|E
25|$|Plagge, as a German, felt {{responsible}} {{for some of}} the horrors he witnessed and felt compelled to work against the genocidal machine. He did what he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> some of Vilnius’ beleaguered Jews by giving work certificates to Jewish men, certifying them as essential and skilled workers regardless of their actual backgrounds. This kind of work permit protected the worker, his wife and two of his children from the SS sweeps carried out in the Vilna Ghetto in which Jews without work papers were captured and killed at the nearby Paneriai (Ponary) execution grounds. Plagge issued 250 of these life-saving permits to men, many of them without mechanical skills, thus protecting over 1,000 Jewish men, women and children from execution from 1941 to mid-1944.|$|E

500|$|After {{witnessing}} early mechanical {{television in}} action, Commissioner Lafount {{said that the}} FRC was doing all it <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> develop the still-infant technology in terms of regulatory issues. He wrote in 1931 that, [...] "I believe that television is destined to become the greatest force in the world. I think it will have more influence over the lives of individuals {{than any other single}} force." [...] This remark has been quoted in several books about the history of television. [...] He at the same time proposed the censorship of television, in order that objectionable images not be seen and the amount of advertising not be excessive.|$|E

The fourth person attending the funeral is the superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery John C. Metzler, Jr., appearing as himself. The funeral is accompanied by the song [...] "The Little Drummer Boy", sung by the boys' choir.|$|E
500|$|While {{publicly}} {{taking no}} position, Howe privately supported former External Affairs Minister Pearson for the Liberal leadership, and Pearson won the contest in January 1958. Howe advised Pearson {{not to take}} any action that might provoke an election. Pearson did not heed Howe and challenged Diefenbaker as soon as Parliament met. The election on 31 March returned the Progressive Conservatives in a record landslide, which left the Liberals with 48seats. Howe, who took no part in the campaign, had already left for Europe with his wife, Alice, on an extended holiday. [...] On his return, {{he did what he}} <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> rebuild the Liberal Party after the disaster, assisting with fundraising and seeking to unite factions within the party.|$|E

500|$|The City of San Francisco {{suffered}} a severe earthquake on April 18, 1906. Lane, {{who was living}} in north Berkeley while awaiting Senate confirmation, hurried to the city {{within hours of the}} earthquake to do what he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz immediately appointed him to the Committee of Fifty to deal with the devastation of the earthquake and subsequent fire, and plan the rebuilding of the city. According to Lane's friend, writer Will Irwin, Lane did not content himself with committee work, but personally fought the fire, helping to save much of the Western Addition. [...] In late April, the commissioner-designate took the train east to Washington, where he unsuccessfully fought to obtain Federal money to help the city's recovery.|$|E
500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would {{expect them to}} be a little upset. Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just as well as I do that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E

United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator Robert Watkins praised Norgrove: [...] "She was a true advocate for the people of Afghanistan and was dedicated to bringing improvements to their lives", and [...] "her spirit and compassion will be greatly missed". First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond said: [...] "Ms Norgrove was a dedicated aid worker who was doing everything she <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> people in Afghanistan—hopefully that legacy of service in a humanitarian cause can be of some comfort to her loved ones in their time of grief".|$|E

500|$|Wolters and {{longtime}} Speer secretary Annemarie Kempf, while not permitted direct communication with Speer in Spandau, {{did what they}} <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> his family and carry out the requests Speer put in letters to his wife—the only written communication officially allowed Speer. [...] Beginning in 1948, Speer had {{the services of a}} sympathetic Dutch orderly to smuggle mail. [...] In 1949, Wolters opened a special bank account for Speer, the Schulgeldkonto or [...] "School Fund Account", and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from Speer's activities during the war. [...] At first the funds were used only to support Speer's family, but as the amounts grew and Speer's family became increasingly able to support itself, the money was used for everything from vacations for Speer's Spandau conduit, Toni Proost, to bribes for those who might be able to secure Speer's release. [...] Once Speer became aware of the existence of the fund, he would often send detailed instructions {{about what to do with}} the money. [...] Wolters raised a total of DM158,000 for Speer over the final seventeen years of his sentence.|$|E
500|$|Rutherford's {{confrontation}} with four Watch Tower Society directors who opposed him in 1917 highlighted both the forcefulness {{of his personality}} and his determination to fight for what he believed was right. Penton claims Rutherford played [...] "hard-fisted church politics" [...] and Rogerson accuses Rutherford of using The Watchtower as a propaganda medium to attack his opposers in what was effectively a battle for his position as president. At {{the heart of his}} opponents' complaints was his [...] "autocratic" [...] behavior as he strove to [...] "exercise complete management of the Society and its affairs." [...] Penton similarly describes Rutherford's actions in his first year of presidency—including his appointment of new directors, refusal to allow the Society's accounts to be examined, and his unilateral decision to publish The Finished Mystery—as high-handed and secretive. In contrast, Rutherford claimed, [...] "It was my duty to use the power the Lord had put into my hands to support the interests of the shareholders and all others interested in the Truth throughout the world ... to be unfaithful to them would be unfaithful to the Lord." [...] Macmillan, who supported Rutherford throughout the crisis, claimed the president was extremely patient and [...] "did everything that he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> his opposers see their mistake, holding a number of meetings with them, trying to reason with them and show them how contrary their course was to the Society's charter".|$|E

[...] Broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow's 1954 exposé of Senator Joseph McCarthy had embarrassed the motion picture industry and soul-searching about its complicity in the HUAC 'witch hunt' had gone on for years. [...] Some, like actor Sterling Hayden, never made peace with themselves for caving in to the inquisitional-style politics and testifying against friends; others {{spent the rest of}} their lives in denial of the damage they had done.

Each of the other four Temptations did what they <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Williams, alternating between raiding and draining his alcohol stashes, personal interventions, and keeping oxygen tanks backstage, but Williams' health, as well as the quality of his performances, continued to decline and he refused to see a doctor.|$|E

The Palestinian Authority sent several fire trucks to help extinguish fires near the Israeli-Arab localities of Tayibe and Barta'a; on Sunday, December 5, 21 Palestinian firefighters joined the efforts in the Carmel Forest area itself.
