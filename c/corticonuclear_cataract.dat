40|$|An 80 -year-old {{woman with}} <b>corticonuclear</b> <b>{{cataract}}</b> had cataract extraction by bimanual microphacoemulsification and in-the-bag implantation of the Akreos MI 60 (Bausch & Lomb) intraocular lens (IOL). After 6 months, a complete capsulorhexis phimosis developed and surgery {{was performed to}} open and reduce the phimosis, with complete functional recovery. In the fellow pseudophakic eye, an acrylic hydrophobic Acri. Smart 48 S (Acri. Tec) IOL had been implanted without complications. We conclude that a capsulorhexis phimosis may occur {{a few months after}} uneventful cataract surgery and in-the-bag implantation of the Akreos MI 60 IOL...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{outcomes}} of coaxial microincision cataract surgery (MICS) with those of conventional coaxial cataract surgery. SETTING: University Eye Clinic, Geneva, Switzerland. METHODS: In a prospective study, 50 eyes of 50 patients with nuclear or <b>corticonuclear</b> <b>cataract</b> (grades 2 to 4 on the Lens Opacities Classification System III) were randomly selected to have cataract extraction through a temporal clear corneal incision using 1 of 2 techniques: coaxial MICS (25 eyes) or conventional coaxial cataract surgery (25 eyes). Coaxial MICS was performed through a 1. 6 mm incision and conventional coaxial cataract surgery, through a 2. 8 mm incision. In all cases, a flexible hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (Lentis L- 303, WaveLight GmbH) was implanted. Intraoperative parameters were ultrasound time, surgical time, and total volume of balanced salt solution used. The best corrected visual acuity, corneal thickness, and endothelial cell count were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: There were no relevant clinical differences between groups or perioperative complications in either group. The only {{statistically significant differences between}} the 2 groups were ultrasound time (P =. 0002) and surgical time (P =. 005). CONCLUSIONS: Coaxial microincision cataract surgery was a safe and effective technique. Although ultrasound and surgical time were significantly higher with coaxial MICS than with conventional coaxial cataract surgery, the postoperative results in the 2 techniques were comparable...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{outcomes}} of bimanual microphacoemulsification and coaxial miniphacoemulsification and assess the potential advantages of the former over the latter. SETTING: Institute of Ophthalmology, University of Modena, Modena, Italy. METHODS: In a controlled prospective clinical trial, 100 eyes of 50 patients with nuclear or <b>corticonuclear</b> <b>cataract</b> of grade 2 to 4 on the Lens Opacities Classification System III had phacoemulsification. Fifty eyes were randomized to have surgery by the bimanual technique and 50, by the coaxial technique. All surgeries were performed by the same surgeon using the same machine (Sovereign WhiteStar, American Medical Optics). In all cases, the incision was made superiorly in clear cornea and a hydrophobic acrylic flexible intraocular lens (Acri. Smart 48 S, Acri. Tec) was implanted. Intraoperative parameters were mean phacoemulsification time, total phacoemulsification percentage, effective phacoemulsification time (EPT), total volume of balanced salt solution (BSS) used, total surgical time, and final size of the corneal incision. Postoperative parameters were visual acuity, astigmatism changes by vector analysis, corneal thickness, endothelial cell count, and presence of flare and cells in the anterior chamber. RESULTS: The only statistically {{significant difference between the}} 2 groups was the total volume of the BSS used (P =. 004) and total surgical time (P =. 045). CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques were safe and effective for cataract surgery. With bimanual microphacoemulsification, significantly less BSS was used and the total surgical time was significantly shorter than with the coaxial method...|$|E
