In 1994 {{it was agreed that}} they would remain on the castle parapet as historical reference. In 2012 following complaints from the ANC member of parliament Nomfunelo Mabedla, all the flags were removed from the parapet apart from the <b>current</b> <b>flag</b> of South Africa and the removed flags were placed in the castle's museum.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{declaration}} of independence, Kosovo was under {{the administration of the}} United Nations and used the UN flag for official purposes. The Serbian and Albanian populations had used their own national flags since the Soclialist Yugoslavia period. The Serbs use a red, blue and white tricolor, which forms the basis of the <b>current</b> <b>flag</b> of Serbia. The Albanian population have used the flag of Albania since the 1960s as their nationality flag. Both flags can still be seen and used within Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|The <b>current</b> <b>flag</b> design {{represents}} {{a dramatic change}} {{in the evolution of the}} Portuguese standard, which had always been closely associated with the royal arms, blue and white. Since the country's foundation, the national flag developed from the bluecross-on-white armorial square banner of King Afonso I to the liberal monarchy's arms over a blue-and-white rectangle. In between, major changes associated with determinant political events contributed to its evolution into the current design.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the flags}} of Puerto Rico. The flags of Puerto Rico {{represent}} and symbolize the island and people of Puerto Rico. The most commonly used flags of Puerto Rico are the <b>current</b> <b>flag,</b> which represents the people of the commonwealth of Puerto Rico; municipal flags, which represent the different regions of the island; political flags, which represent the political beliefs of the people; and sports flags, which identify Puerto Rico as the country represented by its athletics during competitions.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} used in Lithuania's first period of {{independence}} (in the 20th century) from 1918 to 1940, which ceased with the occupation first by Soviet Russia and Lithuania's illegal annexation into the Soviet Union, and then by Nazi Germany (1941–44). During the post-World War II Soviet occupation, from 1945 until 1989, the Soviet Lithuanian flag consisted first of a generic red Soviet flag {{with the name of}} the republic, then changed to the red flag with white and green bars at the bottom. The last alteration to the <b>current</b> <b>flag</b> occurred in 2004, when the aspect ratio changed from 1:2 to 3:5.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag {{has been in}} use since June 7, 1995, one of two symbols adopted in the 1995 referendum. The main elements of the flag is a red and green bicolor, then decorated with an ornament pattern at the hoist position. The <b>current</b> <b>flag</b> is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle was placed near the top-hoist corner and the ornament colors were inverted. Several flags used by government officials and agencies {{were based on the}} {{national flag}}.|$|E

5|$|Two {{recently}} designed national flags {{resemble the}} Japanese flag. In 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, and it adopted a national flag {{that had a}} green background, charged with an off-centered red disc that contained a golden map of Bangladesh. The <b>current</b> <b>flag,</b> adopted in 1972, dropped the golden map and kept everything else. The Government of Bangladesh officially calls the red disc a circle; the red color symbolizes the blood that was shed to create their country. The island nation of Palau uses a flag of similar design, but the color scheme is completely different. While the Government of Palau does not cite the Japanese flag as an influence on their national flag, Japan did administer Palau from 1914 until 1944. The flag of Palau is an off-centered golden-yellow full moon on a sky blue background. The moon stands for peace and a young nation while the blue background represents Palau's transition to self-government from 1981 to 1994, when it achieved full independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag of Ecuador, {{which consists of}} horizontal bands of yellow (double width), blue and red, was first adopted by law in 1835 and later on 26 September 1860. The design of the <b>current</b> <b>flag</b> was finalized in 1900 {{with the addition of}} the coat of arms {{in the center of the}} flag. Before using the yellow, blue and red tricolor, Ecuador used white and blue flags that contained stars for each province of the country. The design of the flag is very similar to those of Colombia and Venezuela, which are also former constituent territories of Gran Colombia. All three are based on a proposal by Venezuelan General Francisco de Miranda, which was adopted by Venezuela in 1811 and later Gran Colombia with some modifications. There is a variant of the flag that does not contain the coat of arms that is used by the merchant marine. This flag matches Colombia's in every aspect, but Colombia uses a different design when her merchant marine ships are at sail.|$|E
5|$|Following the Hong Kong {{handover}} ceremony, {{when the}} Union Jack and the Hong Kong blue ensign were lowered to symbolise {{the end of}} British rule in Hong Kong, the blue ensign lost its official status {{and was replaced by}} the <b>current</b> <b>flag</b> of Hong Kong. In the 2010s, the former flag of Hong Kong was used by protesters to represent the cultural differences between Hong Kong and China; the flag was also used to protest Chinese interference in Hong Kong, as well as perceived Chinese breaches of Hong Kong's universal suffrage (granted by the Sino-British Joint Declaration). The first high-profile use of the old flag in protests came in 2011 during pro-democracy protests. Protesters often stated that they did not use the blue ensign to endorse Hong Kong independence or the return of Hong Kong to British control, but rather because they felt that Hong Kong had greater freedom under British rule. The protesters also said that they used the flag to express the contrasting values of China and Hong Kong. Advocates of the Hong Kong Independence Movement and the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement use a derivative of the blue ensign, without the Union Jack and with the Chinese characters for Hong Kong (香港) in the centre of the arms. The right to display the old flag is protected under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and the Hong Kong Basic Law as an expression of free speech. Despite this, when the old flag began appearing in protests, pro-Beijing newspapers called for it to be banned. The pro-Beijing camp views the flag as a symbol of colonialism and a reminder of China's losses during the era of New Imperialism.|$|E

50|$|Flag {{design has}} a history, and new designs often refer back to {{previous}} designs, effectively quoting, elaborating, or commenting upon them.

50|$|The flag of Gran Colombia {{was based}} on Francisco de Miranda's tricolour, which served as the {{national}} flag of the First Republic of Venezuela.

25|$|If a new flag design {{had been}} chosen, {{assuming}} no intellectual property issues, the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981 {{would have been}} updated to reflect the new design six months {{to the day after}} the second referendum results were declared (or earlier by Order in Council). The <b>current</b> <b>flag</b> would have remained the official flag until then; for example, the <b>current</b> <b>flag</b> would have been flown during the 2016 Summer Olympics, four months after the second referendum took place, regardless {{of the results of the}} second referendum. This result would not have changed the coat of arms (which includes the current national flag), national Māori flag, nor the flags of Associated States (Cook Islands and Niue), nor the New Zealand Red Ensign (merchant marine), White Ensign (naval), (both incorporating Union Flags) police flag and fire service flag (which are based on the <b>current</b> <b>flag).</b> It would also not change New Zealand's status as a constitutional monarchy in the Commonwealth of Nations.|$|E
