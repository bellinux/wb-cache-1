40|$|<b>Confined</b> non-reacting {{turbulent}} <b>jets</b> {{are ideal}} for recirculating the hot flue gas back into the furnace from an external exhaust duct. Such jets are also used inside the furnace to internally entrain and recirculate the hot flue gas to preheat and dilute the reactants. Both internal and external implementation of <b>confined</b> turbulent <b>jets</b> increase the furnace thermal efficiency. For external implementation, depending on the circumstances, the exhaust gas flow may be co- or counter-flow relative to the jet flow. Inside the furnaces, fuel and air jets are injected separately. To create a condition which can facilitate near homogeneous combustion, these jets have to first mix with the burned gas inside the furnace and simultaneously being heated and diluted prior to combustion. Clearly, the combustion pattern and emissions from reacting <b>confined</b> turbulent <b>jets</b> are affected by jet interactions, mixing and entrainment of hot flue gas. In this work, the flow and mixing characteristics of a non-reacting and reacting <b>confined</b> turbulent <b>jet</b> are investigated experimentally and numerically. This work consists of two parts: (i) 	A study of flow and mixing characteristics of non-reacting <b>confined</b> turbulent <b>jets</b> with co- or counter-flowing exhaust/flue gas.

40|$|Supersonic jet with a co-flow, closely {{bounded by}} walls {{is known as}} {{supersonic}} <b>confined</b> <b>jet.</b> Supersonic <b>confined</b> <b>jet</b> is encountered in practical devices like the supersonic ejector. Mixing of the primary and the secondary fluid inside the confined passage is complex. From a design perspective, {{it is necessary to}} have an accurate knowledge of the mixing length (L-MIX). Tracers that do not actively participate in the flow behavior but rather mark the fluids such that they faithfully follow the fluid motion are known as passive scalars. Passive scalars help in the understanding the progression of mixing amidst interacting flows. In this work, we have performed passive scalar mixing studies in a supersonic <b>confined</b> <b>jet</b> for different operating conditions using an existing low area ratio (AR = 3. 7) rectangular supersonic gaseous ejector. Air is used as the working fluid in both the primary and the secondary flow. The design Mach number of the primary flow nozzle (M-PD = 1. 5 - 3. 0) and the total pressure of the primary flow (P-OP = 4. 89 - 9. 89 bar) are varied during the experiments. Using the planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique and acetone as the passive scalar, L-MIX is determined. A 266 nm Nd-YAG laser with a repetition rate of 8 Hz is used to excite the acetone molecules in the flow field, and the emitted fluorescence is captured by an ICCD camera. A new method is proposed to study the passive scalar distribution from the acetone PLIF images through digital image processing. Spatial Scalar Fluctuations Intensity (SSFI or psi) is a parameter defined at every transverse section along the flow direction. Based on the variation of psi along the jet, the location of L-MIX can be identified. L-MIX is defined as the length from the supersonic nozzle exit where psi first attains a value of 0. 05. For the first time, L-MIX is quantified in a supersonic <b>confined</b> <b>jet.</b> L-MIX values are observed to be in the range of 3 H to 6 H for the cases under study, where H is the height of the confined passage. The behavior of L-MIX is closely dependent on the nozzle operating conditions.

This study also provides other supersonic <b>confined</b> <b>jet</b> characteristics like the potential core length (L-PC) and the shock cell spacing (S-x) of the primary supersonic jet.

This paper investigates the heat transfer and hydrodynamic characteristics of a <b>confined</b> impinging liquid <b>jet</b> with a nozzle-to-plate spacing (H/D) ratio of 0. 5. A custom measurement facility was created to infer local heat transfer rates from infra-red images of a jet impinging on a l 2. 5 thick stainless steel foil configured to generate uniform heat flux. Particle-Image Velocimetry (PIV) was performed in order to obtain quantitative velocity data within the jet. A series of experiments were run for Reynolds numbers (Re) in the range of 1, 000 - 24, 000 for a jet of 8 mm diameter (D).

The effect of introducing a contraction nozzle of area ratio four, located two test section diameters downstream of the inlet, is to dramatically reduce the size and shape of the central recirculation zone for the swirling flows considered. The shear stresses are found to increase by an order of magnitude in the region of the contraction nozzle because of large radial gradients of axial velocity. Reduction of the expansion ratio to D/o = 1 causes the time mean flow field to be homogeneous throughout the entire test section with the tangential velocity dominating in the swirling cases.

Large-scale periodic fluctuations such as macro instability (MI) phenomena in a mixing vessel and jet flows in a <b>confined</b> <b>jet</b> were experimentally analyzed by means of LDV. The influences of different sized (0. 5 mm- 2 mm) glass particles (0 %vol - 6. 2 %vol) on the velocity and turbulence distribution in a jet were investigated, {{as well as the}} effects of varying the amounts of solid particles (up to 11. 8 %vol) on the frequency and amplitude of macro instabilities. Two component LDV measurements were conducted at different locations in the jet and in the mixing vessel. The values were evaluated using the Lomb algorithm to obtain frequency spectra of the liquid flow. The average axial and lateral velocities, as well as RMS distributions, were determined together with the integral length scale in the <b>confined</b> <b>jet</b> to analyse particle effect. The particle Stoke number was evaluated for the different sized particles and the different flow situations. The results showed that the MI frequency is not influenced by the addition of solids. However, the MI amplitude was reduced by the addition of the solid phase although still detectable up to the highest concentration measured (11. 8 %vol). The particles (1. 5 mm) with a Stokes number of 1. 1, related to the time scale of MI phenomena, caused an increase in MI strength at intermediate solids loading. This phenomenon could not be observed for smaller particles. No change in the rate of decrease of the centreline velocity or the jet expansion ratio could be observed in the <b>confined</b> <b>jet</b> configuration. The RMS values in the jet increased at high particle loadings; the increase was particularly pronounced in the shear layer close to the nozzle.
