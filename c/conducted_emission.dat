40|$|The size {{of passive}} {{components}} in an adjustable speed drive {{can be reduced}} by using small dc-link capacitors. The EMI filter in the drive also consists of passive components. The size of the filter can be reduced by using a three-level inverter, which can have low output voltage distortion. However, the three-level inverter based on small dc-link capacitors requires a PWM strategy to maintain neutral-point voltage balance. In this paper, the common mode voltage, which is the determining factor for the EMI filter size, is analyzed for a virtual-vector-based PWM strategy. The common mode voltage, the shaft voltage, and the <b>conducted</b> <b>emission</b> for the small dc-link capacitor based three-level inverter are {{compared with that of}} the two-level inverter operated with space vector PWM strategy.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{compatibility}} (EMC) is {{the ability}} of equipment and system to function as intended without degradation or malfunction in their intended operational electromagnetic environment. Further, the equipment or system should not adversely affect the operation of, or be adversely affected by any other equipment. There are two categories of Electromagnetic Compatibility; (1) Eectromagnetic Susceptibility (EMS) (2) Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). EMS and EMI can be further divided into two categories namely radiated and conducted. <b>Conducted</b> <b>emission</b> is the unwanted currents that are produced by electronic and electrical equipments emitted through the power lines. The main sources of <b>conducted</b> <b>emission</b> are common mode current and differential mode current. These currents will interfere with any equipments that are connected to the same power lines. EMC standards pertaining to the <b>conducted</b> <b>emission</b> (such as EN 55014) define the limit lines that should not be exceeded or the product cannot be marketed. In order to avoid non-compliance to the standards, most electronic/electrical equipments have power line filter installed into them. However, these filters are not effective enough because they were designed without considering the emission currents characteristics. This project proposed a method to improve the design of a power line filter by analyzing the characteristic of the emission current noise. The results from the statistical measurements can be used to identify the range of frequencies where most of the noises are located. Eighty four blenders were used as a sample to identify the characteristic of the noise. It was found out that the <b>conducted</b> <b>emission</b> exceed the limit line from 150 kHz to 1 MHz by 5 dB and by lOdB at frequencies from 1 MHz to 30 MHz. A butterworth filter with cut-off frequency of 70. 56 kHz and bandwidth from 0 to 120 kHz was designed. The parameters of the filter were based on the statistical data of the <b>conducted</b> <b>emission.</b> The test result shows that the filter attenuate the noise about 42 dB at frequency range of 150 kHz to 10 MHz and lOdB at frequency range from 10 MHz to 30 MHz. The low attenuation at frequencies from 10 MHz to 30 MHz is due to the existence of capacitive and skin effect.

40|$|AbstractâThis paper {{deals with}} the issue of {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI) in SiC-JFET inverter power modules, and proposes a solution to limit <b>conducted</b> <b>emissions</b> at high frequencies. SiC-JFET inverters can achieve very fast switching, thereby reducing commutation losses, at the cost of a high level of EMI. In order to limit <b>conducted</b> EMI <b>emissions,</b> it is proposed to integrate small-value common mode (CM) capacitors, directly into the power module. High frequency noise, which is usually difficult to filter, is then contained within the module, thus keeping it far from the external network. This approach is in line with the current trend towards the integration of various functions (such as protection, sensors or drivers) around power devices in modern power modules. To demonstrate this concept, the resulting CM noise was investigated, and compared with a standard configuration. Simulations were used to design the integrated capacitors, and measurements were carried out on an experimental SiC-JFET half-bridge structure. A significant reduction was achieved in the experimentally observed CM <b>conducted</b> <b>emissions,</b> with a very minor influence on the switching waveforms, losses and overall size of the system. The benefits and limitations of this design are discussed, for the case of mid-power range inverters for aircraft applications.
