40|$|FUNDAMENTOS: A capilaroscopia é método não invasivo e reprodutível capaz de analisar diretamente os capilares na região periungueal, auxiliando no diagnóstico diferencial das doenças do tecido conectivo. OBJETIVOS: Estudar, por meio da capilaroscopia periungueal, pacientes com lúpus eritematoso cutâneo crônico, lúpus eritematoso sistêmico e grupo controle. MÉTODOS: Foram analisados 70 pacientes pela capilaroscopia periungueal, sendo 37 com lúpus eritematoso cutâneo crônico e 33 com forma sistêmica, comparados a 32 indivíduos sadios. RESULTADOS: A presença de capilares ectasiados (p= 0, 027; p= 0, 001), enovelados (p= 0, 001; p= 0, 007) e em saca-rolhas (p= 0, 011;p= 0, 005), além de hemorragias capilares (p= 0, 004; p= 0, 001) foram parâmetros capazes de discriminar os dois grupos de pacientes do grupo controle. A variável capilar enovelado demonstrou ser preditiva para o diagnóstico de lúpus eritematoso sistêmico (OR= 8, 308). As variáveis independentes capilares ectasiados (OR= 12, 164) e hemorragias capilares (OR= 5, 652) foram preditoras para lúpus eritematoso cutâneo crônico. CONCLUSÃO: A capilaroscopia é útil na prática clínica, pois pacientes com alterações capilaroscópicas específicas parecem ter maior probabilidade de desenvolver lúpus eritematoso. As variáveis preditoras independentes para lúpus eritematoso sistêmico foram capilares enovelados e para lúpus eritematoso cutâneo crônico foram capilares ectasiados e hemorragias capilares. BACKGROUND: Capillaroscopy is {{an useful}} {{diagnostic}} tool that is non-invasive, reproducible, able {{to assess the}} capillaries in the periungal region and that assists in the differential diagnosis of connective tissue diseases. OBJETIVES: The aim {{of the study was}} to distinguish <b>chronic</b> cutaneous <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> and systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> from controls assessed by nailfold capillaroscopy. METHODS: Seventy patients with <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> (37 with <b>chronic</b> cutaneous <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> and 33 with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus)</b> were studied by the technique of capillary microscopy and compared to 32 controls. RESULTS: The presence of ectatic (p= 0. 027; p= 0. 001), meandering (p= 0. 001; p= 0. 007), corkscrew capillaries (p= 0. 011; p= 0. 005) and nailfold bleeding (p= 0. 004; p= 0. 001) distinguished between the two groups of patients (<b>chronic</b> cutaneous <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> and systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus)</b> from controls. The variable meandering loops could be predictive for systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> (OR= 8. 308). The independent variables ectatic loops (OR= 12. 164) end nailfold bleedings (OR= 5. 652) were predictive for <b>chronic</b> cutaneous <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Capillaroscopy can help in the management of patients, since the presence of typical capillaroscopic abnormalities seems to be related to the development of <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> The independent predictive variables for systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> were meandering loops, and, for <b>chronic</b> cutaneous <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> ectasic loops and nailfold bleedings...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> profundus (LEP), <b>lupus</b> panniculitis is {{a variant}} of <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> in which {{inflammation}} occurs mainly in the deeper corium and subcutis. It {{may be associated with}} systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> <b>chronic</b> cutaneous <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> or may occur as an isolated phenomenon. It affects mostly adults between 20 and 60 years of age, predominantly women. Its occurrence in children is uncommon. The typical clinical presentation is that of one to several indurated subcutaneous nodules or plaques with predilection to appear in areas of marked fat deposition – buttocks, proximal segments of the extremities, face. LEP tends to have a chronic and in the majority of patients a benign course. Several less common clinical variants; linear, affecting the periocular tissue, anetodermic and affecting the breasts have been described as well as occasional association with hereditary complement deficiencies and antiphospholipid syndrome. LEP has characteristic histopathologic findings in the subcutis: hyaline degeneration of fat, lymphocytic mainly lobular panniculitis, lymphoid nodules and lymphocytic vasculitis. LEP requires differentiation from panniculitis in other connective tissue diseases. Differentiation from subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma may be difficult and concurrence of this form of lymphoma with LEP has been described.

PACIENTES E MÉTODOS: Foram estudados retrospectivamente 290 pacientes com lúpus eritematoso cutâneo crônico no período de 1982 a 1996, na Clínica de Dermatologia da Santa Casa de São Paulo. RESULTADOS: A média de idade da instalação da doença foi de 32, 3 anos, houve predomínio do sexo feminino em relação ao masculino (3, 4 : 1), a maior parte dos pacientes teve lesões localizadas no segmento cefálico (58, 3 %). Quanto às variedades clínicas, houve predomínio da placa discóide típica em 90, 4 % dos casos, seguida das variantes verrucosa ou hipertrófica (7, 9 %), lúpus eritematso pérnio (1, 4 %), e túmida (0, 3 %).

40|$|SUMMARY Anti-DNA {{antibodies}} {{have been}} detected previously in patients with <b>chronic</b> discoid <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> (DLE) {{despite the absence of}} overt systemic manifestations. 27 patients with DLE were followed up 3 years after the detection of anti-DNA antibodies in 7. None had developed other features of systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> We conclude that the occasional finding of anti-DNA antibodies in patients with DLE does not predict those likely to develop systemic disease. The detection of serum anti-DNA antibodies is an important adjunct to the investigation and manage-ment of patients with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> (SLE) (Hughes, 1971). In the absence of systemic disease, patients with chronic discoid lupus ery-thematosus (DLE) usually do not have anti-DNA antibodies (Prystowsky et al., 1976). However, some studies using sensitive techniques have reported the presence of anti-DNA antibodies in a proportion of patients with DLE (Mandel etal., 1972; Sylvester e...|$|R

The dog later developed hyperthermia, lethargy, apparent joint pain, peripheral lymphadenomegaly, vomiting, and diarrhea. Relevant laboratory tests results included anemia, thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, and an elevated antinuclear antibodies serum titer.

Histological examination showed atrophy of the epidermis with aggression from epidermal-dermal interface and periadnexal and perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate.

40|$|Discoid <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> (DLE) is {{the most}} common form of <b>chronic</b> {{cutaneous}} <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> Classic DLE lesions begin as red-purple macules, papules or small plaques and rapidly develop a hyperkeratotic surface.

Examination revealed erythematous, disc-like, scaly plaques over the face, nose and scalp, showing signs of healing accompanied by scarring and hypopigmentation. Histopathologic examination verified a diagnosis of DLE. Topical steroids and antifungals were applied to the lesions twice daily for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of application, all lesions regressed significantly. Follow-up is important and necessary every 6 months because DLE is considered as a pre-cancerous condition and for the early detection of systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> and to minimize scarring.
