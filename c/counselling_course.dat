40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe main purpose of the research was to explore factors that facilitate learning in psychodynamic <b>counselling</b> <b>courses.</b> The psychodynamic approach has no intrinsic theory of learning. The research approach was therefore conceptualised from a sociocultural model to enable an understanding of students’ learning within the social concept of the course. The learning environments were Higher Education psychodynamic <b>counselling</b> <b>courses</b> at two UK Universities. Eight adult students were encouraged to use qualitative judgements and personal views and reflections on what supported or constrained their learning {{during the course of}} their studies. Data were collected at important points across four years of study and analysed from a critical understanding of sociocultural theories (Vygotsky, 1934, 1962) and psychoanalytic/psychodynamic psychotherapeutic theories (Freud, 1963). Results are presented for a qualitative study from snapshots in time in the light of these seminal theorists’ work as well as more modern theorists’ application of historic thought to modern circumstance. Nine dominant themes emerged from data analysis, which related to students’ personal development. These themes were: autonomy; self-changes; closeness; encouragement/ discouragement; individual learning process; ambivalence about judging the tutor; private life; self-esteem and confidence. The over-arching theme that emerged was the tutor-student relationship, understandable in sociocultural constructivist terms as enabling learning within a zone of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1978, 1986) and in psychodynamic terms as provision of a secure base from which students journeyed towards autonomous independent learning. The outcome suggests that eliciting and analysing students’ views may be important when planning and teaching counselling training in order to meet students’ individual learning needs. The originality of this research lies in its use of elements of the two paradigms to create lenses in an innovative way. A sociocultural constructivist framework has been used through which to understand psychodynamic counselling learning and training...|$|R

She also worked with Wilfred Bion, and wrote many books and papers on psychoanalytic training and child development. Her colleague James Gammill cites Mrs Klein as saying: "She is one of the best people I have ever known for the psychoanalysis of children … and she has a mind of her own. " Harris was responsible for the child psychotherapy training at the Tavistock Clinic from 1960 onwards, developing laterally the method founded on infant observation that had been put in place by Esther Bick. She established cross-clinic work discussion groups, a pioneering schools’ <b>counselling</b> <b>course</b> (in collaboration with her husband Roland Harris), and individual work with disturbed children in the school environment. Her belief that psychoanalytic ideas could and should “travel”, both geographically and across the professions, led to her seeding the “Tavi Model” in many other countries through regular teaching trips, in company with her later husband Donald Meltzer. Her influence was not as a theorist, but as a teacher with an extraordinary capacity to engage processes of introjective learning in both students and readers. This tribute by some of those who studied with her is not simply testimony to a remarkable teacher and clinician whose wisdom has been rarely equalled; it also offers inspiration to others who may be struggling to find ways of using psychoanalytic ideas imaginatively in a variety of contexts - clinical, social or scholarly - in what can at times appear to be an unreceptive world...|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought a}} better {{understanding}} of the role played by student counsellors’ religious commitment as they develop the empathic competencies necessary to become effective counsellors. This phenomenon was explored within a <b>counselling</b> <b>course</b> at the Open Campus, University of the West Indies, Barbados. The literature shows there has been no such study carried out within this locality, and that there is a dearth of empirical research that explores the complex interplay between counsellor empathy and their religious commitment. The theoretical orientation was grounded in the counselling literature with emphasis on the integrative approach to counselling used within the class. Three highly religiously committed students and three low committed students were selected based on their religious commitment scores using the Worthington et al Religious Commitment Inventory. The data for these six respondents were analysed using a thematic approach, from which the main findings were obtained. A further sample of three moderate religiously committed students was also selected and their data analysed to see if the categories held up with a different sample. Methods used to gather data were qualitative personal narratives and responses from an open-ended questionnaire. The Thwaites & Bennett-Levy empathy typology was used to analyse and interpret students’ professional empathy. These findings were then compared with the students’ opinions of how they thought their religion would impact on their counselling practice. Because theory suggests the potential for positive and negative functions of religion, I was open to the possibility of both influences impacting on students’ empathy. The findings suggest that students’ religious commitment is not as great a determinant of effective professional empathy, as is the maturity of the students and how they process and manage their religion. The findings are significant in that they would serve to inform counselling trainers who work in similar situations...|$|E

A cross-sectional survey using semi-structured questionnaires and problem-based scenarios was carried out. Responses were compared to those recommended in the World Health Organization (WHO) Breastfeeding <b>Counselling</b> <b>Course.</b> The setting was a rural area of KwaZulu Natal, with a population of 220 000 people. At the time of the study approximately 36 per cent of pregnant women were HIV-infected and no programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission was in place. A convenient sample of 71 healthcare workers (14 doctors, 25 professional nurses, 16 staff nurses, and 16 community health workers) were included in the study. Over 50 % of respondents had given breastfeeding advice to clients over the previous month. However, there were significant discrepancies in breastfeeding knowledge compared to WHO recommendations. Ninety-three per cent (n = 13) of doctors knew that breastfeeding should be initiated within 30 min of delivery, but 71 per cent (n = 10) would recommend water, and 50 per cent (n = 7) solids to breastfed infants under 6 months of age. Fifty-seven per cent (n = 8) considered glucose water necessary for neonatal jaundice, constipation, and for infants immediately after delivery. Only 44 per cent (n = 7) of staff nurses and 56 per cent (n = 14) of professional nurses knew that breastfeeding should be on demand. The majority would recommend water, formula milk, and solids to breastfed infants under 6 months of age, and glucose water for neonatal jaundice and immediately after delivery. Knowledge of community health workers differed most from WHO recommendations: only 37 per cent (n = 6) knew that breastfeeding should be initiated within 30 min of delivery, 68 per cent (n = 11) thought breastfeeding should be on schedule and not on demand, and the majority would recommend supplements to infants under 6 months of age. Few respondents suggested taking a feeding history or observing a breastfeed in response to the problem scenarios. The most commonly given responses to problems of babies who were perceived to be thirsty, unsatisfied, or crying after feeds was to supplement with other fluids or feeds. There is a need for systematic and ongoing training in breastfeeding and infant feeding counselling in the context of HIV, so that breastfeeding is not undermined by the current HIV pandemic, and exclusive breastfeeding continues to be promoted for all HIV-uninfected women, women of unknown status, and HIV-infected women who choose to breastfeed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these two presentations was to {{highlight}} some of the outcomes of an Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada funded research project designed {{to answer the following}} questions: 1. How well are graduate counsellor education programs doing in preparing practitioners for working in multicultural contexts and addressing social justice issues? 2. What are the most influential learning contexts, processes, or activities in the development of multicultural counselling and social justice competency? The two presentations funded through this A&PDF award focused on the critical incidents in development of multicultural counselling and social justice competency identified by three groups of research participants: graduate students, counsellors, and practicum supervisor. One of the central differences across the groups was that, unlike current counselling students, most counsellors and practicum supervisors had little or no training in these areas as part of their graduate education. They were educated in a context and within a particular theoretical model that did not embrace the importance of cultural diversity to counselling in the way most programs currently do. They developed competence through their interactions with diverse clients, their own self-study, and consultation with others in the field. Current students, on the other hand, had considerable exposure to multicultural issues in their programs and noted, in particular the importance of experiential, consciousness-raising, and applied practice learning activities. However, their learning experiences seemed to impact attitudes and knowledge more profoundly than specific skill acquisition. In particular, they noted deficits in skills for advocacy and other forms of social justice action. Students also noted that most of their learning emerged from one course on multicultural counselling, rather than being integrated across all courses. There are a number of important implications of this research, particularly given the increased support in the counselling literature of both the need and the ethical imperative of competency in these areas: 1. 	Current practitioners and practicum supervisors may lack competency in these areas, unless they have been exposed to, and motivated towards self-study, by the cultural diversity of their clients. 2. 	These existing practitioners and supervisors are role models for new practitioners and practicums students, which suggests that continuing education and professional development opportunities may need to be provided to match their awareness and competency to current professional expectations. 3. 	The importance of exposure to diverse clientele during graduate counsellor education training also suggests that university programs may need to take {{a more active role in}} both ensuring appropriate role modeling and diversity of clientele in student practicum placements. 4. 	There is a need to increase learning opportunities that foster the development of skills competencies for multicultural counselling and, more particularly, social justice action. 5. 	The integration of theory and practice and the infusion of multicultural and social justice competency development across all courses in graduate counsellor education programs offer the best hope of optimizing student competency development. These presentations have now been published in the following journals: Collins, S., Arthur, N., Brown, C. (2013).

Academic Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies, 2 (9), 105 - 115. doi: 10. 5901 /ajis. 2013. v 2 n 9 p 105 In many countries, counselling psychology has increasingly attended to the diverse needs of clients within multicultural societies. In North America, emphasis has been placed on nondominant populations, whose experiences of discrimination, cultural oppression, and social, economic, and political marginalization, have a significant impact on psychosocial wellbeing. Counsellors are expected to engage in social justice action, with or on behalf of clients, to effect change in organizations, communities, or broader social systems. The purpose of this study was to examine how well counsellor education programs in Canada are preparing counsellors for both multicultural counselling and social justice. Most research has focused on curriculum content; less attention has been paid to how that content is taught and the efficacy of those learning processes in facilitating competency. The critical incident technique was used to solicit examples of effective and less effective learning processes from graduate students. The qualitative data was analyzed to isolate, cluster, and relate emergent concepts; a critical lens also highlighted missing constructs. The most common learning contexts were the multicultural <b>counselling</b> <b>course</b> and the applied practicum. Four themes emerged that reflect current research: fostering of self-awareness, application of theory to practice, engagement of affect through experiential exercises, and exposure to diversity. Infusion of multicultural and social justice competency throughout curricula is also widely advocated, but was reflected in only four percent of the critical incidents. Engagement in social justice roles and activities was also missing. Enhancements to both curriculum content and process are required to support the social justice agenda...|$|E

Design: A qualitative design was used utilizing a mixed-method approach. Data were collected using semistructured interviews and the repertory-grid technique. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis (interviews) and the repertory grids were analysed qualitatively using a four-stage procedure. Sample: A convenience sample of six healthcare professionals undertaking a <b>counselling</b> skills <b>course</b> completed both interviews.

The development of attentive listening, both in terms of objective and subjective findings, was evident. Students perceived that personal qualities, such as warmth and caring, were essential. All participants identified that the group were supportive and that this enhanced learning. The students changed their practice by improving their skills, increasing their awareness and by developing deeper therapeutic relationships with patients and their carers.
