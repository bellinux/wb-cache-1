As <b>Catherine</b> <b>cries,</b> their mother enters (the same actress who plays the mother to the two sisters in the story) and the scene switches back to Marie-Catherine with her hands on Bluebeard's head on a platter.|$|R

Crier lamented how Americans have tended to neglect participating in voluntary associations, and tend to live as [...] "strangers apart from the rest", quoting Tocqueville. In contrast, writer Eboo Patel in Newsweek suggested that president Obama had a somewhat different sense of active citizenship, meaning strong families, a vibrant civic center in which persons of different faiths and secular backgrounds work together, with government acting as a [...] "catalyst." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{its debut}} 17 million {{households}} {{were able to}} watch FNC; however, it was absent from the media markets of New York City and Los Angeles. Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as Fox on Crime or Fox on Politics, surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts {{at the bottom of}} the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was The Schneider Report, with Mike Schneider's fast-paced delivery of the news.

50|$|The 19-year-old Edna married Clarke Hall on 22 December 1898. Although he had {{previously}} encouraged and supported his wife's studies, there were tensions between Edna's artistic ambitions and her husband's expectation that she conform to a traditional wifely role. For the next two decades, Edna Clarke Hall's art became a very personal activity only shared with close friends and occasionally shown in group exhibitions. Shortly after their marriage, the Clarke Halls rented a sixteenth-century house called 'Great Tomkins' on Upminster Common. This house reminded Edna of Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, inspiring {{the first of the}} many illustrations of scenes from the novel that she would create. For the rest of her artistic life Clarke Hall added to the Wuthering Heights drawings and etchings during periods of emotional crisis. They portrayed scenes such as the distraught <b>Catherine</b> <b>crying</b> for the absent Heathcliff and Heathcliff supporting the dying Catherine. One of her drawings of the latter scene was inscribed with the quote ‘Let me alone! If I've done wrong, I'm dying for it'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it you, then, {{that have}} changed him {{and made him}} so unnatural?" [...] <b>Catherine</b> <b>cried.</b> [...] "Is it you that have worked on him and taken him from me? He doesn't belong to you, and I don't see how you have {{anything}} to do with what is between us! Is it you that have made this plot and told him to leave me? How could you be so wicked, so cruel? What have I ever done to you; why can't you leave me alone? I was afraid you would spoil everything; for you DO spoil everything you touch; I was afraid of you all the time we were abroad; I had no rest when I thought that you were always talking to him." [...] Catherine went on with growing vehemence, pouring out in her bitterness and in the clairvoyance of her passion (which suddenly, jumping all processes, made her judge her aunt finally and without appeal) the uneasiness which had lain for so many months upon her heart.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 the CCADP website {{was once}} again in the news when it was {{reported}} that the coalition had posted a web site for convicted killer Scott Peterson. During that August of that year, both Lamourie and Parkinson were busy making appearances on various television and radio programmes across North America, including <b>Catherine</b> <b>Crier</b> Live on Court TV, The Abrams Report on MSNBC, The BIG Story and Fox News Live on the Fox News Channel, The Michael Coren Show on CFRB AM 1010 in Toronto ON, and McIntyre in the Morning - Talkradio 790 KABC AM - Los Angeles, California, just to name just a few.|$|E
50|$|After Schneider left FNC in 1997, {{the program}} was reformatted as the Fox News Report, with Jon Scott and <b>Catherine</b> <b>Crier</b> taking over as co-anchors. At its start, the Fox Report aired on Monday through Friday evenings. After Crier left FNC to become a host/correspondent for Court TV (now truTV) and Scott was {{subsequently}} removed as an anchor, Paula Zahn became the solo anchor of the program, then retitled as the Fox Report with Paula Zahn. Zahn anchored the newscast until she became host of The Edge later that year, at which point Shepard Smith was named the program's main anchor and its title amended as simply the Fox Report. This marked the first incarnation of {{what would become the}} flashy, fast-paced newscast it evolved into under Smith's tenure. In particular, Smith started the trend of peppering news scripts with participles instead of using complete sentences.|$|E

50|$|While {{taking their}} report, Detective David Rae finds that Lily has once before been {{reported}} missing, Catherine and Matthew reluctantly reveal {{that she had}} disappeared {{for a few days}} and turned up at a friend's house. After further investigation, Rae learns that one of Lily's Coonaburra teachers, Neil McPherson, had sex with her. When Matthew found out, he beat up McPherson. The Parkers admit to Rae that they left Coonaburra to escape the attention. Catherine becomes frustrated with Matthew's focus on his job as a pharmacist, though he insists that he has no choice, since the community needs his services. Rae's queries in town reveal that Lily had multiple sexual relationships despite being underage. When Catherine finds Lily's diary, it includes pictures and poetry about several people: McPherson, the Parker's mentally handicapped handyman Burtie, and a local youth nicknamed Slug. It also describes her parents' marriage as a sham, which causes <b>Catherine</b> to <b>cry.</b> <b>Catherine</b> hands the diary to Rae with the proviso that he not reveal it to Matthew.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first person}} to {{withdraw}} from competition was La Hiena Barrios in season four and José María Listorti replaced him.

She never came back and Cinthia Fernández took her place only a few rounds before the Season Finale.|$|R
