500|$|A solitary <b>Chilean</b> <b>flamingo,</b> named Pink Floyd {{after the}} English rock band, wintered at the Great Salt Lake. He escaped from Salt Lake City's Tracy Aviary in 1987 {{and lived in}} the wild, eating brine shrimp and socializing with gulls and swans. (Pink Floyd is often {{referred}} to as a [...] "he", although the bird's gender is not actually known.) A group of Utah residents suggested petitioning the state to release more flamingos in an effort to keep Floyd company and as a possible tourist attraction. [...] Wildlife biologists resisted these efforts, saying that deliberate introduction of a non-native species would be ecologically unsound and might have detrimental consequences. Pink Floyd was last seen in Idaho (where he was known to migrate) in 2005. [...] He has not been seen since then and is presumed not to have survived the winter of 2005–2006.|$|E

One of the largest birds in the world, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) can be seen in Patagonia.
