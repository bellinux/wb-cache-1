40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} the {{influence}} of accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process on the microstructure and the mechanical characteristic is investigated. Therefore, AZ 31 magnesium sheets were successfully deformed through ARB for a maximum of three passes. Twin roll <b>cast</b> <b>sheets</b> and twin roll <b>cast</b> <b>sheets</b> with subsequent heat treatment (480 °C, 1 h) were used as initial materials. After one ARB pass, the highest microstructure changes were measured. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) reveals a bimodal microstructure with an average grain size of ~ 1 µm. In comparison to the initial material a strong basal texture was measured. The significant refinement of grain size after severe plastic deformation cause an increase of tensile and compressive strength, e. g. rising yield stress and ultimate tensile strength of 42 % and 15 %, respectively. However, the maximum formability remains nearly at the same level. Further ARB passes do not improve the mechanical characteristics further...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith {{the broader}} {{utilization}} {{of a variety}} of aluminum alloys in the automotive industry for structural lightweight applications, the need for resistance spot welding (RSW) of dissimilar aluminum alloys is increasing. General Motors (GM) has developed a proprietary RSW process using a multi-ring, domed electrode geometry that significantly improves the performance of the aluminum resistance spot welds. In addition, to enhance structural performance, epoxy adhesivesare also often applied prior to RSW to obtain weld-bonded joints. As a contribution, the load-controlled fatigue behavior of dissimilar aluminum alloy spot welds made of 2 mm thick AA 5754 wrought sheet and 3 mm thick Aural 2 die <b>casting</b> <b>sheet</b> with and without the addition of adhesive prior to welding was studied. The same GM proprietary resistance spot welding electrode and current schedule was applied to both welding conditions leading to a larger nugget size when using adhesive, but both weld configurations presented similar maximum load in tension-shear testing. X-ray computed tomography was used to detect internal welding discontinuities such as voids and also to follow the damage evolution and fatigue crack initiation and growth during interrupted fatigue testing of the spot welds. The results show that the main fatigue crack initiates {{at the edge of the}} nugget and penetrates through the Aural 2 die <b>casting</b> <b>sheet</b> in the thickness direction. Using the structural stress concept, it was also found that the structural stress-fatigue life curve for AA 5754 to Aural 2 aluminum spot welds with and without adhesive falls into a master curve indicating that the nugget size which corresponds to the tensile and bending strength dominates fatigue life...|$|E
