5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{there was an}} {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecognized <b>cattle</b> <b>disease</b> in the northern United States and Canada. Cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures and on some occasions, spontaneously. For example, 21 out of 22 cows died after dehorning and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration. All of these animals had bled to death.|$|E

25|$|FAO {{established}} an Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases in 1994, {{focusing on the}} control of diseases like rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease and avian flu by helping governments coordinate their responses. One key element is the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme, which has advanced to a stage where large tracts of Asia and Africa have now been free of the <b>cattle</b> <b>disease</b> rinderpest {{for an extended period}} of time. Meanwhile, Locust Watch monitors the worldwide locust situation and keeps affected countries and donors informed of expected developments.|$|E

25|$|John's successor, whom he {{apparently}} despised, was Henry of Stoke. He {{took steps to}} improve the abbey's finances. In particular, he retained the services of William of Shareshill, a talented lawyer, to maximise the abbey's income from its endowments. Shareshill was very successful and received the lease of Boningale as a reward. However, <b>cattle</b> <b>disease</b> in the 1330s and the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 struck hard. The labour shortage brought the community to its knees. Abbot Henry resigned in 1350 and in 1351 Edward III appointed Shareshill and William Banaster as custodians to restore solvency.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of the Bechuanaland Campaign was from 24 December 1896 to 30 July 1897. In April 1896, a severe outbreak of <b>cattle</b> <b>disease</b> occurred, which required that all cattle in the area needed to be slaughtered {{in an attempt to}} contain the disease. This was resented by the local Tswana population who, as a result, rose up in protest. A number of engagements occurred and, following a build-up of more Colonial reinforcements in July 1897, the conflict ended after a final action at Langberg on 30 July and 1 August 1897, in which most of the Tswana leaders were either killed or surrendered. Veterans of this campaign were awarded the Bechuanaland Clasp.|$|E
25|$|Mlimo, the Ndebele spiritual/religious leader, is {{credited}} with fomenting much of the anger {{that led to this}} confrontation. He convinced the Ndebele and Shona that the white settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) were responsible for the drought, locust plagues and the <b>cattle</b> <b>disease</b> rinderpest ravaging the country at the time. Mlimo's call to battle was well timed. Only a few months earlier, the British South Africa Company's Administrator General for Matabeleland, Leander Starr Jameson, had sent most of his troops and armaments to fight the Transvaal Republic in the Jameson Raid. This left the country’s defences in disarray. The Ndebele began their revolt in March 1896, and in June 1896 they were joined by the Shona.|$|E

60|$|The {{western part}} of this barbaric north from the German forests to South Russia and Turkestan and from Gothland to the Alps was the region of origin of the Nordic peoples and of the Aryan speech. The eastern steppes and deserts of Mongolia was the region of origin of the Hunnish or Mongolian or Tartar or Turkish peoples--for all these several peoples were akin in language, race, and way of life. And as the Nordic peoples {{seem to have been}} {{continually}} overflowing their own borders and pressing south upon the developing civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean coast, so the Hunnish {198} tribes sent their surplus as wanderers, raiders and conquerors into the settled regions of China. Periods of plenty in the north would mean an increase in population there; a shortage of grass, a spell of <b>cattle</b> <b>disease,</b> would drive the hungry warlike tribesmen south.|$|E

60|$|Both meteorites {{and stone}} hatchets, {{as well as}} all other forms of thunderbolt, are in {{excellent}} repute as amulets, not only against lightning, but against the evil eye generally. In Italy they protect the owner from thunder, epidemics, and <b>cattle</b> <b>disease,</b> the last two of which are well known to be caused by witchcraft; while Prospero in the 'Tempest' is a surviving proof how thunderstorms, too, can be magically produced. The tongues of sheep-bells ought to be made of meteoric iron or of elf-bolts, in order to insure the animals against foot-and-mouth disease or death by storm. Built into walls or placed on the threshold of stables, thunderbolts are capital preventives of fire or other damage, though not perhaps in this respect quite equal to a rusty horseshoe from a prehistoric battlefield. Thrown into a well they purify the water; and boiled in the drink of diseased sheep they render a cure positively certain. In Cornwall thunderbolts are a sovereign remedy for rheumatism; and in the popular pharmacopoeia of Ireland they have been employed with success for ophthalmia, pleurisy, and many other painful diseases. If finely powdered and swallowed piecemeal, they render the person who swallows them invulnerable {{for the rest of his}} lifetime. But they cannot conscientiously be recommended for dyspepsia and other forms of indigestion.|$|E
