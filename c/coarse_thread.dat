50|$|Limits for Metric (standard) <b>Coarse</b> <b>Threads</b> According To ISO 965.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coarse</b> <b>threads</b> {{are more}} {{resistant}} to stripping and cross threading because they have greater flank engagement. <b>Coarse</b> <b>threads</b> install much faster as they require fewer turns per unit length. Finer threads are stronger as they have a larger stress area for the same diameter thread. Fine threads {{are less likely to}} vibrate loose as they have a smaller helix angle and allow finer adjustment. Finer threads develop greater preload with less tightening torque.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coarse</b> <b>threads</b> {{are those}} with larger pitch (fewer threads per axial distance), and fine threads are those with smaller pitch (more threads per axial distance). <b>Coarse</b> <b>threads</b> {{have a larger}} threadform {{relative}} to screw diameter, where fine threads have a smaller threadform relative to screw diameter. This distinction is analogous to that between coarse teeth and fine teeth on a saw or file, or between coarse grit and fine grit on sandpaper.|$|R

In the course of this business, there is a multitude of sheeve-holes and blocks, through which you must pass it; often the rope is a very tight fit, so as to make it like threading a fine cambric needle with rather <b>coarse</b> <b>thread.</b> Indeed, it is a thing only deftly to be done, even by day. Judge, then, what it must be to be threading cambric needles by night, and at sea, upward of a hundred feet aloft in the air.|$|E
60|$|The {{athletic}} African, who {{had been}} posted on the forecastle for his vast strength, cast an eye upward, and, with both arms thrust into his bosom, he rolled along the deck, with just as serious a mien {{as though he had}} been sent on a duty of the greatest import. The uproar over his head had drawn a most helpless-looking mortal from a retired corner of the birth-deck, to the ladder of the forward hatch, where, with a body half above the combings, a skein of strong <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> around his neck, a piece of bees-wax in one hand, and a needle in the other, he stood staring about him, with just that sort of bewildered air that a Chinese mandarin would manifest, were he to be suddenly initiated in the mysteries of the ballet. On this object the eye of Scipio fell. Stretching out an arm, he cast him upon his shoulder; and, before the startled subject of his attack knew into whose hands he had fallen, a hook was passed beneath the waistband of his trowsers, and he was half way between the water and the spar, on his way to join the considerate Fid.|$|E
6000|$|Ornamentation, {{when it does}} {{begin to}} appear, arises at first in a {{strictly}} practical and unintentional manner. Later examples elsewhere show us by analogy how it first came into existence. The Indians of the Ohio seem to have modelled their pottery in bags or nettings made of <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> or twisted bark. Those of the Mississippi moulded them in baskets of willow or splints. When the moist clay thus shaped and marked by the indentations of the mould was baked in the kiln, it of course retained the pretty dappling it received from the interlaced and woven thrums, which were burnt off {{in the process of}} firing. Thus a rude sort of natural diaper ornament was set up, to which the eye soon became accustomed, and which it learned to regard as necessary for beauty. Hence, wherever newer and more improved methods of modelling came into use, there would arise an instinctive tendency {{on the part of the}} early potter to imitate the familiar marking by artificial means. Dr. Klemm long ago pointed out that the oldest German fictile vases have an ornamentation in which plaiting is imitated by incised lines. 'What was no longer wanted as a necessity,' he says, 'was kept up as an ornament alone.' ...|$|E

60|$|When in this neighbourhood, I {{several times}} {{heard of the}} Sierra de las Cuentas: a hill distant many miles to the northward. The name signifies hill of beads. I was assured that vast numbers of little round stones, of various colours, each with a small {{cylindrical}} hole, are found there. Formerly the Indians used to collect them, {{for the purpose of}} making necklaces and bracelets--a taste, I may observe, which is common to all savage nations, {{as well as to the}} most polished. I did not know what to understand from this story, but upon mentioning it at the Cape of Good Hope to Dr. Andrew Smith, he told me that he recollected finding on the south-eastern coast of Africa, about one hundred miles to the eastward of St. John's river, some quartz crystals with their edges blunted from attrition, and mixed with gravel on the sea-beach. Each crystal was about five lines in diameter, and from an inch to an inch and a half in length. Many of them had a small canal extending from one extremity to the other, perfectly cylindrical, and of a size that readily admitted a <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> or a piece of fine catgut. Their colour was red or dull white. The natives were acquainted with this structure in crystals. I have mentioned these circumstances because, although no crystallised body is at present known to assume this form, it may lead some future traveller to investigate the real nature of such stones.|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{improvement}} in computer performance over {{the last twenty years}} has come from faster transistors and architectural advances that increase parallelism. Historically, parallelism has been exploited either at the instruction level with a grain-sie of a single instruction or by partitioning applications into <b>coarse</b> <b>threads</b> with grain-sies of thousands of instructions. Fine-grain threads fill the parallelism gap between these extremes by enabling tasks with run lengths as small as 20 cycles. As this fine-g rain parallelism is orthogonal to ILP and <b>coarse</b> <b>threads,</b> it complements both methods and provides an opportunity for greater speedup. This paper describes the efficient communication and synchronization mechanisms implemented in the Multi-ALU Processor (MAP) chip, including a thread creation instruction, register communication, and a hardware barrier. These register-based mechanisms provide 10 times faster communication and 60 times faster synchronization than mechanisms that operate via a shared onchip cache. With a three-processor implementation of the MAP, fine-grain speedups of 1. 2 - 2. 1 are demonstrated on a suite of applications...|$|R
50|$|The {{first person}} to create a {{standard}} (in about 1841) was the English engineer Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a <b>coarser</b> <b>thread</b> than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became British Standard Whitworth, abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the British Standard Fine (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth <b>thread</b> was too <b>coarse</b> for some applications. The thread angle was 55Â°, and the depth and pitch varied with {{the diameter of the}} thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the <b>coarser</b> the <b>thread).</b> Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.|$|R

50|$|The #6-32 UNC is a thicker screw {{with a more}} <b>coarse</b> <b>thread.</b> This {{makes it}} more {{suitable}} for fastening larger parts and thicker materials requiring increased holding strength.

The integrated flange provides greater holding strength with less risk of pull through. The hex head makes it easier to work with during assembly with powered torque screwdrivers.|$|E

50|$|A {{square nut}} is a four-sided nut. Compared to {{standard}} hex nuts, square nuts {{have a greater}} surface {{in contact with the}} part being fastened, and therefore provide greater resistance to loosening (though also greater resistance to tightening). They are also much less likely to become rounded-off after repeated loosening/tightening cycles. Square nuts are typically mated with square-headed bolts. Square nuts are used along with flat washers in order to avoid damage from its sharp edges and helps to increase the strength of the fastener. Square nuts can have standard, fine or <b>coarse</b> <b>threading</b> with platings of zinc yellow, plain, zinc clear, tin and cadmium, among others.
