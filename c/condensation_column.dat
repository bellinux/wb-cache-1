40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} a {{low-temperature}} thermally driven desalination unit exploiting the HD (humidification/dehumidification) process. The system is a closed air cycle unit {{and is based on}} a single-effect humidification/dehumidification technique: heated seawater is introduced into the humidification section of a closed tunnel to saturate the circulating air; then the water vapor in moist air separates within the <b>condensation</b> <b>column,</b> where freshwater production takes place. A HD desalination prototype has been designed, assembled and fully instrumented in order to monitor all physical quantities and to evaluate the performance under different operating conditions. The prototype has been experimentally investigated on a test facility established at the Bergamo University Labs. The results of the measurement campaign are presented and discussed. A computer code for simulating the desalination process has also been developed and it was validated by the experimental data. The modeling procedure investigates air and water thermodynamic properties across every component and allows to predict the HD desalination unit performance, varying seawater and air flow rates, the heat source temperature level and the heat exchanger surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Effects {{of natural}} and {{anthropogenic}} aerosol particles on the radiation budget in cloudy atmospheres are still a major research topic. For example, can an increase or decrease in aerosol particle number, originating from changed dimethylsulfide (DMS) and isoprene emissions by marine phytoplankton, impact the earth radiation budget via increasing or decreasing planetary albedo and lifetime of clouds? And if so, is a shifted cloud droplet spectrum accompanied by a regional change in precipitation? Here, we show by a synergistic analysis of satellite observations (MODIS, SeaWiFS, AIRS, SSM/I and CERES) that the phytoplankton related emission of the mentioned gases into the atmosphere strongly influences cloud properties within a broad latitude belt in the Southern Hemisphere during the austral summer. For this season we detected indirect aerosol effects over the Southern Ocean from 45 S to 65 S, especially in regions with plankton blooms, indicated by high chlorophyll-a concentration in seawater. The strong increase in cloud <b>condensation</b> nuclei <b>column</b> content from 2. 0 × 108 to more than 5. 0 × 108 CCN/cm 2 for a chlorophyll increase from 0. 3 to about 0. 5 mg/m 3 in these regions decreases cloud droplet effective radius and increases cloud optical thickness for water clouds. Consequently, the upward short-wave radiative flux {{at the top of}} the atmosphere increases. Our analysis also reveals reduced precipitation over the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone during strong plankton blooms. We suggest that due to fine particles formed in the atmosphere originating from gaseous DMS and possibly isoprene emissions the reduction of precipitation is caused by delayed homogeneous freezing in water clouds. © 2011 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{calculations}} of <b>condensation</b> outside a <b>column</b> of horizontal smooth tubes {{have been carried}} out in order to investigate the influence of mass transfer resistance for a zeotropic refrigerant mixture. Diffusive transport is calculated locally in both phases. Calculation results show that mass transfer resistance in the gas phase reduces heat transfer by 10  20 % for a binary mixture with a glide similar to that of R 407 C. The decrease in heat transfer due to poor mixing in the condensate is from 15 to 65 % for the conditions investigated; the lower the duty, the greater the decrease. Results show that if assuming mixing in the condensate by diffusion only, the degrees of mixing and the duty dependency are similar to results in earlier work where calculations were matched to experimental data. Diffusion {{is likely to be the}} dominant mixing mechanism in the condensate, and the mixing is poor under certain conditions, which might explain the drop in condenser performance for some heat pump applications...|$|R
40|$|Transient, Thermal-hydraulics, Two-phase, Pipeline, TREMOLO The TREMOLO {{computer}} {{program has been}} used to analyze two-phase flow transients in service water piping systems in nuclear power plants in response to NRC Generic Letter 96 - 06 (USNRC, 1996).   These analyses have been concerned with two-phase flow heat transfer in containment fan coolers and waterhammer events resulting from steam <b>condensation</b> and water <b>column</b> rejoining. To support these applications, the TREMOLO code has been validated with benchmarks against available data. TREMOLO utilizes a “dynamic benchmarking ” feature first introduced by Henry (1996 a, 1996 b, 1997 a, 1997 b) and Paik (1996) whereby a set of dynamic benchmarks is embedded in the source code and is exercised every time the archived code is updated. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is two-fold: to present the concept of dynamic benchmarking as implemented in TREMOLO and to provide benchmark results used to validate the TREMOLO code for nuclear power plant applications related to Generic Letter 96 - 06.   Insights gained during the benchmarking effort related to key phenomena and relevant computer models are also provided in the discussion of benchmark results. 1...|$|R

40|$|Previously {{observed}} twice-Clausius–Clapeyron (2 CC) scaling for extreme precipitation at hourly {{time scales}} {{has led to}} discussions about its origin. The robustness of this scaling is assessed by analyzing a subhourly dataset of 10 -min resolution over the Netherlands. The results confirm {{the validity of the}} previously found 2 CC scaling for extreme convective precipitation. Using a simple entraining plume model, an idealized deep convective environmental temperature profile is perturbed to analyze extreme precipitation scaling from a frequently used relation based on the <b>column</b> <b>condensation</b> rate. The plume model simulates a steady precipitation increase that is greater than Clausius–Clapeyron scaling (super-CC scaling). Precipitation intensity increase is shown to be controlled by a flux of moisture through the cloud base and in-cloud lateral moisture convergence. Decomposition of this scaling relation into a dominant thermodynamic and additional dynamic component allows for better understanding of the scaling and demonstrates the importance of vertical velocity in both dynamic and thermodynamic scaling. Furthermore, systematically increasing the environmental stability by adjusting the temperature perturbations from constant to moist adiabatic increase reveals a dependence of the scaling on the change in environmental stability. As the perturbations become increasingly close to moist adiabatic, the scaling found by the entraining plume model decreases to CC scaling. Thus, atmospheric stability changes, which are expected to be dependent on the latitude, may well {{play a key role in}} the behavior of precipitation extremes in the future climate.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{response}} of atmospheric circulations to changes in surface temperature is investigated. Both cloud-scale and planetary-scale circulations are considered, {{and a number of}} different theoretical and numerical tools are employed. First, mechanisms maintaining the thermal stratification of a convecting atmosphere are examined based on simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) over a wide range of surface temperatures and radiosonde observations of the tropical troposphere. It is argued that cloud entrainment plays a role in determining the lapse rate of convecting regions of the atmosphere, and that this may explain the large increase in convective available potential energy (CAPE) with warming found in the simulations. Increases in updraft velocity are also found in the RCE simulations as the atmosphere warms. The magnitude of these increases is explained through a conceptual model based on an entraining plume. The results imply that the increase in CAPE identified above is important in determining the behavior of the simulated cloud updrafts in a warming atmosphere. The precipitation distribution in RCE is also examined. The scaling of precipitation extremes with temperature is found to be amplified by increases in the mean fall speed of hydrometeors as the atmosphere warms. The hydrometeor fall speed affects precipitation rates by altering a measure of the efficiency with which <b>condensation</b> within the <b>column</b> is converted to precipitation at the surface. The potential relevance of this mechanism for convective precipitation extremes on Earth is discussed. Finally, the large-scale atmospheric circulation response to increasing surface temperature is investigated through a novel transformation of the governing equations. The transformation allows for an upward shift of the circulation with warming, and it is applied to a hierarchy of numerical simulations, including simulations with both idealized and comprehensive general circulation models. The transformation is found to reproduce some of the features of the simulated circulation responses to warming in the middle and upper troposphere, and it has potential applications in understanding the source of inter-model scatter in climate model simulations of global warming. by Martin Simran Singh.
