50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul</b> was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Turdus. The <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul</b> is considered {{to belong to a}} superspecies along with the Himalayan bulbul, white-eared bulbul, white-spectacled bulbul, African red-eyed bulbul, and the common bulbul. Alternate names for the <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul</b> include the Cape geelgat and two names used for other species (common and dark-capped bulbul).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul</b> is {{a common}} and {{conspicuous}} bird, which tends to perch {{at the top of}} a bush. It is active and noisy, usually seen in pairs or small groups foraging for fruit, nectar and insects.|$|E
5000|$|The Himalayan bulbul is {{considered}} {{to belong to a}} superspecies along with the white-eared bulbul, white-spectacled bulbul, African red-eyed bulbul, <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul,</b> and common bulbul. The alternate name, white-cheeked bulbul, is also used by the white-eared bulbul.|$|E
5000|$|Many renosterveld {{trees and}} shrubs produce berries, which attract fruit-eating birds (e.g. <b>bulbuls,</b> <b>Cape</b> white-eyes) and other animals (e.g. {{geometric}} tortoises, chacma baboons).|$|R
40|$|In coevolutionary arms races, like between cuckoos {{and their}} hosts, {{it is easy}} to {{understand}} why the host is under selection favouring anti-parasitism behaviour, such as egg rejection, which can lead to parasites evolving remarkable adaptations to 'trick' their host, such as mimetic eggs. But what about cases where the cuckoo egg is not mimetic and where the host does not act against it? Classically, such apparently non-adaptive behaviour is put down to evolutionary lag: given enough time, egg mimicry and parasite avoidance strategies will evolve. An alternative is that absence of egg mimicry and of anti-parasite behaviour is stable. Such stability is at first sight highly paradoxical. I show, using both field and experimental data to parametrize a simulation model, that the absence of defence behaviour by <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbuls</b> (Pycnonotus capensis) against parasitic eggs of the Jacobin cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus) is optimal behaviour. The cuckoo has evolved massive eggs (double the size of bulbul eggs) with thick shells, making it very hard or impossible for the host to eject the cuckoo egg. The host could still avoid brood parasitism by nest desertion. However, higher predation and parasitism risks later in the season makes desertion more costly than accepting the cuckoo egg, a strategy aided by the fact that many cuckoo eggs are incorrectly timed, so do not hatch in time and hence do not reduce host fitness to zero. Selection will therefore prevent the continuation of any coevolutionary arms race. Non-mimetic eggs and absence of defence strategies against cuckoo eggs will be the stable, if at first sight paradoxical, result...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul</b> is 19-21 cm long, mainly dull, blackish {{brown with}} a {{diagnostic}} white eye-ring, and yellow undertail coverts. The head {{has a small}} crest. The short, straight bill, legs and feet are black and the iris is dark brown. The sexes are similar in plumage.|$|E
50|$|The African red-eyed bulbul was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Turdus. The African red-eyed bulbul is considered {{to belong to a}} superspecies along with the Himalayan bulbul, white-eared bulbul, white-spectacled bulbul, <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul,</b> and the common bulbul. The alternate name of 'red-eyed bulbul' is also used by the Asian red-eyed bulbul.|$|E
50|$|In South Africa, {{biological}} control {{is being used}} {{in an attempt to}} manage Solanum mauritianum - the flowerbud weevil Anthonomus santacruzi is being used as a control agent. S. mauritianum is a favoured food plant of the African olive pigeon (Columba arquatrix), the <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul,</b> the Black-collared barbet, the Red-eyed dove and red-whiskered bulbul.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus capensis) is {{a member}} of the bulbul family of {{passerine}} birds. It is an endemic resident breeder in coastal bush, open forest, gardens and fynbos in western and southern South Africa. This species nests mainly in the southern spring from September to November. The nest is thick walled cup concealed by foliage in a small tree or shrub.|$|E
50|$|The {{white-spectacled bulbul}} was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Ixos. The white-spectacled bulbul is considered {{to belong to a}} superspecies along with the Himalayan bulbul, white-eared bulbul, African red-eyed bulbul, <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul,</b> and the common bulbul. Alternate names for the white-spectacled bulbul include the several names used for other species (black-capped, dark-capped, spectacled and yellow-vented bulbul) and one name (white-eyed bulbul) shared with the cream-vented bulbul.|$|E
5000|$|The white-eared bulbul was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Ixos. The white-eared bulbul is considered {{to belong to a}} superspecies along with the Himalayan bulbul, white-spectacled bulbul, African red-eyed bulbul, <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul,</b> and the common bulbul. Formerly, some authorities considered the white-eared bulbul to be a subspecies of the Himalayan Bulbul. The alternate name, white-cheeked bulbul, is also used by the Himalayan bulbul. In Iran it is sometimes referred to as [...] "the bulbul of Tehran".|$|E
50|$|The {{common bulbul}} was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Turdus. Some authorities treat the Somali, Dodson's and dark-capped bulbul as subspecies of the common bulbul. The common bulbul is considered {{to belong to a}} superspecies along with the Himalayan bulbul, white-eared bulbul, white-spectacled bulbul, African red-eyed bulbul, and the <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul.</b> Alternate names for the common bulbul include the black-eyed bulbul, brown bulbul (also used for the Asian red-eyed bulbul), brown-capped geelgat, common garden bulbul, garden bulbul and white-vented bulbul as well as one name used for another species (yellow-vented bulbul).|$|E
5000|$|As a youngster, Liversidge {{lived for}} various periods in India, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, {{and it was}} as a schoolboy that his {{interest}} in birds originated. His initial training, however, was in engineering, when he was apprenticed as a fitter and turner. He began at the University of Cape Town, in engineering, in 1946. Working full-time as a technician at the university, he then commenced studies in zoology and botany, one subject a year, finally graduating in 1955. He took up an appointment as ornithologist at the Port Elizabeth Museum, where he began his study of the ecolology of the <b>Cape</b> <b>bulbul</b> which in due course he wrote up for a PhD.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{ecological}} life history of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Bulbul</b> Pycnonotus capensis {{was carried out in}} 20 hectares of coastal dune forest near Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Results from four years 1959 to 1962 are given in detail and only the number of breeding pairs present in 1958 have been used from observations that year. The <b>Cape</b> <b>Bulbul</b> is one of three closely related species of a predominantly tropical family. Intra specific breeding is rare and occurs only where man has altered the habitat. Distribution has altered slightly in 150 years where colonisation has occurred. Several conditions may influence distribution, the species is mainly limited to within winter or all year round zones of rainfall. Population of breeding pairs varies from nine to 19 pairs. It is the commonest species in the area. There is a 25 % annual adult mortality with life expectancy of an adult about three years. Competition for food is negligible. Predators concern mainly the nesting cycle. Clutch size which is two or three is not regulated by food supply or population changes. Main changes are due to emigration and immigration which is apparently influenced by density-independent factors...|$|E
40|$|I {{examined}} the breeding biology of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Bulbul</b> Pycnonotus capensis at a study site in Port Elizabeth for a {{comparison with the}} results obtained by Richard Liversidge from a study made 40 years ago. There were no differences in methods, so results were directly comparable. No {{differences were found between}} the two study periods in the timing of breeding, clutch size, number of fledglings per nesting attempt or successful nesting attempt, indicating no major shift in the life history strat-egy or breeding success of the population. During my study period, there was a strong calendar effect on breeding success: early nests were more likely to be successful than late ones. I found strong differences between bush species with regard to predation risk and brood parasitism risk by the Jacobin Cuckoo Clamator jacobinus. These differences emphasise the com-plex interaction between the timing of breeding, risk of predation and risk of brood parasitism, which influences decisions about when to start nesting and nest site selection in the <b>Cape</b> <b>Bulbul.</b> The breeding biology of animals is influenced by a great number of factors, such as food supply, predation risk and nest site selection, amongst others (Newton 1998). Changes in the breeding biology or even anatomy can be related to changes in the abiotic (Hughes 2000, Yom-Tov 2001, Gjerdrum et al. 2003) or biotic environment (Boveng et al...|$|E
40|$|The allotonic {{frequency}} hypothesis (AFH) {{proposes that}} {{the preponderance of}} moths in the diets of some bats (e. g., Rhinolophidae) {{is the result of}} these bats echolocating at allotonic frequencies, that is, outside of the typical hearing range of most moths (ca., 20 [...] 60 kHz). The broader hearing range of African moths (5 [...] 110 kHz) suggests that their ears may function at frequencies usually considered allotonic. We investigated 1) whether moth ears were functionally audible to the Cape horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus capensis (Rhinolophidae), which forages in dense vegetation and echolocates at 84 kHz, and 2) whether moth auditory sensitivity below 10 kHz allows them to detect the rustling noises made by bird predators as they pursued moths through vegetation. The calls of R. capensis were audible to moths albeit over shorter distances relative to syntonic bats. Shorter detection distances combined with the constrained spaces in the cluttered habitat in which rhinolophids forage give moths both less time and less space within which to react to an attacking bat. Thus, the AFH in combination with habitat offers a better explanation for the preponderance of moths in the diets of rhinolophids than either of them on their own. Moths also responded both neurologically and behaviorally to the rustling sounds made by birds (<b>Cape</b> <b>Bulbul,</b> Pycnonotus capensis) as they pursued moths. We suggest that the high sensitivity of moths to frequencies from 5 to 10 kHz allows them to avoid these avian attacks by using responses that have traditionally been considered solely anti-bat behavior.
