To emphasise the change, Aten's name was written in the cartouche form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. The religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a Sed festival, a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, it possibly was a festival in honour of Amenhotep III. Some Egyptologists think that he had a coregency with Amenhotep IV of 2-12 years.The fifth year is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new <b>capital,</b> Akhetaten (<b>Horizon</b> of the Aten), at the site known today as Amarna.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{indeterminacy}} of equilibria in infinite <b>horizon</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation models with technological externalities. Our investigation encompasses both models with bounded and unbounded accumulation paths, and models with {{one and two}} sectors of production. Under reasonable assumptions we find that equilibria are locally unique in the one sector economies, at least as long as cycles are not present and trajectories are therefore monotone. On the other hand we show (by means of an example) that persistent oscillations are possible when the external effect is particularly strong and capital accumulation is bounded. In this case indeterminacy maybe present as {{we are unable to}} rule out the eexistence of a continuum of equilibria converging to the cycle. The situation is different in economies with two sectors of production. Here it is very easy to construct analytical examples where a positive external effect induces a two dimensional manifold of equilibria converging to the same steady state (in the bounded case) or to the same constant growth rate (in the unbounded case), For the latter we also point out that the dynamic behavior of these equilibria is quite complicated and that persistent fluctuations in their growth rates are possible. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the relative significance of the determinants of disaggregated capital flows (foreign direct investment and portfolio flows) to five developing countries, across different time horizons. Design/methodology/approach – An empirically tractable structural VAR model of the determinants of capital flows is developed, and variance decomposition and impulse response analyses are used to investigate the temporal dynamic effects of shocks to push and pull factors on foreign direct investment and portfolio flows. Findings – Estimation of the model using quarterly data for the period 1976 - 2001 provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that shocks to real variables of economic activity such as foreign output and domestic productivity are the most important forces explaining the variations in capital flows to developing countries. Research limitations/implications – These findings highlight the concomitant need for policy makers in developing countries to design domestic policy that accounts for both external and internal shocks to real variables of economic activity. Originality/value – Previous empirical studies on the determinants of capital flows to developing countries have mostly examined the capital flow variable in aggregate, and have largely overlooked the possibility that the relative significance of estimated coefficients of such determinants may vary across time <b>horizons.</b> <b>Capital,</b> Developing countries, International investments, Portfolio investment...|$|R

40|$|This study {{surveys the}} {{academic}} and professional literature examining the privatisation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), {{with a focus on}} empirical studies. Privatisation has been instrumental in reducing state ownership in many countries and had a transforming effect on global stock markets, although the role of SOEs in many other countries is similar to what it was two decades ago. Countries have adopted large-scale privatisation programs primarily for two reasons: first, the conclusive evidence that privately-owned firms outperform SOEs and, second, the empirical evidence clearly shows that privatisation significantly (often dramatically) improves the operating and financial performance of divested firms. Governments can also raise significant revenues by selling SOEs. While the choice between privatisation via public share offering versus through asset sales is still imperfectly understood, factors such as firm size, government fiscal condition, and the state of national economic development are important influences. Further, those countries which have chosen the mass (voucher) privatisation route have done so largely out of necessity [...] and face ongoing efficiency problems as a result. Governments have great discretion in pricing the SOEs they sell, especially those being sold via public share offering, and they use this discretion to pursue political and economic ends. Finally, investors who purchase the shares of firms being privatised earn significantly positive excess returns both in the short-run (due to deliberate underpricing of share issues by the government) and over one, three, and five-year investment <b>horizons.</b> <b>Capital,</b> Investment, Employment, Financing policy, Ownership structure, Investment banking, Venture capital, Brokerage, Public economics, Sources of revenue, Public enterprises, Boundaries of public and private enterprise, Privatisation, Contracting out...|$|R
