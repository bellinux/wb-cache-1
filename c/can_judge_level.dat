50|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of indoor cycling is that each participant can exactly control his/her level of intensity to suit ability or fitness level but still remain as a group together. The classes can therefore be heterogeneous. As an alternative, participants <b>can</b> <b>judge</b> their <b>level</b> of exertion relative to a perceived exertion scale. The instructor should advise a recommended exertion scale from 1 (no exertion at all) to 10 (maximum exertion). Each rider is permitted to dictate how hard he/she chooses {{to work with the}} instructor providing active and dynamic encouragement together with technical and practical advice throughout the class.|$|R
40|$|Expansion of {{distance}} education (DE) {{is one of}} the characteristics of the information society by which we <b>can</b> <b>judge</b> the <b>level</b> of development in a society. As we witnessed many changes in Slovenia {{in the last ten years}} we were interested in what is happening in DE as a modern way of education.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a study {{investigating}} how accurately programming teachers <b>can</b> <b>judge</b> the <b>level</b> of difficulty of questions in introductory programming examinations. Having compiled a set of 45 questions that had been used in introductory programming exams, we took three measures of difficulty for the questions: the expectations of the person who taught the course and set the exams; the consensus expectations of an independent group of programming teachers; and the actual performance of the students who sat the exams. Good correlations were found between all pairs of the three measures. The conclusion, which is not controversial but needed to be established, is that computing academics do have a fairly good idea of the difficulty of programming exam questions, even for a course that they did not teach. However, the discussion highlights some areas where the relationships show weaknesses...|$|R
