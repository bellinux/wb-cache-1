40|$|The Antarctic Ross Ice shelf ANtenna Neutrino Array (ARIANNA) {{particle}} physics experiment aims to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos originating outside our solar system. A second generation detector prototype for the experiment {{has been developed}} and successfully deployed in Antarctica. The second generation detector {{is based on the}} Synchronous Sampling and Triggering (SST) integrated circuit. This dissertation focuses on the design and performance of the SST chip. Fabricated in a 0. 25 um CMOS process, the SST is a low power data acquisition circuit that monitors for potential neutrino signals and preserves candidate signals. The waveform capture is performed with a 256 -cell time-interleaved sampling array. Continuous sampling operation is achieved through circular cycling across the array. The synchronous sampling clock generation allows for sampling rates that span six orders of magnitude (i. e. ranging between 2. 0 KHz and 2. 0 GHz). The analog bandwidth (- 3 dB frequency) of the SST reaches 1. 5 GHz, allowing for the capture of frequency components up to the Nyquist frequency. The SST integrates four channels of waveform capture functionality into a single chip. Each SST channel includes event triggering to initiate the signal capture of neutrino events, and to reject random noise signals. Events are triggered based on outputs from a pair of high speed comparators that monitor for bipolar threshold crossings. Multiple triggering options are available on the SST, including direct output of the <b>comparator</b> <b>signals</b> and triggering on dual threshold crossings occurring within a programmable time window. The SST chip utilizes an external low jitter LVDS oscillator to synchronously generate an internal sampling clock with low timing jitter. The fixed pattern timing noise was characterized through two different approaches: a stochastic zero crossing method and a Monte Carlo based simulated annealing method. After calibrating for fixed pattern timing noise, the SST achieves inter channel timing resolutions between 1. 15 ps (RMS) and 2. 36 ps (RMS) ...|$|E

The ideal detection technology would be fast, accurate, effective from long distances, and safe for the both detector and the object being detected. One detector that has shown potential {{as a tool for}} detecting hidden weapons is an infrared detector. Infrared detectors are passive sensors that create infrared, or thermal, images without having to expose the subject to any radiation. These images show the heat signature that is given off by objects of interest. Previous studies using infrared detectors for concealed weapon detection have tried to observe the image of the weapon. These have been largely unsuccessful, however, because infrared waves will not readily penetrate clothing.

We specialize our results to spaces of functions with continuous rth derivatives, equipped with a Wiener measure. In particular, we show that the interpolation by the natural splines of degree r+ 1 yields the optimal algorithms. We apply the general results to the problem of integration. Part II of this work studies the following image understanding problems: 2 & 1 / 2 D sketch, shape from shading, and optical flow. We point out how known general optimality results in the worst case model may be applied to these problems. We indicate some preliminary results and work in progress, concerning the numerical solution of these problems. Algorithms which differ from those currently used in practice are proposed. Part III provides a design of a binary <b>comparator</b> with completion <b>signal,</b> for the purpose of optimizing the average processing time. The average propagation delay is a constant, independent of n, the number of inputs, while the logic complexity is a linear function of n...|$|R
