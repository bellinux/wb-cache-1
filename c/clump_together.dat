5|$|Clavaria zollingeri {{contains}} lectins, a {{class of}} proteins that bind specific carbohydrates {{on the surface of}} cells, causing them to <b>clump</b> <b>together.</b> A Korean study demonstrated that extracts of the fungus caused lymphoagglutination, a specific form of agglutination that involves white blood cells. In general, lectins are used in blood typing and serology, and they are widely used in affinity chromatography for purifying proteins.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to <b>clump</b> <b>together.</b> These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

25|$|That {{nanoparticles}} {{are highly}} reactive can {{mean that they}} rapidly <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> or react with soil particles or other material in the environment, limiting their dispersal to target contaminants. Some of the important challenges currently limiting nanoremediation technologies include identifying coatings or other formulations that increase dispersal of the nanoparticle agents to better reach target contaminants while limiting any potential toxicity to bioremediation agents, wildlife, or people.|$|E
25|$|Two {{or three}} plumbatae were {{typically}} clipped {{to a small}} wooden bracket {{on the inside of}} the large oval or round shields used at the time. Massed troops would unclip and hurl plumbatae as the enemy neared, hopefully stalling their movement and morale by making them <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> and huddle under their shields. With the enemy deprived of rapid movement and their visibility impaired by their own raised shields, the Roman troops were then better placed to exploit the tactical situation. It is unlikely plumbatae were viewed by the Romans as the killing blow, but more as a means of stalling the enemy at ranges greater than previously provided by the heavier and shorter ranged pilum.|$|E

25|$|Another way glycated Hb causes {{damage is}} via {{inflammation}} {{which results in}} atheroscelerotic plaque (atheroma) formation. Free radical build-up promotes the excitation of Fe2+-Hb through Fe3+-Hb into abnormal ferryl Hb (Fe4+-Hb). Fe4+ is unstable and reacts with specific amino acids in Hb to regain it's Fe3+ oxidation state. Hb molecules <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> via cross-linking reactions and these Hb clumps (multimers) promote cell damage {{and the release of}} Fe4+-Hb into the matrix of innermost layers (subendothelium) of arteries and veins. This results in increased permeability of interior surface (endothelium) of blood vessels and production of pro-inflammatory monocyte adhesion proteins, which promote macrophage accumulation in blood vessel surfaces ultimately leading to harmful plaques in these vessels.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} types of {{distributive}} shock. The most common, septic shock, is caused by an infection, most frequently by bacteria, but viruses, fungi and parasites have been implicated. Infection sites most {{likely to lead to}} septic shock are chest, abdomen and genitourinary tract. In septic shock the blood flow in the microvasculature is abnormal with some capillaries underperfused and others with normal to high blood flow. The endothelial cells lining the blood vessels become less responsive to vasocontrictive agents, lose their glycocalyx (normal coating) and negative ionic charge, become leaky and cause extensive over-expression of nitric oxide. The coagulation cascade is also disrupted. Tissue factor that initiates the clotting cascade is produced by activated monocytes and the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels while antithrombin and fibrinolysis are impaired. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can result from the thrombin produced in the inflammatory response. The ability of red blood cells to change shape decreases and their tendency to <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> increases, inhibiting their flow through the microvasculature.|$|E
500|$|The endoperidium is [...] in {{diameter}} by [...] high, sessile, and a dull grayish brown. The peristome {{is made of}} radially arranged fibrils that <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> at the apex in groups of unequal length to form an opening that appears jagged or torn. The circular area bordering the peristome is a paler color. Spores {{are thought to be}} dispersed by the wind sucking them out when it blows over the hole, or when falling raindrops hit the flexible endoperidium, creating a puff of air that forces the spores through the ostiole.|$|E
5000|$|Brickellia glomerata {{produces}} several flower {{heads with}} disc florets but no ray florets. The heads are <b>clumped</b> <b>together</b> in groups called [...] "glomerules," [...] hence the scientific {{name of the}} species.|$|R

500|$|David K. Smith, {{examining}} Allosaurus fossils by quarry, {{found that}} the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry (Utah) specimens are generally smaller than those from Como Bluff (Wyoming) or Brigham Young University's Dry Mesa Quarry (Colorado), but {{the shapes of the}} bones themselves did not vary between the sites. A later study by Smith incorporating Garden Park (Colorado) and Dinosaur National Monument (Utah) specimens found no justification for multiple species based on skeletal variation; skull variation was most common and was gradational, suggesting individual variation was responsible. Further work on size-related variation again found no consistent differences, although the Dry Mesa material tended to <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> {{on the basis of the}} astragalus, an ankle bone. Kenneth Carpenter, using skull elements from the Cleveland-Lloyd site, found wide variation between individuals, calling into question previous species-level distinctions based such features as the shape of the horns, and the proposed differentiation of [...] "A. jimmadseni" [...] based on the shape of the jugal.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "sand" [...] on Titan {{is likely}} not {{made up of}} small grains of silicates like the sand on Earth, but rather might have formed when liquid methane rained and eroded the {{water-ice}} bedrock, possibly {{in the form of}} flash floods. Alternatively, the sand could also have come from organic solids called tholins, produced by photochemical reactions in Titan's atmosphere. Studies of dunes' composition in May 2008 revealed that they possessed less water than the rest of Titan, and are thus most likely derived from organic soot like hydrocarbon polymers clumping together after raining onto the surface. Calculations indicate the sand on Titan has a density of one-third that of terrestrial sand. The low density combined with the dryness of Titan's atmosphere might cause the grains to <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> because of static electricity buildup. The [...] "stickiness" [...] might make it difficult for the generally mild breeze close to Titan's surface to move the dunes although more powerful winds from seasonal storms could still blow them eastward.|$|E
500|$|Young fruit {{bodies of}} H.bakerensis have rounded caps with cottony margins that are rolled inward; as the {{mushrooms}} mature the caps flatten {{out and the}} margins may lift upward. The diameter of the cap reaches between [...] The center of the cap is colored yellow-brown, tawny or amber, reducing to nearly white at the margin. The cap surface is slimy when wet, and sticky as it gets older and dries out. Beneath the slime layer are hairs that are plastered tightly to the surface, which <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> a few {{at a time to}} form many little streaks. The firm white flesh of the cap is thick— near the stem attachment—and tapers evenly to the margin. It does not change color when cut or bruised. It has a mild taste and a characteristic fragrant odor that resembles almonds, or [...] "crushed peach pits". The waxy gills are decurrent or bluntly attached to the stem. The gill spacing is close to subdistant—between 56–88 individual gills reach the stem, with 2–3 tiers of short lamellulae (shorter gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The gills have even edges, and are narrow but become broad in large caps (8–12mm), ranging in color from creamy white to pinkish-buff. They do not discolor when they are bruised. Young specimens often have drops of a clear liquid beaded on the gills. The gills of dried specimens darken considerably. The stem is [...] long, [...] thick at the apex, solid (i.e., not hollow), and either equal in width throughout or narrowed downward. Its color is white to pale pinkish-buff, with a dry surface. The top portion of young specimens have a cottony, fine whitish powder near the top, but this sloughs off as it matures. Like the gills, the top of the stem is often beaded with drops of translucent liquid in moist weather.|$|E
50|$|Black-capped chickadees {{sleep in}} thick {{vegetation}} or in cavities, usually singly, though {{there have been}} suggestions that they may occasionally roost <b>clumped</b> <b>together.</b> The sleeping posture is with the bill tucked under the scapular (shoulder) feathers.|$|R

2500|$|Herbivores {{have evolved}} cecums (or an abomasum {{in the case}} of ruminants). Ruminants have a fore-stomach with four chambers. These are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and {{separates}} into layers of solid and liquid material. [...] Solids <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> to form the cud (or bolus). The cud is then regurgitated, chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size.|$|E
2500|$|Potassium alum {{has been}} used at least since Roman times for {{purification}} of drinking water and industrial process water.

2500|$|Moringa seed cake, {{obtained}} as {{a byproduct}} of pressing seeds to obtain oil, is used to filter water using flocculation to produce potable water for animal or human consumption. Moringa seeds contain dimeric cationic proteins which absorb and neutralize colloidal charges in turbid water, causing the colloidal particles to <b>clump</b> <b>together,</b> making the suspended particles easier to remove as sludge by either settling or filtration. [...] Moringa seed cake removes most impurities from water. This use {{is of particular interest}} for being nontoxic and sustainable compared to other materials in moringa-growing regions where drinking water is affected by pollutants.|$|E
2500|$|Another set of {{scientific}} arguments against a Hollow Earth or any hollow planet comes from gravity. Massive objects tend to <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> gravitationally, creating non-hollow spherical {{objects such as}} stars and planets. The solid sphere {{is the best way}} in which to minimize the gravitational potential energy of a physical object; having hollowness is [...] unfavorable in the energetic sense. In addition, ordinary matter is not strong enough to support a hollow shape of planetary size against the force of gravity; a planet-sized hollow shell with the known, observed thickness of the Earth's crust {{would not be able to}} achieve hydrostatic equilibrium with its own mass and would collapse.|$|E
2500|$|According to Poe, {{the initial}} {{state of matter}} was a single [...] "Primordial Particle". [...] "Divine Volition", manifesting itself as a repulsive force, {{fragmented}} the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the repulsive force stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to <b>clump</b> <b>together</b> forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order {{to begin the process}} of repulsion and attraction once again. This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason Poe anticipates some themes of modern cosmology.|$|E
