Generally speaking, campus buildings in Egypt reflect real problems of energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality of the overcrowded educational spaces. The case, studied in the article, is for three drawing halls of different specifications, located in the main building of the Faculty of Engineering at Mansoura University. The simulation work is processed along a road map of three consequent phases: simulating the existing situation of thermal and visual comfort inside the three halls; optimizing <b>cooling</b> <b>loads</b> by testing various alternatives of design parameters; and including daylighting levels in the optimization process. The study found that optimizing windows shading of overhangs and louvers, low-transmittance characteristics of glazing, and ventilation system would provide from 26 % to 31 % reduction of <b>cooling</b> <b>loads</b> compared to base case, without taking into account daylighting requirements. While, opening skylight strips, perpendicular to the external facade, with 8 % window–roof-ratio, would provide required daylighting levels with minimum increase of <b>cooling</b> <b>loads.</b> The principle objective, attained through this article, is to underline the significance of using building performance simulation (BPS) tools in the architectural educational and research work...|$|R

Natural ventilation {{is the most}} effective measure to reduce the cooling energy consumption, but it is quite difficult to control and quantitatively assess the natural ventilation. A method was developed with coupling simulation by both software of DeST-h and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in typical meteorological year (TMY) in Guangzhou. First, the base room temperatures with different air change (ACH) rates of natural ventilated dwelling were simulated with DeST-h. The time period in that the indoor air temperature could meet thermal comfort requirement only by natural ventilation in occupied period was analyzed, in which the wind speed and direction in TMY was obtained for the ventilation environment simulation of rooms in windows and doors switching with the PHOENICS software. The actual air change rates in different rooms in such wind speed and direction were calculated.
