25|$|The eye focuses {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light onto the retina. A laser beam can be focused to an intensity on the retina {{which may be}} up to 200,000 times higher than {{at the point where}} the laser beam enters the eye. Most of the light is absorbed by melanin pigments in the pigment epithelium just behind the photoreceptors, and <b>causes</b> <b>burns</b> in the retina. Ultraviolet light with wavelengths shorter than 400nm tends to be absorbed by lens and 300nm in the cornea, where it can produce injuries at relatively low powers due to photochemical damage. Infrared light mainly causes thermal damage to the retina at near-infrared wavelengths and to more frontal parts of the eye at longer wavelengths. The table below summarizes the various medical conditions caused by lasers at different wavelengths, not including injuries due to pulsed lasers.|$|E

50|$|White {{phosphorus}} {{smoke is}} typically very hot and may <b>cause</b> <b>burns</b> on contact.

50|$|Butanethiol {{is a very}} noxious and caustic {{chemical}} compound, and at sufficiently high concentrations, {{it produces}} serious health effects in both humans and animals, especially {{as a result of}} prolonged exposure.

Contact with the skin and mucous membranes <b>causes</b> <b>burns,</b> and contact with the eyes can lead to blurred vision or complete blindness.|$|E
50|$|One Hollywood {{stereotype}} they do {{conform to}} is their vulnerability to silver, which <b>causes</b> <b>burns</b> even on light contact, and their subsequent nigh-invulnerability to {{being killed by}} other means. A longtime supremacy {{of a number of}} werewolf clans in Überwald led to a ban on dwarfs mining silver in the region, though that ban was lifted when the most powerful werewolf clan showed distinct signs of breaking the deal {{that there would be no}} need for such things. Werewolves can also be killed with fire, and put to distinct inconvenience with an axe.|$|E

5000|$|Making candy can be {{hazardous}} {{due to the}} use of boiled sugar and melted chocolate.

[...] Worker safety programs focus on reducing contact between workers and hot food or hot equipment, and reducing splashing, because even small splashes can <b>cause</b> <b>burns.</b> [...] Some ingredients can also irritate the eyes and lungs, if, for example, powdered ingredients are accidentally inhaled, so worker protection involves reducing exposure to potentially irritating ingredients.|$|R

5000|$|Roland {{carries a}} pair of revolvers, {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "the big guns" [...] by other characters. They are described as long and heavy, with blued steel (originally from his world's Excalibur) and sandalwood grips. These guns are a major sigil, as they are recognized throughout Mid-World and are used as an identifier of Roland. During the search for more ammunition in New York City in The Drawing of the Three, the guns are revealed to be chambered close enough to [...]45 or the [...]45 Long Colt to use commercially available cartridges. In The Gunslinger Roland exhibits a technique for reloading his weapons at blinding speed, though it <b>causes</b> <b>burns</b> to his fingertips when done repeatedly in a short time. He loses this ability at the start of The Drawing of the Three, when the first two fingers of his right hand are bitten off. Even after being crippled, he possesses almost superhuman accuracy and he can draw his guns faster than any other character. Roland is noted as being able to shoot equally well with both hands.|$|E

40|$|Injuries {{result from}} {{transfer}} {{of energy to}} a human host. In the epidemiologic model of infectious disease, microbes are the “agents ” of infection. Similarly, in the epidemiologic model of traumatic injury, energy is the “agent ” of injury (figure 1). This model provides a good basis for under-standing {{the role of the}} environment in the causal pathway for injuries. Transfer of energy to the host is the final step in the causal pathway for injuries, but many factors influence the nature of this exchange and its consequences. Energy that causes inju-ries can be in several forms, including kinetic, chemical, or thermal. For example, kinetic energy causes motor-vehicle-related injuries, and thermal energy <b>causes</b> <b>burns.</b> Lack of metabolic energy that occurs through external forces, such as during drowning or suffocation, can also be included in th...|$|E
