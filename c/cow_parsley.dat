5000|$|<b>Cow</b> <b>parsley</b> {{grows in}} sunny to semi-shaded {{locations}} in meadows {{and at the}} edges of hedgerows and woodland. It is a particularly common sight by the roadside. It is sufficiently common and fast-growing to be considered a nuisance weed in gardens. Cow parsley's ability to grow rapidly through rhizomes and to produce large quantities of seeds in a single growing season has made it an invasive species {{in many areas of the}} United States. Vermont has listed <b>cow</b> <b>parsley</b> on its [...] "Watch List" [...] of invasive species, while Massachusetts has banned the sale of the plant. It is classed as a Class B Noxious Weed in the State of Washington since 1989, where its sale is also banned.|$|E

5000|$|Apiaceae or Umbelliferae, is {{a family}} of mostly {{aromatic}} flowering plants named after the type genus Apium and {{commonly known as the}} celery, carrot or parsley family. It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,700 species in 434 genera including such well-known and economically important plants such as angelica, anise, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, chervil, coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, hemlock, lovage, <b>cow</b> <b>parsley,</b> parsley, parsnip, sea holly, [...] giant hogweed and silphium (a plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct).|$|E
50|$|Heracleum sphondylium, {{commonly}} known as hogweed, common hogweed or cow parsnip, is a herbaceous perennial or biennial plant, in the umbelliferous family Apiaceae that includes fennel, <b>cow</b> <b>parsley,</b> ground elder and giant hogweed. It is native to Europe and Asia. The common name eltrot may also be applied, but is not specific to this species. Umbelliferous plants are so named because of the umbrella-like arrangement of flowers they produce. The North American species Heracleum maximum (also called cow parsnip) is sometimes included as a subspecies of H. sphondylium.|$|E
5000|$|Nephrotoma appendiculata, {{the spotted}} crane fly, is {{a species of}} crane fly. This species has a {{wingspan}} of about 50 mm, and a body length of 13 - 15 mm. The body is yellow with short, black stripes on the thorax and a black line on each section of the abdomen. The wings have a thin, yellow line near the leading edge. This species {{can be seen from}} May to September at woodland edges, in gardens and fields, and on farmland. The larvae, known as [...] "leatherjackets", feed on the roots of grasses, while the adults feed on umbellifers such as <b>cow</b> <b>parsley.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anthriscus sylvestris, {{known as}} <b>cow</b> <b>parsley,</b> wild chervil, wild beaked parsley, or keck is a {{herbaceous}} biennial or short-lived perennial {{plant in the}} family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae), genus Anthriscus. It is also sometimes called mother-die (especially in the UK), a name that is also applied to the common hawthorn. It is native to Europe, western Asia and northwestern Africa; {{in the south of}} its range in the Mediterranean region, it is limited to higher altitudes. It is related to other diverse members of Apiaceae, such as parsley, carrot, hemlock and hogweed. It is often confused with Daucus carota which is known as Queen Anne's lace or wild carrot.|$|E
50|$|Along {{the center}} of the island runs a narrow ridge, which is a remnant of the ice age. It has steep slopes in some parts and is up to 22 meters tall. There are no forests on the island, but only {{individual}} trees of elm, spruce, pine, birch, aspen and alder. The trees host about 28 species of polypores (tree mushrooms), and there are more than 100 species of moss. Most of the island is covered in meadows, which are quite varied and rich in colors and species, including rare and protected. A large part of them are of legume family. Common are <b>cow</b> <b>parsley,</b> various species centaurea, tansy and verbascum densiflorum.|$|E
5000|$|Heracleum mantegazzianum, {{commonly}} known as giant hogweed, cartwheel-flower, giant cow parsnip, hogsbane or giant <b>cow</b> <b>parsley,</b> is a plant in the family Apiaceae. In New Zealand, it is also sometimes called wild parsnip, or wild rhubarb. It typically grows to heights of 2 to 5.5 m. [...] Superficially, it resembles common hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium), Heracleum sosnowskyi, or garden angelica (Angelica archangelica). It is phototoxic and {{considered to be a}} noxious weed in many jurisdictions. Giant hogweed is native to the Caucasus region and Central Asia. It was introduced to Britain as an ornamental plant in the 19th century, and it has also spread to many other parts of Europe, the United States, and Canada.|$|E
50|$|The {{common name}} {{derives from the}} bright orange tips of the male's forewings. The males are a common sight in spring, flying along hedgerows and damp meadows {{in search of the}} more reclusive female which lacks the orange and is often mistaken for one of the other 'white' butterflies. The undersides are mottled green and white and create a superb {{camouflage}} when settled on flowerheads such as <b>cow</b> <b>parsley</b> and garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata). The male is able to hide his orange tips by tucking the forewings behind the hindwings at rest. On close examination of the mottling, the green colour can be seen to be made up of a mixture of black and yellow scales. The butterfly is found across Europe, and eastwards into temperate Asia as far as Japan. The past 30 years have seen a rapid increase in the range of the orange tip in the UK, particularly in Scotland and Ireland, probably in response to climate change.|$|E
50|$|The Ameryka {{peninsula}} {{is located}} in between the two lakes Orzysz and Wierzbińskie, which is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Wierzbińskie Bay. From {{the western part of the}} lake there is a bridge which crosses a narrow gap. The width of the peninsula ranges from about 100 to 300 metres. In the narrowest parts of the peninsula, both of the lakes can be seen. On both sides of the lake there are overgrown patches of Alnus glutinosa. Some roots of the trees are visible due to waves eroding their soil, creating a separate characteristic to the part of the lake. Both of the lakes are eutrophic and have similar water-based plants. There is a large amount of swamp vegetation, including the following species found in the lake: bugleweed, bittersweet, water mint, yellow water-lily, and Canadian waterweed. In some parts the shore has sand and is easily accessible. There are also synanthrope plants in the lake: burdock, lion's tail, common nettle, <b>cow</b> <b>parsley,</b> tetterwort and common wormwood. To the southeastern part of the lake, the peninsula becomes more wider and the plants become luxuriant. There are different types of plants in that part than elsewhere: there are blueberries, blackberries and moss, and in the autumn mushrooms grow. In the forest there are visible trenches from World War II. Along the southern part of the shore of Wierzbińskie Lake, there is the stretched village Wierzbiny.|$|E
40|$|Diploma thesis {{was focused}} on the {{determination}} of seed production and their germination of selected species in the Apiaceae family. Selected species were common hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium) and <b>cow</b> <b>parsley</b> (Anthriscus sylvestris). Further was conducted determination weight of thousand seeds of both species and at common hogweed was also determined by the number of seeds containing endosperms, thus seeds potentially capable of germination. Before determining the germination the seeds were stored at different temperature conditions for the long term. Under laboratory conditions was detected in the case of common hogweed very low germination {{and in the case of}} <b>cow</b> <b>parsley</b> zero germination. The average seed production per plant was at 888 hogweed seeds and at <b>cow</b> <b>parsley</b> 1 194 seeds. The average weight thousand of seeds was at common hogweed 2, 79 grams and at <b>cow</b> <b>parsley</b> 2, 12 grams.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} kinetic art work, (Trans) Plant is a 20 ft self-assembling sculpture {{based on}} the structure of Queen Anne’s Lace, or <b>cow</b> <b>parsley</b> (Anthriscus sylvestris). This native British plant is familiar to people living in both rural and urban areas where it can be found on railway banks, in ditches, at woodland edges and on waste ground. In the past children used its hollow, furrowed stems as peashooters. Increasing the scale of this everyday plant gives it an unexpected emphasis and it becomes surprisingly grandiose. The jointed sculpture is made from milled aluminium blocks and tubes. Activated repeatedly throughout the day the plant’s branching structures rise up from a collapsed state, snapping into a recognisable organic structure. (Trans) Plant performs by assembling itself into a large three dimensional form and then, {{at the touch of a}} button, the piece starts to move again, its branches slowly collapse and droop and the sculpture closes itself. <b>Cow</b> <b>parsley</b> is of interest to mathematicians and engineers because it (and other members of its family such as Queen Anne’s Lace) show geometric consistency over a wide size range. Using measurements of <b>cow</b> <b>parsley</b> that Professor Vincent has in his extensive database of natural structures, we can predict the design of a structure up to twice the height of the biggest known similar plant (21 ft) ...|$|E
