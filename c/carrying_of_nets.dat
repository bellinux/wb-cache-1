40|$|In {{this paper}} a new enumerative {{algorithm}} called RAF 3 is introduced that generates slicing placements optimal in both area and overall net length. It {{is designed to}} automate the task of placement for analog circuits given a set of modules with multiple realizations, a corresponding net list, and neighborhood relations. RAF 3 #reduces the overall net length to nearly one fifth compared to a net length unaware enumeration algorithm while using only 1. 6 % more area and twice the CPU-time. # RAF 3 is based on enhanced shape functions that are capable <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>net</b> length information. RAF 3 can be used either as a fully automatic analog placement tool, or as an interactive tool for creating extremely dense placements from a loose placement provided by the designer to establish neighborhood relations.

40|$|In {{the second}} half of the past century it became {{apparent}} that the low temperature behaviour of condensed matter systems can often be described by modeling their ex-citations as quasiparticles immersed in an effective vacuum, whose properties derive directly from those of the low temperature phase of the system. Whereas in the search for the fundamental constituents in our universe we are bound to look for what is al-ready there, the combinatorial nature of the periodic table could then be harvested to realise an endless variety of new vacua, with relative exotic excitations. For instance, particles that <b>carry</b> a fraction <b>of</b> the electronic charge were found in polyacetylene and fractional quantum Hall systems; or electron-like quasiparticles that carry charge but no spin (spin-charge separation) in SrCuO 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT Neuroepithelial {{transforming}} gene 1 (Net 1) is a RhoA-subfamily–specific {{guanine nucleotide}} exchange factor that is overexpressed in multiple human cancers and {{is required for}} proliferation. Molecular mechanisms underlying its role in cell proliferation are unknown. Here we show that overexpression or knockdown <b>of</b> <b>Net</b> 1 causes mitotic defects. Net 1 is required for chromosome congression during metaphase and generation of stable kineto-chore microtubule attachments. Accordingly, inhibition <b>of</b> <b>Net</b> 1 expression results in spindle assembly checkpoint activation. The ability <b>of</b> <b>Net</b> 1 to control mitosis is independent of RhoA or RhoB activation, as knockdown of either GTPase does not phenocopy effects <b>of</b> <b>Net</b> 1 knockdown on nuclear morphology, and effects <b>of</b> <b>Net</b> 1 knockdown are effectively rescued by expression <b>of</b> catalytically inactive <b>Net</b> 1. We also observe that Net 1 expression is required for centrosomal activation of p 21 -activated kinase and its downstream kinase Aurora A, which are critical regulators of centrosome maturation and spindle assembly. These results identify Net 1 as a novel regulator of mitosis and indicate that altered expression <b>of</b> <b>Net</b> 1, as occurs in human cancers, may adversely affect genomic stability...|$|R

40|$|Recently, several transmembrane {{proteins}} of {{the nuclear}} envelope have been implicated in regulation of signaling and gene expression. Here we demonstrate that the nuclear lamina-associated nuclear envelope transmembrane protein NET 39 (Ppapdc 3) functions as a negative regulator of myoblast differentiation, in part through effects on mTOR signaling. We found that NET 39 is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues and becomes strongly upregulated during cultured myoblast differentiation. Knockdown <b>of</b> <b>NET</b> 39 by RNA interference in myoblasts strongly promoted differentiation, whereas overexpression <b>of</b> <b>NET</b> 39 repressed myogenesis.
