The solvent effect {{in a series}} of polar and non-polar solvents of varying dielectric constants and refractive indices was estimated by recording the electronic spectra (S 1 band) of the above compounds. The data was used to determine the magnitude and direction of the electric dipole moments in the first electronically excited state. The results indicate that the observed band systems in these compounds may be attributed to a π→π* transition...|$|E
40|$|Several hydrazone, oxime, <b>carbazone</b> and {{semicarbazone}} derivatives of 14 -alkoxycodeinones and 14 -alkoxydihydrocodeinones were synthesised [1] and characterised in {{in vitro}} radioligand binding assays in rat brain membrane preparations. The tested compounds show the highest {{affinity for the}} mu opioid binding sites {{and most of them}} have agonist character. Subtype analysis of the binding shows mu 2 specificity. However, some of these ligands are able to block partially (40 – 60 %) the high affinity (putative mu 1) opioid binding sites while all of them act as reversible ligands at the low affinity (putative mu 2) sites...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} novel {{coumarin}} pyrazole hybrids of biological interest were synthesized from the hydrazones, <b>carbazones</b> and thiocarbazones via Vilsmeier Haack formylation reaction. These intermediates and formyl pyrazoles were evaluated for antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Among the series, compounds 6 g and 6 h showed excellent antimicrobial activity against different bacterial and fungal strains and compounds 7 g, 7 h {{were found to}} be potent antioxidant agents in both DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays. Further, detailed quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) analysis indicated the molecular parameters that contribute to increased potency of inhibition. The above findings would further encourage our understanding in employing coumarin pyrazole hybrids as potential antibiotic agents for treating infections caused by pathogenic microbes and fungi. Further, it also paves the way for exploration of these compounds as potential therapeutic agents to treat conditions arising because of excessive oxidative damage...|$|R
40|$|Being a {{disabling}} {{symptom of}} many medical conditions, effective pain control {{is one of}} the most important therapeutic priorities. Morphine and other opioid drugs produce analgesia primarily through μ opioid (MOP) receptors, which mediate beneficial but also the non-beneficial actions. Appropriate identification of novel opioid analgesics may reduce complications and improve patient compliance. It was reported that hydrazones, oximes, <b>carbazones</b> and semicarbazone derivatives of morphinan- 6 -ones, e. g. dihydromorphinone or oxymorphone, exhibit high affinity at the MOP receptor [1]. Since most of these structures show high antinociceptive potency while having less pronounced side effects, it remains a promising task to convert the carbonyl group of morphinan- 6 -ones into various functionalities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of the replacement of the 6 -keto function with a 6 -cyano group on in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profiles...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{essential}} oil of Eucalyptus citriodora was extracted and analyzed by Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry. From this analysis, {{it appears that}} citronellal is the major compound (68. 2 %) of this oil. This aldehyde was used in situ in {{the essential}} oil of Eucalyptus citriodora for the hemi-synthesis of four structures <b>carbazones.</b> That was citronellal semicarbazone (1), citronellal thiosemicarbazone (2), citronellal 4 -phenyl semicarbazone (3) and citronellal 4 -phenyl thiosemicarbazone (4). The structures of these compounds were confirmed by IR spectrometry, proton NMR and carbon- 13 and by Mass Spectrometry. From the test againstTrypanosomabruceibrucei, it appears that citronellal semicarbazone (IC 50 = 473. 93 μM) and citronellal thiosemicarbazone (IC 50 = 440. 53 μM) had low activity. Citronellal 4 -phenyl semicarbazone (IC 50 = 57. 26 μM) and 4 -phenyl thiosemicarbazone citronellal (IC 50 = 19. 63 μM) had moderate activity. The activity of citronellal 4 -phenyl thiosemicarbazonewas still pronounced. The study of the toxicity against Artemiasalinashowed that all compounds except the compound 1 were moderately toxic andmay have antitumor properties. But the most antitrypanosomal compound 4 was particularly selective on trypanosome cells (SI = 4. 92) and {{could be a good}} candidate against this parasite...|$|R
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} effect of diphenylthiocarbazone (DPTC) and diphenyl <b>carbazone</b> (DPC) on acid corrosion of aluminium 2 S alloy in 0. 5 M HCI {{has been investigated}} using chemical technique. DPTC and DPC have moderate {{inhibitory effect}}s on the corrosion of aluminium in HCl solution. The protection efficiency increases with increasing concentration of the compounds. DPTC exhibits higher maximum inhibition efficiency than DPC. The difference in the inhibition behaviour of the compounds is explained {{on the basis of}} the difference in election donor ability of the sulphur and oxygen atoms. The adsorption of the compounds via their adsorption centers on the aluminium surface obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The ΔG 0 ads values were calculated using thermodynamic equations...|$|E
40|$|FT-IR and FT-Raman {{spectra of}} {{ethyl methyl ketone}} {{semicarbazone}} were recorded and analyzed. The vibrational wavenumbers were computed using HF/ 6 - 31 G*, B 3 PW 91 / 6 - 31 G* and B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G* basis and compared with experimental data. The first hyperpolarizability, infrared intensities and Raman activities are reported. The calculated first hyperpolarizability is comparable with the reported values of similar derivatives and is an attractive object for future studies of non-linear optics. The extended π-electron delocalization over the <b>carbazone</b> moiety {{is responsible for the}} nonlinearity of the molecule. The geometrical parameters of the title compound are in agreement with that of similar derivatives. The red shift of the NH stretching wavenumber in the infrared spectrum from the computed wavenumber indicates the weakening of the NH bond resulting in proton transfer to the neighboring oxygen atom...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a 19 F labeled {{injectable}} hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel that can be monitored by both 1 H and 19 F MR imaging. The HA based hydrogel formed via <b>carbazone</b> reaction can be obtained within a minute by simple mixing of HA-carbazate and HA-aldehyde derivatized polymers. 19 F contrast agent was linked to with carbazate and thiol dually functionalized HA via orthogonal Michael addition reaction which afforded cross-linkable and 19 F labeled HA. The 19 F labeling of HA polymer {{did not affect the}} mechanical properties of the formed hydrogel. As a result, the shape of a hydrogel sample could be imaged very well by both 1 H MRI and high resolution 19 F MRI. This hydrogel has high potential in clinical applications since it is injectable, biocompatible, and can be tracked in a minimally invasive manner. The present approach can be applied in preparation of injectable 19 F labeled hydrogel biomaterials from other natural biomacromolecules...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article reports data on four <b>carbazones</b> of piperitone: {{semicarbazone}} 1, thiosemicarbazone 2, 4 -phenyl semicarbazone 3 and 4 -phenyl thiosemicarbazone 4 prepared {{directly in}} situ from essential oil of Cymbopogon schoenantus, whose GC-FID and GC–MS analysis revealed piperitone as major component (68. 20 %). The structures of hemi-synthesized compounds were confirmed by high throughput IR, MS, 1 H and 13 C NMR based spectrometric analysis. Their antiparasitic activities were evaluated in vitro on Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Tbb). The compound 3 (IC 50 = 8. 63 ± 0. 81 µM) and 4 (IC 50 = 10. 90 ± 2. 52 µM) exhibited antitrypanosomal activity, 2 had a moderate activity (IC 50 = 74. 58 ± 4. 44 µM) but 1 was void of significant activity (IC 50 = 478. 47 µM). The in vitro {{tests showed that}} all compounds were less cytotoxic against the human non cancer fibroblast cell line (WI 38) (IC 50 > 80 µM) while only 2 (IC 50 = 21. 16 ± 1. 37 μM) and 4 (IC 50 = 32. 22 ± 1. 66 µM) were cytotoxic against the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and toxic on Artemia salina (Leach) larvae. Piperitone 4 -phenyl semicarbazone 3, the best antitrypanosomal compound, showed also a selectivity index (SI) higher than 7 on the larvae and the tested cells and therefore might be further studied as antitrypanosomal agent. Also, all compounds except 3 showed selectivity between the two tested cell lines (SI> 2). This data reveals {{for the first time}} the antitrypinosomal properties of thiosemicarbazones, their cytotoxicity on mammalian cells as well as their activities against Tbb and A. salina Leach...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation {{is focused on the}} design, synthesis, photophysical characterization, and nitro aromatic compounds-sensing properties of planar geometry imidazoles. hi addition, a new series of <b>carbazone</b> compounds have been developed and explored for the detection of explosives such as Trinitrotoluene (TNT). The objective of this research is to explore the use of fluorescence spectroscopy for the indirect detection of Hexamethylene Triperoxide Diamine (HMTD) explosives, including direct sensing of TNT and dimethlyformaide (DMF). Imidazole compounds were investigated for their ability to sense aromatic nitro compounds. Phrenanthrenequinone imidazole (PI) has demonstrated a unique property in solution state as a fluorescence probe for nitroaromatic compounds. It is found that PI fluorescence is quenched by aromatic nitro compounds and hasan excellent response. It is concentration based quenching and the detection sensitivity is in the range of parts per million. We prepared solid film from different imidazole compounds (e. g. PI) which gave us unique detection specificity for DMF. The luminescence intensityindicates the response of the sensor slide is reasonably fast, and potentially reusable, rendering the PI in KBr pellet film a sensor for practical applications. Also we prepared nanocomposites from SWNT-COOH with LPI, 4 MBI and PI. We specifically examined sensing properties from LPI and PIbased nanocomposites Fluorescence spectra were found to give direct evidence for the interaction of imidazole (such as LPI, PI) and the nanotubes. This implies the formation of an imidazole-nanotube nanocomposite, in which the LPI would be expected to adsorb {{to the surface of the}} nanotubes with a less bundled structure. The intensity of the LPI fluctuated in the presence of TNT solution. It is reasonable that LPI molecules on the SWNT-COOH surface are partially replaced by TNT molecules and in return the LPI molecules end up in the solution. This solution states trade-off causes the fluorescence intensity to fluctuate from quenching to enhancement and vice versa. In addition, a series of <b>carbazone</b> compounds were prepared and aimed to explore optical response upon the interaction with nitro aromatic compounds. Generally these compounds are not fluorescent. The initial investigation of Aggregation emission spectroscopy is initiated and potentially has fluorescence 2 ̆ 2 turn on 2 ̆ 2, and 2 ̆ 2 turn off 2 ̆ 7 effect results indicate of the potential that further enhancement could be possible...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{corrosion}} {{inhibition of}} zinc in hydrochloric acid by extract of Nypa Fruticans Wurmb was studied using weight loss techniques. Maximum inhibition efficiency (and surface coverage) was obtained at an optimum concentration. However increase in temperature decreased the inhibition efficiency at the temperature range studied. The inhibition action of Nypa Fruticans Wurmb extract compared closely {{to that of}} 1, 5 Diphenyl <b>Carbazone</b> (DPC). Optimum inhibition efficiency for zinc {{in the presence of}} Nypa Fruticans Wurmb extract was 36. 43 % and 40. 70 % with DPC. The phenomenon of physical adsorption has been proposed from the activation energy values (19. 33 kJ mol- 1 and 21. 11 kJ mol- 1) with Nypa Fruticans Wurmb extract and DPC respectively. A first order kinetics has been deduced from the kinetic treatment of the results. The heat of adsorption, Qad range from (- 33. 63 to - 58. 52 kJ mo l- 1) for both additives studied. Mean ÄGoads values (- 7. 82 to 8. 68 kJ mol- 1) are negative and suggestive of adsorption on metal surface. The data obtained from this study fits well into the Langmuir isotherm. Evidence is hereby provided to show that Nypa Fruticans Wurmb extract and DPC inhibits the corrosion of zinc comparatively @ JASE...|$|E
40|$|The {{gravimetric}} method of measuring blood loss was used during {{all types of}} pediatric operations at The Montreal Children's Hospital. Results of 1787 such measurements indicated that the method is of value {{in the management of}} transfusion. Grading blood loss as minor, moderate or severe, in terms of its relation to total blood volume or body weight is a procedure of practical value. Operations were grouped into those that usually led to a loss of less than 10 % of the blood volume (7. 5 ml. /kg.), those with a loss usually between 10 % and 14 % and those with blood loss usually over 14 % (10. 5 ml. /kg.), in order that appropriate plans for transfusion could be made to reduce the incidence of serious hypovolemia without fear of cardiovascular overloading. Blood loss at operation (adenotonsillectomy) was noted to vary considerably among surgeons but was fairly constant for each surgeon and seemed to be independent of the surgeon's experience. Two alleged hemostatic agents, adrenochrome <b>carbazone</b> (Statimo) and estrogenic substances (Premarin), were not effective in reducing the amount of blood lost during adenotonsillectomy. The importance of calculation of approximate equivalent amounts of blood at various ages of childhood is emphasized...|$|E
