5|$|One stew {{that may}} be served with <b>couscous</b> is the Moroccan tagine, a hearty, {{somewhat}} dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly in a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins.|$|E

Pre-steamed <b>couscous</b> takes less time to prepare than regular <b>couscous,</b> most dried pasta, or dried grains (such as rice).|$|E
25|$|Millet {{was also}} used for <b>couscous</b> by the Kel Ahaggar, a nomadic people of the desert of {{southern}} Algeria, who probably learned {{about it in the}} West African Sudan, where it has been known for centuries. Ibn Baṭṭūṭa in the above quote may have had a millet <b>couscous.</b> Ibn Baṭṭūṭa also mentions rice <b>couscous</b> in the area of Mali in 1350. Millet <b>couscous</b> was never as popular as hard wheat <b>couscous</b> because it took longer to cook and didn’t taste as good.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} <b>couscous</b> is uncertain. It {{may have been}} invented by the Berbers.
