25|$|There {{are various}} other {{mathematical}} concepts {{that can be}} used to represent complete lattices. One means of doing so is the Dedekind-MacNeille completion. When this completion is applied to a poset that already is a <b>complete</b> <b>lattice,</b> then the result is a <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> of sets which is isomorphic to the original one. Thus we immediately find that every <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> is isomorphic to a <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> of sets.|$|E
25|$|A poset {{is called}} a <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> if all its subsets have both a join and a meet. In particular, every <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> is a bounded lattice. While bounded lattice homomorphisms in general {{preserve}} only finite joins and meets, <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> homomorphisms are required to preserve arbitrary joins and meets.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present an {{approach}} of interval fuzzy logic based on <b>complete</b> <b>lattices.</b> In particular, we study the extensions of the notions of t-conorms, fuzzy negations and S-implication, from the unit interval to arbitrary <b>complete</b> <b>lattices.</b> Some general properties of S-implications on <b>complete</b> <b>lattices</b> are analyzed. We show that the interval extensions of t-conorms, fuzzy negations and S-implications on <b>complete</b> <b>lattices</b> preserve the optimality property, being the best interval representations of these fuzzy connectives...|$|R
25|$|<b>Complete</b> <b>lattices</b> {{must not}} be {{confused}} with complete partial orders (cpos), which constitute a strictly more general class of partially ordered sets.

40|$|AbstractReal-valued fuzzy {{measures}} and their associated fuzzy integrals were proposed by Sugeno. In this paper we consider fuzzy measures valued in <b>complete</b> <b>lattices</b> and their associated {{upper and lower}} fuzzy integrals. Moreover we define a class of functionals, called fuzzy integrals. In {{the setting of the}} <b>complete</b> <b>lattices</b> which are both Brouwerian and dually Brouwerian, the upper and lower fuzzy integrals are fuzzy integrals; while in that of the completely distributive <b>complete</b> <b>lattices</b> every fuzzy integral is both lower and upper fuzzy integral with respect to a fuzzy measure...|$|R
25|$|Using the {{standard}} definition from universal algebra, a free <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> over a generating set S is a <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> L {{together with a}} function i:S→L, such that any function f from S to the underlying set of some <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> M can be factored uniquely through a morphism f° from L to M. Stated differently, for every element s of S we find that f(s) = f°(i(s)) and that f° is the only morphism with this property. These conditions basically amount to {{saying that there is}} a functor from the category of sets and functions to the category of complete lattices and join-preserving functions which is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from complete lattices to their underlying sets.|$|E
25|$|Another {{representation}} is obtained {{by noting that}} the image of any closure operator on a <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> is again a <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> (called its closure system). Since the identity function is a closure operator too, this shows that the complete lattices are exactly the images of closure operators on complete lattices. Now the Dedekind-MacNeille completion can also be cast into a closure operator: every set of elements is mapped to the least lower (or upper) Dedekind cut that contains this set. Such a least cut does indeed exist and one has a closure operator on the powerset lattice of all elements. In summary, one can say that every <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> is isomorphic to the image of a closure operator on a powerset lattice.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} analysis, limit {{superior and}} limit inferior are important tools for studying sequences of real numbers. Since the supremum and infimum of an unbounded set of real numbers may not exist (the reals {{are not a}} <b>complete</b> <b>lattice),</b> it is convenient to consider sequences in the affinely extended real number system: we add {{the positive and negative}} infinities to the real line to give the complete totally ordered set , which is a <b>complete</b> <b>lattice.</b>|$|E

25|$|Besides the {{previous}} representation results, {{there are some}} other statements that can be made about complete lattices, or that take a particularly simple form in this case. An example is the Knaster–Tarski theorem, which states that the set of fixed points of a monotone function on a <b>complete</b> <b>lattice</b> is again a <b>complete</b> <b>lattice.</b> This is easily seen to be a generalization of the above observation about the images of closure operators, since these are exactly the sets of fixed points of such operators.|$|E
