40|$|Ten {{patients}} {{were included in}} this pilot study of <b>chlormezanone,</b> assessing its effects on duration and quantity of sleep and daytime performance using a pursuit rotor and a digit symbol test. Comparisons of the sleep assessments favoured <b>chlormezanone,</b> although the differences were not statistically significant. There {{was no evidence of}} any reduction in daytime performance after <b>chlormezanone.</b> The comparison of <b>chlormezanone</b> and placebo on the pursuit rotor test and the visual analogue assessment of hangover both slightly favoured the drug, but there were no significant differences. The study has demonstrated that it is feasible to evaluate hypnotic drugs more exactly in general practice...|$|E
40|$|In a double-blind, {{cross-over}} study of 90 patients with degenerative {{disease of the}} hip, knee, cervical or lumbar spine, and capsulitis of the shoulder the analgesic drug benorylate (either alone or in combination with <b>chlormezanone,</b> a muscle relaxant anxiolytic drug) favourably modified pain, stiffness, quality of sleep and ability to work. <b>Chlormezanone</b> significantly {{reduced the number of}} breaks in sleep. There {{was no significant difference in}} the number of patients reporting side-effects on each of the four treatments, but drowsiness occurred significantly more in the <b>chlormezanone</b> weeks. There appeared to be no advantage in adding <b>chlormezanone</b> in patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, lumbar spondylosis or capsulitis of the shoulder, but there was significant improvement in both pain relief and quality of sleep in those patients with neck pain. <b>CHLORMEZANONE,</b> a mild tranquillizer with muscle relaxant properties, has been shown to be effective in controlling some of the symptoms of musculoskeletal conditions including osteoarthritis (Condie, 1979). A multi-centre, double-blind, {{cross-over study}} was there-fore carried out to assess whether useful interaction occurs between <b>chlormezanone</b> and the analgesic drug benorylate in various rheumatic diseases...|$|E
40|$|A 4 -week {{study of}} <b>chlormezanone</b> {{was carried out}} in thirty-two {{patients}} admitted to a geriatric ward and requiring regular night sedation. Two patients required 400 mg nightly. the remainder only 200 mg nightly. The duration and quality of sleep. and frequency of awaking refreshed. all improved during <b>chlormezanone</b> therapy. There was no deterioration in mental agility test performance. There were no serious side-effects. no significant changes in blood urea or liverfunction tests. and no evidence of drug accumulation. It is concluded that <b>chlormezanone</b> appears to be a well tolerated drug for elderly patients with sleep disturbance meriting further controlled evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{fibromyalgia}} syndrome (PFS) {{is a common}} condition that often proves resistant to health interventions. <b>Chlormezanone</b> combines corrective effects on disturbed sleep with muscle-relaxant properties, and therefore could be of potential benefit in PFS. Forty-two female patients with PFS (mean age 49, range 24 - 72 years) were randomly and blindly allocated either <b>chlormezanone</b> 400 mg nocte or placebo. Patients were assessed by single observer at 0, 3 and 6 weeks of treatment; assessments included sleep quality, inactivity and morning stiffness, morning alertness, tender point score, mood change and global opinion (patient and observer). No beneficial therapeutic effect {{could be attributed to}} <b>chlormezanone.</b> Although there are problems in assessing severity of a predominantly subjective condition, this essentially negative finding is of interest in respect to the pathogenesis of PFS. KEY WORDS: Fibromyalgia, <b>Chlormezanone,</b> Sleep disturbance.

40|$|Drug {{reaction}} with eosinophilia {{and systemic}} symptom (DRESS) syndrome is a severe adverse drug-induced reaction. Diagnosing DRESS syndrome is also challenging {{due to the}} diversity of cutaneous eruption and the organs involved. Here, we described an 88 -year-old Chinese woman who developed DRESS syndrome under combined therapy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <b>chlormezanone</b> (CM) accompanied with cytomegalovirus reactivation. DRESS syndrome should be highly suspected in patients with symptoms, including skin rash, fever, liver involvement, hypereosinophilia, and lymphadenopathy, especially coexisted with reactivation of the cytomegalovirus. Early withdrawal of the culprit drug is necessary once the diagnosis is established...|$|E
40|$|Toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis is a rare, idiosyncratic, ful-minating bullous dermatitis that {{is characterized}} by se-vere exfoliative epidermal sloughing of the skin and mu-cous membranes. Although the clinical presentation can be variable, it often presents initially as Stevens–Johnson syn-drome, primarily affecting the mucous membranes. Then it rapidly progresses to involve complete detachment of the epidermis involving more than 30 % and up to 100 % of the body surface, with a mortality rate of 25 – 75 %. 1 - 3 The exact pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is most often associated with an adverse reaction to a drug. The most commonly impli-cated drugs, in order of decreasing relative risk, are sulfon-amides, <b>chlormezanone,</b> nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, imidazole antifungals, cephalosporins, anticonvul-sants, and allopurinol. 4 Typically, drug-induced toxic epi...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY- A {{review is}} {{presented}} of the drug-induced gustatory disorders that {{have so far}} been identified. Metallic, bitter or salty phantogeusias and hypogeusias, often of a dissociated type, which may even develop into ageusia {{have been described as}} side effects of treatment with some drugs. Personal observations on six cases are reported in which the gustatory disorders are attributed to the ingestion of phenylbutazone, carbarnazepine, <b>chlormezanone</b> and bac 1 ofen. After interruption of the treatments these disorders were reversible within weeks to months. During the last 20 years increasing reports have appeared of gustatory dis-orders of various types attributed to drug treatment. While such side ef-fects are generally rare, they have been observed with some preparations more frequently and occasionally even in up to one-third of the patients. In Tables 1 and 2 those drugs are listed to whic...|$|E
40|$|Flupirtine is a {{centrally}} acting, non-opioid analgesic that {{is available}} {{in a number of}} European countries for the treatment of a variety of pain states. The therapeutic benefits seen with flupirtine relate to its unique pharmacological properties. Flupirtine displays indirect NDMA receptor antagonism via activation of potassium channels and is the first representative of a pharmacological class denoted the 'selective neuronal potassium channel openers'. The generation of the M-current is facilitated by flupirtine via the opening of neuronal Kv 7 potassium channels. The opening of these channels inhibits exaggerated neuronal action potential generation and controls neuronal excitability. Neuronal hyperexcitability is a physiological component of many pain states such as chronic pain, migraine and neurogenic pain. Although large-scale clinical trials are lacking, the clinical trial database available to date from smaller-scale studies, together with extensive clinical experience, indicate that flupirtine effectively reduces chronic musculoskeletal pain, migraine and neuralgias, amongst other types of pain. In addition, flupirtine produces, at recommended clinical doses, muscle-relaxing effects in the presence of abnormally increased muscle tension. Its analgesic and muscle-relaxant properties were comparable to tramadol and <b>chlormezanone,</b> respectively, in two prospective trials in patients with lower back pain. Cytoprotective, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant properties have also been associated with flupirtine use in a small number of studies to date. When provided as combination therapy with morphine, flupirtine increases the antinociceptive activity of morphine 4 -fold. Flupirtine displays superior tolerability when compared with tramadol and pentazocine. The most common adverse effects associated with flupirtine use are drowsiness, dizziness, heartburn, dry mouth, fatigue and nausea. With respect to its molecular structure, mechanism of action and adverse event profile, flupirtine is a unique drug. Flupirtine is an analgesic with many potential therapeutic benefits that may prove useful in the treatment of many disease states...|$|E
40|$|Medication-overuse {{headaches}} {{were first}} {{detected in the}} ‘ 80 s and since then considerable knowledge has been acquired about them. An important tool for this progress has been {{the introduction of the}} classification of the International Headache Society, which has included Medication-Overuse Headache (MOH) among secondary headache forms in the 2 nd edition of 2004 [1]. Furthermore, the severity of medication-overuse headaches has decreased with years, also {{as a consequence of the}} new drugs available for acute headache treatment. At the end of the ‘ 80 s, the most used drugs by patients coming to the Headache Centre of Modena were combinations of caffeine, butalbital, and ergotamine (Cafergot PB); amobarbital, paracetamol, and codeine (Lonarid); caffeine, metamizole, codeine, and <b>chlormezanone</b> (Eblimon); caffeine, propyphenazone, and ethylmorphine (Mindol Merck); caffeine, aminophenazone, and ergotamine (Virdex). All these analgesic combinations contained active principles which could often cause both overuse/abuse, as in the case of barbiturates, and organic damages, as in the case of ergot derivatives. Today it is much rarer to have patients using every day large and toxic quantities of analgesic combinations. The most common case is instead frequent or daily use of therapeutic dosages of triptans [2]. Even if it has been remarked that triptan overuse may increase migraine frequency sooner than other medications [3], in our experience, these drugs are often the only effective ones for acute treatment in chronic migraine patients. The present real cases of overuse concern almost only analgesic combinations still containing barbiturates or the combination of indomethacin, prochlorperazine, and caffeine. In spite of progress, there are still various sectors to improve and goals to reach. We think that the first one is prevention. In order to fully achieve it, we need first of all more effective and tolerated prophylactic treatments, specific for these patients. The second one is optimal ways of handling the most critical patients suffering from chronic headache, analgesic overuse, comorbidity, and organic complications. There are no guidelines to manage these patients, since studies published in literature are so heterogeneous that they do not allow comparing results and coming to strictly evidence-based conclusions. In this situation, recommendations based on experts’ consensus should at least be given, stressing that also minimal goals are important in the treatment of critical patients, such as: reducing the risks of organic damages deriving from analgesic overuse, reducing the frequency of use and/or the quantity overused, and hindering progressive worsening by periodic hospitalization. Experts’ intervention could also make these patients’ hospitalization easier. Chronic headache and analgesic overuse patients’ hospitalization is often fundamental, but hindered by hospital chief executives, since deriving DRG are not very remunerative. Finally, we must consider that growing attention is paid to chronic pain and people are more conscious of the disability associated to migraine. In this context, the conditions of a large number of patients that we are not able to treat should at least be recognised as disabling.
