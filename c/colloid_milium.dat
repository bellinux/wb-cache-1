40|$|<b>Colloid</b> <b>milium</b> {{is a rare}} {{cutaneous}} {{condition with}} at least three distinct subtypes, characterized clinically {{by the development of}} yellowish translucent papules or plaques on sun-exposed skin, and histologically by the presence of colloid in the dermal papillae. In this case report, we present a man with multiple small papules on dorsum of his hands that in pathology confirmed to be <b>colloid</b> <b>milium.</b> <b>Colloid</b> <b>milium</b> is more commonly observed in fair-skin patients and remain unchanged; however our patient had dark skin type (Fitzpatrick skin type III) and lesions were increasing in summer and decreasing in winter...|$|E
40|$|Juvenile <b>Colloid</b> <b>Milium</b> (JCM) is an {{exceedingly}} rare degenerative condition of skin that begins prior to puberty. We report a 22 -years-old girl with non-familial JCM. Histopathologically, superficial dermal deposits of colloid material in {{direct contact with}} the thin epidermis of her lesional skin biopsy were observed...|$|E
40|$|Exogenous {{ochronosis}} {{is caused}} by the longterm application of skin-lightening creams containing hydroquinone. This irreversible disfiguring cosmetic problem assumes epidemic proportions in South African blacks. Mild ochronosis is characterized clinically by coarsening and darkening of the skin and severe ochronosis by coalescing, caviar-like black papules and atrophy. Histology shows ochronotic collagen fibres with eventual formation of ochronotic <b>colloid</b> <b>milium.</b> A variable cellular infiltrate, which may be granulomatous, is present. We describe a 39 -year-old black woman with severe exogenous ochronosis who developed superimposed annular lesions with granulomatous histology bearing great resemblance to lesions of actinic granuloma.

40|$|Abstract Hyaline or amyloid-like {{substances}} {{may be seen}} {{in several}} oral lesions. Some of these originate from epithelial cells and some from connective tissue components. In this study, amyloid-like material causing gingival enlargement in three patients, with eyelid involvement in two, was examined using histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. These accumulations did not share the classical features of amyloid such as green birefringence under polarized light after Congo red staining. Our findings suggest that epithelial degeneration {{plays an important role in}} the pathogenesis of these amyloid-like accumulations. These substances may be the result of defective amyloidogenesis and our cases may represent an oral counterpart of ligneous conjunctivitis or <b>colloid</b> <b>milium</b> of the skin...|$|E
40|$|Nodular colloid {{degeneration}} (NCD) {{is a rare}} dermatological {{disorder and}} uncommon type of <b>colloid</b> <b>milium.</b> The degeneration {{may be related to}} sun exposure. In this report, three cases, all presenting as multiple plaques and nodules over the nose and the face are depicted. Histologically, these nodular masses were homogeneous, with eosinophilic-cleaved materials expanding the papillary dermis and extending into the deep dermis. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS), crystal violet, and methyl-violet stains highlight the colloid material. All the three cases were finally diagnosed as NCD. NCD could be considered in any case with facial nodules and a long history of sun exposure. We suggest the long-term sun exposure as an etiologic factor; thus sun protection would be the most preventive and available treatment...|$|E
40|$|Exogenous {{ochronosis}} {{is caused}} by the long-term application of skin-lightening creams containing hydroquinone. This irreversible disfiguring cosmetic problem assumes epidemic proportions in South African blacks. Mild ochronosis is characterized clinically by coarsening and darkening of the skin; severe ochronosis, by coalescing, caviar-like black papules and atrophy. Histology shows ochronotic collagen fibers with eventual formation of ochronotic <b>colloid</b> <b>milium.</b> A variable cellular infiltrate, which may be granulomatous, is present. We describe two patients with severe exogenous ochronosis who developed superimposed papular lesions. Histology in both cases showed transfollicular elimination of ochronotic fibers. In one patient, gross epidermal hyperplasia, a dense lichenoid infiltrate, and partial destruction of ochronotic fibers accompanied the process of elimination (cell-rich type). In the other, concomitant epidermal hyperplasia and a cellular infiltrate were absent (cell-poor type). Further studies are needed to prove or disprove the existence of such a proposed subdivision. Transepidermal elimination in exogenous ochronosis has been mentioned in a previous report, but to our knowledge this is the first detailed documentation of this phenomenon. The clinical and histopathological spectrum of exogenous ochronosis is thus expanded. Articl...|$|E
