5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a <b>carbon</b> <b>sequestration</b> coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with <b>carbon</b> <b>sequestration.</b> David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, <b>carbon</b> <b>sequestration,</b> climate change, and sustainability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This study {{seeks to}} explain {{one of the}} methods for carbon dioxide capture and sequestration, to reduce the {{greenhouse}} effect in sustainable manner. Out of several CO 2 sequestration methods, biological method of CO 2 sequestration is better because the process is less energy intensive. Algae are autotrophic micro-organisms capable of converting CO 2 into carbohydrates and lipids {{in the presence of}} light by photosynthesis. In these study micro algae is cultivated for the treatment of domestic wastewater and <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>sequestration.</b> The work is carried out at two different stages i. e., wastewater treatment <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>sequestration</b> and tannery effluent treatment with <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>sequestration</b> from CO 2 gas. From the results we concluded that the algae can be effectively used for the treatment of wastewater when compared to treatment of tannery effluent. So, Algal photosynthetic reaction may hold the key to reducing emission in both economically and environmentally sustainable manner. Renewable form of energy can be produced from this algal biomass & many other useful products can also be produced.
