There were two <b>control</b> <b>strips,</b> both located on the inward-facing sides of the fences. The secondary [...] "K2" [...] strip, [...] wide, ran alongside the signal fence, while the primary [...] "K6" [...] strip, [...] wide, ran along the inside of the fence or wall. In places where the border was vulnerable to escape attempts, the <b>control</b> <b>strip</b> was illuminated at night by high-intensity floodlights (Beleuchtungsanlage), which were also used at points where rivers and streams crossed the border.|$|R

Blake crops at Três Lagoas, Mato Grosso do Sul State and Brotas, São Paulo State, Brazil, to evaluate the effects of weed <b>control</b> in <b>strip</b> of different width on the Eucalyptus plant growth. The experiments consisted of two groups treatments: group 1 - with constant width <b>control</b> <b>strips</b> being kept during the first 12 months, i. e., at 0, 25, 50, 100, 125 and 150 cm {{on each side of}} the Eucalyptus row and, group 2 : with increasing width <b>control</b> <b>strips</b> being adopted along the experimental period, i. e., at 25 to 150, 25 - 50 - 150, 50 to 150, 50 - 125 - 150, 100 - 125 - 150, 100 tot 150 and 125 to 150 cm {{on each side of the}} Eucalyptus row during the first 12 months.

40|$|Esta pesquisa foi conduzida em área reflorestada com Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla, no município de Três Lagoas, MS, no período de julho de 1996 a agosto de 1997, com o objetivo de avaliar os efeitos da variação da faixa de controle de Brachiaria decumbens ao longo da linha de plantio sobre o desenvolvimento inicial de clones de eucalipto. Os tratamentos experimentais constaram de dois grupos: no primeiro foram mantidas faixas constantes de controle durante os 12 meses iniciais após o transplante das mudas no campo: 0, 25, 50, 100, 125 e 150 cm de cada lado da linha de transplante das mudas de eucalipto; e, no segundo, foram adotadas faixas crescentes de controle ao longo do período {{experimental}}. Ao final do período experimental (390 dias após o transplante), constatou-se que as plantas de eucalipto que cresceram nas parcelas com faixas de controle constantes ou crescentes, iguais ou superiores a 100 cm, mostraram-se superiores, em diâmetro, altura e velocidade de crescimento absoluto. Com base nesses resultados, pode-se concluir que a largura mínima da faixa de controle a ser utilizada é de 100 cm de cada lado da linha, a fim de manter as plantas de eucalipto livres da interferência das plantas daninhas.
