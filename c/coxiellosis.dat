40|$|Coxiella burnetii, {{the agent}} of Q fever in humans and <b>coxiellosis</b> in other mammals, is an obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium which is sheltered and multiplies within typically large phagolysosome-like replicative vacuoles (LRVs). We have previously shown that, compared with fibroblasts, mouse resident peritoneal macrophages control the development of LRVs and bacterial multiplication within these vacuoles. Earlier experiments with the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG) revealed that the control is exerted by NO induced by the bacteria. We report here that phagocytosis of apoptotic-like, but not of aldehyde-killed, lymphocytes by the macrophages reduced the production of NO induced by the bacteria and increased the development of LRVs and, therefore, the total bacterial load in the cultures. Experiments with macrophages from mice deficient for inducible NO synthase (iNOS(-) /(-)) confirmed the involvement of NO in the control of infection, since neither apoptotic lymphocytes nor AG affected the development of LRVs in these phagocytes. Since macrophages are important for the clearance of apoptotic bodies and C burnetii is able to induce apoptosis in human monocytes, the phenomenon shown here may be biologically relevant {{to the development of}} Q fever and <b>coxiellosis.</b> Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Escola Paulista Med, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Parasitol, BR- 04023062 São Paulo, BrazilUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, Escola Paulista Med, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Parasitol, BR- 04023062 São Paulo, BrazilWeb of Scienc...|$|E

Here, we develop canonical SNP genotyping assays to evaluate spatial and temporal relationships among C. burnetii environmental samples and compare them across studies.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{to the analysis of}} registry data for bovine diseases with regard to the relationship between disease incidence and cattle trade are proposed. Firstly, a parameter-driven spatio-temporal disease mapping model formulated in a hierarchical Bayesian framework is used. Various cattle movement parameters, e. g. the number and proportion of in-movements from infected regions, can be included as potential covariates. Within this context problems of such an endogenous covariate are discussed. Since a purely parameter-driven approach is often not adequate to depict local epidemics, a so-called observationdriven infectious disease model is proposed as a second possibility. It includes an autoregressive part for counts in the region of interest in the past. Additionally, the sum of previous cases in other regions weighted by cattle movements is added to assess the spread of the disease by trading.

40|$|The {{surveillance}} of animal diseases {{is an important}} task of national veterinary authorities. Major aims are the prevention of disease spread and, for zoonoses, the transmission of diseases from animals to humans. Monitoring is mostly done by passive surveillance, where laboratory confirmed cases have to be reported. However, such data are often biased due to reporting delay or underreporting. Since 1991 the Swiss federal veterinary office (BVET) collects data on about 80 notifiable diseases. The week number of diagnosis and the location within one of 184 administrative regions is known for each case. Additionally, data from the Principality of Liechtenstein are available. The aim of this dissertation is to propose approaches for the statistical modelling of spatio-temporal patterns based on the specific characteristics of a disease and to apply them to selected data from the BVET database. If, e. g., regions with a high disease incidence are identified by such a model, appropriate control measures can be initiated. A further {{emphasis is on the}} presentation of user-friendly software and available model choice criteria. Spatio-temporal count data are often analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian models. For inference we propose integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and show their versatile applicability as regards space-time modelling. High usability is guaranteed by freely available INLA software. Along with the deviance information criterion we discuss predictive scores, which are provided by INLA for model choice and criticism. Such scores turn out to be useful for the evaluation of cross-validatory as well as one-step-ahead forecasts. We begin with an analysis of aggregated regional data of diseases with constant, endemic risk. In addition to modelling spatial autocorrelation we describe the inclusion of a linear time trend for a case study on <b>Coxiellosis</b> in cows. Furthermore, we discuss the appropriate specification (linear, nonparametric) of a region-specific covariate. For an analysis of Salmonellosis cases in cows we propose a nonparametric time trend and discuss various modelling options. A further emphasis is on the versatile interpretation of spatio-temporal interaction terms and the derivation of criteria to guarantee their identifiability. To analyze case reporting of Bovine Viral Diarrhoea concerning the affiliation of a region to a Swiss canton, we expand these models by a coarser, cantonal grid. A comparison with exclusively regional models using cross-validated scores shows a biased case reporting in several Swiss cantons. An active surveillance and vaccination program was launched for Bluetongue (BT) in 2008 / 09 within Switzerland. We perform a regression which assesses the association between individual information on vaccination, surveillance and altitude and the occurrence of BT for each farm. Additionally, a two-dimensional location effect on a regular lattice is included in the model. The results indicate that a vaccination reduces the risk of a BT infection. We propose a vector-autoregressive model for multivariate time series to model diseases with local outbreaks. Furthermore, we show how information on networks between regions can directly be related to observed disease counts. Using this methodology, a spatio-temporal spread of <b>Coxiellosis</b> in cows between neighbouring regions and by cattle trade is detected. Comparing one-step-ahead predictive scores it turns out that, for this case study, such a parameterdriven approach exhibits a better predictive performance than so-called observation-driven models, where actually observed previous cases govern the infection mechanis...|$|E

Infected peritoneal phagocytes differed from L 929 or J 774 cells in that: (a) large vacuoles took longer to appear (3 – 5 d instead of 2), and were only found in a subset (20 – 30 %) of macrophages, as opposed to in more than 70 % of the other cells; (b) total and vacuole-associated relative bacterial loads in L 929 and J 774 cells were several-fold higher than in peritoneal macrophages; (c) estimated doubling times of the bacteria were about 68 h in the primary macrophages, 18 h in J 774 and 22 h in L 929 cells.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii infection in sheep and goat flocks with a history of abortion in different areas of Iran. One thousand and one hundred ovine and 180 caprine samples from 43 sheep and goat flocks in four counties located in the Northeast (Mashhad), Central (Isfahan), Western (Arak), and Southwest (Shiraz) Iran were collected randomly between March 2011 and April 2012. The CHEKIT Q fever ELISA kit was used to identify specific antibodies against C. burnetii in sheep and goats. The results showed that the overall seroprevalence of C. burnetii in sheep and goats was 19. 5 % and 27. 2 %, respectively. There was a significant difference in seropositivity between sheep and goats (P< 0. 05). Central Iran significantly had the highest prevalence among the studied areas, especially in goat <b>coxiellosis</b> (23. 8 % and 40. 8 % in sheep and goats, respectively). The lowest prevalence in sheep was 12. 8 % in Northeast Iran while in Western Iran C. burnetii antibodies were absent in goats. The higher prevalence of Q fever in Central Iran may be partly due to persistent favourable conditions to spread C. burnetii in this area including drought and dust storms that originated from neighbouring Iraq and Kuwait. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the relatively high prevalence of Q fever in sheep and goat flocks with a history of abortion.

The bacteria is commonly found in various livestock and wildlife species such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, rodents, birds, dogs, cats, etc. In this study, we sought to estimate the prevalence of Coxiella burnetii IgG antibodies among humans and to identify risk factors for exposure. Methodology: Blood samples were collected from a total of 272 randomly selected subjects in Bura irrigation scheme and manyattas around the scheme. Serum were prepared from these samples in the study sites and transported to Nairobi for analysis. Screening was done using a commercial ELISA antibody test kit (SERION ELISA classic Coxiella burnetii Phase 1 IgG) {{for the detection of}} human antibodies in serum directed against Coxiella burnetii Phase 1. Results: The seroprevalence of coxiella burnetii in humans was 26. 8 %. This was higher in subjects sampled in the irrigation scheme (30. 2 % [95 % CI]) relative to those sampled in the non-irrigated areas (16. 4 % [95 % CI]). The seroprevalence for CB among adults, children and adolescents was 34. 2 % (95 % CI), 26. 8 % (95 % CI) and 23. 2 % (95 % CI), respectively. There were marginal differences in the seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii between males and females; these were estimated to be 28 % and 26 %, respectively. Risk factors associated with seropositivity in univariate analysis included occupation and age. Conclusion: Farmers have a high level of exposure to Coxiella burnetii compared to pastoralists.

Among the domestic ruminants, goats presented the highest prevalence of infection (23. 53 %), followed by cattle, (20. 83 %) and sheep (10. 53 %). C. burnetii DNA was also detected in five Egyptian mongooses and two antelopes and one giraffe. Using a 6 -locus multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA- 6) six complete genotypes, T, I and CM and the first reported CN, CO and CP, were identified, respectively, in small ruminants and Egyptian mongooses.

40|$|The obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium Coxiella burnetii, {{the agent}} of Q fever in humans and of <b>coxiellosis</b> in other animals, survives and replicates within large, acidified, phagolysosome-like vacuoles known to fuse homo- and heterotypically with other vesicles. To further characterize these vacuoles, HeLa cells were infected with C. burnetii phase II; 48 h later, bacteria-containing vacuoles were labeled by LysoTracker, a marker of acidic compartments, and accumulated monodansylcadaverine and displayed protein LC 3, both markers of autophagic vacuoles. Furthermore, 3 -methyladenine and wortmannin, agents known to inhibit early stages in the autophagic process, each blocked Coxiella vacuole formation. These autophagosomal features suggest that Coxiella vacuoles interact with the autophagic pathway. the localization and role of wild-type and mutated Rab 5 and Rab 7, markers of early and late endosomes, respectively, were also examined to determine the role of these small GTPases in the tracking of C. burnetii phase II. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) -Rab 5 and GFP-Rab 7 constructs were overexpressed and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Coxiella-containing large vacuoles were labeled with wild-type Rab 7 (Rab 7 wt) and with GTPase-deficient mutant Rab 7 Q 67 L, whereas no colocalization was observed with the dominant-negative mutant Rab 7 T 22 N. the vacuoles were also decorated by GFP-Rab 5 Q 79 L but not by GFP-Rab 5 wt.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{exposes the}} zoonotic Coxiella burnetii and its distribution in sheep and cattle herds in Germany. The {{importance of this}} zoonosis {{in terms of the}} potential hazard to public health, the need for preventive measures and control strategies and the problem of diagnosis of an intracellular bacterium of risk group 3 "Z" will be discussed. In this study investigations were carried out in clinically healthy non-vaccinated cattle herds and sheep flocks and in herds with increased abortion rate or clinical symptoms. Furthermore, retrospectively conducted epidemiological surveys are discussed by two Q fever outbreaks. In clinically healthy cattle herds, seroprevalence up to 9 %, and monthly average up to 24. 7 % were detected. 1640 sera were examined for this purpose. The results of investigations in 40 clinically healthy unvaccinated sheep flocks led to a prevalence at herd level of 5 % and a seroprevalence of 25 %. In the afterbirths tested in 2009 C. burnetii DNA was detected in 75 %. Nine isolates of the same phylogenetic group could be isolated. In this case the evaluations were based on a sample size of 1158 serum samples, 440 vaginal swabs, 440 rectal swabs, 71 afterbirths and 6 fetuses. The detection of C. burnetii and antibodies in clinically healthy cattle herds was performed using milk samples. This medium has the advantage of being able to carry out direct and indirect diagnostic methods from the same sample. The results of bulk milk samples showed evidence of C. burnetii genome up to 62. 5 % and antibody detection up to 68. 3 %. In the individual milk samples, we found the highest DNA evidence at 60. 0 % and the highest antibody detection at 62. 2 %. A total of 2980 tank and individual milk samples were examined. In the context of the epidemiological surveys of the described Q fever outbreaks, a prevalence of 16. 7 % and a seroprevalence 76. 2 % were determined. A constant course of C. burnetii and evidence of antibody detection cannot be determined in both species. It presents a continuous dynamic in the course of infection which varies from year to year and sometimes even month to month. It is clear that one-time studies represent only snapshots. The inconsistency of excretion and seroconversion are a constant challenge in the interpretation of the infection with C. burnetii. Long-term studies are required for the quality of the diagnostic statements and the assessment of the current risk potential of Q fever and <b>coxiellosis.</b> In addition to the difficulty of interpretation of diagnostic data, it is difficult to compare records of different studies. The described deviations of results in standardized, commercially available test systems illustrate this problem. In the international published literature on Q fever, there is wide variation in study design and implementation of the study conduct. Direct comparisons are therefore partly impossible. For the treatment and prophylaxis of <b>coxiellosis,</b> the importance of vaccination of cattle and sheep flocks increases. Through the demonstrated reduction of excretion and the abortion rate, it represents a good way to control C. burnetii infections and to prevent human disease. Still unclear is the large discrepancy between reporting higher numbers of cattle and much more frequent outbreaks in sheep. In addition to the genetic variability of C. burnetii genome, which can only be assessed by genome sequencing, the type of livestock of both species is important. The Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands shows that not only the species goat, but also the extensive farming is relevant. The transmission of airborne transmissible agents is increased by high animal stocking densities in herds and areas. There is a high number of unreported cases of human Q fever infections due to unspecific clinical symptoms. The same applies to cattle and sheep stocks. In the stocks, an infection may remain unnoticed for a long time, so the initial entry of the pathogen often can only be traced back by analysing human disease cases. C. burnetii is not a bacterium that causes large epidemics and high mortality in Germany. Therefore, the relevance of the pathogen and priority of epidemiological surveys and diagnostic measures often lead to discussions. Most Q fever outbreaks are limited in the number of patients. This is partially caused by underestimation of the hazard of this pathogen. Only by performing long-term studies of herds and flocks, specific risks can be assessed and when necessary appropriate control measures can be applied...|$|E
40|$|Endemic {{zoonotic}} diseases remain a serious but poorly recognised problem in affected communities in developing countries. Despite the overall burden of zoonoses on {{human and animal}} health, information about their impacts in endemic settings is lacking {{and most of these}} diseases are continuously being neglected. The non-specific clinical presentation of these diseases has been identified as a major challenge in their identification (even with good laboratory diagnosis), and control. The signs and symptoms in animals and humans respectively, are easily confused with other non-{{zoonotic diseases}}, leading to widespread misdiagnosis in areas where diagnostic capacity is limited. The communities that are mostly affected by these diseases live in close proximity with their animals which they depend on for livelihood, which further complicates the understanding of the epidemiology of zoonoses. This thesis reviewed the pattern of reporting of zoonotic pathogens that cause febrile illness in malaria endemic countries, and evaluates the recognition of animal associations among other risk factors in the transmission and management of zoonoses. The findings of the review chapter were further investigated through a laboratory study of risk factors for bovine leptospirosis, and exposure patterns of livestock <b>coxiellosis</b> in the subsequent chapters. A review was undertaken on 840 articles that were part of a bigger review of zoonotic pathogens that cause human fever. The review process involves three main steps: filtering and reference classification, identification of abstracts that describe risk factors, and data extraction and summary analysis of data. Abstracts of the 840 references were transferred into a Microsoft excel spread sheet, where several subsets of abstracts were generated using excel filters and text searches to classify the content of each abstract. Data was then extracted and summarised to describe geographical patterns of the pathogens reported, and determine the frequency animal related risk factors were considered among studies that investigated risk factors for zoonotic pathogen transmission. Subsequently, a seroprevalence study of bovine leptospirosis in northern Tanzania was undertaken in the second chapter of this thesis. The study involved screening of serum samples, which were obtained from an abattoir survey and cross-sectional study (Bacterial Zoonoses Project), for antibodies against Leptospira serovar Hardjo. The data were analysed using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), to identify risk factors for cattle infection. The final chapter was the analysis of Q fever data, which were also obtained from the Bacterial Zoonoses Project, to determine exposure patterns across livestock species using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Leptospira spp. (10. 8...|$|E

While various studies on single vector-borne diseases or presence of vectors have been conducted, no summarized evidence {{is available on}} the occurrence of these diseases and the related vectors. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive summary on major vectors and vector-borne diseases in small ruminants in Ethiopia. Search for published and unpublished literature was conducted between 8 th of January and 25 th of June 2015. The search was both manual and electronic based. The databases used in electronic search were PubMed, Web of Science, CAB Direct and AJOL. For most of the vector-borne diseases, the summary was limited to narrative synthesis due to lack of sufficient data. Meta-analysis was computed for trypanosomosis and dermatophilosis while, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis was done only for trypanososmosis due to lack of sufficient report on dermatophilosis. Owing emphasis to their vector role, ticks and flies were summarized narratively at genera/species level. In line with, 43 peer-reviewed articles passed the inclusion criteria out of 106 initially identified research reports. Data on 7 vector-borne diseases were extracted at species and region level from each source. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimate of trypanosomosis was 3. 7 % with 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 8, 4. 9), while that of dermatophilosis was 3. 1 % (95 % CI: 1. 6, 6. 0). The in-between study variance noted for trypanosomosis was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Among the three covariates considered for meta-regression, only one (species) fitted the final model significantly (p < 0. 05) and explained 65. 44 % of the between studies variance (R 2). The prevalence in sheep (5. 5 %) increased nearly by 34 % compared to goats (2. 9 %). The parasitic presence in blood was documented for babesiosis (3. 7 % in goats); and anaplasmosis (3. 9 % in sheep). Serological evidence was retrieved for bluetongue ranging from 34. 1 % to 46. 67 % in sheep, and <b>coxiellosis</b> was 10. 4 % in goats. There was also molecular evidence on the presence of theileriosis in sheep (93 %, n = 160) and goats (1. 9 %, n = 265). Regarding vectors of veterinary importance, 14 species of ticks in five genera, four species of Glossina and 4 genera of biting flies were reported. Despite the evidence on presence of various vectors including ticks, flies, mosquitoes and midges, research report on vector-borne diseases in Ethiopia are surprisingly rare. Especially considering the ongoing climate change, which is likely to affect distribution of vectors, better evidence on the current situation is urgently needed in order to prevent spread or to model future distribution scenarios.
