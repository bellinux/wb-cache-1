50|$|In {{the reign}} of Elizabeth the Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571 and 1584 avoided {{fraudulent}} conveyances as against all parties and voluntary conveyances as against subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration. Early in {{the reign of}} Charles II the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 turned most feudal tenures into tenure by free and <b>common</b> <b>socage</b> and abolished the feudal incidents. The Statute of Frauds contained provisions that certain leases and assignments, and that all agreements and trusts relating to land, should be in writing. The land registries of Middlesex and Yorkshire date from the reign of Anne. Devises (gifts by will) of land for charitable purposes were forbidden by the Charitable Uses Act of 1735. In the next reign the first general Inclosure Act, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801, was passed. In the reign of William IV fines and recoveries were abolished and simpler modes of conveyance substituted, {{and the laws of}} inheritance and dower were amended.|$|E
40|$|It seems {{a shameful}} thing to confess that {{the quest for}} 2 ̆ 2 tenure 2 ̆ 2 {{of land in the}} American States, so busily carried on in modem times, reminds one of the childish game, 2 ̆ 2 Button, button, who has the button ? 2 ̆ 2 It {{certainly}} appears disrespectful to such an ancient and honorable institution as English land tenure, to associate it with so silly a game. Yet is there not a resemblance? Lands in Colonial America were undoubtedly granted by the English Crown to be held in free and <b>common</b> <b>socage,</b> 2 ̆ 2 as of our Manor at East-Greenwich, in the County of Kent, 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 or, as in the patent given by Charles II to William Penn, 2 ̆ 2 to bee holden of Us Our heires and Successors, Kings of England, as of Our Castle of Windsor in Our County of Berks, in free and comon Socage, by fealty only for all Services, and not in Capite or by Knights Service: Yielding and paying therefore to Us, Our heires and Successors, Two Beaver Skins [...] . 2 ̆ 2 Unquestionably there was land tenure in Colonial lands, even though of the mild and somewhat defeudalized type possible after the statute of 12 Car. II, c. 24. Then what has become of it? Look about as you may, you will see none of the familiar signs of English land tenure; no doing of homage, no swearing of fealty, no reliefs, no rent service or distress in case of grants in fee (except in Pennsylvania), no escheat to the original grantor, even though such grantor be the Federal government, but only to the State in which the land lies. There appears to be no tenure at all. Then who has the button? What can have become of that Colonial tenure, which was so very real and active as to keep the colonists in unceasing conflict and turmoil with the royal governors, or unhappy proprietaries, who attempted {{to take advantage of it}} and enforce the rendering of services reserved, here nearly always taking the form of quit rents, and which did so much to bring on the Revolution? The answer has puzzled our scholars and judges. Professor Gray thought it not probable that so 2 ̆ 2 fundamental an alteration in the theory of property as the abolition of tenure would be worked by a change of political sovereignty...|$|E
