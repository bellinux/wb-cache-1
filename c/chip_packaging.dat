50|$|RF MEMS {{components}} are fragile and require wafer level packaging or single <b>chip</b> <b>packaging</b> which allow for hermetic cavity sealing. A cavity {{is required to}} allow movement, whereas hermeticity is required to prevent cancellation of the spring force by the Van der Waals force exerted by water droplets and other contaminants on the beam. RF MEMS switches, switched capacitors and varactors can be packaged using wafer level packaging. Large monolithic RF MEMS filters, phase shifters, and tunable matching networks require single <b>chip</b> <b>packaging.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the functionality of electronic devices, while reducing the overall size and weight of the electronic <b>chip</b> <b>packages,</b> electronic <b>chip</b> <b>packages</b> can be combined into a 3 D assembly. In this field we present a technology for stacking of multiple <b>chip</b> <b>packages,</b> {{resulting in a total}} volume almost equal to that of a single bare die. The technology is based on batch-processed ultra-thin <b>chip</b> <b>packages</b> (UTCPs) with a fine pitch metal fan-out. Package-on-package (PoP) technology enables stacking of UTCPs by vacuum lamination, followed by through hole interconnection technology for making contacts to the metal fan-out of the embedded UTCPs within the stack. The individual <b>chip</b> <b>packages</b> can be tested before stacking...|$|R
40|$|Improvements in <b>chip</b> <b>package</b> {{technologies}} {{have led to}} smaller package sizes and higher density circuitry that require superior reliability of <b>chip</b> <b>packages.</b> One of the crucial factors affecting the reliability of <b>chip</b> <b>packages</b> is warpage which primarily occurs during the reﬂow process. Because warpage may cause serious reliability problems such as solder bump failure and die cracking, warpage control has become a crucial task. Advancements in warpage measurement and prediction would provide important steps toward addressing this concern. Among the various warpage measurement techniques, fringe projection techniques (i. e., laser fringe projection (LFP) and digital fringe projection (DFP)) have emerged as recent trends due to their non-contact, full-field, and high-resolution (for small viewing area) capabilities for measuring the warpage of <b>chip</b> <b>packages</b> and boards (i. e., printed wiring boards (PWBs) and PWB assemblies). In this research, the measurement capabilities of a LFP system were improved by reducing its laser speckle noise and post-processing time, and a novel DFP system for measuring the warpage of painted and unpainted <b>chip</b> <b>packages</b> and boards was developed. Also, parametric studies were performed to predict the warpage of plastic ball grid array packages affected by four geometric factors. Finally, a guideline that manufacturing engineers can use for selecting the most suitable warpage measurement technique for their particular application was developed. The {{results of this study}} will help to improve the yields and reliability of <b>chip</b> <b>packages</b> and boards, reduce the manufacturing costs and time to market for <b>chip</b> <b>packages</b> and boards and ultimately reduce the prices of end-products.

40|$|In the {{electronic}} <b>chip</b> <b>package</b> development process, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) modeling {{is widely used}} as a virtual prototyping technology to achieve good designs. Due to the complexity and variability in materials, geometric shapes, and connectivity configurations, etc. in a <b>chip</b> <b>package,</b> FEA modeling is a tedious and time-consuming activity. Typically finite element modeling takes hours or even days to complete an analysis for a single <b>chip</b> <b>package</b> design.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for efficient modeling of discontinuities in <b>chip</b> <b>packages</b> and boards at RF/microwave frequencies is discussed.

It also leads to a reduction in the cost of fabrication of test structures needed for their characterization. Based on the 3 D full wave electromagnetic (EM) field computation results of the discontinuities, their electrical parameters were extracted.

5000|$|<b>Chip</b> <b>packaging</b> {{materials}} were an insidious {{source of radiation}} that {{was found to be}} causing soft errors in new DRAM chips in the 1970s.

30|$|It {{had been}} an {{industry}} wish to produce light with LEDs by converting the LED emission into an extended wavelength range in the visible light spectrum ever since semiconductor-based LEDs were developed. The concept of using phosphors to convert the LED emission was demonstrated by an LED <b>chip</b> <b>packaged</b> with a phosphor [3]–[8]. The earliest demonstrations started in the 1970 ’s, including, for example, a SiC-based, yellow-emitting LED <b>chip</b> <b>packaged</b> with a rhodamine-containing resin to generate orange-red light through down-conversion, and a GaAs-based infrared LED <b>chip</b> <b>packaged</b> with LaF 3 :Tb,Er phosphor to generate green light through up-conversion. Although the invention of GaN-based, blue-emitting LEDs brought about the promise of providing a red-green-blue (RGB) light source for full color displays and a white light source for general illumination in the early 1970 ’s, {{it was not possible}} to realize that promise until the GaN-based LEDs achieved high brightness performance in mid- 1990 ’s.|$|R
