5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a <b>congenital</b> <b>deformity.</b> It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E
25|$|While many {{of these}} {{procedures}} are done for purely cosmetic benefit, many plastic surgeons work on these features (giving them a more normal appearance), while performing a surgery to improve function {{as the result of}} a <b>congenital</b> <b>deformity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pectus excavatum is a <b>congenital</b> <b>deformity</b> of the {{anterior}} thoracic wall {{in which the}} sternum and rib cage grow abnormally. This produces a caved-in or sunken appearance of the chest. It can either be present at birth or not develop until puberty.|$|E

50|$|Surgery may be {{necessary}} to address the <b>congenital</b> <b>deformities</b> frequently occurring in conjunction with arthrogryposis. Surgery on feet, knees, hips, elbows and wrists may also be useful if more range of motion is needed after therapy has achieved maximum results. In some cases, tendon transfers can improve function. <b>Congenital</b> <b>deformities</b> of the feet, hips and spine may require surgical correction at or about one year of age.|$|R

25|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>deformity</b> – The {{correction}} of vascular malformations and cleft lip and palate abnormalities. In vascular malformations, {{the progression of}} the disease distorts the skin and the underlying structure of the nose. Cleft lip and cleft palate defects usually distort the size, position, and orientation of the nasal-tip cartilages. Reconstruction of vascular malformations can involve laser treatment of the skin, and surgical excision of the deformed tissues. When the underlying cartilage support structure is disturbed, cartilage grafts and suturing of the native nasal cartilages can help improve nasal aesthetics by re-orienting the nasal tip cartilages; and cartilage-graft refinements to the nose tip are performed as required.|$|E
2500|$|... : Clubfoot, a <b>congenital</b> <b>deformity</b> making walking {{difficult}} or impossible, can be corrected, using the surgery-free Ponseti Method for $250. CURE Clubfoot's {{goal is to}} eradicate clubfoot in the developing world, with over 220,000 children born each year with the deformity. By partnerships with other international NGOs, the donor community and in-country partners, CURE has treated 37,665 children in 18 countries with 291 clinics.|$|E
2500|$|Surgery {{is defined}} as {{treating}} injuries or conditions with operative instrumental treatment. Plastic is a derivative of the Greek word plastikos, which means [...] "to build up" [...] or [...] "to take form". This is a logical prefix, as {{parts of the body}} are remade or reformed during most reconstructive and cosmetic surgical procedures. Children make up roughly 3% of all plastic surgery procedures, and the majority of these procedures correct a <b>congenital</b> <b>deformity.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Long {{thought to}} have been born in Clarke County, Virginia, Washington was in reality born in Snickersville in {{neighboring}} Loudoun County, the child of John Perrin Washington and Hannah Fairfax Whiting, and was a descendant of Warner Washington, a first cousin of George Washington; his place of birth has been proven by census records of the era. The boy was born with a <b>congenital</b> <b>deformity</b> of his left foot, and walked with a limp his whole life despite attempts to repair it; he also suffered greatly from numerous childhood ailments. John Washington secured a job with the United States Post Office in Washington, D.C., and his family moved to that town in 1834. The younger Washington began his own career at the Patent Office, working there for some years as a draughtsman. He studied painting with Emmanuel Leutze during his time in Washington, working with the elder painter between 1851 and 1852. He also pursued further study in Düsseldorf, also with Leutze; his recommendation to travel there was supported by both of Virginia's senators, James Murray Mason and Robert Mercer Taliaferro Hunter, who urged Secretary of State Edward Everett to appoint him a dispatch bearer in Europe to provide him with funds for the journey. The Secretary agreed, and Washington began his duties at Calais upon landing there on May 16, 1853. [...] He continued to Germany and began studies under Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow.|$|E
