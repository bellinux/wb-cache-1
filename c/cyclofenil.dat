50|$|<b>Cyclofenil</b> was {{studied in}} the 1970s as an agent to induce {{ovulation}} in infertile women. It was then investigated as a possible treatment for scleroderma in the 1980s, but {{was found to be}} ineffective. Later study of its efficacy in treating Raynaud's phenomenon in people with scleroderma also found no statistically significant benefit.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cyclofenil</b> diphenol, a weak non-steroidal oestrogen, binds to albumin. In the {{presence}} of concentrations of albumin just sufficient to keep <b>cyclofenil</b> diphenol in solution, the compound inhibited the synthesis of [35 S]proteoglycans, [3 H]glycoproteins, [3 H]hyaluronate and [3 H]proteins in primary cultures of chondrocytes from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma in a dose-dependent manner. When excess albumin was present, conditions were found (90 micrograms of <b>cyclofenil</b> diphenol and 4 mg of albumin per ml of culture medium) which completely inhibited [35 S]proteoglycan and [3 H]hyaluronate synthesis but {{had little effect on}} [3 H]protein or [3 H]glycoprotein synthesis. The time of onset of inhibition of [35 S]proteoglycan synthesis by <b>cyclofenil</b> diphenol was very rapid (t 1 / 2 less than 25 min) and incompatible with an action mediated through suppression of proteoglycan core protein synthesis. <b>Cyclofenil</b> diphenol inhibited the synthesis of [35 S]chondroitin sulphate chains onto p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xyloside in the cultures. <b>Cyclofenil</b> diphenol had little effect on the secretion from chondrocytes of [35 S]proteoglycans synthesized immediately prior to treatment. Chondrocyte cultures treated with <b>cyclofenil</b> diphenol recovered their biosynthetic activities almost completely within 3 h of removing the compound from the culture medium. <b>Cyclofenil</b> diphenol had a similar inhibitory action on the synthesis of [35 S]proteoglycans in secondary cultures of human dermal fibroblasts from both normal subjects and patients with systemic sclerosis. It is proposed that <b>cyclofenil</b> diphenol inhibits the synthesis of [35 S]proteoglycans by interfering with the formation of the glycosaminoglycan side chains of these molecules in the Golgi apparatus of cells. The action may be due to disturbance of Golgi membrane organization by the compound...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Thirty {{patients}} with hepatic reactions to <b>cyclofenil,</b> a non-steroidal drug with a stimulating effect on ovulation, are reviewed. The liver damage was probably related to metabolic idiosyncrasy, and was reversible in all patients. <b>Cyclofenil</b> is a non-steroidal drug with a stimulating effect on ovulation. It {{is also used}} for treatment of scleroderma. Although changes of liver tests {{have been known to}} the manufacturer, published observations of increased serum aminotransferases in patients on <b>cyclofenil</b> have appeared only recently. ' A recently experienced case of marked liver reaction to <b>cyclofenil</b> initiated a study of the 30 cases with abnormal liver tests during treatment with this drug reported between 1969 - 1980 to th...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} {{cross-over study}} of <b>cyclofenil</b> and placebo treatments {{was conducted in}} 11 sclero-derma patients. Each treatment period was for four months. A range of subjective and objective measurements failed to reveal any consistent or obvious response to <b>cyclofenil.</b> One patient died of his disease during active treatment. Four were withdrawn because of liver dysfunction which was attributed to <b>cyclofenil.</b> It {{remains to be seen}} whether treatment over longer periods will exert a clinically significant effect. KEY WORDS: Scleroderma, <b>Cyclofenil.</b> ALTHOUGH scleroderma is a relatively uncommon disorder, it constitutes a major thera-peutic challenge. At best it is a progressive and deforming skin disease which evokes misery in patients and frustration in physicians. At worst, it is a relentless, systemic illness with a fatal outcome. The most characteristic feature of scleroderma is the fibrosis which affects the skin and other involved sites. Vascular and immunological phenomena are also well recognized and treatments have in general been directed against one or other of these three features. Thus, recent therapeutic claims have been made for D-penicillamine (1), captopril (2) an...|$|E
40|$|<b>CYCLOFENIL</b> WAS ADMINISTERED TO 17 NORMAL WOMEN IN 21 MENSTRUAL CYCLES, FROM THE 5 TH TO THE 11 TH DAY OF EACH CYCLE: IN 7 CYCLES 200 MG IN 5 CYCLES 400 MG, IN 3 CYCLES 600 MG AND IN 2 CYCLES 800 MG PER DAY. 200 AND 800 MG OF <b>CYCLOFENIL</b> PER DAY WAS ALSO ADMINISTERED TO TWO OF THE ABOVE WOMEN IN THREE SUCCESSIVE CYCLES. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF THE AVERAGE LEVELS OF BLOOD SERUM LH, FSH AND LH/FSH WAS OBSERVED ONLY IN THE GROUP RECEIVING 400 MG CYCLOFENILPER DAY. LH INCREASES ON THE 8 TH DAY, FSH FROM THE 6 TH TO 9 TH DAY AND THE LH/FSH RATIO FROM THE 8 TH TO THE 10 TH DAY OF EACH CYCLE. NONE OF THE GROUPS SHOWED INCREASE OF THE SERUM PRL ONLY, WHILE IN THE GROUPS OF 400 AND 600 MG AN INCREASE OF THE LH/FSH AND FSH /PRL AVERAGES WAS OBSERVED.

40|$|The authors {{compared}} the therapeutic {{effectiveness of these}} different pharmacological methods of preventing dysfunctional menometrorrhagia in adolescents, which were: 1) chorionic gonadotropin, 2) <b>cyclofenil,</b> 3) ovariostatics. Therapy was given during 2 menstrual cycles, and effects were evaluated both during the treatment and for the succeeding 2 cycles. Parameters followed were: a) clinical recovery, b) persistence of spotting, c) effectiveness in inducing ovulation. The results were equally good both in treatment with ovariostatics and ovulation inducers. The latter proved however, more effective during follow-up. Side-effects were very rare, so much so that, in no case was it necessary to suspend treatment...|$|E
40|$|SummaryTo {{increase}} the chemical diversity of bioactive molecules by incorporating unusual elements, we {{have examined the}} replacement of a C=C double bond with the isoelectronic, isostructural B-N bond {{in the context of}} nonsteroidal estrogen receptor (ER) ligands. While the B-N bond was hydrolytically labile in the unhindered <b>cyclofenil</b> system, the more hindered anilino dimesitylboranes, analogs of triarylethylene estrogens, were easily prepared, hydrolytically stable, and demonstrated substantial affinity for ERs. X-ray analysis of one ERα-ligand complex revealed steric clashes with the para methyl groups distorting the receptor; removal of these groups resulted in an increase in affinity, potency, and transcriptional efficacy. These studies define the structural determinants of stability and cellular bioactivity of a B-N for C=C substitution in nonsteroidal estrogens and provide a framework for further exploration of “elemental isomerism” for diversification of drug-like molecules...|$|E
