50|$|It was {{the second}} {{operational}} (permanent) United States railroad, the first over five miles long, and like its rival B&O Railroad, Mauch Chunk began using humble animal power to return its <b>coal</b> <b>tub</b> consists up to the summit - the mules were sent down in the last batch of cars and the return trip required 4-5 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Such low-technology {{longwall}} mines {{continued in}} operation into the 1970s. The best known example was the New Gladstone Mine near Centerville, Iowa [...] "one {{of the last}} advancing longwall mines in the United States". [...] This longwall mine did not even use a conveyor belt, but relied on ponies to haul <b>coal</b> <b>tubs</b> from the face to the slope where a hoist hauled the tubs to the surface.|$|R
50|$|Centerville Block Coal's Relay Mine Number 3 {{was located}} {{on the west side}} of town (Number 31 on the map). By 1908, the coal face was a mile from the base of the shaft. Mules were used to haul trains of loaded <b>coal</b> <b>tubs</b> to the main haulage way, where they were hauled by a {{continuous}} loop of cable the last half mile to the shaft. The coal seam here was about 3 feet thick, and the shaft was 107 feet deep. A centrifugal blower 12 feet in diameter provided ventilation, and compressed air was used to power mining machinery.|$|R
50|$|The Headframe is {{a replica}} of the one that used to stand at the Amblecote Colliery Pit No.12. At the bottom of the shaft was the on-setter, the man whose job it was to load the <b>coal</b> <b>tubs</b> into the cages. When the cage was loaded he would shout or signal (via the bell fixed to the head frame) to the man at the top the shaft, the banks man. He in turn would signal to the engine {{operator}} to raise the cage. At the top the banks man would take the truck from the cage, push it along the rails to the land sale wharf. The rails are laid on a slope above the wharf and loaded up with coal.|$|R
5000|$|On Monday 16 November 1903, water flooded {{into the}} 3rd West {{district}} of the 'Busty' Seam. The inrush killed two miners: John Whittaker (25) and Thomas McCormick (52). McCormick family tradition (source Harry McCormick) is that Thomas McCormick's son Gregory {{had to be}} restrained from rushing into the flood. When the workings were pumped out another man, Robert Richardson was found on Friday standing on his <b>coal</b> <b>tub</b> having been stranded in the dark, surrounded by dirty flood water for 92 hours. [...] "The inquest was opened by Mr. Coroner Graham on the 20th November and adjourned till the 9th December when evidence was taken, and the jury returned a verdict {{that the two men}} were accidentally drowned, and that, owing to the peculiar circumstances, no blame attached to the management." [...] The Royal Humane Society awarded their silver medal to six mine officials. The enquiry lasted just five hours. See the Durham County Advertiser news report.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Ashley {{headed the}} royal {{commission}} of inquiry which investigated the conditions of workers especially children in the coal mines in 1840. Commissioners visited collieries and mining communities gathering information sometimes against the mine owners' wishes. The report, illustrated by engraved illustrations and the personal accounts of mineworkers was published in May 1842. Victorian society was shocked to discover that children, as young as five or six worked as trappers, opening and shutting ventilation doors down the mine before becoming hurriers, pushing & pulling <b>coal</b> <b>tubs</b> and corfs. Lord Ashley deliberately appealed to Victorian prudery, focussing on girls and women wearing trousers and working bare breasted {{in the presence of}} boys and men which [...] "made girls unsuitable for marriage and unfit to be mothers". Such an affront to Victorian morality ensured the bill was passed.|$|R
500|$|The {{new owners}} {{embarked}} on a programme of expansion and installed {{one of the earliest}} electrical plants at any colliery in 1900. A sirocco-type ventilation fan made by Hick, Hargreaves, which could be powered by either electricity or steam, was provided. Deepening the downcast shaft to access the Deep mine at [...] started in 1903 and coal was reached in 1906. A massive timber headgear was built over the downcast shaft and a twin-cylinder vertical winding engine, built by Robert Daglish of St Helens, installed in the engine house. <b>Coal</b> <b>tubs</b> holding 10 cwt of coal were wound, six at a time in double-deck cages. The upcast shaft was used for winding men and had a smaller horizontal winding engine. An earlier shaft at the Forge pit was [...] deep and used for pumping water from the workings. A windlass was used for winding at this shaft.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from using}} the winding engine to raise and lower the miners and the <b>coal</b> <b>tubs,</b> the winding engine would also {{have been used to}} remove water from the pit. This was done by a process called tanking. After 1864 all coal miners had to have two head frames and two shafts to provide an extra way out of the {{workings}} in an emergency. The second shaft would be situated over the lowest point of the pit so that all the water would gather there in a sump. The winding engine would lower a tank into the sump, a special valve enabled the tank to fill with water, the tank was then raised and someone on the surface pulled a lever one the tank to discharge the water from the pit. There is one of these tanks lying {{at the side of the}} miner’s [...]|$|R
5000|$|Typically, {{they would}} work an eight-hour shift each day, {{during which they}} might haul 30 tons of <b>coal</b> in <b>tubs</b> on the {{underground}} mine railway. One 1911 writer estimated that the average working life of coal mining mules was only 3 1/2 years, where 20-year working lives were common on the surface. [...] Recollections differ on how well the ponies were cared for in earlier years.|$|R
50|$|The North Union Railway between Wigan and Preston {{opened in}} 1838. Coppull Colliery {{was owned by}} John Hargreaves. On 20 May 1852 was an {{explosion}} of firedamp, found {{to be caused by}} a lighted candle, 90 men suffering from chokedamp or burns escaped but 36 men and boys died. The colliery was renamed Hic Bibi Colliery in the 1860s. It had several owners and after it closed in the 1880s, fireclay was used at a brickworks started and operated by the Ellerbeck Collieries Company until it closed in 1959. Chisnall Hall Colliery on Coppull Moor was owned by Pearson and Knowles Coal and Iron Company in 1896 when it employed 135 underground and 48 surface workers. After 1850 Coppull grew rapidly, many rows of houses were built to house coal miners and factory workers. There were several collieries and deep shafts were sunk for the John Pit, Springfield Pit, Blainscough, Hic Bibi, Darlingtons, Ellerbeck Colliery, Birkacre and Pearsons mines. Mineral lines carried <b>coal</b> <b>tubs</b> to the main railway.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its {{elevation}} of 260 metres being considerably {{lower than that}} of Denniston (600 metres), the steep grade between the coastline and Millerton still meant that the coal was difficult to get down from the hilltop to the coastal railway near sea level. The Westport Coal Company built the Millerton Incline in 1891 and the Millerton Mine began production in 1896. Mining at Millerton ended in the late 1960s, as it largely did at Denniston. The Millerton Incline was a narrow gauge (...) incline consisting of two parallel sets of tracks on which the <b>coal</b> <b>tubs</b> ran, being hauled by rope. Remnants of tracks, trucks, bath house and other installations are still visible.The Millerton Incline was a significant engineering achievement for its time, and the remains of this incline and its infrastructure are more accessible than those of the more famous Denniston Incline. The Millerton Incline was used to convey <b>tubs</b> of <b>coal</b> from the mines around the Millerton area to the bins at Granity, which were once the largest coal loading bins of wooden construction in New Zealand. The bins no longer exist, but the incline remains and can still be seen today.|$|R
50|$|The Ingleton Coalfield was {{worked for}} 400 years. It is about 6 miles long by 4 mile wide and extends into the {{neighbouring}} parishes of Burton in Lonsdale and Thornton-in-Lonsdale. The coalfield terminates at the South Craven fault. The coal measures are shallow {{and represent the}} lowest layers in the Pennine coal measures sequence. The earliest coal mining occurred along the River Greta where Four Foot and Six Foot seams outcrop. Most deep mining was at New Ingleton Pit sunk in 1913. Its sinking led {{to the discovery of}} the Ten Foot seam (house and steam coal) at 127 yards, and the Nine Foot seam (steam and house coal) at 134 yards. Beneath them are the Four Foot seam (house, gas and coking coal) at 233 yards, the Three Foot seam (house and gas coal) at 236 yards and the Six Foot seam (steam and house coal) at 260 yards. Commercially viable deposits of fireclay lay under the Three Foot seam and pottery clay beneath the Six Foot seam used to make Ingleton Bricks.The Walkers achieved their legal victory through a son-in-Law William Knipe. Thomas Moore(?-1733) was the second husband of Marianne Walker and between 1702 and 1711 bought out other share holders in the collieries while building a successful medical practice in Wakefield. He left the collieries to be managed by an agent. His daughter Susannah married William Serjeantson- and his family ran the collieries from 1736 to 1828. Coal was delivered by horse and cart. Ingleton and Bentham Moors were enclosed in 1767. Plans were drawn up in 1780 to connect Ingleton to the Leeds & Liverpool Canal via Clapham, Settle and Foulridge, Colne but it never progressed. Boys and girls as young as four worked the collieries in the 1780, first as 'messengers' and from six, underground, as 'trailers', pulling <b>coal</b> <b>tubs.</b> The last mine was closed in 1940.|$|R
50|$|The inquiry then {{considered}} how {{the coal}} dust {{might have been}} ignited. Four possibilities were considered: Open lights (lamps or matches), shot firing, sparking from friction and electricity. No evidence of faulty lights or contraband was found (though there remains {{the question of the}} Howart's Patent Deflector reported at the 1933 inquiry). All shots were accounted for and every shot hole inspected; none was fired at the time or shortly before the explosion. Friction from <b>tubs</b> (<b>coal</b> wagons) against the rails or following a derailment was considered and dismissed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{railroad}} {{operates the}} [...] "trash train" [...] hauling refuse from Yarmouth to SEMASS, a waste-to-energy plant in Rochester, MA, as did its predecessor. However, Massachusetts Coastal operates the train {{under the new}} name, [...] "Energy Train" [...] using 20 former Canadian Pacific bath <b>tub</b> <b>coal</b> hopper cars rebuilt into [...] "Energy" [...] cars. These [...] "Energy Cars" [...] are numbered 1000-1019. These cars are painted in an attractive Pullman green scheme with a black band. The first 6 cars were fully painted with [...] "MASS COASTAL" [...] lettering, and [...] "ENERGY TRAIN" [...] written along the sides and gold stripes. the remaining 14 cars are in an abbreviated scheme with no lettering or stripes. This was done {{to speed up the}} delivery process. As of January 2015, the Energy Train operates Monday through Friday in the morning and afternoon. Mostly on Tuesdays, Mass Coastal sends a locomotive or two from either Rochester or Taunton to interchange with CSX in Middleboro. Operations in Fall River, New Bedford, and Taunton can be seen some days Monday through Friday.|$|R
40|$|Mining is the {{extraction}} of valuable minerals from earth. Mining creates pollution which affects the surrounding environment. Loss of many biological species and deterioration of soil quality were the ultimate consequences. During mining, companies should adopt mitigation measures for maintaining good environmental conditions. EIA (Environment Impact Assessment) is required to understand {{the status of the}} environment that will help in taking up appropriate strategy to combat any adverse effect on it. Soil status {{is one of the key}} factors in the EIA. Land rehabilitation and mine reclamation are very crucial after finishing of mining. For this purpose the present study was conducted on physico-chemical characteristics and microbial diversity of top soil from selected villages (Nawari, Tubed and Dhobiajharan) in the proposed coal mining area of <b>Tubed</b> <b>Coal</b> Mines Ltd., Latehar district, Jharkhand, India. The results showed that the pH of the soil was found to be slightly acidic in nature. The bulk density and the specific gravity of the soil samples were very low, that indicates that the soil samples contain higher organic matter which is suitable for the growth of plants. The Chloride content ranged between 8. 62 – 12. 69 mg/g which is far higher than normal range (0. 3 - 1 mg/g). Potassium content is extremely high in all the soil samples which ranged between 566 - 597 Kg/ha except the soil samples from Dhobiajharan village which is found to be very low 63 Kg/ha (normal range is 198. 5 - 254. 1 Kg/ha). 5 bacterial species (Bacillus species, Micrococcus species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus species and Enterobacter species) and one fungal species (Aspergillus sp.) were identified from the soil samples. From the result it is concluded that the soils is rich in macronutrients which is essential for the growth of plants. Hence the suitability of the soil should be maintained after completion of mining in the proposed area. ...|$|R
