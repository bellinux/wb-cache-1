5|$|Duquesne {{suffered}} {{its final}} disappointment {{of the season}} on March 17 as it fell to the Princeton Tigers. Bill Clark remained suspended and Damian Saunders led the team with only 14 points. Duquesne dominated the game early on, taking a 20–11 lead before Princeton came back, eventually leading 28–23 at the half. The Dukes were unable to turn the momentum and continued to fall behind, eventually losing 51–65. The absence of Bill Clark showed on defense, as the Dukes were out-rebounded heavily. The Dukes also failed to improve on their issues from the regular season, going only 8 for 18 from the free throw line and 3 for 15 from 3-point range. This loss ended the 2009 season, and all Duquesne <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> look ahead to the next year.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 1861, Frémont ordered Grant {{to embark}} south with his troops from Cairo to attack Confederate {{soldiers}} encamped in Belmont, Missouri. Grant, along with Brigadier General John A. McClernand, landed 2,500 men at Hunter's Point, two {{miles north of}} the Confederate base outside Belmont. They took the camp, but the reinforced Confederates under Brigadier Generals Frank Cheatham and Gideon J. Pillow forced a chaotic Union retreat. At first, Grant had wanted to destroy Confederate strongholds at both Belmont, Missouri and Columbus, Kentucky, but Frémont had not given Grant enough troops to do the job. All Grant's men <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> disrupt the Confederates and fight their way back to their Union boats. They escaped back to Cairo under fire from the heavily fortified stronghold at Columbus. A tactical defeat, the battle gave Grant's volunteers confidence and experience.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Dušan the Mighty and the {{accession}} {{of his son}} Uroš the Weak, in December 1355, was soon followed by {{the breakup of the}} once-powerful and threatening Serbian Empire. It disintegrated into autonomous lordships that, by themselves, could not resist Bosnia. This paved the way for Tvrtko to expand towards the east, but internal problems prevented him from seizing the opportunity immediately. A lordship on Bosnia's eastern border was that of Vojislav Vojinović. When Vojislav attacked Ragusa, in 1361, the republic appealed to Tvrtko for help, but to no avail. Vojislav's widow Gojislava, ruling on behalf of their minor sons, provided Tvrtko with passage through the family's land during his struggle with Vuk, and Tvrtko remained cordial with the family. He was, however, unable to defend her from her nephew Nicholas Altomanović, who, by November 1368, had seized her sons' lands. All Tvrtko <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> help the dispossessed widow safely reach her native Albania.|$|E
5|$|To {{sequester}} Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|With William dead, the {{succession}} to the English throne {{was thrown into}} doubt. Rules of succession were uncertain in western Europe at the time; {{in some parts of}} France, male primogeniture was becoming more popular, in which the eldest son would inherit a title. It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor while he was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear. This was not the case in England, where the best a noble <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to identify what Professor Eleanor Searle has termed a pool of legitimate heirs, leaving them to challenge and dispute the inheritance after his death. The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years. William the Conqueror had invaded England, his sons William Rufus and Robert Curthose had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested successions.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Washington {{essentially}} put the game {{away with a}} 5-play, 74-yard drive that ended with Garrett's third touchdown of the day, this one a 27-yard catch, making the lead 31–0.

25|$|The 1778 Treaty of Alliance, {{promising}} {{the defense}} of French territory in the American continent, failed to {{be observed by the}} United States as soon as 1793, when France entered in conflict with Great Britain in the Caribbean. All the U.S. <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to maintain neutrality, but this neutrality was so negative as to forbid the French the right to equip and arm privateers in American ports, or the right to dispose of French prizes in the United States. These reluctances in effect marked the end of the alliance.|$|E
25|$|However, in June, forces {{loyal to}} Constantius {{captured}} {{the city of}} Aquileia on the north Adriatic coast, an event that threatened to cut Julian {{off from the rest}} of his forces, while Constantius's troops marched towards him from the east. Aquileia was subsequently besieged by 23,000 men loyal to Julian. All Julian <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> sit it out in Naissus, the city of Constantine's birth, waiting for news and writing letters to various cities in Greece justifying his actions (of which only the letter to the Athenians has survived in its entirety). Civil war was avoided only by the death on November 3 of Constantius, who, in his last will, is alleged by some sources to have recognized Julian as his rightful successor.|$|E

25|$|In 1771, an {{incident}} {{on the field}} of play {{led to the creation of}} a new Law which remains extant. In a match between Chertsey and Hambledon at Laleham Burway, the Chertsey all-rounder Thomas White used a bat that was the width of the wicket. There was no rule in place to prevent this action and so all the Hambledon players <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> register a formal protest which was signed by Thomas Brett, Richard Nyren and John Small, the three leading Hambledon players. As a result, it was decided by the game's lawmakers that the maximum width of the bat must be four and one quarter inches; this was included in the next revision of the Laws and it remains the maximum width.|$|E
25|$|Just {{as quickly}} as Qahtaba's forces marched from Khorosan to Kufa, so did the forces of Abdallah ibn Ali and Abu Awn Abd al-Malik ibn Yazid march on Mosul. At this point Marwan II mobilized his troops from Harran and {{advanced}} toward Mesopotamia. On January 16, 750 the two forces met on the left bank of {{a tributary of the}} Tigris in the Battle of the Zab, and nine days later Marwan II was defeated and his army was completely destroyed. The battle is regarded as what finally sealed the fate of the Umayyads. All Marwan II <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> flee through Syria and into Egypt, with each Umayyad town surrendering to the Abbasids as they swept through in pursuit.|$|E
25|$|Franco {{canceled}} the Guadalajara offense on December 23, but the relief force could not begin its attack until December 29. All Franco <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> send messages to Rey d'Harcourt {{to hold out}} at all costs. In the meantime the Republicans pressed home their attack in atrocious weather. The Nationalist counter-attack began on schedule on December 29 with the experienced generals Antonio Aranda and José Enrique Varela in command. The German Condor Legion covered the attack. By New Year's Eve with a supreme effort, the Nationalists were on Teruel's Tooth and actually broke into the town to take the bullring and the railway station. But they could not hold the gains within the town. Then the weather actually turned for the worse with {{the start of a}} four-day blizzard, four feet of snow falling and temperatures of minus 18 C. Fighting ground to a halt as guns and machines froze, and the troops suffered terribly from frostbite. The Nationalists suffered the most as they did not have warm clothing. Many amputations were performed to remove frozen limbs.|$|E

50|$|Least I <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> (LICD) <b>is</b> a humor webcomic by Ryan Sohmer and Lar deSouza (also {{the creators}} of the fantasy webcomic Looking for Group), which debuted on February 10, 2003. The {{original}} artist for the strip was Trevor Adams, who was with Least I <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> for about six months. Prior to Adams drawing LICD John Horsley from y2cl was on board to draw the strip but dropped out in late 2002 only having drawn the first strip which was re-drawn by Adams. Adams was followed by Chad W. M. Porter, who drew the strip for two years. Least I <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> <b>is</b> produced by Blind Ferret Entertainment, which owns {{the rights to the}} strip. The primary theme of the strip is sexuality, especially the promiscuity of the primary character, Rayne Summers, who is loosely based upon Sohmer himself.|$|R
