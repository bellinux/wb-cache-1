5|$|His mother, Queen Hedvig Eleonora, {{remained}} the formal regent until Charles XI attained his majority on 18 December 1672, {{but she was}} <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> embroil herself in political conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Pope Urban VIII had {{personally}} asked Galileo to give arguments {{for and against}} heliocentrism in the book, and to be <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the rest}} of the infancy {{narrative}} these verses are <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> refer <b>to</b> Jesus as Joseph's child. The angel refers to him as [...] "the young child" [...] not [...] "your young child", but freely refers to Mary as his mother.|$|R
25|$|In Imperial Japan, {{the left-wing}} of the Japanese Esperanto {{movement}} was forbidden, but its leaders were <b>careful</b> enough <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{give the impression}} to the government that the Esperantists were socialist revolutionaries, which proved a successful strategy.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it's wuss nor that," [...] replied Cap'n Bill sadly. [...] "I'm on {{the edge}} of a precipice. Wait a minute an' I'll move along and let you see for yourselves. Be <b>careful,</b> Trot, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fall." ...|$|R
5|$|Kurt Franz {{maintained}} {{a photo album}} against orders never to take photographs inside Treblinka. He named it Schöne Zeiten ("Good Times"). His album is a rare source of images illustrating the mechanised grave digging, brickworks in Małkinia and the Treblinka zoo, among others. Franz was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> photograph the gas chambers.|$|E
5|$|The move 7.Bf4 {{is similar}} in spirit to 7.Nd2, in that White hopes to {{inconvenience}} Black by a quick attack on d6. After 7...Bg7 8.Qa4+! Bd7 9.Qb3 White attacks both b7 and d6, and Black must be <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> drift into a passive position after 9...Qc7 10.e4 0-0.|$|E
5|$|Some early {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, {{and preferred}} to eat parrots and pigeons; others {{described it as}} tough but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters had to be <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E
50|$|Her wooden {{houses were}} {{inspired}} by nature, <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> overwhelm or dominate the natural landscape, but rather blend with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That, of course, is {{something}} we'll {{have to figure}} out. We'll want to be <b>careful,</b> so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get our own fingers burnt." ...|$|R

5|$|Sukarno {{continued}} to command loyalty from {{large sections of}} the armed forces as well as the general population, and Suharto was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be seen to be seizing power in his own coup. For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats.|$|E
5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners. The Savoyards were <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E
5|$|Although Riley was wealthy {{from his}} books, {{he was able}} to triple his annual income by touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in {{managing}} his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours. Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books, and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> book busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short, lasting only three months.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{get through}} those bushes," [...] he said. [...] "Be <b>careful,</b> Hans, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> break a twig, as you go. We can climb that tree. There are plants, with stems like cords, winding round it. The top is so thick and bushy that I don't {{think they can}} see us, there." ...|$|R
30|$|The new {{learning}} environment characterized by P 2 P networking allows for {{new forms of}} learning and new ways of knowledge production. One must be <b>careful,</b> however, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> confuse the more mature concepts of fluid and relative knowledge, which learners gradually develop through dialog and exchange, {{with some kind of}} epistemological revolution mandated by the new networked environment itself.|$|R
50|$|Glass and silica {{cells are}} often the vessels in which the sample is placed. The {{scientist}} must be very <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> leave fingerprints or any other sort of mark {{on the outside of}} the cell.|$|R
5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{both the}} mill owners and local unions were against the army's {{takeover}} of lumber production. The mill owners disliked having the army overseeing their businesses, and the unions saw soldiers' labor {{as a form}} of strikebreaking. Disque, however, called on everyone to support war production. He was also <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> favor either owners or unions as he increased production, helping both sides achieve their goals. For the mill owners, military manpower kept mills open and running at full capacity; in addition, it prevented radicals from sabotaging facilities or equipment. The unions benefited because military rules stabilized wages and improved working conditions for loggers and sawmill workers throughout the Pacific Northwest. Among the improved conditions was a standard eight-hour day.|$|E
5|$|The {{unresolved}} larger narrative arc encourages {{speculation about}} future story events. According to Martin, {{much of the}} key to Ice and Fire future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make the story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what the readers believe to be true {{may not necessarily be}} true.|$|E
60|$|He {{did this}} judiciously, just {{giving them a}} taste of the marvellous now and then to whet their appetites. He was {{particularly}} <b>careful,</b> however <b>not</b> <b>to</b> practise on their credulity or to pass himself off as a conjuror. He distinctly stated that all his powers were derived from God,--their father and his,--and that he only excelled them in some matters because of having had better opportunities of acquiring knowledge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank yo', Mrs. Bunker. I'll {{be sure to}} {{tell the}} cunnle how <b>careful</b> yo' were <b>not</b> <b>to</b> give up his {{correspondence}} to everybody. It'll please him mo' than to hear yo' are wearing his ring--which everybody knows--before people." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{superior}} side must be <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> stalemate {{the opposing}} king, whereas the defender {{would like to}} get into such a position. There are two general types of stalemate positions that can occur, which the stronger side must avoid.|$|R
5|$|From 1930 to 1934, Wu {{studied at}} the National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University and {{reinstated}} in Taiwan), first in mathematics, but later transferring to physics. She became involved in student politics. Relations between China and Japan were tense at this time, and students were urging the government to take a stronger line with Japan. Wu was elected {{as one of the}} student leaders by her colleagues because they felt that since {{she was one of the}} top students at the university, her involvement would be forgiven, or at least overlooked, by the authorities. That being the case, she was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> neglect her studies. She led protests that included a sit-in at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, where the students were met by Chiang Kai-shek.|$|E
5|$|In summer 969, Sviatoslav {{returned}} to Bulgaria in force, accompanied by allied Pecheneg and Magyar contingents. In his absence, Pereyaslavets had been recovered by Boris II; the Bulgarian defenders {{put up a}} determined fight, but Sviatoslav stormed the city. Thereafter Boris and Roman capitulated, and the Rus' rapidly established control over eastern and northern Bulgaria, placing garrisons in Dorostolon and the Bulgarian capital of Preslav. There Boris continued to reside and exercise nominal authority as Sviatoslav's vassal. In reality he {{was little more than}} a figurehead, retained in order to lessen Bulgarian resentment at and reaction to the Rus' presence. Sviatoslav appears to have been successful in enlisting Bulgarian support. Bulgarian soldiers joined his army in considerable numbers, tempted partly by the prospects of booty, but also enticed by Sviatoslav's anti-Byzantine designs and probably mollified by a shared Slavic heritage. The Rus' ruler himself was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> alienate his new subjects: he forbade his army from looting the countryside or plundering cities that surrendered peacefully.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus was {{succeeded by}} his son; the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Zenobia, {{the mother of}} the new king, was the de facto ruler and Vaballathus {{remained}} in her shadow while she consolidated her power. Gallienus dispatched his prefect Heraclian to command military operations against the Persians, but he was marginalized by Zenobia and returned to the West. The queen was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> provoke Rome, claiming for herself and her son the titles held by her husband while guaranteeing the safety of the borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran. To protect the borders with Persia, Zenobia fortified different settlements on the Euphrates including the citadels of Halabiye and Zalabiye. Circumstantial evidence exist for confrontations with the Sasanians; probably in 269 Vaballathus took the title Persicus Maximus ("The great victor in Persia") and the title might be linked with an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to regain control of Northern Mesopotamia.|$|E
50|$|One must be <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> confuse a hill-fort with a 'ringfort' - {{a medieval}} {{settlement}} - a common archaeological feature {{across the whole}} island of Ireland, of which over 40,000 examples are known; one source claims there may be 10,000 undiscovered ringforts.|$|R
6000|$|The reply {{which most}} Clerical Councils would return {{respecting}} the [...] "axiomatic" [...] question of this Letter would probably be, [...] "We cannot answer a fallacy; we are <b>not</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> answer thee in this matter." ...|$|R
60|$|Albinia {{had been}} hearing {{much the same}} story from Mrs. Drury, though not so much exaggerated, and {{administered}} with more condolence. She did not absolutely believe, and yet she could not utterly disbelieve, so {{the result was a}} letter to Gilbert, with an anxious exhortation <b>to</b> be <b>careful,</b> and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be deluded into foolish expenditure in imitation of the Polysyllable; and as no special answer was returned, she dismissed the whole from her mind as a Drury allegation.|$|R
5|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Science, Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University and colleagues {{announced}} {{the recovery of}} soft tissue from the marrow cavity of a fossilized leg bone from a Tyrannosaurus rex. The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated as the Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125, or MOR 1125, the dinosaur was previously excavated from the Hell Creek Formation. Flexible, bifurcating blood vessels and fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling blood cells were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to ostrich blood cells and vessels. Whether an unknown process, distinct from normal fossilization, preserved the material, or the material is original, the researchers do not know, and they are <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make any claims about preservation. If it {{is found to be}} original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene. The absence of previous finds {{may be the result of}} people assuming preserved tissue was impossible, therefore not looking. Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures. Research on some of the tissues involved has suggested that birds are closer relatives to tyrannosaurs than other modern animals.|$|E

25|$|During the First Mithridatic War (89–85 BC), Tigranes {{supported}} Mithridates VI of Pontus, but was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> become {{directly involved}} in the war.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{point that}} has been much debated. They told you so in the Plains, did they not? Also the Tribes think it on the Mountain. Indeed, the thing seems reasonable, seeing {{that all of us}} who live are flesh and spirit. But you will form your own {{judgment}} and then we can discuss the matter. There, your arm is finished. Be <b>careful</b> now <b>not</b> <b>to</b> strike it or to fall, and look, your companion awakes." ...|$|R
50|$|Finally, in the {{judgement}} section Queen Aoibheal {{rules that}} all laymen must marry {{before the age}} of 21, on pain of corporal punishment at the hands of Ireland's women. She advises them to equally target the romantically indifferent, homosexuals, and unmarried skirt chasers who boast of the number of notches on their belts. Aoibheal tells them <b>to</b> be <b>careful,</b> however, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> leave any man unable to father children. She also states that abolishing priestly celibacy is beyond her mandate and counsels patience.|$|R
50|$|Because their styling {{changed little}} from 1958 through 1982, many film {{producers}} were <b>not</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> use period-correct Checker cars in their work. Often, a later model Checker (with side marker lights, late-1970s bumpers, etc.) {{was used in}} 1950s or 1960s settings.|$|R
