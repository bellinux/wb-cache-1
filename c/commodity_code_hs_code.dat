40|$|Abstract- The recent {{development}} of multimedia commu-nications across unreliable channels {{has brought the}} need for robust coding techniques, such that a partial loss of in-formation does not necessarily imply {{the loss of the}} whole video sequence. The implementation of Multiple Descrip-tion Coding (MDC) schemes based on the H. 264 /AVC cod-ing standard provides an affordable solution to this problem. This paper presents some MDC schemes that differently exploit the correlation (spatial or temporal) of a video se-quence. Several efforts were made in order to develop H. 264 /AVC standard-compliant MD coders. Finally, the ca-pabilities of the different schemes are evaluated and com-pared.

5000|$|If not {{traveling}} with the goods, which are shipped, one must use other customs declaration forms, such as: a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, or an import declaration form, or an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration. Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and customs declaration. For example, the form many require an <b>Hs</b> <b>code</b> (harmonize code), which helps define the type of goods and their associated tax rate, if any. Also, the forms normally require the traveler to note the country of origin of the goods and may sometimes require a certificate of origin.

40|$|Abstract – For some {{multimedia}} applications, like storage or surveillance, it may {{be desirable}} to encode the content at constant quality level; the encoder {{should be aware of}} media content and set suitable parameters. In this work, we analyze the case of video. We propose an algorithm to adapt the quantization, to obtain constant PSNR. This algorithm selects each frame’s quantizer level by comparison with the average of PSNR over N preceding frames, and modifying the quantizer accordingly. This system proved to obtain the target average with a variance in the order of 0. 3 in most of the cases. Furthermore, the application may require a per-GOP constant PSNR, like in semantic-based video coding. To obtain this effect, we propose a method to track a given PSNR pattern. The proposed algorithm is able to achieve the target PSNR for each single shot, 1 with a convergence time of only few frames after shot boundary.

40|$|Abstract—The {{decoding}} of context-based adaptive binary arith-metic coding (CABAC) {{imposes a}} heavy performance requirement on H. 264 /AVC decoding systems particularly for large-scale video sequences. As a simple approach of elevating the operating fre-quency {{is not sufficient}} to meet the performance requirement, this paper proposes an efficient approach to accelerate the decoding, which is effective under relatively low operating frequency. Since the CABAC decoding procedure is highly sequential and has strong data dependencies, it is difficult to exploit parallelism and pipeline schemes. The proposed approach resolves the difficulties by modi-fying the operation chain based on a thorough analysis, eventually enabling both parallel operations and pipelining. More specifically, 1) several context models are simultaneously loaded from memory while context selection is performed in parallel and 2) bin-level pipelining is enabled by employing a small storage to remove struc-tural hazards and data dependencies. Experimental results show that the proposed approach leads to the real-time decoding of HD sequences.

40|$|Abstract—An error {{resilient}} {{video streaming}} scheme that trans-mits offline <b>coded</b> <b>H.</b> 264 /AVC video through erroneous channels, called the alternative macroblock coding (AMC) scheme, is pro-posed in this work. In the AMC scheme, each macroblock can be reconstructed from one default and several alternative versions coded using different predictions. During the transmission, the sender tracks ACK or NACK {{messages from the}} receiver to detect transmission errors. When the reference used in the default ver-sion of a macroblock {{that has not been}} transmitted is corrupted by errors, one of its alternative versions that has the correctly received reference is selected to replace the default version in the output bit stream to stop error propagation. The AMC scheme is designed to ensure that the bit stream replacement during streaming will not cause significant mismatch at the decoder end and neither introduce large bit rate overhead to the transmitted bit stream. Furthermore, adaptive quantization selection and bit stream replacement methods are developed to improve the rate-distortion performance of received video. It is demonstrated by experimental results that the AMC scheme is effective in reducing error propagation in offline <b>coded</b> <b>H.</b> 264 /AVC video.
