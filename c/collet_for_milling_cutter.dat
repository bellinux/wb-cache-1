40|$|In oral implantology, proper {{execution}} of the holes for the installation of dental implants {{is directly related to}} the correct functioning and durability of the system itself. For this reason, the procedure discussed here, which was once performed freehand in all its phases, is now being implemented through aids with more precision. Masks currently in use are created in resin ad hoc; surgical stents are inserted into the holes that will then be used as a guide. These aids are fixed into the jaw by means of micro bone screws in order to prevent movement during surgery. Despite this, we still use the guides as they are, centered properly with the help of drilling jigs.

30|$|With {{regard to}} the substrate, the WC-Co was selected. The Co can promote the {{graphitization}} and deteriorate the adhesive strength of as-deposited diamond film. Although the higher Co content in the substrate could provide higher toughness <b>for</b> the <b>milling</b> <b>cutter,</b> the WC- 6 wt.%Co was still the most appropriate for depositing CVD diamond films on. Besides, the WC-Co materials with fine WC grains (< 0.5 μm) performed superior mechanical properties, and cutting edges are much easier to be sharpened, but the adhesion of the diamond film on these substrates was relatively lower, mainly due to the inferior mechanical bonding between the diamond and fine WC grains. So the WC- 6 wt.%Co with the regular WC grain size (about 0.5 ‒ 1.5 μm) was finally fixed. The uncoated <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> made of such the material (R-WC) had a radius of the peripheral cutting edge r of 0.02 mm. Moreover, in cutting tests, the uncoated <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> made of the WC- 8 wt.%Co material with the small WC grain size (< 0.5 μm) (F-WC) was also used as the contrast specimen, which had an extremely small r below 0.01 mm.|$|R

40|$|The {{review of}} manufacturer's {{programs}} to make thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> {{has shown that}} most of <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> are produced with the helical flutes with the ω slope angle {{within the range of}} 10 ° [...] . 30 °.

In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> shaving with a straight flutes, made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and clearance angles, and inclination angle of helical flutes at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the tool lead to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutter,</b> made of cemented carbide and high speed steel.

5000|$|This modular {{style of}} {{construction}} is appropriate <b>for</b> large <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> <b>for</b> {{about the same}} reason that large diesel engines use separate pieces for each cylinder and head whereas a smaller engine would use one integrated casting. Two reasons are that (1) for the maker it is more practical (and thus less expensive) to make the individual pieces as separate endeavors than to machine all their features in relation to each other while the whole unit is integrated (which would require a larger machine tool work envelope); and (2) the user can change some pieces while keeping other pieces the same (rather than changing the whole unit). One arbor (at a hypothetical price of USD100) can serve for various shells at different times. Thus 5 different <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> may require only USD100 worth of arbor cost, rather than USD500, as long as the workflow of the shop does not require them all to be set up simultaneously.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this work}} is to obtain the {{contemporary}} gradient materials based on the tungsten carbidereinforced high-speed steel using the conventional powder metallurgy method and increasing the high-steelhardness (80 HRA = 800 HV) by introducing the tungsten carbide as the reinforcing phase, with hardnessexceeding 2200 HV. Design/methodology/approach: The materials were fabricated with the conventional powder metallurgymethod consisting in compacting the powder in the closed die and finally sintering it. Forming methods weredeveloped for powders of the HS 6 - 5 - 2 high-speed steel and WC, {{making it possible to}} obtain material withseven layers in the structure. Findings: It was found out basing on the microhardness tests that hardness of test pieces grows along withthe sintering temperature and with WC content in the interface layers and in the high-speed steel ones. It wasalso observed that porosity decreases along with the WC concentration increase in these layers. It was foundout, basing on the comparison of structures and properties of the compacted and sintered test pieces, that instructures of all examined test pieces in the sintered state fine carbides occurred distributed homogeneously inthe high-speed steel layer. Research limitations/implications: It was noticed, that increase of the sintering temperature results in theuncontrolled growth and coagulation of the primary carbides and melting up to forming of eutectics in layersconsisting of the high-speed steel.

40|$|Milling is {{a process}} of {{producing}} flat and complex shapes with the use of multi-tooth cutting tool, which is called a <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> and the cutting edges are called teeth. The axis of rotation of the cutting tool is perpendicular to the direction of feed, either parallel or perpendicular to the machined surface. The machine tool that traditionally performs this operation is a milling machine. Milling is an interrupted cutting operation: the teeth of the <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> enter and exit the work during each revolution. This interrupted cutting action subjects the teeth to a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The tool material and cutter geometry must be designed to withstand these conditions. Cutting fluids are essential <b>for</b> most <b>milling</b> operations. In this Paper the design aspects of <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> is analyzed.
