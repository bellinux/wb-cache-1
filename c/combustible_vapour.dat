It not only escapes from the end of the tube, but falls down to the bottom of the flask like a heavy substance, as indeed it is. We find that this is the wax of the candle made into a vaporous fluid--not a gas. (You must learn the difference between a gas and a vapour: a gas remains permanent, a vapour is something that will condense.) If you blow out a candle, you perceive a very nasty smell, resulting from the condensation of this vapour. That is very different from what you have outside the flame; and, in order to make that more clear to you, I am about to produce and set fire to a larger portion of this vapour--for what we have in the small way in a candle, to understand thoroughly, we must, as philosophers, produce in a larger way, if needful, that we may examine the different parts. And now Mr. Anderson will give me a source of heat, and I am about to shew you what that vapour is. Here is some wax in a glass flask, and I am going to make it hot, as the inside of that candle-flame is hot, and the matter about the wick is hot. [The Lecturer placed some wax in a glass flask, and heated it over a lamp.] Now, I dare say that is hot enough for me. You see that the wax I put in it has become fluid, and there is a little smoke coming from it. We shall very soon have the vapour rising up. I will make it still hotter, and now we get more of it, so that I can actually pour the vapour out of the flask into that basin, and set it on fire there. This, then, is exactly the same kind of vapour as we have in the middle of the candle; and that you may be sure this is the case, let us try whether we have not got here, in this flask, a real <b>combustible</b> <b>vapour</b> out of the middle of the candle. [Taking the flask into which the tube from the candle proceeded, and introducing a lighted taper.] See how it burns. Now, this is the vapour from the middle of the candle, produced by its own heat; and that is one of the first things you have to consider with respect to the progress of the wax in the course of its combustion, and as regards the changes it undergoes. I will arrange another tube carefully in the flame, and I should not wonder if we were able, by a little care, to get that vapour to pass through the tube to the other extremity, where we will light it, and obtain absolutely the flame of the candle at a place distant from it. Now, look at that. Is not that a very pretty experiment? Talk about laying on gas--why, we can actually lay on a candle! And you see from this that there are clearly two different kinds of action--one the production of the vapour, and the other the combustion of it--both of which take place in particular parts of the candle.|$|E

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model is}} presented for vaporization and combustion of heavy residual based fuel oil in high-pressure sprays, {{in the context}} of marine diesel engines. The fuel is considered as a mix of residual base and cutter stock. The model accounts for multiple fuel components as well as limited diffusion rates and thermal decomposition rates within droplets by the use of straight-line relationships for the saturation pressure of <b>combustible</b> fuel <b>vapour</b> at the droplet surface as functions of droplet temperature. The energy required for decomposition of heavy molecules is accounted for. Combustion is modelled using a timescale that is the sum of a kinetic timescale based on a single-step reaction and a turbulent timescale based on turbulent mixing rates. The ignition timescale is based on a simple three-equation model. Cellwise ignition is employed. The heavy fuel oil model is applied to two different constant volume chambers that are used to test ignition and combustion quality of marine heavy fuel oil, using the computational fluid dynamics code StarCD version 3. 2. Good agreement is shown between trends in measured and computed data including ignition delay, burn rate and spatial distribution of spray and flame parameters. The model is tested for two representative fuels, one with good ignition and combustion properties and one poor. Essentially only two parameters need to be changed to set the fuel quality. These are the ignition delay factor and the activation energy for the high-temperature kinetics. Further tuning of the model to specific fuels is possible by modifying the saturation temperature relationships...|$|R

The {{power or}} force which makes <b>combustible</b> gas or <b>vapour</b> abandon its elastic state {{in contact with}} a solid, that it may cover the latter with a thin stratum of its own proper substance, is {{considered}} as being neither attraction nor affinity. It is able also to extend liquids and solids in concrete lamin√¶ {{over the surface of}} the acting solid body, and consists in a repulsion, which is developed from the parts of the solid body by the simple fact of attenuation, and is highest when the attenuation is most complete. The force has a progressive development, and acts most powerfully, or at first, in the direction in which the dimensions of the attenuated mass decrease, and then {{in the direction of the}} angles or corners which from any cause may exist on the surface. This force not only causes spontaneous diffusion of gases and other substances over the surface, but is considered as very elementary in its nature, and competent to account for all the phenomena of capillarity, chemical affinity, attraction of aggregation, rarefaction, ebullition, volatilization, explosion, and other thermometric effects, as well as inflammation, detonation, &c. &c. It is considered as a form of heat to which the term native calorie is given, and is still further viewed as the principle of the two electricities and the two magnetisms.|$|R
50|$|The modern Diesel {{engine is}} a hybrid {{incorporating}} {{the features of}} direct (airless) injection and compression-ignition, both patented (No. 7146) as Improvements in Engines Operated by the Explosion of Mixtures of <b>Combustible</b> <b>Vapour</b> or Gas and Air by Akroyd-Stuart and Charles Richard Binney in May 1890. Another patent (No. 15,994) was taken out on 8 October 1890, which details the working of a complete engine where air and fuel are introduced separately. But such a system was not feasible for the essential vaporization of heavier fuels for combustion in an enigne and moreover the modern diesel engine operation is based on vaporization by the fuel delivery system and not by internal thermal vaporization as in hot bulb which bears more similarity to original solution of Rudolph Diesel by employing injection and vaporization through air blast system which was the only technology available at that time capable of vaporizing and introducing heavier fuel at high pressure in the cylinder.|$|E
