25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the inquiry}} he {{repeatedly}} berated the politicians conducting it, and the government. When {{asked about his}} company's tax minimisation schemes, he replied: [...] "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> minimising my tax. And if anybody in this country doesn't minimise their tax, they want their heads read, because as a government, I can tell you you're not spending it that well {{that we should be}} donating extra!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark McMenamin, a {{professor}} of geology, quotes {{a section of the}} book describing a billion-year-old supercontinent that subsequently split apart, forming ocean basins where early marine life developed. He says, [...] "This amazing passage, written in the 1930s, anticipates scientific results that did not actually appear in the scientific literature until many decades later." [...] McMenamin also states, [...] "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> being selective here in my choice of quotations, and there are reams of scientifically untenable material in The Urantia Book." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{following}} year potato blight brought famine which impinged on the Darwins' servants and workmen, and led to overthrow of the Corn Laws. Darwin welcomed this, but as a landowner now found that it affected his income from rent and {{he wrote to his}} agent that [...] "Although I am on principle a free-trader, of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not willing to make a larger reduction than necessary to retain a good tenant." [...] Despite his own illness recurring, Darwin pressed on with South America, having to jointly subsidise it with the publisher when the Treasury grant ran out, and it was completed by October 1846.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in November 2015, in {{connection}} with his presidential campaign, Sanders's announcements suggested {{that not only was}} he running as a Democrat, but that he would run as a Democrat in future elections. When challenged by Clinton about his party commitment, he said, [...] "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination." [...] During the campaign, news sources often referred to him as a Democrat. Since he remained a senator, elected as an independent, the United States Senate website continued to refer to Sanders as an independent during the campaign and upon his return to the Senate. He confirmed {{at the end of the}} campaign that he remained an independent in the senate for the balance of his term, since that was how he was elected.|$|E
2500|$|The Duke de Broglie {{turned to}} Marshal MacMahon, a veteran soldier who had {{defeated}} the Austrians at the Battle of Magenta, had been wounded fighting the Germans and had defeated the Commune. MacMahon declined at first, but as Broglie [...] persisted, {{he said that}} had no political ambitions, but that if Thiers retired, {{he did not want}} to leave France without a government. In the parliamentary debate that soon followed, Thiers declared: [...] "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> for a republic...outside of a republic, there is nothing but chaos." [...] Thiers was immediately supported by Gambetta, leader of the left republicans, who said, [...] "Thiers is the best shield against the monarchists in the Assembly." [...] His ally Jules Simon warned him: [...] "You irritate the left but you don't appease the right", but Thiers was confident of victory; he told Simon, [...] "I have the popularity; the country is with me." ...|$|E

In the fall of 2011, during an interview to promote Miss Little Havana, Estefan expressed her views on gay rights and gay marriage and revealed {{that she was a}} strong supporter of both.

[...] Estefan has also recorded a video for the It Gets Better campaign, an organization which aims to prevent homophobic bullying.|$|E
2500|$|Coles ran for {{governor}} in the election of 1822. To his great surprise, he won the election by a very tight margin, defeating Chief Justice Joseph Philips (an ally of Judge Jesse Thomas and prominent slavery advocate {{in his own right}} who eventually returned to Kentucky), Associate Justice Thomas C. Browne(the eventual candidate of the Ninian Edwards faction) and militia commander James B. Moore. Coles had left Illinois on election day believing he had lost, and received the news of his victory while in Virginia recovering from bilious fever. He accordingly cleared up his land office accounts in Washington, D.C. and returned to Illinois. Madison sent him a package containing a pedometer, and a note, [...] "As you are about to assume new motives to walk in a straight path, and with measured steps, I wish you to accept the little article enclosed, as a type of the <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure you will pursue, and as a token of the affection I have so long cherished for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean it {{on every}} ground," [...] said Mr. Turnbull, rising {{on his legs}} and {{standing}} {{with his back to}} the fire.
