40|$|Despite {{a growing}} body of {{information}} about the importance of good logistics and supply chain management, there remains a dearth of research regarding <b>consumer-to-business</b> reverse logistics (the collection of processes required to move individual goods from individual end-consumers to the appropriate retailer, manufacturer, or third party). Indeed, there is not a comprehensive framework to assist enterprises in understanding, evaluating, creating, implementing, or changing a <b>consumer-to-business</b> reverse logistics policy of program. Given the growth of e-commerce and the Internet channel, where goods are often delivered to end-consumers in quantities of one and may likely be returned in quantities of one, this absence of a framework is peculiar. This thesis seeks to fill that gap by utilizing analysis of existing literature, as well as extrapolation of recent trends and developments in reverse logistics service offerings, technology, and last mile solutions. The results are that there is enough available information on the processes and issues surrounding <b>consumer-to-business</b> reverse logistics that a flexible and pragmatic framework can be proposed for use in the United States. This is accomplished by synthesizing results with original analysis, thought, and context. Though the framework cannot be considered comprehensive, it does provide an initial tool for critique and improvement. by Jonathan M. Fleck. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} concept of dispute system design {{in the context of}} {{consumer}} dispute resolution (CDR). While there is a growing literature on dispute system design (DSD) in North America, practitioners and scholars in the UK and Europe have failed to give significant attention to DSD as a discrete activity. As the role of CDR within civil justice systems across Europe continues to grow, the activity of ‘designing justice’ in this area should increasingly be seen as a matter of constitutional as well as practical significance. A failure to address this issue risks undermining the continued legitimacy of state-sanctioned dispute resolution for <b>consumer-to-business</b> disputes. In this chapter, we present a new dispute design model for CDR mechanisms and, drawing on several case studies, demonstrate how it may be applied in practice...|$|E

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} model for {{designing}} consumer dispute resolution (CDR) mechanisms (including conciliation, adjudication, arbitration, and ombuds schemes). This field has expanded significantly in recent years, replacing courts as the primary forum of dispute resolution {{in some areas of}} <b>consumer-to-business</b> activity. This expansion has been ad hoc, with a lack of consistency in the design of CDR mechanisms and in the overall shape of the CDR landscape. In light of the recent implementation of the EU’s Directive on Consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution and Regulation on Consumer Online Dispute Resolution, Dispute System Design (DSD) requires urgent attention to ensure that the design of future mechanisms is based on coherent principles. A failure to address this issue risks undermining the legitimacy of state-sanctioned dispute resolution.

40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} {{has changed}} the outlook of traditional business trading behavior. It is now common to see business-to-business (B 2 B), business-to-consumer (B 2 C) and consumer-to-consumer (C 2 C) commerce on the Internet. However, another type of model, <b>consumer-to-business</b> (C 2 B), is seldom found. A possible reason for this phenomenon is transaction cost; to unite a group of candidate buyers’ common needs and preferences to buy a product or service is uneasy. Difficulties arise, for example, in how to synthesize individual’s preferences into a group’s consensus, how {{to communicate with each}} other within the group, and how to collectively negotiate with a seller, etc. To establish a successful business model in the electronic market, however, these processes have to be implemented. We address these issues in this paper, and propose a Buyer Collective Purchasing (BCP) model implemented in a multi-agent framework. A prototype system, which uses a laptop computer purchasing case as an example, is created to demonstrate the idea and show how the model works...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Consumer-to-Business</b> (C 2 B) systems {{represent}} {{the future of}} eCommerce. Using natural language as a basis, and remaining keenly aware of its potential pitfalls, we describe a software specific communication model based on a new concept called content-biased language (CBL). It is shown that the requirements of a C 2 B system cannot be satisfied with anything less than the stretchability of a CBL. Once this fact has been established, {{the remainder of this}} paper discusses a representation for a CBL, as well as an architecture for utilizing that representation. This effort results in the description of a new software quality measure called stretchability, as well as the introduction of perspective domain graphs (PDGs), external open ontological type systems (EOOTS), and global and constituent systems. Finally, the discussion closes with the definition of a new distributed system design called the Content Oriented Architecture (COA). 1. Consumer-To-Business: The New Acronym for eCommerce Business-to-Business, or B 2 B, is a well-known term designating the Internet-based supply-chain oriented transactions executed between corporations. Business-to-Consumer (B 2 C) has also entered the business executive’s arsenal of Internet-based acronyms and generally signifies the set of activities surrounding the marketing and selling of goods by companies to individuals.

40|$|Purpose: Much of {{the success}} of a {{relationship}} marketing program rests on the consumers’ choice to participate in a service relationship in the first instance. This study examines the degree to which this desire of the consumer to engage in a relationship impacts upon their perceived cognitive-state gains (motivation, confidence and affiliation) and key measures of <b>consumer-to-business</b> relationship success (relationship strength, satisfaction and retention intentions). Design/methodology/approach: Following a qualitative study, the main quantitative study used a self-administered survey of 334 service consumers to understand relationship perceptions. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Analysis revealed that consumers desire to participate in a relationship influenced their level of motivation, degree of confidence and these, in turn, impacted upon the consumers sense of affiliation with the service provider. A consumers’ sense of affiliation subsequently influenced the strength of their relationship and their level of satisfaction with the relationship. Additionally, the effect of relationship desire upon relationship strength and satisfaction was apparent. Consumers’ desire indirectly impacted upon retention intentions, suggesting that service managers should be careful not to assume that consumers’ deliberate choice to participate in a relationship will routinely result in loyalty. Originality/value: Practitioners and academics have sought to determine why some consumers, and not others, participate in relationships. This study adds to knowledge in this area by empirically demonstrating {{the extent to which the}} desire of a consumer to participate in a service relationship effects the gains accrued to the consumer and the relationship outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Policy {{concerns}} arise as e-business activities {{become increasingly}} common. This paper discusses {{important elements of}} such concerns, particularly the pro- and anti-competitive assessment of online business-to-business (B 2 B) exchanges. The definition of markets, the role of quality management and communication, and joint purchasing implications within such environments are related to food distribution systems. Other online business-to-consumer (B 2 C) and <b>consumer-to-business</b> (C 2 B) policy concerns are also raised. The distinctions between various markets within the rapidly evolving e-business environment {{can be compared to}} an iceberg: the vast majority of transactions occur under the surface via online business-to-business (B 2 B) exchanges. While estimates for the overall importance of e-business vary considerably, most suggest that B 2 B activity accounts for up to ten times the volume of business-to-consumer (B 2 C) e-commerce. This paper discusses the policy implications of the evolving role of such online B 2 B exchanges and suggests repercussions for food distribution systems. Online B 2 B exchanges can be characterized as groupings of firms using the Internet to communicate and coordinate production, processing, purchasing, and marketing activities. They may be horizontal (across industries or markets) or vertical (throughout a particular supply chain). These business relationships are not newly introduced by the networked economy-much recent discussion with regard to agribusiness structure and behavior has addressed similar policy concerns related to integration of supply chains. This discussion informs the broad analysis of online B 2 B exchanges. It is also important to recognize that electronic exchanges themselves are not new phenomena; early forms using satellite, telephone, and fax communications predated the move towards e-commerce. What is new is the bi-directional asynchronous and very rapid environment introduced by the Internet. Hooker and Ernst are assistant professor and communicatio...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – With B 2 B (business-to-business) and new {{developments}} in marketing as the springboard, to emphasize the necessity of heeding complexity and context by addressing marketing as a coherent, relational system. Methodology/approach – Conceptual analysis based on {{new developments}} in marketing, network theory, and case study research. Findings – First, any company or marketing situation directly or indirectly embraces both B 2 B and B 2 C (business-to-consumer) issues. Second, recent marketing theory points to changing roles between suppliers and customers. Two of these developments, many-to-many marketing as a broadening of relationship marketing (RM) and CRM (customer relationship management), and the service dominant logic (S-D logic) stress C 2 B (<b>consumer-to-business)</b> and C 2 C (customer-to-customer) interaction, exposing the customer’s active role. Third, a practitioner contribution, the cross-disciplinary IBM service science program, is enrolling academic research and education {{in the development of}} more functional and seamless service systems that work in real settings. Fourth, the conventional divide in goods and services marketing is conceptually dissolved in favor of supplier-customer interaction leading to value propositions and the co-creation of value. Research implications – B 2 B, B 2 C/C 2 B and C 2 C aspects are part of an integrated, complex context. Case study research and network theory allow researchers to address complexity and context to come forward. Network theory should be used in all marketing and not only on B 2 B. Definitions, categories and concepts in use need to be constantly evaluated as to validity and relevance for contemporary and future marketing. The conventional economic sectors (manufacturing, services, agriculture) are supplier-centric whereas marketing prescribes customer-centricity. By focusing on continuous theory generation, an open source code and mass collaboration, “testing” and critiquing theory is superfluous; instead generate better theory to replace previous theory. Treat marketing as an aspect of all company activities; in a network every node and link can affect every other. Practical implications – For marketers to better overview complexity and context of their specific marketing situations, to systematically observe relational phenomena and the customer’s role, and as a consequence better foresee opportunities and avoid mistakes in their marketing planning. Originality/value – In the light of new research and conceptualization, the article offers a network view which is only marginally represented in research and education in marketing. With bigger and more global systems and growing dependency on software and the Internet, the need to address integrated systems becomes urgent. The dependency between B 2 B and B 2 C has been noted before but we go further and treat these as perspectives of a grander marketing context and not as independent categories. The analysis of B and C combinations displays the broadened role of customers in value networks. Goods and services are intertwined and can only be overviewed by means of systems and network theory. In the new logic of service and value creation, marketing categories are being dissolved and the reductionism and linearity of Western science are being challenged in favor of a broader network approach. Key words - Network theory, many-to-many marketing, service-dominant logic, service science, case study research...|$|E
40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2013 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Teknoloji ve {{internet}}in artık tüm dünyada yaygınlaşmasıyla beraber var olan şirketlerin iş modellerini elektronik ortama da uyarlaması veya yeni girişimciler ile birlikte yepyeni iş modellerinin internette sahne alması başlamıştır. Bu modellerden biri internet üzerinden alışveriştir ve Türkiye de de internet üzerinden alışveriş tüm dünyaya paralel olarak her geçen gün gelişmektedir. Yeni iş konseptleri e-ticaret sektörüne farklı bakış açıları getirmektedir. Geliştirdikleri e-ticaret modelleri veya varolan işlerini e-ticarete uyarlayan şirketler, müşterilerine çok daha kısa sürede ulaşıp, olumlu veya olumsuz geri dönüşleri hızlı bir şekilde alabilmektedirler. Bu sayede hem rekabet avantajlarını sürdürebilirler hem de yüksek kar marjları elde edebilirler. Bu alışveriş modelinin özelleşmesiyle yepyeni bir iş modeli doğmuş ve bu oluşum özel alışveriş kulüpleri (ÖAK) adını almıştır. Her iş modelinde olduğu gibi ÖAK ların da kendi iç dinamikleri ve özellikleri bulunmaktadır. ÖAK lar, internet üzerinden ürünlerin(ürünler belli sektörlere veya markalara göre sınıflandırılabilir) yüksek indirimlerle satışa sunulduğu sitelerdir. Bu indirimlerde süre sınırlandırılması söz konusu olup, indirimden bir süre önce üyelere e-posta ile bildirilir. Genellikle davetiye sistemiyle yani kapalı devre alışveriş sistemiyle çalışmaktadır. ÖAK lara üye olunmadan ürünler görüntülenemeyeceği gibi indirimlerden de haberdar olunamamaktadır. Literatürde daha önce yapılan çalışmalarda kullanıcıların internet üzerinden alışveriş davranışlarını inceleyen araştırmalarda bir çok model önerisi sunulmuştur ve kullanıcıların bu davranışları belirlenmeye çalışılmıştır. Bu çalışmada ÖAK iş modeli, Teknoloji Kabul Modeli (TKM) temel alınarak geliştirilmiş araştırma modeli ile incelenmektedir. Modelde, faydacı ve zevke ait alışveriş yönelimi, kişisel yenilikçilik, sosyal etki, e-ticaret servis kalitesi vb. faktörler TKM ye eklenmiştir. Çalışmanın amacı bu sitelerden alışveriş yapan kullanıcıların davranışlarını açıklamak ve bu davranışları etkileyen faktörleri tanımlamaktır. Model tasarım aşamasında, uygulama yapılacak hedef kitle Türkiye den olduğu için, modelin yapısı bu kitlenin kültürel özellikleri göz önüne alınarak oluşturulmuştur. Veriler Çoklu Regresyon yöntemi ile analiz edilerek her bir yapı için önerilen model doğrulanmıştır. Çalışmanın sonuçları, bu iş modelini uygulayacak yeni şirketlere ve halen faaliyette olan ÖAK lara rehber niteliğindedir. Bu sonuçlar sayesinde ÖAK kullanıcılarının bir ÖAK web sitesinden neler beklediği, ne gibi şeylere önem verip, inceledikten sonra satın alma davranışlarını gerçekleştirdiği ortaya çıkarılabilir. Bunun yanında satın alma davranışı sonucunda memnuniyet etkileri belirlenebilmektedir. Together with World Wide Web {{enter into}} our lifes, traditional business models affected and new business {{models have been}} emerged. Especially after transtion from Web 1. 0 to Web 2. 0, end users participation are increasing to internet world everyday. That participation brings a lot of innovations, opportunities etc. for companies and end users. Companies are expanding their market shares and also protecting their competitive advantages owing to e-commerce phenomenon s growth. E-Commerce emerges as an evolving structure day by day. E-commerce has many definition by different sources for instance World Trade Organization (WTO) defines e-commerce as; the production, distribution, marketing, sale or delivery {{of goods and services}} by electronic networks. It has many different business models which are varied business models according to the application areas and business structures. Generally, e-commerce business models can be grouped under for main models; B 2 B (business-to-business), B 2 C (business-to-consumer), C 2 B (<b>consumer-to-business)</b> and C 2 C (consumer-to-consumer). Each e-commerce business models have their own internal-external dynamics and success factors. Companies are paying attention to these factors and also companies try to achieve success by minimizing barriers. Furthermore e-commerce companies try to strengthen their technological infrastructure for providing timely and up to date information and supplying their products and services to customers in quickest way. E-Commerce structure brings a lot of advantages to companies. These advantages; the strengthening of customer relationship management, increasing profit margins through eliminating intermediaries, responding and answering customer s request more effectively and fast owing to direct communication with customers and feedbacks from customers. Besides the advantages, e-commerce systems contain a lot of obstacles. Particularly it is hard to sustain existence in market for start up companies. Approximately ten percentage of venture companies could sustain existence in their marketplace. As mentioned in these indicators, companies should analyze these advantages and disadvantages and make right decisions {{if they want to be}} successful in these business area. E-commerce web sites and companies, especially the US companies, extend their transaction volumes every year. European countries are keeping pace with that structure, they are raising the amount of e-commere transacion volumes. Turkey which is the country of study conducted is a little behind the other major players of Europe. However looking at the growing rate and potential of Turkey, it can be said that Turkey will come into one of Europe s major players. Literature has many models which is created for examining acceptance of electronic systems or technologies such as internet. Each of them has been developed for different purposes and application areas. Models of studies for examining technology acceptance in literature; diffusion of innovation theory, theory of reasoned action, theory of planned behavior, unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, technology acceptance model. Among the many models that are improved to explain the acceptance of new technologies and information systems, TAM outshines as a strong model. The model is developed by Davis in 1989 and has become the most preferred model for researchers in this field. Technology acceptance model is differentiated from others because it has a very good theoretical infrastructure therefore it has been used most in technology acceptance studies. As mentioned, TAM s power comes from its infrastructure; cost-benefit analysis, adaptation of innovations, self-efficacy theory and expectancy theory. Within the technology and Internet s becoming widespread all around the world, existing companies began to integrate their existing business models to electronic environment or with new entrepreneurs, novel business models have started to appear. One of these business model is shopping online which is growing in Turkey as well as in the world. New business models bring new perspectives on e-commerce sector. In the previous years, Private Shopping Clubs (PSC) has emerged as a new business model of online shopping which is one of the most popular business models. In this study, by considering the online shopping, i. e., e-commerce sector, the private shopping clubs that have an important place for this sector are aimed. PSCs have their own internal dynamics and characteristics as every business model. Private Shopping Club is a members only shopping club, where members can buy goods great opportunities. After sign up these kind of web sites, users can see the goods, services and prices. PSCs are websites where products (products are classified according to certain sectors or brands) are sold online with huge discounts. These discounts have time limitations and members are notified before the discounts start especially they organize sales events for its members that typically last 2 to 6 days. This business model works usually with an invitation system that is called closed-loop shopping system. People who do not have membership to the PSC cannot see the products and they are not informed about the discounts. Previous studies that examined buying behavior of users on internet, proposed different models for determining shopping behavior of users. In this study, PSC model is examined with proposed model based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The proposed model is a wide model with 15 different structures. Between relationship of structures of proposed model are analyzed by Multiple Regression Analysis and then trying to validate the proposed hypotheses. In a multiple regression analysis, the relations between the dependent variables that is affected by the multiple independent variables are taken together. In the model, factors such as; Subjective Norm, Trust, Risk, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Behavioral Intention, Utilitarian and Hedonic Online Shopping, Product Information Quality, Website quality, Perceived Enjoyment, Individual Innovativeness, E-commerce Service Quality, Content Richness, Satisfaction are included to the model. Online survey system has been used to collect data from survey participants for evaluating these fifteen structure. Since the basis of the study relies on online shopping, the users should have an internet access and they should have used at least one of the private shopping clubs before. The survey questions are prepared as a 1 - 5 number Likert scale to quantify the components of the model. Before start to analyze Multiple Regression Analysis, it has been done reliability and factor analysis on survey questions and structures in order to validate properly categorized, reliable statistically and object elemination. After these analysis, Trust structure has been removed because of analysis results and Subjective Norm structure divided two part, the other part is Image structure. Finally proposed model has been revised and Multiple Regression Analysis applied on that proposed model. This study aims to explain the behaviors of PSC users. Also it is examining PSC as a dimension of “Online Shopping” – which is an developing concept, these factors were aimed to be measured; user intentions, factors affecting the intentions of shopping, user satisfaction at the end of shopping activities. Results of the study can be used as a guide to existing PSC and to new companies with the intention to use this new business model. Researchers can analyze what PSC s users are expecting from PSC s web sites or what kind of things they attach importance during their transactions. In addition to this researchers can also analyze the satisfaction level of actual purchases of the PSC users. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
