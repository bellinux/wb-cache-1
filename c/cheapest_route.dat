50|$|To move men and {{supplies}} to the gold fields, service by river steamers was inaugurated in 1858.

50|$|The {{planning}} of road legs is sometimes {{done by a}} separate subsystem within a journey planner, but may consider both single mode trip calculations as well as intermodal scenarios (e.g. Park and Ride, kiss and ride, etc.). Typical optimisations for car routing are shortest route, fastest route, <b>cheapest</b> <b>route</b> and with constraints for specific waypoints. Some advanced journey planners can take into account average journey times on road sections, or even real-time predicted average journey times on road sections.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, the Portuguese colonial {{authorities}} in Mozambique started {{the construction of}} the huge Cahora Bassa Dam on the Zambezi River. It became apparent that the shortest and <b>cheapest</b> <b>route</b> of the powerlines from the dam to the distribution stations near Pretoria would lead through sensitive ecological regions in the northern Kruger Park. In 1969 Eskom agreed to run the powerlines {{to the north of the}} sensitive Nyandu thickets and during the same year work started on the unsightly lines. The section through the Kruger Park was completed by early 1971.|$|E
40|$|We propose FResher Encounter SearcH (FRESH), {{a simple}} {{algorithm}} for e#cient route discovery in mobile ad hoc networks. Nodes keep {{a record of}} their most recent encounter times with all other nodes. Instead of searching for the destination, the source node searches for any intermediate node that encountered the destination more recently than did the source node itself. The intermediate node then searches for a node that encountered the destination yet more recently, and the procedure iterates until the destination is reached. Therefore, FRESH replaces the single network-wide search of current proposals with a succession of smaller searches, resulting in a <b>cheaper</b> <b>route</b> discovery.

50|$|An area {{of major}} geopolitical {{competition}} involves the routing of oil {{out of this}} oil field. Oil from the Tengiz field is primarily routed to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) project. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline is an alternative pipeline developed by U.S. and UK interests originating in the Southern Caspian which is the principal export route for crude from Azerbaijan and bypasses dependence on the Russian pipeline. In addition, Total S.A. is interested in developing a pipeline south through Iran, which is theoretically the <b>cheapest</b> <b>route</b> due to the geopolitical climate involving Iran, however, the United States does not favor this route.|$|E
5000|$|At its core, a pathfinding method {{searches}} a graph {{by starting}} at one vertex and exploring adjacent nodes until the destination node is reached, generally {{with the intent}} of finding the <b>cheapest</b> <b>route.</b> Although graph searching methods such as a breadth-first search would find a route if given enough time, other methods, which [...] "explore" [...] the graph, would tend to reach the destination sooner. An analogy would be a person walking across a room; rather than examining every possible route in advance, the person would generally walk {{in the direction of the}} destination and only deviate from the path to avoid an obstruction, and make deviations as minor as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Writing in STEP Magazine, Dr. Ariel Sergio Goekmen of Kaiser Partner Privatbank AG {{compared}} {{the benefits of}} the LDF with the UK-Swiss tax agreement.

He notes that the success of the LDF {{is due to the fact}} that it is structured, safe, can be implemented very quickly and can be used to regain control over globally diversified assets.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} characterizing user equilibria and optimal solutions for routing in a given network. We extend the known models by considering users oblivious to congestion in the following sense: While in the typical user equilibrium setting the users follow a strategy that minimizes their individual cost by {{taking into account the}} (dynamic) congestion due to the current routing pattern, an oblivious user ignores congestion altogether; instead, he or she decides his routing on the basis of <b>cheapest</b> <b>routes</b> on a network without any flow whatsoever.

This model tries to capture the fact that a certain percentage of travelers base their route simply on the distances they observe on a map, without thinking (or knowing, or caring) about the delays experienced on this route due to their fellow travelers. In this work we study the effect of such users using as the measure of network performance its price of anarchy, i. e., the ratio of the total latency experienced by the users (oblivious or not) at equilibrium over the social optimum.

40|$|With the {{deregulation}} of power industry, large power users can buy electricity directly from power producers. For trades between different regional markets, {{it is necessary}} to research on the method to find the <b>cheapest</b> <b>route</b> for power exchanging. Moreover, as there exists no coordinator above regional markets, the power routing problem must be solved in a distributed way. Most previous research are based on power electronic transformers. Some research proposed EMS of sub-networks as energy routers, but failed to consider the power flow constraints or did not converge in some specific cases. Our method is based on the EMS of multiple markets, which saves cost by eliminating expensive electronic transformers and has high efficiency in systems with numerous nodes by considering the regional markets as generalized nodes. We take transmission costs and congestion costs into consideration, and uses Bellman-Ford algorithm to determine the <b>cheapest</b> <b>route</b> for power transmission between different regional markets and make convergence analysis about our algorithm. This method proves effective and convergent when there is no loop among the markets. A four-market loop-free case was used to illustrate the efficiency of the method.

Though seemingly modest, this exercise has inspired studies by mathematicians, chemists, and physicists. Teachers use it in the classroom.

40|$|The {{shortest}} path {{is a part}} of the subject in the graph theory in the field of operational research. The idea of the {{shortest path}} is to find the best possible routes that linking between a given source and a destination. There are many algorithms have been designed to find these paths. The algorithms such as Djikstra, Bellman-Ford or Floyd- Warshall are difference from one to another due to the simplicity, effectiveness and duration of processing the nodes. This research will be focused on determining the best shortest path algorithm for the first possible best (fastest, safest and <b>cheapest)</b> <b>route</b> and also to search the other possible best routes. Assessment will be done by calculating the algorithm complexion and runtime using the computer. The fastest route can be attained via traveling on the highway. The safest route is might considered as a route with an accident free (data from police department). The <b>cheapest</b> <b>route</b> is a toll-free route, i. e., federal or state routes. The numbering assigned to every route in Peninsular Malaysia will be used to calculate and distinguish these routes and the alternatives. A development of GIS database is also involved in prototype covering the road network in Peninsular Malaysia (the e-map) will be developed to show the viability or validity of the findings. The system will be developed by using Microsoft Visual Basic and some supporting software. It is hoped the system will serve at test platform for the deeper research in the future...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} characterizing user equilibria and optimal solutions for selfish routing in a given network. We extend the known models by considering users oblivious to congestion.

These <b>cheapest</b> <b>routes</b> can be, for example, the shortest paths in the network without any flow. This model tries to capture the fact that routing tables for at least a fraction of the flow in large scale networks such as the Internet may be based on the physical distances or hops between routers alone. The phenomenon is similar to the case of traffic networks where a certain percentage of travelers base their route simply on the distances they observe on a map, without thinking (or knowing, or caring) about the delays experienced on this route due to their fellow travelers. In this work we study the price of anarchy of such networks, i. e., the ratio of the total latency experienced by the users in this setting over the optimal total latency if all users were centrally coordinated...|$|R
