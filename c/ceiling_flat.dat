5000|$|The main ranch house, is {{regarded}} as a rare example of the earlier [...] "Sonoran traditional ranch style," [...] characterized by thick adobe walls, whether exposed or stuccoed, beamed <b>ceiling,</b> <b>flat</b> roof and floor of packed earth, often laid out in an L-form. An outbuilding is built of railroad ties covered with corrugated roofing.|$|E
50|$|The {{architect}} {{of the house is}} thought to have been James Elmes (1782-1862), who is known to have submitted a design for Oakwood, the house opposite Sennicotts, and who lived at Oving, West Sussex nearby. Elmes was a friend of Sir John Soane, and artchitectural features such as the entrance hall, which is cube shaped and has a ceiling of shallow ‘groined’ vaulting, is very similar to Soane’s drawing room at Aynhoe Park. The ends of the hall are in the form of shallow apses, with marbled niches, and below the bold cornice runs an egg-and-dart moulding. Both the drawing and dining rooms at Sennicotts have coved ceilings with a bead moulding on the <b>ceiling</b> <b>flat,</b> and an unusual leaf enriched torus moulding at the cornice.|$|E

On {{the sound}} stage, {{construction}} grips {{are responsible for}} laying out, building, moving, and adjusting major set pieces (e.g. walls, <b>ceiling</b> <b>flats)</b> when {{something needs to be}} moved to get a camera or lights into position. Construction grips also build decks and platforms. This job is exclusively practiced in the New York area.|$|R
50|$|All of the nave's aisles are {{the same}} height {{as the rest of}} the church. The walls are {{plastered}} and the <b>ceilings</b> <b>flat.</b> The nave arcades have elliptical arches ("as shallow as Soane liked them") on thin Tuscan columns. The north and south galleries were removed during renovations to the church in 1951, but the west gallery, supported by cast iron columns, remains. In the gallery is the organ, previously in the chancel, now housed in a mahogany case including panels from the 1884 corvette HMS Calliope. In the south aisle is an eighteenth-century font.|$|R
50|$|The {{second and}} third levels could be reached via a set of stairs built into the walls to add support to the {{building}} and had similar niches for scrolls. The <b>ceiling</b> was <b>flat,</b> and {{there may have been}} a central square oculus to provide more light.|$|R
50|$|The street awning to {{the lower}} floor is early, and has a pressed metal <b>ceiling.</b> <b>Flat</b> brick arches above fanlights and earlier {{openings}} are visible {{at the top of}} the awning. The ground floor shops open onto Brisbane street and are accessed from the rear through a courtyard containing a loading dock. A separate, single-storey building is set at an angle to the main two-storey building and houses a shop which addresses Ellenborough street. This shop contains a safe set low in one wall and a vault with a heavy metal door at the rear. The shops have been refurbished but some original fabric remains including fanlights to the shop doorways, marble thresholds and a pressed metal ceiling to the corner shop. The individual tenancies are separated by timber vj walls. The stair to the upper floor is intact with marble threshold, double timber doors and timber stair and handrail.|$|E
50|$|The 1915 open-air annexe and its {{extension}} are to {{the north}} of the 1876 school building. It has been modified and extended. It is a highset timber building, approximately 21.5m by 11m, with concrete stumps, partially enclosed under. The roof is corrugated iron and has two ventilators on the southern portion. To the north and west it is hipped to accommodate now enclosed verandahs. The external walls are clad with chamferboards except on the walkway from the other buildings, which is weatherboard, and the enclosed northern verandah section, which is clad with aluminium siding. Above the aluminium are aluminium framed sliding windows. Access to the building is via the walkway from the 1876 school building, perpendicular stairs from the west, and stairs on the northern side. Internally the building is divided into nine sections. On the western section there is an enclosed verandah which has been converted into a computer room. This room is lined with fibrous cement sheeting and has a timber, tongue and groove ceiling. There is access to the walkway from the 1876 school building and from the teachers' room. Double timber doors lead onto the front steps and there is a double hopper window adjoining. An arch leads into a small room, which, with its neighbour, has been divided from the original open-air annexe classroom. Each has a false ceiling. The southern one has a pair of double casement windows, each topped by a hopper. A door leads into the original annexe schoolroom. This is a large (7200 by 7700) room with tongue and groove timber walls and a pressed metal <b>ceiling,</b> <b>flat</b> in the middle and sloped towards the sides and ends. The western end of the ceiling is obscured by the false ceilings in the adjoining subdivided rooms. There are metal stringers between the walls. Three sets of the windows consisting of a double casement topped by a hopper are on the southern wall. A large archway leads onto the enclosed northern verandah.|$|E

6000|$|... § III. I have little, therefore, to say here, {{and that}} {{touching}} rather the omission than {{the selection of}} decoration, as far as regards interior roofing. Whether of timber or stone, roofs are necessarily divided into surfaces, and ribs or beams;--surfaces, flat or carved; ribs, traversing these in the directions where main strength is required; or beams, filling the hollow of the dark gable with the intricate roof-tree, or supporting the <b>flat</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Wherever the ribs and beams are simply and unaffectedly arranged, there is no difficulty about decoration; the beams may be carved, the ribs moulded, and the eye is satisfied at once; but when the vaulting is unribbed, as in plain waggon vaults and much excellent early Gothic, or when the <b>ceiling</b> is <b>flat,</b> it becomes a difficult question how far their services may receive ornamentation independent of their structure. I have never myself seen a <b>flat</b> <b>ceiling</b> satisfactorily decorated, except by painting: there is much good and fanciful panelling in old English domestic architecture, but it always is in some degree meaningless and mean. The <b>flat</b> <b>ceilings</b> of Venice, as in the Scuola di San Rocco and Ducal Palace, have in their vast panellings some of the noblest paintings (on stretched canvas) which the world possesses: {{and this is all}} very well for the ceiling; but one would rather have the painting in a better place, especially when the rain soaks through its canvas, as I have seen it doing through many a noble Tintoret. On the whole, <b>flat</b> <b>ceilings</b> are as much to be avoided as possible; and, when necessary, perhaps a panelled ornamentation with rich colored patterns is the most satisfying, and loses least of valuable labor. But I leave the question to the reader's thought, being myself exceedingly undecided respecting it: except only touching one point--that a blank ceiling is not to be redeemed by a decorated ventilator.|$|R

The lectern and baptismal font are also original.|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} is cross-shaped {{with a central}} tower, typical of Romanesque architecture. There were, however, some later modifications in the Gothic style such as the vaults, replacing the original <b>flat</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and the pointed arches in the tower.|$|R
25|$|On the <b>flat</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{he painted}} an allegory of the Apotheosis of S. Ignatius, in breathtaking perspective. The painting, 17 m in diameter, is devised {{to make an}} observer, looking from a spot marked by a brass disc set into {{the floor of the}} nave, seem to see a lofty vaulted roof {{decorated}} by statues, while in fact the <b>ceiling</b> is <b>flat.</b> The painting celebrates the apostolic goals of Jesuit missionaries, eager to expand the reach of Roman Catholicism in other continents. The Counter-Reformation also encouraged a combative Catholicism. For example, rather than placing the usual evangelists or scholarly pillars of doctrine in the pendentives, Pozzo depicted the victorious warriors of the old testament: Judith and Holofernes; David and Goliath; Jael and Sisera; and Samson and the Philistines. It is said that when completed, some said (sic)Sant'Ignazio was a good place to buy meat, since four new butchers are now there.|$|R
