5|$|In 2006 a triplet <b>carbene</b> was {{reported}} with a half-life of 40 minutes. This <b>carbene</b> is prepared by a photochemical decomposition of a diazomethane with expulsion of nitrogen gas at a wavelength of 300 nanometers in benzene.|$|E
5|$|In particular, {{the formal}} {{substitution}} of sulfur {{for one of}} the nitrogens in imidazole would yield the aromatic heterocyclic compound thiazole. A thiazole based <b>carbene</b> (analogous to the <b>carbene</b> postulated by Breslow) has been prepared and characterised by X-ray crystallography. Other non-aromatic aminocarbenes with O, S and P atoms adjacent (i.e. alpha) to the <b>carbene</b> centre have been prepared, e.g. thio- and oxy-iminium based carbenes have been characterised by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|A {{more radical}} {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which is stable at room temperature, the <b>carbene</b> atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the <b>carbene</b> is not necessary for stability, either.|$|E
50|$|In organic chemistry, <b>carbenes</b> are {{molecules}} {{which have}} carbon atoms with only have six valence electrons and therefore disobey the octet rule. <b>Carbenes</b> generally split into singlet <b>carbenes</b> and triplet <b>carbenes,</b> named for their spin multiplicities. Both have two non-bonding electrons; in singlet <b>carbenes</b> these {{exist as a}} lone pair and have opposite spins {{so that there is}} no net spin, while in triplet <b>carbenes</b> these electrons have parallel spins.|$|R
40|$|<b>Carbenes</b> attack! Stable <b>carbenes</b> {{react with}} [Fe(cot) 2] in very {{different}} ways. Whereas the classical N-heterocyclic <b>carbenes</b> induce the formation of tetra- and trimetallic iron clusters, abnormal NHCs and carbocyclic <b>carbenes</b> (BACs) form mono- and bimetallic iron complexes. Cyclic (alkyl) (amino) <b>carbenes</b> (CAACs) react with [Fe(cot) 2] {{in a completely different}} manner, namely through outersphere [4 + 1] cycloaddition...|$|R
50|$|The {{two classes}} of <b>carbenes</b> are singlet and triplet <b>carbenes.</b> Singlet <b>carbenes</b> are spin-paired. In the {{language}} of valence bond theory, the molecule adopts an sp2 hybrid structure. Triplet <b>carbenes</b> have two unpaired electrons. Most <b>carbenes</b> have a nonlinear triplet ground state, except for those with nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms, and halides directly bonded to the divalent carbon.|$|R
5|$|Exposure to oxygen (diradical) {{converts}} this <b>carbene</b> to {{the corresponding}} benzophenone and the diphenylmethane compound is formed {{when it is}} trapped by 1,4-cyclohexadiene. As with the other carbenes this species contains large bulky substituents, namely bromine and the trifluoromethyl groups, that shield the <b>carbene</b> and prevent or slow down the process of dimerisation to a 1,1,2,2-tetra(phenyl)alkene.|$|E
5|$|The first air-stable ylidic <b>carbene,</b> a {{chlorinated}} {{member of}} the imidazol-2-ylidene family, was obtained in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{reported}} stable isothiazole <b>carbene</b> (2) {{derived from}} an isothiazolium perchlorate (1) was questioned, who were {{only able to}} isolate 2-imino-2H-thiete (4). The intermediate 3 was proposed through a rearrangement reaction. This <b>carbene</b> is no longer considered stable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Carbenes</b> {{are called}} singlet or triplet {{depending}} on the electronic spins they possess. Triplet <b>carbenes</b> are paramagnetic and may be observed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy if they persist long enough. The total spin of singlet <b>carbenes</b> is zero while that of triplet <b>carbenes</b> is one (in units of [...] ). Bond angles are 125-140° for triplet methylene and 102° for singlet methylene (as determined by EPR). Triplet <b>carbenes</b> are generally stable in the gaseous state, while singlet <b>carbenes</b> occur more often in aqueous media.|$|R
5|$|Schrock carbenes; {{in which}} <b>carbenes</b> are {{tethered}} to a metal and an electron-donating group. The reactions that such <b>carbenes</b> participate in {{are very different}} from those in which organic <b>carbenes</b> participate.|$|R

5|$|Unlike the {{dimerisation}} of {{triplet state}} carbenes, these singlet state carbenes do not approach {{head to head}} ("least motion"), but rather the <b>carbene</b> lone pair attacks the empty carbon p-orbital ("non-least motion"). <b>Carbene</b> dimerisation can be catalyzed by both acids and metals.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Ronald Breslow {{proposed}} that a relatively stable nucleophilic <b>carbene,</b> a thiazol-2-ylidene derivative, {{was involved in}} the catalytic cycle of vitamin B1 (thiamine) that yields furoin from furfural.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Hideo Tomioka and his {{associates}} were able to produce a comparatively stable triplet <b>carbene</b> (bis(9-anthryl)carbene, with a half-life of 19 minutes), {{by taking advantage of}} resonance.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>carbenes</b> {{in general}} are {{extremely}} short-lived, some derivatives of this compound are surprisingly stable, and form an important class of the persistent <b>carbenes.</b> They include the first stable <b>carbenes</b> postulated (but not isolated) by Hans-Werner Wanzlick around 1960.|$|R
5|$|Persistent {{triplet state}} <b>carbenes</b> {{are likely to}} have very similar {{reactivity}} as other non-persistent triplet state <b>carbenes.</b>|$|R
5|$|One stable N-heterocyclic <b>carbene</b> has a {{structure}} analogous to borazine with one boron atom {{replaced by a}} methylene group. This results in a planar 6-electron compound.|$|E
5|$|The first acyclic {{persistent}} <b>carbene</b> {{was reported}} in 1996, thus showing that a cyclic backbone was not necessary for their stability. Unlike the cyclic derivatives, the acyclic carbenes are flexible with respect to rotation of the bonds to the carbenic atom. By measuring the barrier to rotation of these bonds, {{the extent of their}} double bond character could be measured, and the ylidic nature of this <b>carbene</b> could be determined. Like the cyclic diaminocarbenes, unhindered variants tend to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|Triazole-based carbenes are {{thermodynamically}} {{stable and}} have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 210–220 ppm for the carbenic carbon. The X-ray {{structure of the}} triphenyl substituted <b>carbene</b> above shows an N-C-N bond angle of ca. 101°. The 5-methoxytriazole precursor to this <b>carbene</b> {{was made by the}} treatment of a triazolium salt with sodium methoxide, which attacks as a nucleophile. This may indicate that these carbenes are less aromatic than imidazol-2-ylidenes, as the imidazolium precursors do not react with nucleophiles due to the resultant loss of aromaticity.|$|E

5|$|Diaminocarbenes do {{not truly}} dimerise, but rather form the dimer by {{reaction}} via formamidinium salts, a protonated precursor species. Accordingly, this reaction can be acid catalysed. This reaction occurs because unlike imidazolium based carbenes, {{there is no}} loss of aromaticity in protonation of the <b>carbene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diaminocarbenes have {{diagnostic}} 13C NMR {{chemical shift}} values between 230–270 ppm for the carbenic atom. The X-ray structure of dihydroimidazole-2-ylidene shows a N-C-N bond angle of ca. 106°, whilst {{the angle of}} the acyclic <b>carbene</b> is 121°, both greater than those seen for imidazol-2-ylidenes.|$|E
5|$|If this dimer existed as a dicarbene, the {{electron}} lone pairs on the carbenic carbon {{would be forced}} into close proximity. Presumably the resulting repulsive electrostatic interactions {{would have a significant}} destabilising effect. To avoid this electronic interaction, the <b>carbene</b> units dimerise.|$|E
5|$|Persistent <b>carbenes</b> {{can exist}} in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state <b>carbenes</b> being more stable. The {{relative}} stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by bulky groups. Some singlet <b>carbenes</b> are thermodynamically stable {{in the absence of}} moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can be isolated and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state <b>carbenes</b> have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore can be observed but not stored.|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleophilic}} {{reaction of}} ambidentb-lactam <b>carbenes</b> with alkylphenylketenes is studied, which produces {{two types of}} spiro[b-lactam- 2, 10 -indene] derivatives in total yields of 55 – 89 %. This work not only provides the first example that ambident <b>carbenes</b> behave with high activity towards ketenes, but also developes the application of b-lactam <b>carbenes</b> {{in the construction of}} spiro-b-lactam compounds...|$|R
5000|$|N-Heterocyclic <b>carbenes</b> (NHC's) {{are derived}} by C-deprotonation imidazolium or dihydroimidazolium salts. They often are {{deployed}} as ancillary ligands in organometallic chemistry. Such <b>carbenes</b> are spectator ligands {{that are usually}} very strong sigma donors, often drawing comparisons to phosphines. [...] The ligands themselves, especially when they are isolated free of the metal, are sometimes known as Arduengo or Wanzlick <b>carbenes.</b>|$|R
5|$|In particular, {{substitution}} of two chlorine atoms {{for the two}} hydrogens at ring positions 4 and 5 yielded the first air-stable <b>carbene.</b> Its extra stability probably results from the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine substituents, which reduce the electron density on the carbon atom bearing the lone pair, via induction through the sigma-backbone.|$|E
5|$|Mesoionic carbenes (MICs) {{are similar}} to N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) except that {{canonical}} resonance structures with the <b>carbene</b> depicted cannot be drawn without adding additional charges. Mesoionic carbenes are {{also referred to as}} abnormal N-heterocyclic carbenes (aNHC) or remote N-heterocyclic carbenes (rNHC). A variety of free carbenes can be isolated and are stable at room temperature. Other free carbenes are not stable and are susceptible to intermolecular decomposition pathways.|$|E
5|$|Organometallic {{compounds}} {{by definition}} contain {{at least one}} carbon-metal bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, tetraethyllead), η-alkene compounds (for example, Zeise's salt), and η-allyl compounds (for example, allylpalladium chloride dimer); metallocenes containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, ferrocene); and transition metal <b>carbene</b> complexes. Many metal carbonyls exist (for example, tetracarbonylnickel); some workers consider the carbon monoxide ligand to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.|$|E
