50|$|Active & Waiting Calls: {{measures}} current {{volume of}} active calls {{compared to the}} number of <b>callers</b> <b>waiting</b> to be patched through to an agent. This is a real-time status metric that should be shared with all the agents to offer them insight on their performance. Agents should be encouraged to resolve calls on a timely basis {{in order to get to}} the next caller in queue and not keep the <b>callers</b> on <b>wait.</b>|$|R
50|$|Music On Hold, {{also known}} as {{messages}} on hold, marketing on hold and MOH, is the audio content organizations provide on phone systems for <b>callers</b> <b>waiting</b> in the hold queue. Streaming MOH refers to a live music on hold stream (URL-based delivery) which can also include custom content.|$|R
50|$|On-hold {{messaging}} is {{a service}} used by businesses and organizations {{of all sizes}} to deliver information to their <b>callers</b> <b>waiting</b> on hold or while they are being transferred. Also called audio marketing, on-hold messaging is a specialist area of marketing and branding. It seeks to represent the personality of a business in the medium of audio.|$|R
50|$|An orange box is a {{piece of}} {{hardware}} or software that generates caller ID frequency-shift keying (FSK) signals to spoof caller ID information on the target's caller ID terminal. It takes advantage of call <b>waiting</b> <b>caller</b> ID (also called off-hook caller ID) by mimicking the phone company's central office equipment and sending the call <b>waiting</b> <b>tone</b> followed by the audible caller ID data. An orange box {{can also be used to}} spoof Caller ID information sent after an incoming call rings, if the user has direct access to the target's phone line. One proposal to accomplish this involves an orange box used in conjunction with a magenta box, which in combination is called a vermilion box.|$|R
5000|$|People using {{telecommunications}} {{devices for}} the deaf (TDDs) and calling public agencies might expect the agency being called to answer with a TTY. The <b>caller</b> <b>waits</b> for [...] "TTY tones" [...] to be generated over the phone line. The answerer should place the phone receiver into the TTY coupler and type anything ("Hello, Go Ahead") so the caller knows it is connected. For public agencies that have a TTY, it is inappropriate to hang up on a silent call.|$|R
5000|$|Eskin {{also has}} more of an {{affinity}} towards sports gambling than other co-hosts. On Friday afternoons during football season, he often has a [...] "handicapping expert" [...] on as a guest. In addition, he is the self-proclaimed [...] "King of Monday Night" [...] due to his successful track record in picking Monday Night Football games correctly. When his time slot was Monday evenings, he would often tease and mock his <b>callers</b> <b>waiting</b> for him to announce his Monday Night pick, calling them [...] "degenerates".|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to sending and receiving SMS service, voicemail, voice based messaging service SMS Koza, end call notification on call completion, IVR, and USSD recharge {{are included in}} the prepaid base Warid connection.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 47) This project {{provides an}} understanding of delay (queuing) theory and its practical applications to telephone systems. Various options available to the delayed customer are explored. Some of these options are: Wait for service, leave and return again, or simply leave. These options lead to different mathematical solutions, which predict the accessibility of the service system. Specifically for telephone systems, three well-established formulas are presented which predict trunk usage and exchange blockage. Results from one of these formulas estimate {{the mean number of}} <b>callers</b> <b>waiting</b> for service as well as their average delay time. This information can be used by engineers to design telephone systems with an acceptable level of service. However, economics usually requires that some callers be delayed during the busy hours...|$|R
50|$|In May 2011, Adfortel {{started the}} first ad-sponsored call service in Austria with Orange, with users hearing a {{targeted}} advertisement {{instead of the}} regular <b>waiting</b> ring <b>tone.</b>|$|R
50|$|IVRs {{will also}} log call detail {{information}} {{into its own}} database for auditing, performance report, and future IVR system enhancements. CTI allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller {{as a means of}} directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a screen-pop, making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine enquiries to switchboard or PABX (Private Automatic Branch eXchange) operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the <b>caller</b> <b>waiting</b> time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated voice mail experience to the caller.|$|R

6000|$|Sometimes a {{professor}} of Oriental Languages at Trinity College, a Persian, came to our Society and talked of the magicians of the East. When {{he was a little}} boy, he had seen a vision in a pool of ink, a multitude of spirits singing in Arabic, [...] "woe unto those that do not believe in us." [...] And we persuaded a Brahmin philosopher to come from London and stay for a few days with the only one among us who had rooms of his own. It was my first meeting with a philosophy that confirmed my vague speculations and seemed at once logical and boundless. Consciousness, he taught, does not merely spread out its surface but has, in vision and in contemplation, another motion and can change in height and in depth. A handsome young man with the typical face of Christ, he chaffed me good-humouredly because he said I came at breakfast and began some question that was interrupted by the first <b>caller,</b> <b>waited</b> in silence till ten or eleven at night when the last caller had gone, and finished my question.|$|R

50|$|Telcordia {{has been}} a major {{architect}} of the United States telecommunications system and has pioneered many services, including <b>caller</b> ID, call <b>waiting,</b> mobile number portability and toll-free telephone number (800). Its expertise is in managing large, complex projects across the operations and communications spectrum.|$|R
40|$|The taxi {{dispatch}} problem involves assigning taxis to <b>callers</b> <b>waiting</b> {{at different}} locations. A dispatch system currently in use {{by a major}} taxi company divides the city (in which the system operates) into regional dispatch areas. Each area has fixed designated adjacent areas hand-coded by human experts. When a local area does not have vacant cabs, the system chooses an adjacent area to search. However, such fixed, hand-coded adjacency of areas {{is not always a}} good indicator because it does not take into consideration frequent changes in traffic patterns and road structure. This causes dispatch officials to override the system by manually enforcing movement on taxis. In this dissertation, I apply a multiagent self-organization technique to this problem, dynamically modifying the adjacency of dispatch areas. We compare performance with actual data from, and a simulation of, an operational dispatch system. The proposed technique decreases the total waiting time by up to 25 % in comparison with the real system and increases taxi utilization by 20 % in comparison with results of the simulation without self-organization. Interestingly, we also discover that human intervention (by either the taxi-dispatch officials or the taxi drivers) to manually overcome the limitations of the existing dispatch system can be counterproductive when used with a self-organizing system...|$|R
50|$|If {{the total}} {{allowable}} ringer load is exceeded, the phone circuit {{may fail to}} ring or otherwise malfunction. For example, call <b>waiting,</b> <b>caller</b> ID and ADSL services are often affected by high ringer load. 20th century equipment tends {{to contribute to a}} larger REN than new equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{authors also}} {{proposed}} {{a mechanism for}} composition of alternatives, the orElse function. It runs one transaction and, if that transaction does a retry, runs a second one. If both retry, it tries them both again {{as soon as a}} relevant change is made. This facility, comparable to features such as the POSIX networking select (...) call, allows the <b>caller</b> to <b>wait</b> on any {{one of a number of}} events simultaneously. It also simplifies programming interfaces, for example by providing a simple mechanism to convert between blocking and nonblocking operations.|$|R
5000|$|The dialing {{pattern for}} Hot-Choice {{subscribers}} is different. After dialing [...] "8", the subscriber <b>waits</b> for a <b>tone</b> and then dials the operator code (OC) either {{for a long}} distance call or an international call.|$|R

5000|$|On 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires {{occurred}} in Victoria, {{otherwise known as}} Black Saturday bushfires. Over 18,000 calls to the Triple Zero Emergency Service on that day were left unanswered {{and the majority of}} calls took much longer to be answered than usual. Due to the unprecedented amount of calls coming through Telstra decided to isolate all Victorian emergency calls which were answered by the Melbourne emergency call centre with all the remaining calls answered by the Sydney emergency call centre. Telstra also activated the generic extreme event recorded voice announcement [...] "You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero. If you require police, fire or ambulance please stay on the line. If you require your local State Emergency Service please hang up and dial 1223 — that’s 1223 — as this service cannot be connected through Triple Zero" [...] which temporary replaced their front end announcement While Telstra records show 95 emergency call centre employees rostered during the 24-hour period on 7 February 2009, call pick up delays were evident due to lengthy delays at the SECC level, being ESTA. Telstra agents were left tied up on phone calls with <b>callers,</b> <b>waiting</b> for emergency services to answer, thus calls in the 000 queue were unable to be answered. Callers in a queue waiting for a Telstra agent to answer the phone were played an RVA every 30 seconds in the following terms, [...] "You have dialled the Emergency Triple Zero number. Due to an unprecedented highvolume of calls being received by Triple Zero, we are experiencing short delays in answering. Please stayon the line and you will be answered by the next available operator". This reassures callers that an extreme emergency was occurring and their call would be answered.|$|R

40|$|Presented {{online for}} the 2016 Research and Creative Achievement Week. Blog website: [URL] where to {{transfer}} an incoming call to within an organization can be time consuming {{even for the}} most seasoned receptionists. The time the <b>caller</b> is <b>waiting</b> to be transferred can positively and negatively impact the remaining customer interaction for those downstream of the receptionist. This study will investigate the current average call time to transfer an incoming caller, make recommendations to reduce the average wait time, and monitor the suggested changes to determine the results. The goal {{of the study is}} to reduce the average transfer time by 50 %, in an effort to save the callers and the organization money. By reducing the transfer time by half, the customer will experience savings in time spent on the phone, and the organization may be able to reduce the staff necessary to transfer the incoming calls...|$|R
