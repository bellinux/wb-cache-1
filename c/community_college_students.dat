25|$|The Wisconsin HOPE Lab {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of conducting research into basic needs insecurity among college students. Insecurity in all its various forms jeopardizes a student’s academic achievements as well as their health and wellbeing. Specific to food security, 23% of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>students</b> have experienced low food security (restricted or decreased food intake due to lack of resources) while 33% have endured very low food security (amount of food eaten is below the amount considered appropriate).|$|E
25|$|<b>Community</b> <b>college</b> <b>students</b> {{are more}} likely to be food {{insecure}} than those students at four-year colleges. African American and Latino college students are food insecure to greater extent than Asian and White college students. Three-fourths of college students who are food insecure receive some form of financial aid and the majority of these students are employed. It has been found that food insecurity at the community college level is far higher for students concentrated in mathematics, developmental writing, and reading. Food insecure students {{are more likely}} to consider dropping out of college and are less likely to stay on track toward obtaining their academic goals than those who are food secure.|$|E
