5|$|Several states {{claimed to}} be the Roman Empire's successors {{after the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire, an attempt to resurrect the Empire in the West, was {{established}} in 800 when Pope LeoIII crowned Frankish King Charlemagne as Roman Emperor on Christmas Day, though the empire and the imperial office did not become formalized for some decades. After the fall of Constantinople, the Russian Tsardom, as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire's Orthodox Christian tradition, counted itself the Third Rome (Constantinople having been the second). These <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> known as Translatio imperii.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} used for decompression {{depend on the}} mode of diving, the available equipment, the site and environment and the actual dive profile. Standardized procedures have been developed that provide an acceptable level of risk in appropriate circumstances. Different sets of procedures are used by commercial, military, scientific and recreational divers, though there is considerable overlap where similar equipment is used, and some <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> common to all decompression procedures.|$|E

40|$|Frequent and Infrequent <b>concepts</b> <b>were</b> {{identified}} in psychological reports. These <b>concepts</b> <b>were</b> presented with established Barnum statements to 70 college students for {{estimation of the}} percentages of persons described by each concept.

50|$|There <b>are</b> two key <b>concepts</b> behind dcGO. The first <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> {{to label}} protein domains with ontology, for example, with Gene Ontology. That {{is why it}} is called dcGO, domain-centric Gene Ontology. The second <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> to use ontology-labeled protein domains for, for example, protein {{function}} prediction. Put it in a simple way, the first <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> about how to create dcGO resource, and the second <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> about how to use dcGO resource.|$|R
50|$|The dictum de nullo says: Whatever {{is denied}} of a <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> also denied of {{everything}} that is contained under it. The <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> a predicate that has been abstracted from the <b>concepts</b> that <b>are</b> contained under it. Whatever is inconsistent with this <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent with the subject and therefore also with the predicates of the subject. This {{is based on the}} rule of negative ratiocination.|$|R
5|$|Versions of {{the fictional}} Baron have {{appeared}} on stage, screen, radio, and television, {{as well as in}} other literary works. Though the Baron Munchausen stories are no longer well-known in many English-speaking countries, they are still popular in continental Europe. The character has inspired numerous memorials and museums, and several medical conditions and other <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> named after him, including Munchausen syndrome, the Münchhausen trilemma, and Munchausen numbers.|$|E
5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E
25|$|During the {{implementation}} phase <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> created and /or adjusted.|$|E

50|$|The SLK I <b>Concept</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} at the Turin Motor Show in Spring of 1994. The SLK I <b>Concept</b> <b>was</b> a near-production two-seater roadster concept car, with design cues {{inspired by the}} W196S 300SLR and R129 Mercedes SL-Class. The SLK I <b>Concept</b> <b>was</b> based on a custom platform, and featured a silver exterior and carbon fibre interior, but did not feature a roof.|$|R
25|$|Similar to the Innate Knowledge thesis, the Innate Concept thesis {{suggests}} that some <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> simply part of our rational nature. These <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> a priori in nature and sense experience is irrelevant to determining {{the nature of these}} concepts (though, sense experience can help bring the concepts to our conscious mind).|$|E
25|$|The dotted arrows {{running from}} the meta-process diagram (left) to the meta-data diagram (right) {{indicate}} which <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> created/ adjusted in the corresponding activities.

50|$|Upon {{completion}} of Colonel Perkins' task, a Master Training <b>Concept</b> <b>was</b> developed and approved, and the MWR Academy was launched. A graphical {{representation of the}} Master Training <b>Concept</b> <b>was</b> {{defined in terms of}} a pyramid.

40|$|The {{scheme for}} classifications of <b>concepts</b> <b>is</b> introduced. It has {{founded on the}} triplet model of concepts. In this model a <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> {{depicted}} by means of three kinds of knowledge: a concept base, a concept representing part and the linkage between them. The idea of triplet classifications of <b>concepts</b> <b>is</b> connected with a usage of various specifications of these knowledge kinds as classification criteria...|$|R
50|$|The initial <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> successful, {{but many}} of their {{locations}} failed as competition grew. The <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> abandoned by the late 1990s with locations being downsized, re-branded as Loblaws stores and sold altogether.|$|R

40|$|An {{advanced}} composite shear web design <b>concept</b> has <b>been</b> {{developed for the}} Space Shuttle Orbiter main engine thrust beam structure. Various web <b>concepts</b> <b>were</b> synthesized by a computer-aided adaptive random search procedure. A practical <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> identified having a titanium-clad, boron/epoxy plate with vertical boron/epoxy reinforced stiffeners. Baseline composite and titanium shear resistant designs are compared; the composite <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> 28 % lighter than the titanium web. Element test results show the metal cladding effectively reinforces critical composite load transfer and fastener hole areas making the composite web concept practical for other shear structure applications. ...|$|R
