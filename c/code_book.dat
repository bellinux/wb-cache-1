In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags.|$|E
5|$|After 18 to 24 {{months of}} development, Maniac Mansion debuted at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was {{released}} for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in October 1987. While previous Lucasfilm Games products {{had been published}} by outside companies, Maniac Mansion was self-published. This became a trend at Lucasfilm. The company hired Ken Macklin, an acquaintance of Winnick's, to design the game's packaging artwork. Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design the back cover. The two also created an insert that includes hints, a backstory, and jokes. An MS-DOS port was released in early 1988, developed in part by Lucasfilm employees Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) followed, with the Amiga and Atari ST ports in 1989 and the NES port in 1990. The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a copy protection system requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a <b>code</b> <b>book</b> include with the game. This was not present in the Commodore 64 and Apple versions {{due to lack of}} disk space, so those instead used an on-disk copy protection.|$|E

25|$|During the Battle of Galveston, Harriet Lane sank the Rebel tugboat Neptune, leaving {{one-half}} of the two-vessel Confederate fleet lying {{on the bottom of}} the harbor. However, the Confederate gunboat Bayou City circled and made a second run on Harriet Lane. At daybreak, Harriet Lane was listing steeply, and a boat was dispatched from her side to the remaining Union ships to negotiate a surrender. During the negotiations, Harriet Lane was further damaged by fire from the Union Owasco under a flag of truce in an attempt to explode her magazine. The flagship Westfield was later exploded, and the remaining Union ships fled to New Orleans, leaving Harriet Lane, along with a copy of the United States signal service <b>code</b> <b>book</b> in her cabin, in Confederate hands.|$|E
25|$|In 1808 a {{flagstaff}} {{was erected}} on Fort Phillip and by 1823 a semaphore {{had been placed}} there. A hut for the signalman was also built at this time which {{can be seen in}} the watercolour of 1842. The semaphore had two swinging arms which could be changed to various positions that spelled out numbers. These could be translated into letters by referring to a <b>code</b> <b>book.</b> The first hut for the signal station was very small consisting of only four rooms, two of which were bedrooms. This was replaced in 1847 by the more substantial stone building designed by architect Mortimer Lewis which exists today. This building was the home of successive signal masters and their families until 1939 when the station was closed.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{during the}} cold war era, Hughes was {{approached}} by the CIA through his longtime partner, David Charnay, to help secretly recover the Soviet submarine K-129, which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier. Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, conducting expensive civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules. The recovery plan used the special-purpose salvage vessel Glomar Explorer. In the summer of 1974, Glomar Explorer attempted to raise the Soviet vessel. However, during the recovery a mechanical failure in the ship's grapple caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor. This section is believed to have held many of the most sought-after items, including its <b>code</b> <b>book</b> and nuclear missiles. Two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered, along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony. The operation, known as Project Azorian (but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer), became public in February 1975 after secret documents were released, obtained by burglars of Hughes' headquarters during a burglary in June 1974. Though he lent his name and his company's resources to the operation, Hughes and his companies had no operational involvement in the project. The Glomar Explorer was eventually acquired by Transocean Inc. (an offshore oil and gas drilling rig company) and was sent to the scrap yard in 2015 during a large decline in oil prices.|$|E

500|$|The {{signal was}} relayed using the numeric flag code {{known as the}} [...] "Telegraphic Signals of Marine Vocabulary", devised in 1800 by Rear Admiral Sir Home Popham, {{and based on the}} signal books created earlier by Admiral Lord Howe. This code {{assigned}} the digits 0 to 9 to ten signal flags, which were used in combination. Code numbers 1–25 represented letters of the alphabet (omitting J and with V=20 before U=21); higher numbers were assigned meanings by a <b>code</b> <b>book.</b> The code numbers are believed to have been hoisted on the mizzenmast, one after another, with the [...] "telegraphic flag" [...] (a red over white diagonally-split flag) also being flown to show that the signals employed Popham's code. As well as digit flags, the code used [...] "repeat" [...] flags so that only one set of digits was needed; thus the word do, coded as [...] "220", used a [...] "2" [...] flag, a [...] "first repeat" [...] flag here serving as a second 2, and a [...] "0" [...] flag. The word duty was not in the codebook (and was not replaced as confides had been), so had to be spelt out, and the whole message required twelve [...] "lifts". It is believed that it would have taken about four minutes, {{with the end of the}} message indicated by an [...] "end of code" [...] flag (blue over yellow diagonally split). A team of four to six men, led by Lt. Pasco, would have prepared and hoisted the flags onboard Lord Nelson's flagship [...] The message shows one of the shortcomings of Popham's code—even the two-letter [...] "do" [...] required three flags hoisted for the signal. It is reported that a great cheer went up as the signal was hoisted and repeated throughout the fleet.|$|E
