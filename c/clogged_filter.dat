50|$|Some water {{treatment}} filters use surface wash systems that {{break up the}} heavily clogged, granular media surface layer. Surface wash systems are buried {{in the top of}} the filter media or are suspended above the filter media surface. John R.

Rotating arms use jets of water to break up the <b>clogged</b> <b>filter</b> surface and to rotate a movable arm through the filter material. A surface wash step in a backwash cycle usually takes place at the beginning of the filter bed cleaning process.|$|E

Monitoring and implementation of prognostics on filtration system {{have the potential to}} avoid costs and increase safety. Prognostics is a fundamental technology within Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM). Prognostic models can be categorised into three major categories: 1) Physics-based models 2) Data-driven models 3) Experience-based models. One of the challenges in the progression of the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure is the inability to observe the natural <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure due to time constraint. This paper presents a simple solution to collect data for a <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure. Also, it represents a simple state-based prognostic with duration information (SSPD) method that aims to detect and forecast <b>clogging</b> of <b>filter</b> in a laboratory based fuel rig system. The progression of the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure is created unnaturally. The degradation level is divided into several groups. Each group is defined as a state in the failure progression of <b>clogging</b> <b>filter.</b> Then, the data is collected to create the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> progression states unnaturally. The SSPD method consists of three steps: clustering, clustering evaluation, and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Prognosis results show that the SSPD method is able to predicate the RUL of the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> accurately...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{modelling}} of {{the variation}} in the pressure drop across a HEPA filter during cake filtration in the presence of humidity was studied. A semi-empirical model was developed that considers the pressure drop across the <b>clogged</b> <b>filter</b> as the sum of the pressure drops across the clean filter and across the cake, which is itself decomposed into several successive layers. The pressure drop across each layer of particles depends on its state of equilibrium with the air humidity. The model includes the specific resistance of each layer of particles and its variation when the cake is exposed to a flow of moist air. This model applies for relative humidity below the deliquescent point of the aerosol if it is hygroscopic. The results show good agreement between the calculated values and experimental values for flat filters clogged with aluminium oxide and sodium chloride test aerosols. The model also revealed the influence of filtration time on the evolution of the pressure drop across a <b>clogged</b> <b>filter</b> in the presence of humidity, especially with a hygroscopic aerosol...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNumerous {{sources of}} liquid {{aerosols}} {{are to be}} found in industrial environments. Such aerosols may, for instance, be cutting fluids, pesticides, etc., that are harmful or even toxic to humans. To control and reduce worker exposure to potentially toxic aerosols, these latter are usually filtered through fibrous filters.

Consequently, workers are exposed to greater amounts of more concentrated vapors than the initial state of the filtered aerosol. Furthermore, exposure readings are distorted by an artifact that may be significant. This study offers an experimental approach to long-term monitoring of the evaporation of a semi-volatile n-hexadecane liquid aerosol deposited on filters of varying efficiency.

For many remote, under-privileged and poor communities, {{this is the only}} pre-treatment of drinking water prior to boiling. With the emergence of arsenic contaminations in many groundwater aquifers, the filtration became imperative for many communities around the world. However, after repetitive/continuous uses, clogging of the filter media is obvious, which eventually causes poor performance of the filtration process.

40|$|In industry, {{contaminant}} filtration is {{a common}} process to achieve a desired level of purification, since contaminants in liquids such as fuel may lead to performance drop and rapid wear propagation. Generally, clogging of filter phenomena is the primary failure mode leading to the replacement or cleansing of filter.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) jointly {{maintain}} a fuel economy website (www. fueleconomy. gov), which helps fulfill their responsibility under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to provide accurate fuel economy information [in {{miles per gallon}} (mpg) ] to consumers. The site provides information on EPA fuel economy ratings for passenger {{cars and light trucks}} from 1985 to the present and other relevant information related to energy use such as alternative fuels and driving and vehicle maintenance tips. In recent years, fluctuations in the price of crude oil and corresponding fluctuations in the price of gasoline and diesel fuels have renewed interest in vehicle fuel economy in the United States. (User sessions on the fuel economy website exceeded 20 million in 2008 compared to less than 5 million in 2004 and less than 1 million in 2001.) As a result of this renewed interest and the age of some of the references cited in the tips section of the website, DOE authorized the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Fuels, Engines, and Emissions Research Center (FEERC) to initiate studies to validate and improve these tips. This report documents a study aimed specifically at the effect of engine air filter condition on fuel economy. The goal {{of this study was to}} explore the effects of a clogged air filter on the fuel economy of vehicles operating over prescribed test cycles. Three newer vehicles (a 2007 Buick Lucerne, a 2006 Dodge Charger, and a 2003 Toyota Camry) and an older carbureted vehicle were tested. Results show that clogging the air filter has no significant effect on the fuel economy of the newer vehicles (all fuel injected with closed-loop control and one equipped with MDS). The engine control systems were able to maintain the desired AFR regardless of intake restrictions, and therefore fuel consumption was not increased. The carbureted engine did show a decrease in fuel economy with increasing restriction. However, the level of restriction required to cause a substantial (10 - 15 %) decrease in fuel economy (such as that cited in the literature) was so severe that the vehicle was almost undrivable. Acceleration performance on all vehicles was improved with a clean air filter. Once it was determined how severe the restriction had to be to affect the carbureted vehicle fuel economy, the 2007 Buick Lucerne was retested in a similar manner. We were not able to achieve the level of restriction that was achieved with the 1972 Pontiac with the Lucerne. The Lucerne's air filter box would not hold the filter in place under such severe conditions. (It is believed that this testing exceeded the design limits of the air box.) Tests were conducted at a lower restriction level (although still considerably more severe than the initial <b>clogged</b> <b>filter</b> testing), allowing the air filter to stay seated in the air box, and no significant change was observed in the Lucerne's fuel economy or the AFR over the HFET cycle. Closed-loop control in modern fuel injected vehicle applications is sophisticated enough to keep a clogged air filter from affecting the vehicle fuel economy. However for older, open-loop, carbureted vehicles, a clogged air filter can affect the fuel economy. For the vehicle tested, the fuel economy with a new air filter improved as much as 14 % over that with a severely <b>clogged</b> <b>filter</b> (in which the filter was so clogged that drivability was impacted). Under a more typical state of clog, the improvement with a new filter ranged from 2 to 6 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Renal {{failure is}} common in {{critically}} ill patients and frequently requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). CRRT is discontinued at regular intervals for routine changes of the disposable equipment or for replacing <b>clogged</b> <b>filter</b> membrane assemblies. The present {{study was conducted to}} determine if the necessity to continue CRRT could be predicted during the CRRT-free period. Materials and methods In the period from 2003 to 2006, 605 patients were treated with CRRT in our ICU. A total of 222 patients with 448 CRRT-free intervals had complete data sets and were used for analysis. Of the total CRRT-free periods, 225 served as an evaluation group. Twenty-nine parameters with an assumed influence on kidney function were analyzed with regard to their potential to predict the restoration of kidney function during the CRRT-free interval. Using univariate analysis and logistic regression, a prospective index was developed and validated in the remaining 223 CRRT-free periods to establish its prognostic strength. Results Only three parameters showed an independent influence on the restoration of kidney function during CRRT-free intervals: the number of previous CRRT cycles (medians in the two outcome groups: 1 vs. 2), the "Sequential Organ Failure Assessment"-score (means in the two outcome groups: 8. 3 vs. 9. 2) and urinary output after the cessation of CRRT (medians in two outcome groups: 66 ml/h vs. 10 ml/h). The prognostic index, which was calculated from these three variables, showed a satisfactory potential to predict the kidney function during the CRRT-free intervals; Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0. 798. Conclusion Restoration of kidney function during CRRT-free periods can be predicted with an index calculated from three variables. Prospective trials in other hospitals must clarify whether our results are generally transferable to other patient populations. </p...|$|E

40|$|Prefabricated {{vertical}} drains (PVD) {{are used}} to accelerate drainage and consolidation of soft sediment. An effective functioning of these PVD depends on its capacity to drain water from the subsurface. Among other causes, the <b>clogging</b> of <b>filter</b> jackets {{is thought to be}} of a considerable negative influence on the functioning of PVD. Current regulations prescribe a minimum ratio between the filters aperture size and the grain size distribution of the soil to prevent this clogging. Objective: The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> on the performance of PVD filter jackets, with regards to the soft soil conditions that are encountered in large parts of the Netherlands. Method: A literature review is performed on the principle of vertical drainage, soil types, <b>filter</b> types, <b>clogging</b> criteria, processes and testing methods. An experimental program was undertaken in the laboratory in which filter jackets were exposed to two different clogging phenomena, i. e. particle clogging and chemical <b>clogging.</b> Also <b>filters</b> from the field were evaluated. All filters were evaluated on their loss of permittivity with constant head measurements on filter pieces of three different filter types, the D 165 and HS 5417 from the Typar line of DuPont and the 30195 of Freudenberg. Particle clogging was evaluated by two different setups, the Oedometer and a long term filtration setup. Within the Oedometer tests the load and the moisture content of the clay sample varied. Chemical testing was done briefly, to see till what extend iron precipitation could induce <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> and if one filter would be more prone to clog than the other. Results: The permittivity tests on the filter pieces showed reproducible results. Repeated measurements on the same sample showed an average standard deviation of not larger than four percent of the samples mean. The initial permittivity also corresponded reasonable with the values provided by the filter manufacturers. With particle clogging, it was seldom observed that clogging ratios were higher than five. Relations between clogging and the applied load on the clay sample could not be found. Increasing moisture content showed a slightly higher clogging ratio. Another clogging indicator was found from work by Aydilek, initial permittivity. This is believed to be a better estimator; higher initial permittivity in general gave lower clogging ratios. In the chemical experiment it was observed that on the filter of Freudenberg large amounts of iron oxide precipitated. During filtration the <b>filter</b> seemed fully <b>clogged.</b> Permittivity tests on this filter showed an approximately four times larger clogging ratio, than that of the other ones. Conclusions: Based on literature and observations from both experiments and field data, it can be concluded that the permittivity reduction of filter jackets is always less than a factor of ten. Hence <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> is not a real issue, since the permeability of the soft sediments is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the <b>clogged</b> <b>filters.</b> Hence, the system permeability is mainly determined by the soil behavior.
