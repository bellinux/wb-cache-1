50|$|AT/RT may {{be related}} to {{malignant}} rhabdoid tumor (MRT), which occurs outside the CNS, usually in the kidney. The finding that AT/RT and MRT both have deletions of the INI1 gene indicates that rhabdoid tumors of the kidney and brain are at least closely related. AT/RT and MRT also have similar histology and similar <b>clinical</b> <b>and</b> <b>demographic</b> features. Moreover, 10-15% of MRT patients have simultaneous or subsequent brain tumors, many of which are secondary or primary MRT.|$|E
50|$|A 2016 {{study of}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorders provides a powerful {{example of a}} CDS platform to diagnose, track, predict and monitor the progression of Parkinsons disease. Using large and multi-source imaging, genetics, <b>clinical</b> <b>and</b> <b>demographic</b> data, these investigators developed a decision support system that can predict {{the state of the}} disease with high accuracy, consistency and precision. They employed classical model-based and machine learning model-free methods to discriminate between different patient and control groups. Similar approaches may be used for predictive diagnosis and disease progression forecasting in many neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, as well as for other clinical and biomedical applications where Big Data is available.|$|E

50|$|Considerable {{debate has}} been focused on whether AT/RTs are the same as rhabdoid tumours of the kidney (i.e., just extra-renal MRTs (malignant rhabdoid tumours)). The recent {{recognition}} that both CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours (AT/RTs) and MRTs have deletions of the INI1 gene in chromosome 22 indicates that rhabdoid tumours of the kidney and brain are identical or closely related entities, although the CNS variant tends to have its mutations on Taxon 9 and MRTs elsewhere. This observation is not surprising because rhabdoid tumours at both locations possess similar histologic, <b>clinical,</b> <b>and</b> <b>demographic</b> features. Moreover, 10-15% of patients with MRTs have synchronous or metachronous brain tumours, many of which are second primary malignant rhabdoid tumours. This similarity excludes composite rhabdoid tumours, which occur mainly in adults.|$|E
