40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{the studies}} was to {{determine}} the possibility of using a combined rearing system of tanks and illuminated cages for coregonid larvae in eutrophic lake. Studies were carried out in 1990. Tank rearing took place in Dgal Hatchery, <b>cage</b> <b>rearing</b> was performed in eutrophic Lake Leginskie. Increasing the egg incubation temperature, larvae hatching was accelerated about 3 weeks earlier. The larvae were reared on artificial feeds, at 16 ± 1 C, for a period of 19 days. Then they were transferred to il-luminated cages, in which they fed on the zooplankton only. The control group consisted of the larvae ha-tched in the usual period in cold hatcheries, and reared identically as the experimental fish. <b>Cage</b> <b>rearing</b> lasted for 63 days. Growth rate, mortality, LDS and fish biomass were determined throughout of the experiment. The larvae attained the weight of 41 mg at the end of tank rearing. Fry obtained {{at the end of the}} <b>cage</b> <b>rearing</b> weighed from 1732 to 2023 mg (experimental fish) and from 475 to 648 mg (control fish). Stock mortalities amounted from 65 to 80 %. Experimental fish finished their larval development after 42 days, whereas a certain part of control group did not finished their larval development till the end of <b>cage</b> <b>rearing.</b> There were high values of fish biomass in cages in tank-and-cage rearing (from 2. 39 to 3. 24 kg/m 3). The results of the experiment have showed that tank-and-cage rearing of producing coregonid stocking material may be applicable in eutrophic lakes...|$|E

The annual mean values of clorophyll a varied from 2. 3 mg m - 3 in 1991 to 11. 1 mg m - 3 in 1990, annual mean values of biomass from 0. 5 mg l - 1 in 1993 to 3. 9 mg l - 1 in 1990 and annual mean values of cellular density from 6 x 106 cells l - 1 in 1993 to 11. 3 x 106 cells l - 1 in 1990. Despite great variations in the species composition of phytoplankton in each year, a general scheme in the algal succession was found with Cryptophyceae in the colder months, Chlorophyceae in the spring months (sometimes in autumn), Cyanophyceae and Dinophyceae in summer, Bacillariophyceae in autumn, Chrysophyceae between winter and spring and Conjugatophyceae in summer or in winter. The trophic status on the basis of phytoplankton composition, clorophyll a, annual mean values of total phosphorus (from 19 mg P m - 3 in 1993 to 25 mg P m - 3 1990) was mesotrophic but in 1990 the eutrophic probability, on the basis of chlorophyll a, was higher.

40|$|Transfers and {{introductions}} of marine species have occurred and are occurring on a worldwide basis, largely {{in response to}} perceived needs of expanding aquaculture industries. Greatest interest is in salmon (<b>cage</b> <b>rearing</b> and ocean ranching), shrimp, and bivalve mollusks, although other organisms are being considered. Such movements of animals carry an associated risk of moving pathogens into areas where they did not occur previously, possibly resulting in infections in native species. Many case histories {{of the effects of}} introduced pathogens and parasites now exist-enough to suggest that national and international action is necessary.

50|$|The {{distance}} between {{the upper and lower}} pulleys of a rear derailleur is known as the cage length. Cage length, when combined with the pulley size, determines the capacity of a derailleur to take up chain slack. Cage length determines the total capacity of the derailleur, that is the size difference between the largest and smallest chainrings, and the size difference between the largest and smallest sprockets on the cogset added together. A larger sum requires a longer cage length. Typical cross country mountain bikes with three front chainrings will use a long <b>cage</b> <b>rear</b> derailleur.

40|$|ABSTRACT Broilers {{reared in}} cages {{have a high}} {{incidence}} of wing breakage during processing. Three trials were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} cage dimensions and floor types on bone breaking strength and wing breakage during processing. Broilers were fed commercial-type diets and processed through the pickers at a commercial processing plant or a research facility. Broken bones were detected by palpation, and humeri and tibia were removed. Breaking strength was determined for the humeri and tibia with a testing instrument. Incidence of breast blisters, crooked keels, follicle infection, fleshing downgrades, and slabsidedness were determined in one trial. Cage height was the major factor affecting wing breakage and humerus strength. Incidence of wing breakage for broilers on wire floors with cages. 64 m high was not significantly different from that of control broilers reared on litter with ceiling 2. 54 m high.

Two commercial flocks each of about 12375 day old Hubbard broiler chicks of mixed sex were housed in two fully environmentally controlled pens (cage and floor pens) from 0 - 6 weeks of age. Welfare was assessed through bird's performance, behavior, fearfulness and Heterophil: lymphocyte ratio (HLR). Compared to cage reared group, floor reared broilers recorded significantly heavier final body weight, body weight gain, better feed conversion and lower mortalities throughout the whole rearing period (0 - 6 weeks). Behavioral data showed that, caged birds were more often standing and stereotyped drinking, however floor reared group showed more walking, feeding and pecking.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effect of protein level fed from 6 to 20 weeks of age on the performance of <b>cage</b> <b>reared</b> and floor reared replacement pullets. The protein level of rations containing 2800 to 3000 kcal. metabolizable energy per kilogram was varied by 2 % increments from 18 to 12 %, 18 to 12 % and 16 to 10 % during the periods from 6 to 10, 10 to 14 and 14 to 20 weeks of age, respectively. Data from these two experiments indicate that replacement pullets fed a 20 % protein ration to 6 weeks of age require a 14 - 14 - 12 or 16 - 12 - 12 percent protein level sequence from 6 to 10, 10 to 14 and 14 to 20 weeks of age, respectively, to maximize 20 -week weight and efficiency of feed utilization and minimize the days required to reach 50 % egg production. Feeding lower protein levels, i. e., 20 - 14 - 12 - 12, 20 - 12 - 12 - 12 and 20 - 14 - 12 - 10 percent protein level sequences resulted in inferior performance of replacement pullets to 20 weeks of age. The data also show that even though feeding a 20 - 14 - 12 - 12 or 20 - 12 - 12 - 12 percent protein level sequence resulted in a smaller bird at 20 weeks of age which required more days to reach 50 % egg production, the subsequent production during the following 42 -week laying cycle was not significantly reduced. The influence of protein level on the performance of replacement pullets was similar for <b>cage</b> <b>reared</b> and floor reared pullets even though pullets <b>reared</b> in <b>cages</b> were heavier at 20 weeks of age, consumed more feed, were less efficient in the utilization of feed and required fewer days to reach 50 % egg production compared to pullets reared on the floor...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In 1992 and 1993 tank-cage rearing of {{whitefish}} larvae {{was carried}} out. The fish hatched {{in two different}} periods: in 1992 larvae hatching {{took place at the}} beginning of March (early-hatched whi-tefish), and in 1993 - {{in the second half of}} April (late-hatched whitefish). Each year the larvae were kept in tanks for the first 3 weeks of their life. The tanks were fed with water of 140 C (group A) and 180 C (gro-up B). During this period the fish were given artificial feeds. Fish rearing in the next 6 weeks was carried out in the illuminated lake cages (placed in Lake Legiñskie), maintaining the division into two groups. While in cages, the fish fed exclusively on the zooplankton. In 1992 <b>cage</b> <b>rearing</b> was quite early in the season (1 April- 17 May), while in 1993 it was rather late (11 May- 20 June). Feeding activity of whitefish larvae was strictly related to the dynamics of energy content in crustacean zooplankton occurring in the lake. Copepods were the main energetic component of whitefish food du-ring „early ” rearing (1992) : 0. 7 cal. per individual in variant A and about 1 cal. in variant B. In the case of „late ” rearing (1993), cladocerans dominated with respect to the energetic value: about 5 cal. per indivi-dual in variant A and 3. 5 cal. in variant B...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. -"Shrinkage, " or unaccounted-for {{losses of}} fish during <b>cage</b> <b>rearing,</b> is widely {{acknowledged}} among fish culturists who rear salmonid fishes, but {{the extent of}} such losses has not been documented. Over 60, 000 Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were reared in floating cages at four locations in Puget Sound, Washington, and were hand-counted {{at the beginning and}} end of 200 + d of rearing. Average unexplained losses were 8 - 38 % for individual locations (three to four cages each) and 2. 5 - 46. 5 % for individual cages. When cage netting remains intact, unexplained losses are probably the result of decomposition of carcasses (particularly during disease outbreaks); scavenging by birds, mammals, and fishes; and to a lesser extent, escapes. The economic consequences of losing fish can be important in terms of lost harvest and increased food costs, resulting in true food conversions 10 - 68 % higher than anticipated. It is widely known among commercial fish culturists that when fishes are held within nets in a body of water, a certain portion of fish assumed to be in cages disappears. Though this unexplained loss of fishes has been recognized for decades (Institute of Fisheries Economics 1971; Kennedy 1975; Secretan 1979), it has never been accurately documented. Even today, commercial fish culturists continue to lose important numbers of salmonid fishes from cages in salt water, estimated to range from 10 % to as much as 30...|$|E
