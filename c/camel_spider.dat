40|$|<b>Camel</b> <b>spiders</b> (Arachnida: Solifugae) {{are one of}} the {{arachnid}} groups characterised by a prosomal dorsal shield {{composed of}} three distinct elements: the pro-, meso- and metapeltidium. These are associated respectively with prosomal appendages one to four, five, and six. What is less well known, although noted in the historical literature, is that the coxae of the 4 th and 5 th prosomal segments (i. e. walking legs 2 and 3) of <b>camel</b> <b>spiders</b> are also separated ventrally by a distinct membranous region, which is absent between the coxae of the other legs. We suggest that this essentially ventral division of the prosoma specifically between coxae 2 and 3 is homologous with the so-called sejugal furrow (the sejugal interval sensu van der Hammen). This division constitutes a fundamental part of the body plan in acariform mites (Arachnida: Acariformes). If homologous, this sejugal furrow could represent a further potential synapomorphy for (Solifugae + Acariformes); a relationship with increasing morphological and molecular support. Alternatively, outgroup comparison with sea spiders (Pycnogonida) and certain early Palaeozoic fossils could imply that the sejugal furrow defines an older tagma, derived from a more basal grade of organisation. In this scenario the (still) divided prosoma of acariform mites and <b>camel</b> <b>spiders</b> would be plesiomorphic. This interpretation challenges the textbook arachnid character of a peltidium (or ‘carapace’) covering an undivided prosoma...|$|R

25|$|Solifugae is a {{group of}} 900 species of arachnids, {{commonly}} known as <b>camel</b> <b>spiders,</b> wind scorpions, and sun spiders. The name derives from Latin, and means those that flee from the sun. Most Solifugae live in tropical or semitropical regions where they inhabit warm and arid habitats, but some species have been known to live in grassland or forest habitats. The most distinctive feature of Solifugae is their large chelicerae. Each of the two chelicerae are composed of two articles forming a powerful pincer; each article bears a variable number of teeth. Males in all families but Eremobatidae possess a flagellum on the basal article of the chelicera. Solifugae also have long pedipalps, which function as sense organs similar to insects' antennae and give the appearance of the two extra legs. Pedipalps terminate in reversible adhesive organs.|$|R
50|$|Common kestrels eat almost {{exclusively}} mouse-sized mammals. Voles, shrews and true mice supply up to three-quarters {{or more of}} the biomass most individuals ingest. On oceanic islands (where mammals are often scarce), small birds (mainly passerines) may make up the bulk of its diet. Elsewhere, birds are only an important food during a few weeks each summer when inexperienced fledglings abound. Other suitably sized vertebrates like bats, swifts, frogs and lizards are eaten only on rare occasions. However, kestrels are more likely to prey on lizards is southern latitudes. In northern latitudes, the kestrel is found to more often deliver lizards to their nestlings during midday and also with increasing ambient temperature. Seasonally, arthropods may be a main prey item. Generally, invertebrates like <b>camel</b> <b>spiders</b> and even earthworms, but mainly sizeable insects such as beetles, orthopterans and winged termites are eaten with delight whenever the birds happen upon them.|$|R
2500|$|Solifugae is {{an order}} of animals in the class Arachnida known {{variously}} as <b>camel</b> <b>spiders,</b> wind scorpions, sun spiders, or solifuges. The order includes more than 1,000 described species in about 153 genera. Despite the common names, they are neither true scorpions (order Scorpiones) nor true spiders (order Araneae) – though they are {{more closely related to}} scorpions than to spiders. Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two tagmata: an opisthosoma (abdomen) behind the prosoma (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two chelicerae that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for stridulation. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a [...] "tail". Most species of Solifugae live in dry climates and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling arthropods and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of , including legs. A number of urban legends exaggerate the size and speed of the Solifugae, and their potential danger to humans, which is negligible.|$|R
50|$|Cheliceratichnus, meaning {{trace of}} a chelicerate arthropod, is an ichnogenus erected by Dalman and Lucas (2015) for a body imprint {{discovered}} in the Lower Jurassic East Berlin Formation of Holyoke, Massachusetts. The specimen is now housed at the Springfield Science Museum, {{which is one of}} multiple museums on the Quadrangle (Springfield, Massachusetts). Considering that only a single specimen was found, the ichnogenus is monospecific, with the species name lockleyi honoring paleontologist and ichnologist Martin Lockley. In trace fossil classification schemes based on behavior, the body imprint is considered a cubichnion, or resting trace. Cheliceratichnus lockleyi exhibits the tagma characteristic of arthropods, with the trace divided into anterior, central, and posterior regions. Dalman and Lucas (2015) interpreted these regions as imprints of the chelicerae, prosoma, and opisthosoma, respectively, of a chelicerate arthropod. Additionally, imprints of the animal's legs and telson were identified. These authors noted that, in general, the pattern of the trace was similar to the body plan of the Solifugae, or <b>camel</b> <b>spiders,</b> but also noted that the presence of a telson imprint rules out that group because these animals lack telsons. Consequently, they attributed the trace to a solifuge-like arthropod without being more committal on what made it. In addition to the a body imprint, the animal produced a trackway, called Acanthichnus cursorius, leading away from the body imprint, which demonstrates that the animal was alive at the time its body imprinted the sediment.|$|R

Those occurring in New Zealand, Australia, and Tasmania are typically {{referred to as}} jumping or cave weta. Most are found in forest environments or within caves, animal burrows, cellars, under stones, in wood or in similar environments. They are characterized in part by their long antennae and legs. The well-known field crickets are from a different superfamily (Grylloidea) and only look vaguely similar, while {{members of the family}} Tettigoniidae may look superficially similar in body form.|$|R
