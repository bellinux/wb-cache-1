40|$|Rice {{production}} {{is a key}} component in the Sri Lankan economy. Paddy is processed to produce raw or parboiled rice. In parboiling process, <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> uses about 1, 300 liters of water per tonne of paddy. About 70 % of the water used in parboiling with biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) ranging from 950 to 1300 mg/L is discharged as effluent into the surface waters, causing environmental damage. Anaerobic condition in the <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> process is considered {{the primary reason for}} high BOD of the effluent. Maintaining aerobic conditions would reduce the effluent strength. Study of dissolved oxygen (DO) profile, in the soaking water, is important in the design of an aerobic <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> system. An experiment was conducted to study the DO profile in conventional and aerated soaking processes using 12 month old small grain paddy. Soaking tests were 48 hour duration and DO concentration was measured intermittently. When DO reduced to about 1. 0 mg/L, water was aerated by circulation through a shower, Aeration was stopped when increased to about 8 mg/L. This cycle was repeated for 48 hours. Moisture content of paddy, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and pH of effluent were measured during the experiment. Initially, it took about 9 hours of soaking for DO to deplete to lower limit and aeration to upper limit took only 25 minutes. As the experiment progressed time for DO depletion decreased and time for aeration increased. After about 21 hours, the depletion-aeration cycle stabilized at about 3 hour total cycle time.

Jayer was noted for his refusal to filter his wines and known to always destemming his grapes in contrast to habits of other growers in Burgundy that even today let stems go through the crusher when vintages does not provide enough tannins. This has the side effect of adding tannins with more green and bitter character. Jayer also invented a new technique called <b>cold</b> <b>soak</b> that is a pre-maceration avoiding spontaneous fermentation at temperature of about 10 oC for 1-4 days. The method aims to extract more apples, complex aromas, color, less harsh tannins and add more nose to wines.|$|E

A significant amount of water is used in this soaking operation which is then discharged as wastewater. The continuous discharge of this wastewater has become an environmental concern in the paddy parboiling industry in Sri Lanka. In this study important characteristics of the effluent generated from two existing paddy soaking operations practiced in Sri Lanka namely hot <b>soaking</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> were initially determined. This analysis was done for wastewater resulting from soaking two rice varieties available locally, namely LD 356 a red rice and BG 300 which is a white rice. Characterization study showed pollutant levels higher in paddy soak wastewater than the stipulated local discharge standards (Appendix C). Wastewater generated from both hot <b>soaking</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> of red rice variety showed relatively higher COD and BOD values compared to those of wastewater from white rice variety. Hot soaking wastewater had higher COD and BOD values than <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> wastewater.

Experimental wines were made using <b>cold</b> <b>soak,</b> post-fermentation EM, and standard fermentation treatments (C). <b>Cold</b> <b>soak</b> treatments included a 3 -day <b>cold</b> <b>soak</b> at 10 °C (CS), {{with an additional}} comparison of plunging effects for the 2004 wines (CSP). Post-fermentation extended maceration treatments were 1 - or 3 -weeks on skins in 2004 (PS 1 and PS 3 respectively), and 3 -weeks in 2006 and 2007 (PS 3). A variety of chemical and sensory test methods {{were used to determine}} changes in phenolic components and organoleptic properties between treatments of all 3 varietals as they aged in the bottle. Among other results, it was determined if wines made with a period of <b>cold</b> <b>soak</b> had increased colour intensity, and increased concentrations of monomeric anthocyanins and pigmented polymers compared to control wines. It was also determined if wines made with a period of post-fermentation EM had increased concentrations of the flavan- 3 -ols (+) -catechin and (−) -epicatechin, and tannin, decreased colour intensity and modified mouthfeel compared to the other wine treatments. A greater understanding of Australian red winemakers’ opinions on EM regimes and their use in Australian wineries was obtained by survey. Survey results confirmed that EM is used extensively in Australian wineries but that winemakers have poor understanding of the {{consequences of}} EM regimes for red wine properties. The survey confirmed that winemakers are concerned about the economic cost and logistic pressures {{associated with the use of}} EM regimes during vintage. Wines made using EM need to spend longer in fermentation vessels, which are in high demand during this time. Findings from this study provide winemakers with more information to consider before making decisions about their use of EM regimes. Survey findings showed more winemakers would use EM regimes if logistic and economic pressures did not apply. However, results suggest that even if winemakers did adopt EM practices, some may not achieve what they believe to be the outcome of these regimes, such as improved colour or mouthfeel properties. For instance, results showed that cold soaking did not make a difference to wine colour compared to conventional fermentation maceration. Even without cold soaking red must, winemakers may be able to achieve the same or very similar wine organoleptic characteristics at a reduced cost. Similarly, no significant effects of plunging during <b>cold</b> <b>soak</b> were observed. Post-fermentation EM visibly reduced wine colour intensity and imparted a browner hue to the wine compared to red wine that was pressed off skins upon reaching dryness. This EM regime is therefore unlikely to benefit winemakers who are seeking to produce highly coloured wines. However, prolonged maceration post-fermentation did increase the intensity of perceived bitterness and increased the concentration of wine flavan- 3 -ols and tannins. Winemakers may therefore influence the desired balance between the extraction of these wine phenolics (and the associated outcome for taste and mouthfeel properties) and economic considerations by varying the duration of maceration post-fermentation.
