40|$|Due to the {{availability}} of increased computational power combined with better X-ray source and detector technologies, the obtainable resolutions now allow to use CT-machines not only for material and medical science, but also for dimensional metrology. However, the transition from visualization to measuring requires calibration {{steps to ensure that}} measurements are traceable to the unit of length. There is still a lack of proper standards to calibrate <b>CT</b> <b>machines</b> and to check their performance for dimensional metrology. In addition, there is still room for a better systematic approach for measurement uncertainty determination.

The first production X-ray <b>CT</b> <b>machine</b> (in fact called the [...] "EMI-Scanner") was limited to making tomographic sections of the brain, but acquired the image data in about 4 minutes (scanning two adjacent slices), and the computation time (using a Data General Nova minicomputer) was about 7 minutes per picture. This scanner required the use of a water-filled Perspex tank with a pre-shaped rubber [...] "head-cap" [...] at the front, which enclosed the patient's head. The water-tank was used to reduce the dynamic range of the radiation reaching the detectors (between scanning outside the head compared with scanning through the bone of the skull).

50|$|Initial {{machines}} would {{rotate the}} X-ray source and detectors around a stationary object.

Newer machines permitted continuous rotation with the object to be imaged slowly and smoothly slid through the X-ray ring. These are called helical or spiral <b>CT</b> <b>machines.</b> A subsequent development of helical CT was multi-slice (or multi-detector) CT; instead of a single row of detectors, multiple rows of detectors are used effectively capturing multiple cross-sections simultaneously. Systems with {{a very large number}} of detector rows, such that the z-axis coverage is comparable to the xy-axis coverage are often termed cone beam CT, due to the shape of the X-ray beam (strictly, the beam is pyramidal in shape, rather than conical).|$|R
30|$|Since {{the first}} {{introduction}} of CT in 1979, three-dimensional CT (3 D CT) {{became a major}} imaging tool for craniofacial evaluation and treatment planning. Even though 3 D CT needs high-dose radiation and expensive cost, it can allow us to observe the craniofacial structure at the various perspectives and to analyze 3 D length and angle more precisely than two-dimensional cephalometric radiography does [18, 19]. Furthermore, there are no image distortions, and the deep structures can be directly observed by controlling images. Nowadays, 3 D imaging software for CT can be easily accessed with the personal computer environment [17], and the development of high-quality <b>CT</b> <b>machine</b> such as the multi-detector CT and the cone-beam CT make it possible to acquire thin sliced CT image (being less than 0.5  mm) and to reduce radiation dose with the special low-dose protocols. Therefore, the 3 D CT is expected to be more popular for craniofacial imaging in the future [15].|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe rapid {{development}} in the technology has dramatic impact on the medical health care field. Medical data base obtained with latest machines like <b>CT</b> <b>Machine,</b> MRI scanner requires large amount of memory storage and also it requires large bandwidth for transmission of data in telemedicine applications. Thus there is need for video compression. As the database of medical images contain number of frames (slices), hence while coding of these images there is need of motion estimation. Motion estimation finds out movement of objects in an image sequence and gets motion vectors which represents estimated motion of object in the frame. In order to reduce temporal redundancy between successive frames of video sequence, motion compensation is preformed. In this paper three step search (TSS) block matching algorithm is implemented on different types of video sequences. It is shown that three step search algorithm produces better quality performance and less computational time compared with exhaustive full search algorithm...|$|E

PURPOSE: The {{aim was to}} evaluate the quality of coronary stent lumen delineation with CT using a detector with integrated electronics. METHODS: Twelve coronary stents placed in plastic tubes and filled with contrast agent (CT number 250 HU) were imaged with either a 128 -section dual-source <b>CT</b> <b>machine</b> equipped with conventional detector or with integrated electronics. On both scanners, images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (slice thickness 0. 6 mm; increment 0. 4 mm) and sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (slice thickness 0. 6 mm; increment 0. 4 mm), and with iterative reconstruction (slice thickness 0. 5 mm; increment 0. 3 mm) on the integrated scanner. Two blinded, independent readers assessed image quality, noise, in-stent diameter, in-stent attenuation, and image sharpness by using signal intensity profiles across stents.

50|$|In {{conventional}} <b>CT</b> <b>machines,</b> an X-ray {{tube and}} detector are physically rotated behind a circular shroud (see the image above right). An alternative, short lived design, known as electron beam tomography (EBT), used electromagnetic deflection of an electron beam {{within a very}} large conical X-ray tube and a stationary array of detectors to achieve very high temporal resolution, for imaging of rapidly moving structures, for example the coronary arteries. Cone-beam CT functionality is also an increasingly common function found in medical fluoroscopy equipment; by rotating the fluoroscope around the patient, a geometry similar to CT can be obtained, and by treating the 2D X-ray detector {{in a manner similar}} to a CT detector with a massive number of rows, it is possible to reconstruct a 3D volume from a single rotation using suitable software.|$|R
30|$|The {{sample in}} the present study showed almost a similar bone density value pattern in the maxilla and {{mandible}} as observed by Park et al [14] in a Korean population, except that they found the highest bone density in the canine premolar region of the maxilla. In general, bone density values were found to be higher in an Indian population than in a Korean population [14, 15]. Differences in metabolic or lifestyle factors account for a larger share of the racial differences in bone mass. Lifestyle factors such as dietary calcium intake, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake have been found to influence bone density [16]. Another reason which could be possible for the variation in the observed bone mineral density values is the difference in methodological approach {{such as the use of}} different slice thickness, software, <b>CT</b> <b>machines,</b> etc. [17].|$|R
