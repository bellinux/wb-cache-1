In particular, the cubic boron nitride phase has extreme hardness, <b>chemical</b> inertness, high <b>resistivity,</b> thermal conductivity and transparency and resistance to oxidation up to 1600 °C. The conventional methods of synthesis use highly toxic and inflammable source materials at high deposition temperature. A hot filament activated PACVD technique was developed to deposit BN films under a wide range of conditions. The source material was borane-ammonia (BH 3 -NH 3) which is a non-toxic crystalline solid, free of carbon and oxygen. Using this technique, mixed-phase boron nitride (BN) films, containing crystallites of the cubic phase embedded in a hexagonal matrix, were deposited at a substrate temperature of 350 °C. These films showed good thermal and chemical stability with smooth surface topography. A good correlation was obtained between the properties of the films and plasma diagnostics. With increasing rf power, the ratio of cubic to hexagonal phase, determined by infra-red spectra, was increased with a shift towards lower wave number. In the growing and phase stabilization of the cubic phase, ion bombardment {{plays an important role in}} forming the sp 3 -microstructure of BN films. The ion-density and thus ion flux to the more negatively biased substrate was increased with rf power corresponding to an increase o f N 2 + species in the plasma, determined by OES. This increased ionbombardment contributed in increasing the volume fraction of cubic phase in the film. For a specific substrate and filament temperature, if the deposition conditions are measured in terms of ion-bombardment, a sharp threshold value exists where the phase of the films changes from being hexagonal to being cubic. At a substrate temperature o f 350 °C, this threshold value was found to be 160 W of rf power. A substrate temperature o f 300 °C was necessary for enhancing the growth of cubic phase. The shift towards lower wave number at higher power was considered to be a transition to the cubic phase from the wurtzite phase of BN which grows under less highly activated conditions.

40|$|Dye Sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) are a {{promising}} candidate for next generation photovoltaic panels {{due to their}} low cost, easy fabrication process, and relative high efficiency. Despite considerable effort on the advancement of DSSCs, the efficiency has been stalled {{for nearly a decade}} due to the complex interplay among various DSSC components. DSSCs consist of a photoanode on a conducting substrate, infiltrated dye for light absorption and electron injection, and an electrolyte to regenerate the dye. On the photoanode is a high band-gap semiconducting material, primarily of a nanostructure morphology of titanium (II) dioxide (TiO 2), dye molecules whose molar absorption is typically in the visible spectrum, are adsorbed onto the surface of TiO 2. To improve the current DSSCs, there are many parameters that can be investigated. In a conventional DSSC, a thick semiconducting layer such as the nanoparticle TiO 2 layer induces charge separation efficiently while concurrently increasing the charge transport distance, leading the cell to suffer from more charge recombination and deterioration in charge collection efficiency. To improve on this limitation, TiO 2 nanowires (NW) and nanotubes (NT) are explored to replace the nanoparticle photoanode. One-dimensional nanostructures are known for the excellent electron transport properties as well as maintaining a relatively high surface area. Hence one of the focuses of this thesis explores at using different morphologies and composition of TiO 2 nanostructures to enhance electron collection efficiency. Another challenge in conventional DSSCs is the limit in light absorption of solar irradiation. Dyes are limited to absorption only in the visible range, and have a low molar absorption coefficient in the near infrared (NIR). Tuning dyes is extremely complicated and may have more disadvantages than simply by extending light harvesting. Therefore our strategy is to incorporate quantum dots to replace the dye, as well as prepare a cell for the possibility of co-sensitization, thereby extending the absorption of light in the visible and NIR. The first phase of the thesis involves the synthesis and characterization of the materials used for the cell. We successfully synthesized TiO 2 nanowires and nanotubes and characterized them for the use as the photoanode. Both one-dimensional structures proved to have low <b>resistivity,</b> <b>chemical</b> stability, and high density. We also synthesized lead (II) sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) and explored at modifying theirdiameter in order to properly control their light harvesting potential into the NIR region. The electron transport kinetics proved to be faster in one-dimensional nanostructure due to their high crystallinity order and reduced elastic scattering of the electrons during transport. Furthermore, quantum dots were synthesized such that their band-gap allowed for the absorption of NIR light.

TaN 박막은 4. 5 ~ 4. 6 eV정도의 일함수 값으로 보고되고 있으며, 이를 반도체 소자에서 요구하는 일함수 값으로 조절하기 위해서 박막 내 란탄계 원소 등을 함입시키거나 금속탄화 결합(TaC, graphite) 을 형성시키는 방법이 연구되고 있다. 이들 공정 중에서 TaN 박막 내 금속탄화 결합을 형성시키는 공정이 란탄계 원소를 함입시키는 공정보다 용이하기 때문에 본 연구에서는 TaCxNy 박막 내 조성에 따른 박막의 물성 및 박막증착공정에 대해서 평가하였다. 박막증착공정으로 높은 증착속도를 가지는 화학기상증착공정(CVD, Chemical vapor deposition) 을 수행하였다. Ta 전구체로 가장 많이 사용하고 있는 tert-butylimido tris-diethylamido tantalum(TBTDET) 전구체와 다양한 반응기체(Ar, H 2, NH 3, C 2 H 4) 를 이용하여 TaCxNy 박막을 증착하고, 증착온도에 따른 TaCxNy 박막의 조성, 화학결합, 비저항, 일함수 등의 변화를 확인하였으며, TBTDET 전구체의 열분해 거동 및 화학기상증착공정에서 일어나는 화학반응을 실시간 진단공정을 개발하여 평가하였다. 380 ˚C 이하에서 증착온도가 증가함에 따라 TaCxNy 박막의 증착속도는 약 10 Å/min까지 증가하였다. 이와 같이 증착속도가 증가하는 이유는 표면에서의 반응속도가 증가하기 때문이다. 표면에서 TBTDET 전구체가 분해되는 활성화에너지 (activation energy) 가 약 56. 8 kcal/mol로 나타났다. 380 ˚C 이상에서 TaCxNy 박막의 증착속도는 증착온도에 관계없이 거의 일정한 속도를 나타내었다. 이 같은 현상은 물질전달속도가 표면반응속도보다 느리기 때문에 나타난다. 즉, TBTDET 전구체의 물질전달속도에 따라 박막의 증착속도가 결정된다. TBTDET 전구체의 물질전달속도는 주입되는 전구체의 속도에 따라 결정되고, 주입되는 전구체의 속도는 버블러(bubbler) 의 온도에 의해 결정된다. 위 공정에서 얻은 증착속도는 유사한 조건의 원자층 기상증착공정(ALD, Atomic layer deposition) 에 비해서 10 여 배 이상 빠른 속도이다. 화학기상증착공정으로 증착한 TaCxNy 박막은 TaC, graphite, TaN, Ta 3 N 5, Ta 2 O 5 같은 여러 화학결합상으로 이루어져 있다. 이들 화학결합상의 비율은 증착온도에 영향을 받았다. 증착온도가 증가함에 따라 TaCxNy 박막 내 존재하는 TaN 상은 증가하였으나 Ta 3 N 5 상은 감소하였다. 이 같은 현상은 TaN 상이 Ta 3 N 5 상보다 고온에서 열역학적으로 선호되는 상이기 때문이다. 또한, TaC, graphite, Ta 2 O 5 상들은 증착온도가 증가할수록 감소하였다. 특히, Ta 2 O 5 상은 TaCxNy 박막이 증착된 후 공기 중에서 유입되는 산소에 의해서 형성되는 결합으로 보고되고 있으며, 증착온도가 증가할수록 TaCxNy 박막의 밀도가 증가하여 공기 중 산소 유입이 억제되기 때문에 감소하였다. 600 ˚C에서 증착한 TaCxNy 박막은 TaN 상의 비율이 매우 높게 나타났으며, 이로 인하여 TaCxNy 박막의 결정성이 TaN 상의 (111) 또는 (200) 방향으로 나타난다. 위의 결과들로부터 증착온도가 TaCxNy 박막의 물성 및 증착속도에 영향을 주는 것을 알 수 있다. 증착온도에 따라 TaCxNy 박막의 비저항 및 일함수도 영향을 받는다. 증착온도가 증가함에 따라 TaCxNy 박막의 비저항이 3. 6 × 103 μΩ&# 8226 cm까지 감소하였다. 이 같은 현상은 TaCxNy 박막 내 전도성 결합인 TaN 상이 증가하고, 절연성 결합인 Ta 3 N 5 상과 Ta 2 O 5 상이 감소하였기 때문이다. 또한, TaCxNy 박막의 일함수는 4. 25 ~ 4. 50 eV 사이로 변화하였다. 4. 5 ~ 4. 6 eV의 일함수를 가지는 TaN 상이 많은 TaCxNy 박막에 약 4. 3 eV의 일함수를 가지는 TaC 상이 유입될수록 TaCxNy 박막의 일함수를 감소하였다. 이와 같은 전기적 특성의 변화는 TaCxNy 박막 내 화학결합 비율이 영향을 줄 수 있음을 알 수 있었다. 즉, TaCxNy 박막의 비저항 및 일함수 값은 박막 내 존재하는 탄화물상과 질화물상에 따라 조절할 수 있었다. 앞에서 연구한 화학기상증착공정은 TBTDET 전구체의 열적 거동에 따라 나타나는 것이다. 이에 화학기상증착공정에서 일어나는 화학반응을 실시간 진단장비를 이용하여 평가하였다. FT-IR을 이용하여 기상과 표면에서 온도에 따라 일어나는 TBTDET 전구체의 화학반응을 관찰하였으며, 화학반응에 의해서 생성되는 부산물 등에 대해서 잔류기체분석으로 확인할 수 있었다. 350 ˚C부터 표면에 흡착된 TBTDET 전구체의 화학종의 분해가 진행되었다. 이 같은 현상은 350 ˚C 이상에서 주입되는 TBTDET 전구체가 표면에 흡착하여 안정하게 존재하는 것이 아니라 열분해 반응을 일으키면서 TaCxNy 박막을 증착되는 것을 의미한다. 열분해 반응시 발생하는 부산물을 잔류기체분석방법으로 확인하였다. 이 때 발생하는 기체들은 isobutylene, ethylene, methane 등의 기체로 TBTDET 전구체 내에 존재하는 리간드 그룹에서 수소제거(hydrogen elimination) 반응에 의해서 생성될 수 있다. 이로 인하여 증착온도에 따라 TaCxNy 박막 내 화학결합 비율이 변화함을 알 수 있었다. 여러 반응기체를 이용하여 TaC¬xNy 박막 내 화학결합 비율을 조절하고자 하였다. 수소기체를 이용하여 수소제거반응이 시작되는 온도를 50 ˚C정도 높힐 수 있었으며, TaCxNy 박막 내 존재하는 TaNx 상에는 큰 영향을 주지 않았으나 TaC 상의 형성을 억제하였다. 암모니아기체를 이용할 경우, TaCxNy 박막 내 TaC 상의 형성을 억제함과 동시에 Ta 3 N 5 상의 비율이 증가하여 비저항이 증가하였다. 에틸렌(C 2 H 4) 기체를 이용할 경우, TaCxNy 박막 내 TaNx 상에는 큰 영향을 주지 않았으나 TaC 상의 비율을 증가시켜 일함수를 감소시킬 수 있었다. 즉, 수소 및 암모니아 기체는 TaC 상의 형성을 억제하였으나, 에틸렌 기체는 TaC 상의 형성을 향상시켰다. 반면, TaNx 상에 영향을 주는 것은 암모니아 기체로 Ta 3 N 5 결합 비율을 증가시켜 TaCxNy 박막의 비저항 특성을 저하하는 결과를 나타내었다. 본 연구로부터 개발된 TaCxNy 박막의 화학기상증착공정은 비저항이 낮고, 일함수 조절이 용이하고, 증착속도가 빠르고, 공정이 단순하고, 기존 실리콘공정과의 적합성이 우수하여 차세대 게이트 전극 공정으로 활용할 수 있다. 또한, 전구체의 거동을 확인할 수 있는 진단방법을 개발함으로써 금속유기전구체 개발 연구에도 기여할 수 있을 것으로 기대한다. During {{the last}} few decades, poly silicon has been widely used as a gate {{electrode}} in the metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) applications. In the sub- 50 nm regime, the poly silicon electrode shows several problems such as gate depletion, high gate resistance, high gate tunneling leakage current, and boron penetration into the channel region. Tantalum nitride (TaN) film is the most promising candidate due to its low resistivity and excellent thermal stability. The carbon incorporation in the TaN film using plasma treatment {{can be used to}} modify the work function. The TaN films have been mostly deposited with atomic layer deposition (ALD) for Cu diffusion barrier. However, the growth rate of the TaN film deposited with ALD is much lower than 1 nm/cycle. In this thesis, we studied the tantalum carbo-nitride (TaCxNy) films deposited with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique using tert-butylimido tris-diethylamido tantalum (TBTDET) and various gases (Ar, H 2, NH 3, and C 2 H 4). TaCxNy film deposited with CVD was studied {{as a function of the}} deposition temperature, and the film properties (film composition, <b>chemical</b> bond, <b>resistivity,</b> and work function) were evaluated. The TaCxNy films were deposited with CVD using TBTDET and argon gas between 350 ˚C and 600 ˚C. Below 380 ˚C, when the deposition temperature was increased, the growth rate was increased up to 10 Å/min. The growth rate was increased because the surface reaction rate was increased and the activation energy was about 56. 8 kcal/mol. Above 380 ˚C, the growth rate of the film was almost independent of the deposition temperature. In this region, the growth rate was determined by the mass transfer rate of the TBTDET precursor. Also, the thickness of the TaCxNy film deposited with CVD during 1 hour was 65. 6 nm, whereas the thickness of TaCxNy film deposited with thermal ALD using TBTDET and H 2 during 400 cycle (5 hour) was about 24 nm. The growth rate in the CVD process is about 12. 5 ~ 13. 7 times higher than that in the ALD process. The TaCxNy film was composed of the various phases such as TaC, graphite, TaN, Ta 3 N 5, and Ta 2 O 5. The phase composition in the TaCxNy film was dependent on the deposition temperature. When the deposition temperature was increased, the TaC, graphite (C-C), and Ta 3 N 5 phases in the TaCxNy film were decreased whereas the TaN phase was increased. The TaN phase is thermodynamically more favorable in high temperature over the Ta 3 N 5 phase. The Ta 2 O 5 phase in the film from the air after deposition was decreased due to the increase in the film density. At 600 ˚C, the TaCxNy film was the TaN dominant film and showed the polycrystalline (111) /(200) TaN cubic structure. The TaCxNy film properties such as composition, phase composition, density, and crystallinity were dependent on the deposition temperature. With the increase in the deposition temperature, the conductivity and work function of the TaCxNy film were increased due to the change in the phase composition of the TaCxNy film. The resistivity of the TaCxNy film was decreased until 3. 6 × 103 μΩ&# 8226 cm due to the increase of the TaN phase and the suppression of the oxygen uptake in the TaCxNy film. The work function of the TaCxNy film was changed due to the carbon incorporation in the TaCxNy film. With the increase of the TaC phase in the TaCxNy film with n-channel MOS work function (~ 4. 3 eV), the work function of the TaCxNy film was decreased to 4. 25 ± 0. 05 eV. The phase composition in the TaCxNy film affected the electrical properties such as resistivity and work function. The decomposition behavior of the TBTDET precursor was observed to understand the chemical reaction in the TaCxNy CVD process using in-situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and in-situ quadrupole mass spectroscopy (QMS). Above 350 ˚C, in the surface FT-IR results, the chemisorbed species of TBTDET on the surface began to dissociate and the TaCxNy film was deposited with the CVD mode. QMS was used to monitor the chemical species formed in the CVD process. The mass signals of chemical species such as isobutylene, ethylene, methane, and hydrogen from the dissociation of the TBTDET precursor or the hydrogen elimination reaction were observed during the TBTDET dose step. The isobutylene, ethylene, and methane were the reaction products from the hydrogen elimination of the tbutylimido ligand and the diethylamido ligand in TBTDET. Also, above 500 ˚C, the dissociation of the TBTDET precursor in the gas phase was observed and the FT-IR peaks associated with ethylene appeared around 3200 - 2800 cm- 1 and 990 - 930 cm- 1. TaC phase in the TaCxNy film was decreased due to the dissociation of TBTDET and the desorption of the hydrocarbon species on the surface. The various reactive gases such as H 2, NH 3, and C 2 H 4 were used to control the phase composition in the TaCxNy film deposited with CVD and the electrical properties (resistivity and work function) of the TaCxNy film were evaluated. Compared with Ar atmosphere, TaNx phase in the TaCxNy film deposited with H 2 and C 2 H 4 were not significantly changed, whereas TaNx phase was increased with NH 3. So, the resistivity of the TaCxNy film deposited with NH 3 was increased due to the increase of the Ta 3 N 5 phase. Also, TaC phase in the TaCxNy film was suppressed with H 2 and NH 3, whereas TaC phase was increased with C 2 H 4. So, the work function of the TaCxNy film deposited with C 2 H 4 was decreased to 4. 29 ± 0. 05 eV due to the increase of the TaC phase in the TaCxNy film. For the n-channel MOSFET gate electrode, the TaC phase in the TaCxNy film was controlled by the deposition condition such as deposition temperature and reactive gas...|$|R
40|$|Five {{different}} types of acid anhydrides such as succinic anhydride (SA), maleic anhydride (MA), phthalic anhydride (PA), 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (TPA) and cis- 1, 2 -cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride (CDA) were used to prepare various polyalkyd resins from palm oil by following alcoholysis and esterification reaction. Palm oil was subjected to dehydration process using concentrated sulphuric acid prior to alcoholysis to improve the unsaturation in the fatty acid chains. Various physicochemical properties of the resins such as acid value, iodine value, yield, density, specific gravity, molecular weight, non-volatile material content, drying time, colour, solubility, etc., were tested by using standard methods. The resins were cured by using methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP), styrene and cobalt naphthenate at 120 °C. To enhance the thermal, structural and other resinous properties, 0. 5 wt% of montmorillonite nanoclays (MNCs) was dispersed in TPA-based resin. The cured films were tested for X-ray diffraction, surface morphology, tensile properties, pencil hardness, gloss, gel content, swelling ratio, adhesion, thermogravimetric analysis, and <b>chemical</b> <b>resistivity.</b> In addition, hydrophobicity of the cured films was observed by contact angle measurement. A comparison was drawn among the resins {{as well as the}} films prepared from different acid anhydrides. Analysis revealed that TPA-based resin/film shows improved characteristics among the others due to high degree of crosslinking. On the other hand, incorporation of MNCs into the polyalkyds led to higher thermal properties, acceptable pencil hardness and reduced wettability, which may suit this film to be applied for high-performance surface coating applications...|$|E
