40|$|Zoomable user {{interfaces}} are more attractive because they offer {{the possibility to}} present information and to support actions according to a "focus+context" method: while a context of use is preserved or presented in a more compact way, the focus can be achieved on {{some part of the}} information and actions, enabling the end user to focus on one part at a time. While this interaction technique can be straightforwardly applied for manipulating objects of the same type (e. g., cells in a spreadsheet or appointments in a calendar), it is less obvious how to present interactive tasks of an information system where tasks may involve very different amount and types of information and actions. For this purpose, this paper introduces a metric based on a task model in order to decide what portion of a task model should lead to a particular user interface <b>container,</b> <b>group,</b> or fragment, while preserving the task structure. Each branch of the task model is assigned to a weight that will lead to such a <b>container,</b> <b>group,</b> or fragment depending on parameters computed on variables belonging to the context of use. In this way, not only the task structure is preserved, but also the decomposition of the user interface into elements depends on the context of use, particularly the constraints imposed by the computing platform.

The axial compression pump is used to simulate overburden pressure and the micro back-pressure booster pump is manually operated to control the fluid pressure.

Precision displacement sensors {{at both ends of}} the core holder (with an accuracy of 0.001  mm) record compaction displacements. The intermediate <b>container</b> <b>group</b> is used to contain the fluid required for the experiment. The CCCV pump provides the displacement pressure to displace fluid and pore water toward the fluid-receiving scale at a constant flow rate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present phase IV {{multicentre}} trial was to evaluate general patient tolerance to Omnipaque(R) 350 mgI/ml (iohexol) supplied in polypropylene containers compared to that of the same product supplied in routinely used glass vials, with emphasis on allergy-like adverse events. Polypropylene is a pure plastic material with practically no additives, and has been tested in vitro as a contrast medium packaging material for several years. Handling of these containers is easier and safer than handling of glass vials. Iohexol was administered to 1481 patients undergoing urography (741 patients in the glass vial group, 740 in the polypropylene <b>container</b> <b>group),</b> all of whom successfully participated in the trial. Six centres, representing four European countries, participated. Patients were randomized to receive iohexol from either polypropylene containers or traditional glass vials according to a double blind, parallel design, Pre-established inclusion and pre-admission exclusion criteria were followed, as web as routine procedures for preparation of the patients and conduct of the urography examinations at each hospital. Patient tolerance was assessed by recording all adverse events experienced over a period of up to 1 h after the procedure, Allergy-like events were defined as coughing, sneezing, nausea, vomiting, urticaria or itching. No adverse events were experienced by 56. 5 % of the patients in the glass vial group, nor by 58. 0 % of those in the polypropylene group. Discomfort (mainly a sensation of warmth) was reported by 39. 4 % and 38. 6 % of the patients, and ad,adverse events other than discomfort by 7. 4 % and 5. 9 % of the patients, respectively. There seemed to be a correlation between the speed of injection and the frequency of discomfort (an increase with increasing speed), both of which varied a lot between centres. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of allergy-like events between the two groups, Such reactions were seen in 2. 0 % of patients in the glass vial group and 1. 9 % of those in the polypropylene <b>container</b> <b>group</b> There was no significant difference between the patients' tolerance to iohexol supplied in traditional glass vials or in polypropylene containers. Therefore, the new polypropylene container can be recommended as a container for Iohexol...|$|E

40|$|Background: Electronic {{monitoring}} {{is recommended}} for accurate measurement of medication adherence but a possible limitation {{is that it may}} influence adherence. Purpose: To test the reactive effect of electronic monitoring in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: A total of 226 adults with type 2 diabetes and HbA 1 c ≥ 58  mmol/mol were randomized to receiving their main oral glucose lowering medication in electronic containers or standard packaging. The primary outcomes were self-reported adherence measured with the MARS (Medication Adherence Report Scale; range 5 - 25) and HbA 1 c at 8  weeks. Results: Non-significantly higher adherence and lower HbA 1 c were observed in the electronic <b>container</b> <b>group</b> (differences in means, adjusting for baseline value: MARS, 0. 4 [95  % CI - 0. 1 to 0. 8, p = 0. 11]; HbA 1 c (mmol/mol), - 1. 02 [- 2. 73 to 0. 71, p = 0. 25]).

40|$|Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), {{characterized}} by heartburn and acid regurgitation, {{is one of}} the most common gastrointestinal diseases general practitioners encounter. GORD is effectively treated with acid suppressive medication (ASM), of which proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are most commonly used. Due to high therapy satisfaction and minor side-effects, initial short-term treatment with PPIs often evolves in long-term treatment, resulting in many GORD patients chronically using ASM without evidence-based indication. Dosage reduction is promoted for budgetary reasons and to prevent unnecessary use and adverse side-effects of long-term acid suppression. Since 2000, ‘on-demand’ treatment with PPIs has been shown to be effective and safe for GORD treatment; patients only take medication when they experience symptoms, and terminate treatment once symptoms are controlled satisfactorily. Our study investigated whether long-term treated GORD patients can reduce their ASM dosage, how a dosage reduction affects symptom control and quality of life, and whether a successful transfer to on-demand treatment after long-term treatment can be predicted using patient characteristics. Primary care GORD patients chronically using ASM, without evidence-based indication for this use were investigated. The minimal effective dosage was determined in a blinded way with minimal interference by placebo-effects: Patients received two containers, one for daily use and one with rescue tablets. They were instructed to use one tablet per day from the daily container and in case of inadequate symptom control one from the rescue <b>container.</b> <b>Group</b> 1 had placebo in the daily container and PPI as rescue; these patients blindly adjusted their PPI dosage. Group 2 had a PPI in the daily container and placebo ‘rescue’. Characterization of included patients: 1. A high prevalence of overweight, furthermore overweight increases the prevalence and severity of residual symptoms under ASM treatment. 2. Infection with Helicobacter pylori reduces the PPI dosage needed for symptom control. 3. GORD patients on ASM display a population-average psychological state. However, based on the adequacy of symptom control, this apparently heterogenic group can be divided into a psychologically distressed and mentally healthy subgroup. The trial showed that dosage reduction is very well possible among chronic users of ASM; 19 % of patients terminated treatment, 33 % reduced their dosage to 2 - 6 tablets/week, and 48 % sustained their daily dosage. The vast majority of patients did not report decreases in symptom control and quality of life during dosage adjustment; 24 % expressed a temporal decrease. Therefore, long-term daily treatment of GORD can be switched to an on-demand regime. For physicians it would be useful to be able to predict which patients are eligible for dosage reduction. To this aid we compared patients reducing their dosage with those who did not. No clinically useful combination of patient characteristics was able to adequately predict eligibility for dosage reduction. Successful transfer of patients to an on-demand regime remains a process of trial and error, in which motivation of the patient and support by the physician will be important factors for success...|$|E
