2500|$|The fuel is {{fluidized}} in {{oxygen and}} steam or air. The ash is removed dry or as heavy agglomerates that defluidize. The temperatures are relatively low in dry ash gasifiers, so the fuel must be highly reactive; low-grade coals are particularly suitable. The agglomerating gasifiers have slightly higher temperatures, and {{are suitable for}} higher rank <b>coals.</b> Fuel <b>throughput</b> is higher than for the fixed bed, but {{not as high as}} for the entrained flow gasifier. The conversion efficiency can be rather low due to elutriation of carbonaceous material. [...] Recycle or subsequent combustion of solids can be used to increase conversion. Fluidized bed gasifiers are most useful for fuels that form highly corrosive ash that would damage the walls of slagging gasifiers. Biomass fuels generally contain high levels of corrosive ash.|$|R

Vehicle <b>throughput</b> increased seventeenfold in a mere decade. The late 1990s also saw the upgrade of livestock operations. Although growth in container freight continued, it only increased by twenty percent over the decade, which for the most part was a consequence of the unstable political and economic situation experienced in many of the hinterland states during the early 1990s.|$|R

40|$|The techno-economic {{aspects of}} coal drying with cost {{effective}} {{waste heat recovery}} mechanism {{is one of the}} challenging issues faced while using lignite or high ash brown coal for direct combustion in coal fired thermal power plant. Coal being hygroscopic in nature, re-adsorbs considerable moisture even after conventional drying post wet coal washing condition affecting boiler performance.

In this paper the impact of coal moisture on useful heat value for PC fired steam generation is evaluated for some typical steam coals so that related change in direct firing <b>coal</b> <b>throughput</b> can be estimated for application of suitable online coal drying mechanism.

40|$|Coal {{handling}} is {{a complex}} process involving different correlated and highly dependent operations such as selecting appropriate product types, planning stockpiles, scheduling stacking and reclaiming activities and managing train loads. Planning these operations manually is time consuming and can result in non-optimized schedules as future impact of decisions may not be appropriately considered. This paper addresses the operational scheduling of the continuous coal handling problem with multiple conflicting objectives. As the problem is NP-hard in nature, an effective heuristic is presented for planning stockpiles and scheduling resources to minimize delays in production and the coal age in the stockyard. A model of stockyard operations within a coal mine is described {{and the problem is}} formulated as a Bi- Objective Optimization Problem (BOOP). The algorithm efficacy is demonstrated on different real-life data scenarios. Computational results show that the solution algorithm is effective and the <b>coal</b> <b>throughput</b> is substantially impacted by the conflicting objectives. Together, the model and the proposed heuristic, can act as a decision support system for the stockyard planner to explore the effects of alternative decisions, such as balancing age and volume of stockpiles, and minimizing conflicts due to stacker and reclaimer movements...|$|E
40|$|Four {{different}} coals were investigated: two sub-bituminous, one bituminous and lignite, {{which were}} processed in the temperature range 750 - 950 Â Â°C. The heat for pyrolysis was generated by partial gasification of the char produced. Air {{was used as}} the gasifying medium with amounts of 0. 6 - 1. 5 m 3 /kg of coal, depending on the required gasification-temperature. Two sequential phenomena were taken into account: char gasification and coal devolatilisation in respect of temperature. The experimental data on carbon dioxide and monoxide concentrations in a LCV gas produced were used for the correlation of Boudouard's equilibrium and the data on carbon burn-off and final volatile matter content in char were used for the solid-products yield. The equations for the quasi-equilibrium state were developed and calculated values were compared with the measurements. The model takes into account the equations developed and the total energy-balance assuming the heat losses of the experimental system. The investigated <b>coal</b> <b>throughput</b> amounted to 200 - 300 kg/h depending on the coal properties.

The following paper presents and analyses methods of monitoring the key performance factors of a vertical spindle mill that is suited for implementation on older power stations, i. e. the quantity (mass flow rate) and quality (particle fineness) of the pulverised fuel produced by the mill. It is shown herein that the mill throughput can be monitored on-line using a simple mill energy balance that successfully predicts the <b>coal</b> <b>throughput</b> within 2. 33 % as compared to a calibrated coal feeder. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the coal moisture is a critical measurement for this method to be adopted as an on-line mass flow monitoring tool.

40|$|Today, coal {{supplies}} over 55 % {{of the electricity}} consumed in the United States {{and will continue to}} do so well into the next century. One of the technologies being developed for advanced electric power generation is an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) system that converts coal to a combustible gas, cleans the gas of pollutants, and combusts the gas in a gas turbine to generate electricity. The hot exhaust from the gas turbine is used to produce steam to generate more electricity from a steam turbine cycle. The utilization of advanced hot-gas particulate and sulfur control technologies together with the combined power generation cycles make IGCC one of the cleanest and most efficient ways available to generate electric power from coal. One of the strategic objectives for U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) IGCC research and development program is to develop and demonstrate advanced gasifiers and second-generation IGCC systems. Another objective is to develop advanced hot-gas cleanup and trace contaminant control technologies. One of the more recent gasification concepts to be investigated is that of the transport reactor gasifier, which functions as a circulating fluid-bed gasifier while operating in the pneumatic transport regime of solid particle flow. This gasifier concept provides excellent solid-gas contacting of relatively small particles to promote high gasification rates and also provides the highest <b>coal</b> <b>throughput</b> per unit cross-sectional area of any other gasifier, thereby reducing capital cost of the gasification island...|$|E
40|$|Coal is Australia's leading export {{valued at}} close to A$ 50 billion and {{representing}} more than 20 % of Australia's commodity exports in 2008 (Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). The Port of Newcastle {{is home to the}} world's largest coal export operation. In 2008, it achieved a throughput of around 92 million tonnes, or more than 10 per cent of the world's total trade in coal for that year. That throughput is expected to double in the next decade. Several coal terminals operate at the Port of Newcastle. Crucial to achieving a high <b>coal</b> <b>throughput</b> is effective management of the stockyards at these terminals. The stockyard, where cargoes of (typically blended) coal product are assembled in stockpiles using stacking machines, and then reclaimed using bucket wheel reclaimers, is a pivotal component of a coal export chain. In this paper, a model of stockyard operations within a coal export supply chain, with make-to-order cargo assembly, is described. Stockpiles are assembled from coal delivered by trains from load points at mines. For a given stockpile, it is known in advance how much coal must be delivered from each load point to completely assemble the stockpile. Trains arrive at a dump station and dump the coal onto a conveyor which transports it to a stacker which in turn assembles the stockpile on the yard. Once the stockpile is completely assembled (a process that usually takes several days), it is removed from the stockyard via a reclaimer and loaded onto a vessel (a process that usually takes around half a day to complete). A stockpile often remains in the stockyard for some time (several days) before its intended vessel arrives at the berth and it can be loaded. The system is constrained in a number of ways. There are limited berths available for vessels to be loaded. The departure of larger vessels may be restricted to high tide. Load point capacity at the mines, {{in terms of the number}} of trains as well as the volume that can be handled per day, is limited. Stockyard space is often at a premium, and dumping, stacking, and reclaiming capacity per day is limited too. All these constraining factors need to be taken into account when managing the sequencing and loading of vessels, and the management of the stockyard. The model developed represents decisions and constraints typically applied at a planning stage of about 4 to 6 weeks in advance. The key decisions are where on the stockyard to place each stockpile for a vessel, when to start building the stockpile, when to bring the vessel to berth, and when to start reclaiming and loading each stockpile for the vessel. An approximate railing plan for transporting coal from mine load points to the stockyard is also required, largely as a check on load point and rail capacity limits. The model considers the stockyard itself and the outbound handling in some detail, with timing at the hourly level, but approximates in-bound capacity constraints more coarsely, at the daily level. We give a solution approach, simulating stockpile placement and scheduling decisions in a greedy fashion, with the goal of minimizing vessel sailing delays, and maximizing throughput of the system. Since a greedy approach is unlikely to yield the most efficient schedules, a variant of the algorithm is developed in which the vessel scheduling order is randomized, and the resulting performance analysed computationally. The resulting model and algorithm together can be viewed as a prototype decision support system for the stockyard planner. However, it can also be used as a simulation tool, to explore the effects of alternative stockyard management strategies. Such strategies, may, for example, reserve some areas of the stockyard for fast-moving, and some for slow-moving, cargo, with the aim of balancing load across the stacking and reclaiming equipment. One such strategy is implemented in the model, and compared with the simple greedy approach. Computational results of this study are reported. Our research shows that <b>coal</b> <b>throughput</b> can be substantially impacted by the stockyard management strategy employed...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{clean coal}} technologies, e. g. power {{generation}} from integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and {{pressurised fluidised bed}} combustor, have attracted increased interest from the scientific and technological communities {{over the last few}} decades. Pressures up to 40 atm have been applied to these technologies, which inherently result in an increase in <b>coal</b> <b>throughput,</b> a reduction in pollutant emissions and an enhancement in the intensity of reaction. Therefore, fundamental understanding of the effect of operating pressure on coal reactions is essential to the development of these technologies. In this paper, the pressure effect on a variety of aspects of coal reactions reported in the open literature has been reviewed. Major emphasis of the paper is given to experimental observations, although some theoretical modelling is reviewed. The pressure has been found to significantly influence the volatiles yield and coal swelling during devolatilisation, hence the structure and morphology of the char generated. More char particles of high porosity are formed at higher pressures. Char structure appears to {{play a significant role in}} burnout of residual char and ash formation. In general, at higher pressures, coal particles burn quicker and form finer ash particles. Increasing reactant pressure enhances char combustion and gasification reaction rate, which can be understood by an adsorption–desorption mechanism. These factors have been applied to the understanding of a practical high-pressure gasifier. Most of the work published has been at the lower temperatures (typically < 1000 °C), which can be achieved in experiments involving captive particles or coal samples. Experiments in pressurised TGA and wire mesh systems at these low temperatures are the most commonly reported, with some experiments for entrained flow system reported at the higher temperatures typical IGCC conditions in entrained flow reactors. Although the difficulty and cost have restricted these experiments, the entrained flow work is the current research need. The structure of the char generated has recently been related to char reactivity and the ash formed, but the mechanisms leading to the effect of pressure on this structure are not understood. Progressing the understanding of the formation of char structure at pressure and its relation to coal properties is an obvious research need...|$|E
40|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} {{of solid}} fuels, often {{performed in a}} mixture of oxygen and wet or dry recycled carbon dioxide, has gained significant interest {{in the last two decades}} as one of the leading carbon capture technologies in power generation. The new combustion characteristics in a high-O₂ environment raise challenges for furnace design and operation, and should be modeled appropriately in CFD simulation. Based on a comprehensive literature review of the state-of-the-art research on the fundamentals of oxy-coal combustion, sub-models for the critical physical processes, such as radiation and char combustion, have been properly modified for the O₂-rich environment, and the overall performance of CFD simulation on oxy-coal combustion has been validated using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches. The predicted distributions on velocity, species, and temperature were compared with experimental results from the literature in order to validate the CFD simulation. Results show that although agreeing reasonably with the measured mean axial and tangential velocity, all the RANS turbulence models used in this study underestimate the internal recirculation zone size and the turbulence mixing intensity in the char combustion zone, while LES improves the predictions of internal recirculation zone size, the entrainment of oxygen from the staging stream, and the overall flame length than the RANS approaches. Special attention was given to the CO₂'s chemical effects on CO formation in oxy-fuel combustion, and its modeling approaches in CFD simulations. Detailed reaction mechanism (GRI-Mech 3. 0) identifies that the reaction H+CO₂ [...] >/< [...] OH+CO enhances the CO formation in the fuel-rich side of the diffusion flame due to the high CO₂ concentration, leading to a significantly higher CO concentration. Reasonable CO predictions can only be obtained using finite-rate mechanisms combining with reaction mechanisms considering the above-mentioned reaction in CFD simulations. The validated CFD approach was used to investigate the pressure's effects in a pressurized oxy-coal combustion system. The results show that, given a fixed reactor geometry and burner velocity, the particle residence time does not change with operating pressure due to its small Stokes number; on the other hand, the coal conversion time decreases significantly because of the enhanced reaction rates at elevated pressures. Therefore, the burner can be operated at a higher burner velocity at elevated operating pressure, which results in a much higher <b>coal</b> <b>throughput</b> using the same reactor size. For instance, the thermal load can be increased from 3 MWth to 60 MWth using a pressurized oxy-coal reactor, when the operating pressure increases from 4 bar to 40 bar. In order to investigate the slag behaviors in the pressurized oxy-coal combustor, a first-of-its-kind three-dimensional slag model has been developed, which can be applied in slagging coal combustion/gasification with any geometry. The method couples Volume of Fluid (VOF) model and Discrete Phase Model (DPM), and fully resolves the slag's behaviors such as the slag layer buildup, multiphase flow, as well as heat transfer. The results are in good agreement with experimental observations, and can be taken as a design tool for coal furnace/gasifier development. by Lei Chen. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{electric}} power in India {{has been growing}} steeply {{during the past decade}} particularly in the rapid industrialising southern regions and power shortages are frequently experienced. In order to cope with this problem, several coal burning power stations will be constructed along the west coast of India. One of the projected sites for a power station is at Kayamkulam, supplied by coal from Talcher mines in the north east. The Central Electricity Authority established that the least coal transport costs from Talcher (Port of Paradip) to the coastal power stations is by means of sea transport. Different coal unloading locations have been put forward for consideration for the Kayamkulam powerplant. One of these locations is at the existing port of Cochin (110 km north of Kayamkulam). Furthermore several ways for transporting the coal from the coal unloading terminal at Cochin to the powerplant site have been considered : slurry pipe, rail and inland waterway transport. In the assessment of alternatives concerning the coal transport scenarios for the Kayamkulam powerplant it has been required to perform a more detailed assessment of the option by which coal will be unloaded at the existing port of Cochin and further transported by Inland Waterway Transport (IWT) to the Kayamkulam plant site. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess constraints and opportunities concerning the transportation of the projected <b>coal</b> <b>throughput</b> of 8. 06 million tons per year from the coal unloading terminal at Cochin to the projected powerstation at Kayamkulam by IWT using the existing West Coast Canal; and to select the most promising scenario for this transport system on basis of technical feasibility and costs. To meet the objective an inventory of the existing situation has been made and constraints and bottlenecks have been identified. Main constraints are the inadequate waterway dimensions and the restricted dimensions of the existing locks at Thanneermukkom and Trikkunnapuzha. It is concluded that the existing waterway is not suitable for the transportation of the required throughput of 8. 06 million tons per year. Improvement scenarios have been generated and it is concluded that feasibility of the transport scenario requires the deletion of the existing locks at Trikkunnapuzha from the system, the construction of new locks at Thanneermukkom and extensive capital dredging works. I Several options for the coal carrying vessels have been considered i. e. : -self propelled vessels, ranging from 600 to 2, 250 tons -push formations, ranging from 3, 500 to 11, 200 tons. These options have been analyzed with respect to the required -waterway improvements -Ioading- and unloading terminal -fleet composition Further, a distinction has been made between daytime only and dav and night navigation. Costs for each option have been determined in order to make a comparison between the options. Based on these analyses, the preferred option for the transportation of the required throughput of 8 mmtpa, is the use of self propelled IWT vessels having a payload of 2, 250 tons. The total coal transportation cost for the 8 mmtpa are estimated to be US$ 4. 0 per ton. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
