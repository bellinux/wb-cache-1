5|$|Electronic Logging Devices <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records {{the same information}} as a manual paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E
5|$|Nahuatl {{does not}} have {{grammatical}} case but uses what is sometimes called a relational noun to describe spatial (and other) relations. These morphemes cannot appear alone but must occur after a noun or a possessive prefix. They are also often called postpositions or locative suffixes. In some ways these locative constructions resemble and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> locative case constructions. Most modern dialects have incorporated prepositions from Spanish that are competing with or that have completely replaced relational nouns.|$|E

5|$|Venture kept to {{a steady}} {{bimonthly}} schedule for ten issues, but its circulation never reached a sustainable level, and it was canceled in mid-1958. The large number of competing magazines probably hurt sales, though {{since many of the}} competitors lasted for only one or two issues, Venture <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> at least a partial success. An anthology drawn from the magazine's fiction, No Limits, was published in 1964 by Ballantine Books, attributed to Joseph Ferman as editor.|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry {{groups are}} groups {{consisting}} of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, {{such as the}} introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if every group element performs some operation on X compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern {{is connected to the}} structure of the object being acted on.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Monism is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be {{explained in terms of}} these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.|$|E
