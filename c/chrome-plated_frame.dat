5000|$|The toy did not {{represent}} any specific car. The front featured stacked, forward-sweeping headlights and slightly pointed hood reminiscent of Pontiacs of the period while the inwardly dished grille and crossbar resembled those used on early 1960s Mercurys. The taillights strongly resembled those on 1948-1956 Cadillacs while the rear end and overall styling suggested the 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible rendered in molded red plastic. The highly detailed interior featured white bucket seats with black inserts both front and rear, matching door panels, black [...] "carpeting" [...] and a chrome-plated dashboard and console with legible gauges and radio dial resembling those in the Mercury Monterey. The <b>chrome-plated</b> windshield <b>frame</b> surrounded a green-tinted windshield and was topped by working sun visors.|$|R
5000|$|His early chair {{designs were}} based on a series of {{cushions}} separated by open spaces in order to economize on materials which were difficult to obtain after the Second World War. The first model, the Pyramid Chair from 1953, with foam and cloth elements, was far from successful. But the same basic approach eventually led to his masterpiece, the Corona Chair, first designed in 1961. The original consisted of a wooden skeleton on which a series of oval cushions provided the seat and the rising back. The idea was that it would allow the body to relax in various positions. The following year, as the result of cooperation between Volther and the recently established Erik JÃ¸rgensen furniture factory, a new model with a <b>chrome-plated</b> steel <b>frame</b> was marketed in 1964. But it was still far from successful.|$|R
