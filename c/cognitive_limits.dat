40|$|There is a <b>cognitive</b> <b>limit</b> in Human Mind. This <b>cognitive</b> <b>limit</b> {{has played}} a decisive role in almost all fields {{including}} computer sciences. The <b>cognitive</b> <b>limit</b> replicated in computer sciences is responsible for inherent Computational Complexity. The complexity starts decreasing if certain conditions are met, even sometime it does not appears at all. Very simple Mechanical computing systems are designed and implemented to demonstrate this idea and it is further supported by Electrical systems. These verifiable and consistent systems demonstrate the idea of computational complexity reduction. This work explains a very important but invisible connection from Mind to Mathematical axioms (Peano Axioms etc.) and Mathematical axioms to computational complexity. This study gives a completely new perspective that goes well beyond Cognitive Science, Mathematics, Physics, Computer Sciences and Philosophy. Based on this new insight some important predictions are made. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

According to this argument, the research around Dunbar's Number implies a limit on the number of inbound and outbound connections a human in a group-forming network can manage, so that the actual maximum-value structure is much sparser than the set-of-subsets measured by Reed's law or the complete graph measured by Metcalfe's Law.|$|E

This number was first proposed in the 1990s by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who found a correlation between primate brain size and average social group size. By using the average human brain size and extrapolating from the results of primates, he proposed that humans can comfortably maintain only 150 stable relationships. Dunbar explained it informally as [...] "the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar".|$|R

The Harris School of Public Policy Studies at the University of Chicago has a more quantitative and economics approach to policy, the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon uses computational and empirical methods, while the John F.

The Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs provides traditional public policy training with multidisciplinary concentrations available in the environmental sciences and nonprofit management. Moreover, the University of Illinois at Chicago offers public policy training that emphasizes the stages of decision-making in formulating policy (e.g. agenda setting), {{as well as the}} importance of framing effects and <b>cognitive</b> <b>limits</b> in policy formation.|$|E
50|$|This book expounds Polo's metaphysical method. Aristotle {{considered}} metaphysics {{the highest}} possible science because it deals with being, which is the ultimate constituent of everything. Modern metaphysicians, such as Descartes and Kant, understood {{that many of the}} pitfalls of metaphysics were caused by the lack of a rigorous method. Polo is sympathetic with Descartes and Kant about the need for such a method, but reflects that in metaphysics the method has to take us to grasp the being or existence of entities as such. If instead of that, our method leaves unresolved the question 'what is being?', its achievements will lead to perplexity. For Polo, such is the situation of Modern metaphysicians. When perplexed, the metaphysician finds himself in an awkward position, for he becomes blind to his own <b>cognitive</b> <b>limits,</b> and consequently has to put up with the suspicion that something in his system is missing without knowing exactly what.|$|E

We find that users can entertain a maximum of 100 - 200 stable relationships in support for Dunbar's prediction. The "economy of attention" is limited in the online world by cognitive and biological constraints as predicted by Dunbar's theory. Inspired by this empirical evidence we propose a simple dynamical mechanism, based on finite priority queuing and time resources, that reproduces the observed social behavior.

5000|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that good information management {{is crucial to}} the smooth working of organisations, and although there is no commonly accepted theory of information management per se, behavioural and organisational theories help. Following the behavioural science theory of management, mainly developed at Carnegie Mellon University and prominently supported by March and Simon, most of what goes on in modern organizations is actually information handling and decision making. One crucial factor in information handling and decision making is an individual's ability to process information and to make decisions under limitations that might derive from the context: a person's age, the situational complexity, or a lack of requisite quality in the information that is at hand - all of which is exacerbated by the rapid advance of technology and the new kinds of system that it enables, especially as the social web emerges as a phenomenon that business cannot ignore. And yet, well before there was any general recognition of the importance of information management in organisations, March and Simon [...] argued that organizations have to be considered as cooperative systems, {{with a high level of}} information processing and a vast need for decision making at various levels. Instead of using the model of the [...] "economic man", as advocated in classical theory [...] they proposed [...] "administrative man" [...] as an alternative, based on their argumentation about the <b>cognitive</b> <b>limits</b> of rationality. Additionally they proposed the notion of satisficing, which entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met - another idea that still has currency.|$|E
50|$|The main {{critique}} often pointed against discursive {{approaches and}} {{their focus on}} narratives, language and deliberation, is that they imply 1) a version of idealism and 2) forms of scientific, moral and political relativism. Against the first point, the argumentative approach does not deny {{the existence of a}} world out there, but rather points to the <b>cognitive</b> <b>limits</b> of scientific inquiry. Whatever the inner nature of the world out there might be, we have no immediate excess to it. Our perspective on the world is always mediated by socio-cultural systems of meaning and the cognitive frames that are expressions of our situated knowledge. Discourse operate as conditions of possibility of experience, since they provide reality with meaning and draw a line between the visible and the invisible. The second point is directed against the contextualism of the argumentative approach, saying that there is no point from which to distinguish the true from the false or the good from the bad, so every perspective is equal to another. But this view from nowhere, were everything has the status of being valid in same way, does not exist for the post-positivist researcher. The perspective of the policy-analyst is always already organized according to a shared horizon of meaning, where she can put herself into the positions of reflective distance, but cannot transcend it. Political actors, social scientists and people doing their everyday business always use specific systems of evaluation and judgment, which are actualized or transformed {{in the context of their}} inter-subjective deliberative practices. On the one hand, building on Foucault, discourse has to be connected to the analysis of relations of power, although communicative practises cannot be reduced to mere manifestations of dominance or ideology. On the other hand, sticking to Habermas, the approach makes an explicit normative commitment towards conceptions of deliberative democracy, thereby facilitating dialogical exchange and debate between actors with different interests and perspectives.|$|E

We consider {{a situation in which}} multiple decisions must be made over a period of time, where the consequences of these decisions are not fully determined. We model this situation as a Markov decision process, and incorporate <b>limited</b> <b>cognitive</b> resources by varying the amount of time in the future that the agent considers the consequences of its decisions. Through simulations, we show that with <b>limited</b> <b>cognitive</b> resources, this model can exhibit better performance by incorporating a bias towards wishful thinking.

50|$|For a {{functioning}} group {{to attempt to}} add new members in a casual way is a certain prescription for failure, loss of efficiency, or disorganization. The number of functioning members in a group can be reasonably flexible between five and ten, and a long-standing cohesive group {{may be able to}} tolerate a few hangers on. The key concept is that the value and success of a group is obtained by each member maintaining a distinct, functioning identity in the minds of each of the members. The <b>cognitive</b> <b>limit</b> to this span of attention in individuals is often set at seven. Rapid shifting of attention can push the limit to about ten. After ten, subgroups will inevitably start to form with the attendant loss of purpose, dominance-order, and individuality, with confusion of roles and rules. The standard classroom with twenty to forty pupils and one teacher offers a rueful example of one supposed leader juggling a number of subgroups.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a problem}} with the {{practice}} and understanding of our sociality (or social capital).

This cannot be the ground for social capital, especially since these features are radically new to our species. Through my reconceptualization, we will see symptoms instead of causes.

40|$|This paper builds upon {{on-going}} {{research into}} the organisational implications of `modularity'. Advocates of modularity argue that the Invisible Hand of markets is reaching activities previously controlled through the Visible Hand of hierarchies. This paper argues that there are <b>cognitive</b> <b>limits</b> {{to the extent of}} division of labour: what kinds of problems firms solve, and how they solve them, set limits to the extent of division of labour, irrespective of the extent of the market. This paper analyses the <b>cognitive</b> <b>limits</b> to the division of labour relying on an in-depth case study of engineering design activities. On this basis, this paper explains why co-ordinating increasingly specialised bodies of knowledge, and increasingly distributed learning processes, requires the presence of knowledge integrating firms even in the presence of modular products. Such firms, relying on their wide in-house scientific and technological capabilities, have the 'authority' to identify, propose, and implement solutions to complex problems. In so doing, they coordinate networks of suppliers of both components and specialised competencies. 1...|$|E
40|$|The many {{decisions}} {{that people make}} about what {{to pay attention to}} online shape the spread of information in online social networks. Due to the constraints of available time and cognitive resources, the ease of discovery strongly impacts how people allocate their attention to social media content. As a consequence, the position of information in an individual’s social feed, as well as explicit social signals about its popularity, determine whether it will be seen, and the likelihood that it will be shared with followers. Accounting for these <b>cognitive</b> <b>limits</b> simplifies mechanics of information diffusion in online social networks and explains puzzling empirical observations: (i) information generally fails to spread in social media and (ii) highly connected people are less likely to re-share information. Studies of information diffusion on different social media platforms reviewed here suggest that the interplay between human <b>cognitive</b> <b>limits</b> and network structure differentiates the spread of information from other social contagions, such as the spread of a virus through a population...|$|E
40|$|Taking its {{starting}} point from remarks by Peirce and Rescher on Kant’s pragmatism, the paper attempts to answer two questions. (1) Whether the Ding an sich plays {{any role in}} Kant’s pragmatics; and (2) whether the English rendering of the thing-in-itself has perhaps encouraged P. F. Strawson and his successors to burden Kant’s “problematic” term {{with an emphasis on}} its alleged essential features. The paper retraces some well-trodden ground to emphasize Kant’s perspectival realism, which never doubts the objective reality of the phenomenal world, in order to ward off idealist as well as transcendental realist readings. The paper then proposes the ‘thing-at-itself’ as a less misleading, even if unidiomatic, rendering in English. A brief summary concludes the paper with Kant’s pragmatics as philosophical praxis in which the Ding as sich functions only negatively as <b>cognitive</b> <b>limit</b> but can play no role in the consideration of the consequences of our ideas, their possible utility, and their degree of attunement with sensus communis...|$|R
5000|$|One {{academic}} outcome {{from this}} work was a challenge to Dunbar's number theorem. Dunbar's number theorem suggests a theoretical <b>cognitive</b> <b>limit</b> {{to the number of}} people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is, and how each person relates to every other person. Dunbar's number is not derived from systematic observation of the number of relationships that people living in the contemporary world have. Killworth and his associates did a number of field studies in the United States that came up with an estimated mean number of ties - 290 - that is roughly double Dunbar's estimate. This was not an average of study averages or a theoretical hypothesis but a repeated finding. In 1997, Killworth and Bernard formed the keynote speakers at the International Network for Social Network Analysis annual [...] "Sunbelt" [...] meeting, presenting on this accumulated work.|$|R
40|$|The premise, that {{building}} codes have become too complex, has been discussed, commented on, and documented by practicing engineers; however, {{prior to this}} research there was little scientific evidence that codes have increased in complexity over time. There are many aspects of building codes that are complicated, and this reflects {{a combination of the}} inherent complexity of building design and the dynamical processes that produce the codes. This research focuses on navigational complexity and specifically the aspects that can be quantified to demonstrate current codes are more complex than their predecessors. Navigational complexity is defined as the complexity created by document cross referencing and other unintended structural features of a code. A metric for quantifying navigational complexity has been developed based on estimates of time consumed by an engineer stepping and navigating through codes. The metric can be used to quantify navigational complexity within a given code and between different codes. Although it is unclear as to what extent navigational complexity contributes to the overall level of complexity within a code, this research affirms that navigational complexity has increased in various codes over the years and can be used to compare complexity between different codes. The complexity of building codes {{has been shown to be}} increasing in several commonly used codes, and it may be necessary to simplify some codes. Additionally, this research postulates that it is possible for codes to become too complex and that there may be instances where the <b>cognitive</b> <b>limit</b> of navigational complexity within any given code is exceeded. However, building codes are complex for several reasons, and attempting to make codes less complex is not trivial. Without a method to reduce complexity, the task of simplification may be impenetrable. The developed metric for navigational complexity has been coupled with graphical representations to identify areas where navigational complexity can be reduced and areas where it may be beyond the <b>cognitive</b> <b>limit</b> of code users. The combination of numerical data and graphical representations may provide additional significant advantages that are not yet realized. Measuring and understanding navigational complexity within any code opens up the possibility of mitigation through reorganization and developing better navigational tools for future editions...|$|R
