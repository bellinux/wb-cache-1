60|$|But let us {{retreat to}} the early eighties, when Alvina was a baby: or even further back, to the palmy days of James Houghton. In his palmy days, James Houghton was crême de la crême of Woodhouse society. The house of Houghton had always been well-to-do: tradespeople, we must admit; {{but after a few}} generations of affluence, tradespeople acquire a {{distinct}} cachet. Now James Houghton, at the age of twenty-eight, inherited a splendid business in Manchester goods, in Woodhouse. He was a tall, thin, elegant young man with side-whiskers, genuinely refined, somewhat in the Bulwer style. He had a taste for elegant conversation and elegant literature and elegant Christianity: a tall, thin, brittle young man, rather fluttering in his manner, full of facile ideas, and with a beautiful speaking voice: most beautiful. Withal, of course, a tradesman. He courted a small, dark woman, older than himself, daughter of a Derbyshire squire. He expected to get at least ten thousand pounds with her. In which he was disappointed, for he got only eight hundred. Being of a romantic-commercial nature, he never forgave her, but always treated her with the most elegant courtesy. To seehim peel and prepare an apple for her was an exquisite sight. But that peeled and quartered apple was her portion. This elegant Adam of commerce gave Eve her own back, nicely <b>cored,</b> <b>and</b> had no more to do with her. Meanwhile Alvina was born.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, many {{efforts have}} been made for <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity design system to be fully automated. Three {{profound}} limitations in the previous automated <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity design systems are (i) the lack in parting direction flexibility, (ii) inability to detect and generate parting direction for both inner and outer undercuts and (iii) no information transfer from automated <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity design system to machining system. To overcome these limitations, automated <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity design system (ACCDS) is developed. This system acts as a component in computer aided process planning system where it takes information from any 3 D CAD model and provides information to the machining system. Generative method {{is the basis of}} this system where <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity models are generated from scratch. The outputs from the system are (i) the generated <b>core,</b> cavity <b>and</b> side-cores with parting direction and (ii) the information of zero tool-face collision angle range of <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity mould pieces. By comparing ACCDS with a recent system proposed by a researcher, improvements such as better <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity design and the reduction of system computational time were observed. This shows that ACCDS were able to contribute in the betterment of the <b>core</b> <b>and</b> cavity design system in automatic manner...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent {{evidence}} suggests that toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize certain viruses. We reported that hepatitis C virus (HCV) <b>core</b> <b>and</b> nonstructural 3 (NS 3) proteins activate inflammatory pathways in monocytes. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the role of TLRs in innate immune cell activation by <b>core</b> <b>and</b> NS 3 proteins. METHODS: Human monocytes, human embryonic kidney cells transfected with TLR 2, and peritoneal macrophages from TLR 2, MyD 88 knockout, and wild-type mice were studied to determine intracellular signaling and proinflammatory cytokine induction by HCV proteins. RESULTS: HCV <b>core</b> <b>and</b> NS 3 proteins triggered inflammatory cell activation via the pattern recognition receptor TLR 2 and failed to activate macrophages from TLR 2 or MyD 88 -deficient mice. HCV <b>core</b> <b>and</b> NS 3 induced interleukin (IL) - 1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) activity, phosphorylation of p 38, extracellular regulated (ERK), and c-jun N-terminal (JNK) kinases and induced AP- 1 activation. Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB by <b>core</b> <b>and</b> NS 3 was associated with increased IkappaBalpha phosphorylation. TLR 2 -mediated cell activation was dependent on the conformation of <b>core</b> <b>and</b> NS 3 proteins and required sequences in the regions of aa 2 - 122 in <b>core</b> <b>and</b> aa 1450 - 1643 in NS 3. Although cellular uptake of <b>core</b> <b>and</b> NS 3 proteins was independent of TLR 2 expression, cell activation required TLR 2. HCV <b>core</b> protein <b>and</b> TLR 2 showed intracellular colocalization. The hyper-elevated TNF-alpha induction by TLR 2 ligands in monocytes of HCV-infected patients was not due to increased TLR 2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: HCV <b>core</b> <b>and</b> NS 3 proteins trigger inflammatory pathways via TLR 2 that may affect viral recognition and contribute to activation of the innate immune system...|$|R

50|$|The {{deglaciation}} {{patterns of}} the Bergen and Nordfjord-Sunnmøre areas in western Norway are described and correlated. In the Bergen area the coast was first deglaciated at 12,600 B.P., with a succeeding re-advance into the North Sea around 12,200 B.P. Later, during the Allerød, the inland ice retreated at least 50 km, but nearly reached the sea again during the Younger Dryas re-advance, ending at 10,000 B.P. Sunnmøre was ice-free during an interstadial 28,000-38,000 B.P. Later the inland ice reached the sea. The final deglaciation is poorly dated in Sunnmøre, while further south in Nordfjord, it started slightly before 12,300 B.P., followed by a major retreat. No large re-advance of the inland ice occurred during the Younger Dryas. However, in the Sunnmøre-Nordfjord area many local glaciers formed outside the inland ice during the Younger Dryas. Limnic sediments outside one such cirque glacier have been <b>cored</b> <b>and</b> dated, proving that the glacier did not exist at 12,300-11,000 B.P., {{and that it was}} formed and disappeared in the time interval 11,000-10,000 B.P. (Younger Dryas). The erosion rate of the cirque glacier was 0.9 mm/year.|$|E
