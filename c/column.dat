It commemorated all the Greek city-states that had participated in the battle, listing them on the <b>column,</b> and thus confirming some of Herodotus' claims. Most of it still survives in the Hippodrome of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), where it was carried by Constantine the Great during the founding of his city on the Greek colony of Byzantium.|$|E
5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double <b>column</b> (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double <b>column.</b> Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) <b>column,</b> this final <b>column</b> is usually read straight downwards.|$|E

For strengthening of reinforced concrete <b>columns,</b> total fourteen <b>columns</b> were cast and tested up to failure of the <b>columns</b> under axial loading. The <b>columns</b> were bonded with BFRP sheets in single layer and double layers with various configurations.

40|$|Confining <b>columns</b> with fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composites {{have been}} investigated {{in the last few}} decades {{to address the problem of}} upgrading and retrofitting reinforced concrete (RC) columns; however, most studies have concentrated on solid <b>columns.</b> This paper investigates the comparative behaviour of FRP confined hollow RC <b>columns</b> subjected to concentric loading. A total of twelve RC <b>columns</b> made from high strength concrete (HSC) were cast and tested. Six of the <b>columns</b> had a circular cross section (two solid <b>columns,</b> two hollow <b>columns</b> each having a circular hole, and two hollow <b>columns</b> each having a square hole) and the remainder <b>columns</b> had a square cross section (two solid <b>columns,</b> two hollow <b>columns</b> each having a circular hole, and two hollow <b>columns</b> each having a square hole). Six <b>columns</b> in total, three from each configuration were left unconfined as control specimens, while the others were confined with FRP. It was found that FRP confinement increased hollow RC columns’ axial load and ductility capacities; and hollow <b>columns</b> having circular holes had better performance compared to hollow <b>columns</b> having square holes...|$|R

5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the <b>column</b> upwards.

Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption <b>column</b> height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E

5|$|Major-General Hunter's flying <b>column</b> set {{out from}} Kassinger, a small town {{a few miles north}} of Merowe, at five-thirty the evening of July 29, marching only at night so as to avoid both the heat of the sun and the eyes of any Mahdist lookouts. There was no road or path to follow, and the terrain upon which Hunter's flying <b>column</b> marched was nearly nontraversable; the route alternated between broken, rocky ground and ankle-high sand, {{ultimately}} proving extremely difficult to navigate in the dark of night. Added to these difficulties was the measure of speed imposed upon the <b>column,</b> as the mounted Major-General Hunter and Lieutenant MacDonald drove their units to their breaking points in order to preempt Mahdist reinforcements. The <b>column</b> advanced until midnight, completing a march of over sixteen miles. Sleeping during the day was made impossible by the sweltering heat; only when adequate shade was found in the barren desert could the exhausted men of Hunter's flying <b>column</b> rest.|$|E

5|$|That second <b>column,</b> {{commanded}} by Soult and including Gen.

Bad weather and the desertion of the Spanish drivers caused the artillery train to become separated from the escorting infantry, a problem that was further complicated when the <b>column</b> was threatened by 5,000 Spanish troops under Gen.

When confronted by Marshal Mortier, Ballesteros retreated without suffering serious harm but remained a threat {{to the rear of the}} French <b>column.</b> For this reason Soult directed Gazan's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege-train, while he himself continued onward to Almendralejo with his cavalry. As a result, Soult finally joined Latour-Maubourg on 6 January with only a fraction of his original <b>column</b> and no heavy artillery.|$|E
