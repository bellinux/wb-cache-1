At the end of the 1950s, he developed his own personal compositional style, the pluralistic [...] "Klangkomposition" [...] (German word referring to the compositional style that focuses on planes - or areas - of sound and tone-colors). The <b>combination</b> <b>and</b> <b>overlapping</b> of layers of musical material from various time periods (from Medieval to Baroque and Classical to Jazz and Pop music) using advanced musical techniques is characteristic of Klangkomposition. Zimmermann's use of this technique ranged from the embedding of individual musical quotes (seen somewhat in his orchestral work Photoptosis) to pieces that are built entirely as a collage (the ballet Musique pour les soupers du Roi Ubu). In his vocal works, especially his Requiem for a Young Poet, the text is used to progress the piece by overlapping texts from various sources. He created his own musical stance using the metaphor [...] "the spherical form of time".|$|E

A standard practical fabrication method was used to produce specimens of various dimensions and materials. These specimens consist of 10 mm steel inner adherend and various outer adherend materials including composite and steel of various thicknesses <b>and</b> <b>overlaps.</b> The composite is largely based on carbon fibre reinforced plastic. The specimens were tested under monotonic tensile loading and the results showed that joint strength depends largely on materials <b>combination</b> <b>and</b> <b>overlap</b> length. The testing also included the use of an advanced imaging system to determine failure initiation and propagation. Two-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) stress models were applied and showed the importance of modelling the composite layers adjacent to the adhesive bondline in order to account for the critical local stresses. The FEA results also showed that overall shear stress distributions can be used to characterise joint failure. The paper presents the experimental and numerical details with key conclusions...|$|R

40|$|We {{document}} {{in this study}} the internal structure of the Late Cretaceous–late Oligocene Ligurian accretionary wedge in northwestern Italy, and the occurrence in this exhumed wedge of broken formation and three different types of mélanges that formed sequentially through time. The broken formation is the oldest unit in the accretionary wedge and shows bedding-parallel boudinage structures, which developed {{as a result of}} layer-parallel extension at the toe of the internal part of the Alpine wedge front during the Late Cretaceous–middle Eocene. This broken formation experienced an overprint of tectonic, diapiric, and sedimentary processes as a result of continental collision in the late Oligocene. The NE-vergent thrusting and associated shortening produced a structurally ordered block-in-matrix fabric through mixing of both native and exotic blocks, forming the tectonic mélange. The concentration of overpressurized fluids along the thrust fault planes triggered the upward rise of shaly material, producing the diapiric mélange, which in turn provided the source material for the downslope emplacement of the youngest, late Oligocene sedimentary mélange. The sedimentary mélange units unconformably cover the collisional thrust faults, constraining the timing of both this episode of contractional deformation related to continental collision <b>and</b> the <b>combination</b> <b>and</b> <b>overlap</b> of tectonic, diapiric, and sedimentary processes. Our multiscale structural analysis of the Ligurian accretionary wedge shows that tectonic, diapiric, and sedimentary processes {{played a significant role in}} its evolution, and that the interplay between and the superposition of these different processes strongly controlled the dynamic equilibrium of the accretionary wedge in the NW Apennines–western Alps. This kind of polygenetic mélange development may be common in many modern and ancient accretionary complexes, and the processes involved in their formation are likely to be responsible for major tsunamic events in convergent margins...|$|R
40|$|Protected {{areas are}} one of the main tourist attractions and home to many poor people living in and around them in many {{developing}} countries. Tourism development in such areas requires linking nature conservation with poverty elimination. Although attracting more concern, the actual benefits accessible to the local poor is inevitably neglected or misunderstood. This work identifies the correlation between tourism and poverty alleviation by tracing the cash flows to the local poor, review the social and environmental effects of tourism on the local area and establishes a community-based sustainable tourism-eliminating poverty strategy framework. The case study was conducted in a group of protected areas in the Qinling Mountain Region in Western China. The study focuses on local poor people, but does not exclude other stakeholders. Since the case study region is a typical representation of the <b>combination</b> <b>and</b> <b>overlapping</b> of the multiple needs for tourism development, poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation, which are faced by many other developing countries in the world, it is expected that the findings and recommendations can be applied to other regions in China, as well as other developing countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{transgressive}} Tayan Member of {{the upper}} Lower to Middle Cambrian Burj Formation (Jordan) has been investigated in several localities of the Dead Sea Rift valley, Jordan. The lower portion of this member consists of low-energy siliciclastics with indications of temporary, early pedogenetic processes, pointing to some stagnation during transgression. The upper portion of the member was deposited under higher energy conditions. Stromatolites, desiccation cracks, halite-pseudomorphs, laminated dolostones, and tepees, together with ripples, mud-clasts and scours point to a shallow intertidal to supratidal sabkha-related environment in a climate of tropical to subtropical aridity. The fossil content of the Tayan Member consists exclusively of trace fossils. Simple endobentic, worm-like r-strategists are common in some horizons. For the first time, Treptichnus pedum has been reported from Jordan where it was found near the base of this member. The markedly reduced biodiversity together with sedimentological data led to the interpretation of a strongly stressed, paleoecologically unstable habitat. Regional comparisons with high-energy transgressive environments laid down {{at the same time}} show that the main factors controlling facies development and the migration of facies belts are (1) the topography of the flooded surface and of the hinterland (mainly with only a local effect), (2) the configuration of the coast (local effect), (3) the rate of subsidence and transgression (local to regional effects), and (4) climate (large regional effects). The <b>combination</b> <b>and</b> <b>overlap</b> of these factors controlled facies gradients and may explain special differences between the facies of the Jordanian and those of the near-by Israeli transgressive deposits on the one hand, but, also the obvious general similarity of Lower to Middle Cambrian transgressive successions in the Middle East and the Mediterranean part of Gondwana on the other hand...|$|R

40|$|AbstractC-terminal kinesin motor proteins, {{such as the}} Drosophila NCD and yeast KAR 3, are {{involved}} in chromosomal segregation. Previously we have described two orthologs of NCD in Caenorhabditis elegans, KLP- 3 and KLP- 17, which also participate in chromosome movement. Here we report cDNA cloning of klp- 15 and klp- 16, and the expression pattern of the genes encoding C-terminal motor kinesins including klp- 15 and klp- 16. Interestingly KLP- 15 and KLP- 16 form a unique class of C-terminal kinesins, distinct from the previously known C-terminal motors in other organisms. Using in situ hybridization and RNA interference assay, we show that although all of these motors mediate chromosome segregation, they {{do so in a}} <b>combination</b> of unique <b>and</b> <b>overlapping</b> manners, suggesting a complex hierarchy of kinesin motor function in metazoans...|$|R
40|$|Karyotype {{analysis}} {{is a widespread}} procedure in cytogenetics to assess the possible presence of genetics defects. The procedure is lengthy and repetitive, so that an automatic analysis would greatly help the cytogeneticist routine work. Still, automatic segmentation and full disentangling of chromosomes are open issues. We propose an automatic procedure to obtain the separated chromosomes, which are then ready for a subsequent classification step. The segmentation is carried out {{by means of a}} space-variant thresholding scheme, which proved to be successful even in presence of hyper- or hypofluorescent regions in the image. Then, the tree of choices to resolve touching <b>and</b> <b>overlapping</b> chromosomes is recursively explored, choosing the best <b>combination</b> of cuts <b>and</b> <b>overlaps</b> based on geometric evidence and image information. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method on routine data acquired with different microscope-camera setup at different laboratories: from 162 images of 117 cells totaling 6683 chromosomes, 94 % of the chromosomes were correctly segmented, solving 90 % of the <b>overlaps</b> <b>and</b> 90 % of the touchings.

Phased arrays are advantageous for this but have the drawback that they often have inflexible and bulky configurations.

To this end we developed a highly flexible multiple receive element phased array for use on anesthetized monkeys.

30|$|A whole firm can be {{organized}} and designed {{in accordance with}} the principles of an academic firm. However, it is also possible only to organize subunits (branches) of a firm according to the principles of academic firms. Alternatively, the focus may be placed primarily on certain principles of an academic firm, and these principles then can be applied to or across the whole (commercial) firm or at least to substantial divisions of the whole (commercial) firm. The term “academic firm” perhaps invites us to the belief, imagination, or vision that this would always mean a whole firm. What the analysis presented here however demonstrates is that this would be an artificially narrowing-down of the concept and idea of the academic firm. It {{is important to note that}} the academic firm can address a whole firm or only specific organizational units (subunits), processes, or principles of a whole firm. In fact, this even would allow for hybrid <b>combinations</b> <b>and</b> <b>overlapping</b> arrangements between the academic firm (knowledge-focused and knowledge-driven) and the commercial firm (profit-driven). Currently, it is difficult to assess how common or uncommon academic firms or principles of the academic firm are in the world of contemporary business. The conventional wisdom would be that the commercial firm represents (still represents) the dominant type of organizational representation for how to structure and how to develop firms (companies). In metaphorical terms, this is also the visualized image and picture in Fig.  1. With the advancement of economy and knowledge economy in context of the knowledge society (and knowledge democracy), it is plausible to assume that expectations are justified that a diffusion and spreading of academic firms appear to be reasonable. Academic firms have all the potential of substantially transforming (in a bottom-up mode and fashion) how the economy and economic activity are being understood and processed. The academic firm invites the introduction of academic values, life styles, and working methods into business because the academic firm believes that academic research and the academic context to academic research are beneficial to the capacities and capabilities of firms focusing on knowledge production (research) and knowledge application (innovation). For the academic firm, academic research is not external but is being conceptualized, re-modeled, and incorporated as an intrinsic process and an intrinsic form of organization within the boundaries of a firm. Academic firms also engage in academic research, where research is linked and inter-connected with innovation. Academic firms express and encourage a “limited ‘scientification’ of business R&D” (Campbell and Güttel 2005, p. 170; Campbell et al. 2013; see also Carayannis and Campbell 2009).|$|R

40|$|Virtual machine (VM) {{scheduling}} is {{an important}} technique to efficiently operate the computing resources in a data center. Previous work has mainly focused on consolidating VMs to improve resource utilization and thus to optimize energy consumption. However, the interference between collocated VMs is usually ignored, which can result in very worse performance degradation to the applications running in those VMs due to the contention of the shared resources. Based on this observation, we aim at designing efficient VM assignment and scheduling strategies where we consider optimizing both the operational cost of the data center and the performance degradation of running applications and then, we propose a general model which captures the inherent tradeoff between the two contradictory objectives. We present offline and online solutions for this problem by exploiting the spatial and temporal information of VMs where VM scheduling is done by jointly consider the <b>combinations</b> <b>and</b> the life-cycle <b>overlapping</b> of the VMs. Evaluation {{results show that the}} proposed methods can generate efficient schedules for VMs, achieving low operational cost while significantly reducing the performance degradation of applications in cloud data centers...|$|R

Using Illumina genotyping followed by imputation, we generated 268 034 consensus genotypes and in excess of 2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for analysis. Association signals were assessed for replication in a second panel of 2286 European cases and 3160 European controls. Four loci achieved genome-wide significance for AD and replicated consistently across all cohorts.
