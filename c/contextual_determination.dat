40|$|This study {{presents}} {{findings from}} an ontological and <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> {{of the concept}} of dignity. The study had a caritative and caring science perspective and a hermeneutical design. The aim {{of this study was to}} increase caring science knowledge of dignity and to gain a determination of dignity as a concept. Eriksson’s model for conceptual determination is made up of five part-studies. The ontological and contex-tual determination indicates that dignity can be understood as absolute dignity, the spiritual dimension char-acterized by responsibility, freedom, duty, and service, and relative dignity, characterized by the bodily, external aesthetic dimension and the psychical, inner ethical dimension. Dignity exists in human beings both as absolute and relative dignity...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} {{to reflect on}} the meaning of {{complexity}} in relation to current biology, and in particular, in relation to current systems biological developments by considering them as confronting biology {{with the idea of a}} complex part–whole determination of living systems, that is contextual as well as stratified. We attempt to trace as clearly as possible the abstract core of the idea of parts and wholes that is at stake in this <b>contextual</b> <b>determination.</b> In doing so, we have found inspiration in Kant’s view on living systems. We argue that Kant’s transcendental viewpoint can be relevantly actualized and extrapolated as a relational account of living systems, and will explore its ramifications starting from a multilevel view of living systems...|$|E
40|$|Through {{an account}} of the efforts of Scottish {{immigrant}} settler James Dawson to negotiate legitimate access to Indigenous country (in south-west Victoria), a theory of ʻthe law of accidentsʼ is outlined. Such a law is based on a performative conception of language: it is grounded in accidence, the aspect of grammar that articulates speaking positions. The case is made that Dawsonʼs publication Australian Aborigines (1881) is especially alive to this nuance, conserving in its Indigenous word-lists individual ideolects as well as clear evidence that right speaking and proper placing (in the landscape) were understood to be related. It is suggested that an interactional and <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> of legitimacy also changes the nature of the environment thus made available: no longer an exclusively held territory, it is reconfigured as a zone of intercommunication. This model has implications for postcolonial redefinitions of sovereignty, identity and indeed the foundational narratives of the nation-state...|$|E
40|$|This study uses {{religions}} {{census data}} collected by French dioceses in the fifties and the sixties and presents the regional variations in Church attendance for different occupational {{groups as well as}} the evolution of the gap between them.

The provisional conclusion is that the model of explanation of religions practice is certainly more complex than a mechanical relating of its level to a specific rank in the occupational hierarchy.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{democratic}} regime {{as a specific}} visibility regime. It takes as its starting point the idea that visibility is a complex sociological category. The field of visibility interweaves aesthetic and semiotic relations, in other words it crosscuts the domains of the perceptual and the symbolic. Visibility {{can be described as}} a relational, strategic and processual feature that characterises human relations. More specifically, contemporary society is arranged into regimes of visibility that concur in the definition and management of power, representation, public opinon, violence and social control. Whereas potential ambivalences are inherent to all visibility effects, regimes contribute to specify and activate <b>contextual</b> <b>determinations</b> of the visible. Norberto Bobbio defined democracy as the exercise of 'power in public', while Jürgen Habermas characterized the public sphere as an open and accessible discoursive space. But what is properly public in the public sphere and how can it be conceptualized in terms of visibility? What are the specific consequences of visible as opposed to invisible power? The paper provides an attempt at answering these questions by conceptualising and understanding the democratic visibility regime from a transdisciplinary perspective, joining together contributions from interactionism, cultural studies and political science...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} in this paper that the two usual values of the modal {{auxiliary}} verb hui, the one called "capacity" and the one called "probability", are the two manifestations of the same operation. It is the <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> and/or the physical and cultural properties of the constituents involved that will gear the interpretation towards one meaning or the other. The first one is generic : in this sense, hui expresses a potential property inherent in the subject. That is the basic value of the auxiliary hui. The second one is specific {{in the sense that}} hui presents the event symbolized by the sentence as logically sure, given what one knows. It is in this case that we can talk about conjecture. The conjecture expressed by hui is hypothetical and deductive, it always supposes a premiss of the "potential property" kind. Iljic Robert. HUI : propriété virtuelle et modalité du déductible..

40|$|Centered on the <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> of {{religions}} practice, this study, using multiple and stepwise regression techniques, finds {{a significant relationship}} between the internal variations of the occupational structure of the labor force and the fluctuations in the level of different Roman Catholic worship practices such as pascalisation (Easter duty), messalisation (Mass attendance) and cenalisation (frequent Communion). Two spacial frames of reference are used in this study: the departement (thirty-four of these administrative districts grouping about thirty countries each are analysed), and the whole (empirical aggregate of the rural counties of these departments). The relationship is stronger and better explained in the first case. However, the departmental variations suggest {{that it is not a}} simple and uniform connection.

40|$|The {{question}} of the legacies {{of the work of}} Jacques Derrida (1930 - 2004) is increasingly coming to the fore {{in the wake of his}} death - alongside, though not simply subsumed by, the {{question of}} the death and afterlives of 'theory'. Within humanities in the United States, in particular, Derrida has unquestionably been one of the most celebrated and reviled French thinkers of the last thirty years. The transatlantic passage of his work forms part of a particular problematic of 'French theory in America' which has only recently started to be mapped systematically. Orchard's contribution to this emerging and highly active field concentrates on an aspect of Derrida's work previously dealt with only glancingly, yet central not only to his own work but also to the understanding of recent French thought more generally. This is his work on philosophy in France as an institution, its material, cultural and intellectual determinations and their philosophical relevance. In the first book-length study of this corpus of material, Orchard raises the question of <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> itself, of 'theory' versus 'philosophy', and of a 'French' versus an 'American' Derrida.

40|$|This paper explores {{changes in}} {{ordinary}} daily behaviour {{in relation to}} bathroom renovations in Denmark. Much suggests that new expectations evolve in connection to such renovations and that these changes could have long-term environmental impacts. The aim {{of this paper is}} to get a deeper understanding of how the production and reproduction of cultural meanings are interconnected with the changes in the bathroom. On the basis of general remarks about cultural meanings in connection to the bathroom, I discuss some general characteristics of modern bathroom ideas. My point is to elucidate the simultaneous rootedness and <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> of bathroom ideas. Hereafter, I examine two empirical examples in order to study the actual process of bathroom renovations. Through this, I carry out an empirical unfolding of the interconnectedness of material, social and cultural dimensions in everyday life. These two examples show how cultural meanings connected to the bathroom are changed through the process. The bathroom setting changes, the informants ’ rou-tines changes and the role of the bathroom changes. An example of new cultural meanings is how an element of pleasure is added to the idea of showering as a duty. The two examples also show how specific contexts trigger specific changes. In conclusion, the paper points out that renovations are part of a revolutionising of everyday life and its surroundings. Here, various contextual connec...|$|E
40|$|This article maps {{out some}} interdependencies between {{political}} science and political sociology. It then details some lessons that political sociologists might take from four contemporary literatures in political science: (1) rational choice work on rational individual action in institutional context; (2) the "nonlinear social systems " literature on the <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> of intensely embedded social actions; (3) the game-theoretic literature on strategic interactions among large emergent class and state actors; and (4) a more qualitative, inductive, and contextualized approach {{to the analysis of}} class and state action extending the tradition of Barrington Moore. The four literatures share a commitment to social action that is decreasingly common among sociologists. Yet they address questions of institutional constraint, contextual dynamics, and macrosocial history akin to those that are engaging their sociological contemporaries. This balance of attention between action and its constraints is the common element drawn from the several instructive political science literatures. Political sociology and political science are deeply interdependent. Thus, there is much relevant work in political science that should and does inform political sociology. I will start out by mapping the interdependence between these two disciplines. Then, I will detail some particular lessons that political sociologists would be wise to take from political science. Few differences in metatheory and method separate political sociology and political science. A decade ago, the influence of rational choice theory appeared so much greater within political science than within political sociology that this influence alone might have served to sharply distinguish the two. However, with the sociological assimilation of the rational choice perspective, this is no longer the case. Indeed, the metatheories and methods of the two are almost precisely the same: institutional and neoinstitutional; behaviorist and behavioral-ist; neofunctionalist and neo-Marxist; elite/managerial and pluralist and neo-pluralist; hermeneutic and postmodern; and multivariate, historicist and comparative historical...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to, from a caring science perspective, uncover the meaning content in to support as well as it’s pragmatic {{features}} in healthcare leadership, with a focus on nurses’ health. The overall aim is to understand to support as a praxis concept in caring science. The study questions are: What does to support mean in the light of etymology and semantics? What shape has supporting in healthcare leadership with a focus on nurses’ health? The study belongs to the caring tradition and has a hermeneutic approach, where the interest of knowledge lies on understanding. The understanding deepens and the horizon broadens in the hermeneutic process where the preunderstanding goes in dialogue, with dictionaries in an etymological and a semantic analysis, and with peer reviewed articles in a <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> of the concept via content analysis. To support as a praxis concept in caring science integrates the concept to support and the supporting way of living. The study result in the following theses: To support ‒ to give cause for her to strive for becoming in health. To support ‒ to place fundaments on which she can securely lean against or rest on. To support ‒ not to let her fall. To support ‒ to confirm her unique dignity. To support ‒ genuine presence, where love embraces and unburdens. To support ‒ to act beneficially so she can reach her potential. In healthcare leadership supporting takes the shape of supporting in the meaning of helping, assisting, promoting and subsiding, in the meaning of promoting, favoring and encouraging {{as well as in the}} meaning of establishing. That manifests concrete in that the healthcare leader is present, guides, respects, maintains ethical fundaments, inspire development as well as is equally flexible in creating outer conditions where the nurses’ inner can flourish...|$|E
40|$|Current {{research}} within healthcare architecture {{has shown}} that how our built environments are designed affects our capacities for healing. However, far less is explored, developed and known in the ﬁeld of residential architecture and how it inﬂuences well-being. In {{the light of the}} growing knowledge of how spaces inﬂuence our emotions and physical reactions we need to know more about how residential spaces act upon our abilities to heal and to improve our health conditions. This licentiate thesis recognizes this need, and intends to explore how residential architectural design contribute to residents' sense of wellbeing and health. As a tool to understand the interplay between human beings and the built environment, the concept of Atmosphere is used, which has been proposed as a way to describe architectural quality. In case study 1 and 2, this concept is adopted to perform a semantic concept analysis with a subsequent <b>contextual</b> concept <b>determination</b> through a theoretical study of an unbuilt apartment. The results from these analyses form part of the theoretical basis for case study 3 where deep interviews are conducted with residents in order to explore and to analyze connections between residential architecture and health. The thesis recognizes the growing body of knowledge in particular within neurosciences concerning attributes critical for our perception and spatial orientation and their physiological and emotional effects. It also recognizes a spectrum of theories related to health. The concluding analysis focuses on identifying and developing concepts that describe aspects of residential architecture of signiﬁcant importance for residents' sense of wellbeing while using results from the conducted deep interviews and applying various other theoretical perspectives on health. The thesis suggests Atmosphere could be regarded as a protector of wellbeing. The surrounding building envelope and the various spatial layers of the home are of particular interest in shaping conditions for creating an environment that promotes wellbeing. Different phenomena, tools and spatial properties are put forward as suggestions of how these aspects could be integrated in residential design. The results of the research are intended to provide {{a better understanding of the}} connections between residential architecture, atmosphere, wellbeing and health. This knowledge should be implemented in future residential architectural design processes...|$|R
40|$|Within the Dutch society there is, {{in recent}} years, an {{influence}} from postmodernism notable. This {{influence of a}} post modern way of life has also {{become more and more}} apparent within the churches who count themselves as being part of the ‘Reformed family group of churches’ (Dutch: De Gereformeerde Gezindte). In some respects this worldview influences the way of practising the faith, or so called: spirituality. What the consequences are of these changes in spirituality, form the subject of this research. For this research a qualitative approach was chosen to study literature of post-modern origin to arrive at the research viewpoint. What are the demands from postmodernism to come to a valid form of spirituality? With this research viewpoint the work of two influential Dutch theologians, F. G. Immink and R. R. Ganzevoort is evaluated. The outcome of this comparison is connected with a personal definition of pastoral counselling formulated from a salvation-historical understanding of the bible. Immink takes his viewpoint from the philosophical idea of External Realism. God is knowable and it is possible to have and maintain a relationship with the Divine. For Immink the most important choices are: a) attention to the relational character of faith, and b) the active influence of faith in daily living, authenticity. Gansevoort’s proposition is the social-scientific theory of Social-constructionism and his Practical Theology is based on a Narrative approach. He emphasises: a) a personal influence in shaping the way of believing, b) <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> of faith, and c) autonomy of the human being. The inference made from the choices found in the work of Immink and Ganzevoort and the personal definition of pastoral counselling produces ideas for a model for pastoral counselling. Important features here are: attention to the concept of authenticity, in the way of understanding the Bible, as well as the way the contents of the faith are communicated during counselling the experience of fellowship and communion, together with attention focussed on a personal approach and contribution, during pastoral counselling attention for pastoral workers regarding discipleship and being a spiritual guide Copyright 2006, University of Pretoria.

40|$|The {{research}} {{interest is}} based on a need for knowledge development related to the substantial gap between movement as a scientific concept and the practice concept of movement in physiotherapy (PT). The aim is to deepen the understanding of movement as a basic concept in PT and thereby expand the understanding of the PT discipline and paradigm. The thesis also aims to expand the understanding of movement as a universal scientific concept. The research questions are: 1) What is the meaning of movement as a basic concept in PT when relating to the ontological meaning, substance, form and essence? 2) What outlines for a scientific theory, with the foundation in the ontological meaning and essence of movement, can be brought forward and used as a basis for development of an internally shaped PT discipline? 3) What is the core and essence of movement as a universal concept? The dissertation is inspired by the tradition of caring, and based on a human science approach. The dissertation is categorized as basic research. The overall approach is hermeneutic and the methodology {{is based on}} Eriksson’s (2010 a; 2012) model for concept determination consisting of ontological and <b>contextual</b> <b>determination.</b> The understanding of movement is deepened and the concept is explored from different perspectives: the semantic, the everyday life, the professional, the history of ideas and PT discipline in a hermeneutic spiral where the contextual characteristics are reflected on the ontological characteristics, and vice versa. The hermeneutic interpretation as a continuous spiral between part and the whole – relating the empirical and theory are central. The results of the dissertation consist of three new horizons of understanding: 1) movement as a basic and core concept in PT, 2) a contextual model of movement in PT and 3) a universal ideal model for natural movement. Movement as value, meaning and emotion, with natural movement as an ethos constitute a basic and core concept for PT as a human science. Natural movement is anchored in the historical core and traditional values of PT. The ontological meaning of movement expands the understanding of the active means and forms of movement in physiotherapy in relation to health, health processes and suffering. Natural movement as an ethos may form a research object within the PT discipline with its basis in the health cure and the ontological meaning of the movement concept. The ideal model constitutes a first outline of natural movement as a basic scientific concept. The natural movement of humans can increase the understanding of movement and the bodily dimension in relation to health and suffering. The models and theses, which are introduced as results of the study, are preliminary and provide a basis for further research. Movement as a basic and core concept enable a systematic further development of the PT discipline as a human science and movement as a universal scientific concept...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} what is intended and {{understood as the}} meaning of contemporary dance in its sociocultural context, in which {{the role of the}} state is a significant factor. It investigates the extent to which the structures and practices of public arts funding influence the production and reception of contemporary dance, focusing on British and French dance in the 1990 s. By focusing on specific works in critically reflexive terms, it seeks to offer a basis for future ethnographic study of dance practices and dance audiences. The thesis employs a critical hermeneutic method, offering a philosophical reflection on dance as well as exploring the mutual implication of artistic practice, aesthetic response and their socio-political and economic contexts. The philosophical grounding of the investigation is explored in detail, in order to support a reflexive engagement of methodological issues of broader relevance to the discipline of dance studies. The relation between verbal language and dance is critically examined: drawing from Saussure and Wittgenstein, the argument is made for the <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> of meaning in both these "forms of life". A discussion of aesthetic and anthropological theories which recognise the mutual implication of artwork and context is followed by a reflection on the methods of dance analysis that most effectively explore the extent and character of that implication. Phenomenological and hermeneutic approaches are discussed, including methods derived and adapted from the study of literature which focus analytic attention on the reception rather than production of texts. An emphasis on spectatorship and dance interpretation seeks to redress what is argued as an imbalance in dance studies, namely the privileging of the perspectives of choreographing and performing subjects in dance analysis. The empirical investigation explores the structure and development, since 1945, of what is termed the "cultural institution", namely the set of conventions and practices which both enable and constrain the production and reception of contemporary dance art. It is argued that the state, through intervention via policy formulation and subsidy distribution, has played a key role in setting parameters within the "danceworld", a subsidiary of the broader cultural institution and the environment which contexts contemporary dance performance. An overview of the politico-economic conditions of dance in the 1990 s is presented, and four case studies then extend this discussion by exploring how those conditions are actualised on individual sites of dance productionand reception. Four works are examined in detail (Kim Brandstrup's Crime Fictions, Russell Maliphant's Unspoken, Daniel Larrieu's Mobile and Herve Robbe's ld.), in terms of their institutional context and the viewing experiences to which they give rise, arguing for a connection between the types of aesthetic response articulated and the institutional conditions in which the works are performed and received. The thesis argues against a determinist relation between the politico-economic context and the aesthetics of dance, proposing instead that these two dimensions of contemporary dance practice need to be examined conjointly. It seeks to demonstrate that this is crucial, if the current condition of contemporary dance in Britain and France is to be both understood and critically appraised...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} and {{research}} questions: The aim {{of this study is to}} illuminate how caring communion can aid in promoting health as becoming in elderly people in the context of natural caring. The target group of the study consists of elderly citizens living at home. The focus of this thesis is on the concept of communion and how caring communion can affect the inner health resources in a patient’s inner health domain, as well as how caring communion can support health as becoming and inner health resources in the elderly. The main research questions of this study are the following: 1) what does communion mean? 2) what does caring communion mean? 3) what is the connection between caring communion and health? Theoretical perspective: The theoretical perspective of this qualitative study relies on the caritative caring theory as developed by scholars of caring sciences at the Åbo Academi University’s Vasa unit. The caritas motive is based on an ethos built on a consideration of togetherness, i. e. caring communion, a place where one feels at home and where one can be the person one was meant to be. Methodology: A hermeneutic research approach based on Gadamer (1997) permeates the study. This entails that understanding and interpretation become central. The study conducted in the thesis is divided into three sub-studies. Sub-study one and two are based on ontological determination whereas the third sub-study is carried out by <b>contextual</b> <b>determination.</b> The first sub-study is conducted by etymological and semantic analysis of the concept of communion (gemenskap) based on Koort (1975) and the second sub-study by determining the basic epistemological category of the concept based on Eriksson (2010 b). Sub-study three is conducted through content analysis of 18 multidisciplinary and 13 caring science articles and dissertations based on Kvale (2009). The aim in the third sub-study is to define caring communions in various contexts of meaning based on Eriksson´s model of conceptual determination (2010 b). All studies are interpreted through hermeneutic interpretation where the continuous movement from a part of a whole, to the whole, to part again, leads to new understanding. Finally, the findings from all the three sub-studies are compared to the concepts of pre-understanding and the inner-health-domain model of Wärnås (2002). Results: The results of the study offer a description of the dimensions of caring communion and a model that illuminates how caring communion can further health as becoming. The fundamentals of caring communion rest on the idea of a human being’s absolute right to dignity as a base for communion. The concept of communion contains a moral, an ethical, and a spiritual component. In communion, there exists a moral and ethical responsibility and a willingness to commit oneself. The individual is part of a connection or relation and knows the aim and course for the communion. A caring connection, a caring culture, a caring atmosphere and caring listening are characteristics of caring communion. In caring communion, the elderly feel trusting and see themselves as unique, powerful, and valuable. The model demonstrates that when the elderly are able to rest in caring communion, the virtues of courage and faith become strong and desire for life awaken within the elderly and health as becoming becomes possible. Conclusions: The outcome of the study is that all communion is not necessarily caring communion. In order for communion to be caring and for the elderly to achieve health as becoming, there are certain criteria that must be met. This is especially important when designing activities for the elderly in the context of natural caring...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} represents {{basic research}} in the field of caring science. The purpose of this research is to develop an ideal model for the preconditions of the ethics of technology, and the aim is to gain knowledge and new evidence of the concept of technology and its ethics in caring science. The starting points of the research were in caritative caring science and its value basis and tradition, which formed the interpretation horizon in this hermeneutic research. The human good and the dignity of human being are the fundamental values in the ethics of caring science and in this research. The main research questions were: What is the concept of technology? What is the ethics of the concept of technology? What is the ideal model of the ethics and caring of technology in caring science? The methodology used to search for answers to the research questions were hermeneutic interpretation and hermeneutic concept determination. The research comprises four sub‐studies and a summary section which answers the main study questions. The purpose of the first sub‐study was to determine the ontology of the concept of technology. The purpose of the second sub‐study was to describe and summarise the concept of technology and its ethics in previous nursing and caring literature. The third sub‐study was carried out to describe patients’ experiences of technology in care in previous nursing and caring literature, aiming to highlight and emphasise the patient’s perspective to technology in care. The fourth sub‐study was carried out to gain new knowledge of ethics in the context of technology. The sub‐studies two, three and four formed the <b>contextual</b> <b>determination</b> of the concept of technology, while sub‐study one determined the ontology of the concept of technology. The ideal model of the ethics of technology was developed {{on the basis of the}} new evidence gained from the sub‐studies and its reflection with the knowledge from the preunderstanding and the interpretation horizon of the research at the end of the hermeneutic research circle. The core of the ideal model of technology and its ethics is the idea of technology, which is to serve, fulfil the purpose and ethos of the substance matter. The purpose of technology is to promote the human good. The basic of serving is to dignify the unique, whole and autonomous human being. Technology is universal but also unique. Technology is universal but it needs to be tailored in the service of unique human being. Technology in itself has an ethical dimension. The idea of technology and its ethics are linked to human good, human being’s freedom, and the freedom to choose and realise self‐ determination. Technology is related to the substance where it is used, and the substance is the priority. Caring communion and patient education are the means to realise the ethics of technology in caring science. Technology is knowledge, art, devices, processes and services which serve for the good of human being. The human good is arête. It is important to know patients’ experiences of technology and its good and caring from a patient centred‐perspective. Together with the theoretical knowledge of the concept of technology and its ethics, knowledge of patients’ experiences of technology form the basis of good and well‐serving technology. The common understanding of the concept of technology, i. e., what it is, what its ethics is and what are the preconditions to realise the ethics, the human good, in the context of technology in caring science formed the theoretical basis to develop the technology of caring as a subarea of caring science. Knowledge of the concept of technology and its ethics and also of the preconditions of the ethics of technology can serve both the development of technology and caring practice...|$|E
