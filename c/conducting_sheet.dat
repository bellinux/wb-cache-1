40|$|The current {{distribution}} {{in a parallel}} set of thin <b>conducting</b> <b>sheets</b> due to an external applied source is investigated. All sheets are placed in one plane. The source, and all excited fields, are time harmonic. The frequency is low enough to allow for an electro quasi-static approximation (neglecting the displacement current). The <b>conducting</b> <b>sheets</b> are infinitely long and the current is uniform in the longitudinal direction of the sheets. The sheets have a thin rectangular cross-section, so thin that the current can be assumed uniform in the thickness-direction. Hence, the {{current distribution}} only depends on the transverse coordinate. Due to the mutual induction between the sheets, the current dis-tribution over {{the width of the}} cross-section becomes non-uniform: it accumulates {{at the edges of the}} sheets. It is especially this so-called edge-effect, and its dependence on the applied frequency and the distances between the sheets, that is the aim of this investiga-tion. From the Maxwell equations, a set of integral equations for the current distribution in the sheets is derived. These integral equations are solved, as far as possible by ana-lytical means, by writing the current distribution in each sheet as a series of Legendre polynomials. The general method is worked out for N (N ≥ 1) sheets, but explicit results are presented for N = 1 and N = 3. It turns out that the edge-effect becomes stronger for increasing frequencies. For this solution, only a very restricted number of Legendre polynomials is needed. ...|$|R
