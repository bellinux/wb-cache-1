5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the <b>common</b> <b>kestrel,</b> and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{the tree}} sparrow include a variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, <b>common</b> <b>kestrel,</b> little owl, and {{sometimes}} long-eared owl and white stork. It {{does not appear to}} be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, jays, least weasels, rats, cats and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake.|$|E
5|$|The urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, mice, rats) {{strongly}} reflects UV {{light and}} this may be used in communication by leaving visible as well as olfactory markings. However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous; the <b>common</b> <b>kestrel</b> can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes.|$|E
50|$|Grey wagtails can {{be found}} during the winter months, as well as white-throated kingfishers and <b>common</b> <b>kestrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is home to}} a {{population}} of griffon vultures, along with Egyptian vultures, <b>common</b> <b>kestrels,</b> and peregrine falcons.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{large and}} varied bird {{population}} that include west Peruvian doves, pigeons, barn swallows, sparrows, hummingbirds, Peruvian sheartails, American robins, eagles, falcons, <b>common</b> <b>kestrels,</b> owls, black vultures, herons and parrots.|$|R
5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and <b>common</b> <b>kestrel</b> (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (Athene noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E
25|$|Wintering species like booted warbler, Blyth's {{reed warbler}} and <b>common</b> <b>kestrel</b> {{can also be}} seen.|$|E
25|$|During the {{wintering}} months <b>common</b> <b>kestrel,</b> Montague's harrier, blue-tailed bee-eater, barn swallow, Eurasian wigeon, cotton pygmy goose, fulvous whistling duck, painted stork, openbill stork can be spotted.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} part of a clade that {{contains}} the kestrel species with black malar stripes, a feature which apparently was not present in the most ancestral kestrels. They seem to have radiated in the Gelasian (Late Pliocene, roughly 2.5-2 mya, probably starting in tropical East Africa, as indicated by mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data analysis and considerations of biogeography. The <b>common</b> <b>kestrel's</b> closest living relative is apparently the nankeen or Australian kestrel (F. cenchroides), which probably derived from ancestral <b>common</b> <b>kestrels</b> settling in Australia and adapting to local conditions less than one million years ago, during the Middle Pleistocene.|$|R
50|$|Local {{wildlife}} includes owls, polecats, rabbits, <b>common</b> <b>kestrels</b> and {{the occasional}} golden eagle and sea eagle, {{as well as a}} large seabird population: fulmars, cormorants, oystercatchers and many more. Other marine life includes seals, basking sharks, porbeagle sharks and dolphins.|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>kestrels</b> are {{ultraviolet}} sensitive {{which allows}} them to visually locate the trails of voles. These small rodents lay scent trails of urine and faeces that reﬂect ultraviolet light, making them visible to the kestrels, particularly in the spring before the scent marks are covered by vegetation.|$|R
25|$|During the {{wintering}} months Indian pitta, rosy starling, orange-headed ground thrush, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian brown flycatcher, <b>common</b> <b>kestrel,</b> booted eagle, common snipe and blue-tailed bee-eater {{can all be}} seen.|$|E
25|$|During {{winter months}} blue-tailed bee-eater, <b>common</b> <b>kestrel,</b> yellow wagtail, barn swallow, glossy ibis, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, painted stork, openbill stork, booted eagle, Oriental pratincole, common sandpiper, wood sandpiper and {{greenshank}} can be spotted.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the bird}} species spotted here in winter include greater flamingo, lesser flamingo, {{northern}} pintail, northern shoveller ducks, sandpipers, plovers, terns, gulls, osprey, painted stork, Asian openbill stork, glossy ibis, black-headed ibis, western reef egret, little egret, intermediate egret, great egret, greenshank, common redshank, spotted redshank, godwits, pied avocet, Eurasian curlew, spot-billed pelican, stints, peregrine falcon and <b>common</b> <b>kestrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{female and}} young birds are {{slightly}} paler than their relative, but are so similar that call and structure are better guides than plumage. The call is a diagnostic harsh chay-chay-chay, unlike the <b>common</b> <b>kestrel's</b> kee-kee-kee. Neither sex has dark talons as is usual in falcons; those {{of this species}} are a peculiar whitish-horn color. This, however, is only conspicuous when birds are seen at very close range, e.g. in captivity.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>kestrels</b> of Europe living during cold {{periods of}} the Quaternary {{glaciation}} differed slightly {{in size from}} the current population; they are {{sometimes referred to as}} paleosubspecies F. t. atavus (see also Bergmann's Rule). The remains of these birds, which presumably were the direct ancestors of the living F. t. tinnunculus (and perhaps other subspecies), are found throughout the then-unglaciated parts of Europe, from the Late Pliocene (ELMA Villanyian/ICS Piacenzian, MN16) about 3 million years ago to the Middle Pleistocene Saalian glaciation which ended about 130,000 years ago, when they finally gave way to birds indistinguishable from those living today. Some of the voles the Ice Age <b>common</b> <b>kestrels</b> ate—such as European pine voles (Microtus subterraneus)—were indistinguishable from those alive today. Other prey species of that time evolved more rapidly (like M. malei, the presumed ancestor of today's tundra vole M. oeconomus), while yet again others seem to have gone entirely extinct without leaving any living descendants—for example Pliomys lenki, which apparently fell victim to the Weichselian glaciation about 100,000 years ago.|$|R
40|$|We studied dietary {{composition}} of urban populations of <b>Common</b> <b>Kestrels</b> (Falco tinnunculus) and Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) under fluctuating vole abundance. We tested hypotheses {{that the proportion}} of alternative prey in the diet increase with decreasing vole abundance throughout the years and that alternative prey differ between raptors due to different daily activities and/or hunting techniques. Finally, we tested whether the proportion of voles in the diet is influenced by the nest position within the city...|$|R
25|$|Over 100 {{resident}} and migratory bird {{species have been}} recorded so far, the commonest raptors being: Oriental honey buzzard, white-eyed buzzard and shikra. Migratory raptors including black baza, <b>common</b> <b>kestrel</b> and booted eagle can be seen during the winter months. Resident birds include red-vented bulbul, red-whiskered bulbul and white-browed bulbul, coppersmith barbet, sunbirds, yellow-wattled lapwing, Indian robin, lesser flameback woodpecker and spotted owlet.|$|E
25|$|Ardeidaes rest in salty ponds (snowy egret, green heron, western cattle egret, yellow-crowned night heron, tricolored heron, etc.) {{and living}} with the aquatic turtles, the common moorhen, the blue land crab, the blackback land crab, the sand fiddler crab and other species of crabs. The <b>common</b> <b>kestrel</b> is easily visible and audible during rides into the dry forest, like the zenaida dove, an endemic species of West Indies {{protected}} inside the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Another {{migratory bird}} {{seen in the}} winter is the great egret, which grows to up to a meter in height. Some rare birds that have been seen here include the <b>common</b> <b>kestrel,</b> the osprey and certain types of owl. The most {{commonly}} observed migratory species is the American white pelican, which was not seen in the area before the lake and canals were restored. However, this species has only been seen in numbers since the 2000s, with 500 reported as of 2009. These birds migrate here from Canada and the northern US. Another important species is the kingfisher, which was earlier thought to be extinct in the area, but has been seen again.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>kestrels</b> measure 32 - 39 cm {{from head}} to tail, with a {{wingspan}} of 65 - 82 cm. Females are noticeably larger, with the adult male weighing 136 - 252 g, around 155 g on average; the adult female weighs 154 - 314 g, around 184 g on average. They are thus small compared with other birds of prey, but larger than most songbirds. Like the other Falco species, they have long wings {{as well as a}} distinctive long tail.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{occasionally}} hunted by the peregrine falcon, which shares its mountain habitat, and during its migration over the Himalayas, {{it is reported}} to be subject to predation by crows. <b>Common</b> <b>kestrels,</b> Eurasian sparrowhawks, Eurasian jays and common ravens are also treated as predators and attacked by repeated dives if they approach nesting cliffs. Despite the general aggressiveness of the martin, it tolerates sympatric common house martins, perhaps because the large numbers of that highly colonial species provide an early warning of predators.|$|R
50|$|Their plumage {{is mainly}} light {{chestnut}} brown with blackish {{spots on the}} upperside and buff with narrow blackish streaks on the underside; the remiges are also blackish. Unlike most raptors, they display sexual colour dimorphism with the male having fewer black spots and streaks, {{as well as a}} blue-grey cap and tail. The tail is brown with black bars in females, and has a black tip with a narrow white rim in both sexes. All <b>common</b> <b>kestrels</b> have a prominent black malar stripe like their closest relatives.|$|R
500|$|New Hare Covert is woodland, mainly {{composed}} of oak, ash, larch and Scots pine. [...] The area is managed for biodiversity purposes and provides habitat for numerous mammals, including muntjac, {{as well as}} woodland bird species. [...] Between New Hare Covert and Swallow Pool {{there is also an}} area of grassland, which attracts numerous species of butterfly. The area also has a large population of small mammals such as common shrew, field vole and bank vole, which in turn attract birds of prey such as the <b>common</b> <b>kestrel</b> and short-eared owl.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 121 bird {{species have been}} {{observed}} in the park, with twenty-six of them being considered of conservation priority. The area hosts fifteen raptor species and populations of bird species with limited distribution in Greece, such as the hazel grouse, Tengmalm's owl, wallcreeper and willow tit. The two bird communities that inhabit the subalpine and forest ecosystems are considered among the most complete in Greece: The first community includes species that nest and feed in the subalpine area, like the alpine chough, shore lark, western rock nuthatch and alpine swift, while the second comprises birds of prey like the griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, peregrine falcon and <b>common</b> <b>kestrel,</b> that search for food in a wider zone.|$|E
500|$|A {{widespread}} species {{throughout the}} temperate and subtropical {{parts of the}} Old World, the Eurasian sparrowhawk is resident or breeds in an estimated global range of [...] and had an estimated population of 1.5 million birds in 2009. Although global population trends have not been analysed, numbers seem to be stable, so it has been classified as being of Least Concern by IUCN. The race granti, with 100 pairs resident on Madeira and 200 pairs on the Canary Islands, is threatened by loss of habitat, egg-collecting and illegal hunting, and is listed on Annex I of the European Commission Birds Directive. It {{is one of the}} most common birds of prey in Europe, along with the <b>common</b> <b>kestrel</b> and common buzzard. The Norwegian and Albanian populations are declining and, in many parts of Europe, Eurasian sparrowhawks are still shot. However, this low-level persecution has not affected the populations badly. In the UK, the population increased by 108% between 1970–2005, but saw a 1% decline over 1994–2006. In Ireland it is the most common bird of prey, breeding even near the city centre of Dublin, where it frequents parks and large gardens.|$|E
50|$|Skomer is {{best known}} for its large {{breeding}} seabird population, including Manx shearwaters, guillemots, razorbills, great cormorants, black-legged kittiwakes, Atlantic puffins, European storm-petrels, common shags, Eurasian oystercatchers and gulls, as well as birds of prey including short-eared owls, <b>common</b> <b>kestrels</b> and peregrine falcons. The island is also home to grey seals, common toads, slow-worms, a breeding population of glow-worms and a variety of wildflowers. Harbour porpoises occur in the surrounding waters. The Skomer vole, a sub-species of bank vole, is endemic to the island.|$|R
50|$|The crag martins may be hunted by fast, agile {{birds of}} prey such as the African hobby or Eurasian hobby that specialise in {{catching}} swallows and martins in flight, and by other falcons such as the peregrine and Taita falcons. Crows may attack migrating Eurasian crag martins, and that species also treats <b>common</b> <b>kestrels,</b> Eurasian sparrowhawks, Eurasian jays and common ravens as predators if they approach the nesting cliffs. The dusky crag martin has been recorded in the diet of the greater false vampire bat, Megaderma lyra.|$|R
50|$|The {{area around}} the path has been heavily shaped by human activity, leading to its {{colonisation}} by nitrophilous plants which benefit from nitrate-rich environments created by human interference. Flora and fauna {{that can be seen}} along the path include esparto grass, wild gladiolus, toothed lavender, rough bugloss and felty and shrubby germander, which grow in the area. Barbary partridge, northern raven and <b>common</b> <b>kestrels</b> nest near the path. A less welcome presence is that of a number of feral goats which have caused serious damage to the vegetation, although eradication efforts are being pursued.|$|R
2500|$|While owls are {{apparently}} often {{be killed by}} Eurasian eagle-owls while active and hunting, diurnal raptors are often ambushed at night at their large, conspicuous nests since they are easily located during hunting forays and the raptors are nearly defenseless in nocturnal conditions. The eagle-owl has been specified as the primary predator of common buzzards, peregrine falcons, <b>common</b> <b>kestrel</b> (Falco tinnunculus) and black kites. The common buzzard and <b>common</b> <b>kestrel</b> {{are probably the most}} often selected diurnal raptors because they inhabit the edges most often hunted by the eagle-owls. Studies have shown that [...] peregrine falcon experience lower productivity in areas where they nest closely to eagle-owls, as the eagle-owls pick off both nestlings and adults by night. However, peregrine populations were not hugely effected except in cases where small reintroductions were attempted of falcons or falcon populations were already rare due to other causes. The northern goshawk is itself a serious predator of other raptors. The eagle-owl is the goshawk’s only major predator, although goshawks are not as intensely hunted as are buzzards due to their more deeply wooded preferred nesting habitat.|$|E
2500|$|There are 185 [...] {{species of}} birds in the reservation, of which 120 are {{resident}} birds. Because of such large number of birds, including rare ones like night heron and spotted crake, Zasavica {{is included in the}} list of IBA, important bird areas. Since 1998, 20 artificial nesting platforms are placed throughout the reservation. Other species include common moorhen, little grebe, Eurasian coot, great reed warbler, little bittern, mallard, common quail, white stork, black stork, Eurasian bittern, white-tailed eagle, western marsh harrier, <b>common</b> <b>kestrel,</b> mute swan, northern lapwing, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Birds: The {{reserve is}} home to 200 species of birds, of which 19 are {{considered}} rare at the national level. More than 22 species have been confirmed to be resident, the rest are migratory or rare visitors, {{and at least two}} or three species have been introduced. The reserve holds a combination of birds found in Europe, Africa, and Asia which include: chukar (Alectoris chukar), Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), blackbird (Turdus merula), common raven (Corvus corax), <b>common</b> <b>kestrel</b> (Falco tinnunculus), shore lark (Eremophila alpestris), common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), common chaffinch, (Fringilla coelebs), turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur), rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis). [...] Two species at least have been introduced to the shouf area for hunting and expanded their range into the reserve, the two species are: rock partridge (Alectoris graeca), and common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). The reserve is also home to many species of birds of prey such as: griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos).|$|E
50|$|UVS vision {{may also}} give birds an {{advantage}} in foraging for food. The waxy surfaces of many fruits and berries reﬂect UV light that might advertise their presence. <b>Common</b> <b>kestrels</b> {{may be able to}} locate the trails of voles visually. These small rodents lay scent trails of urine and faeces that could reﬂect UV light, making them visible to the kestrels, particularly in the spring before the scent marks are covered by vegetation. However, this view has been challenged by the finding of low UV sensitivity in raptors and weak UV reflection of mammal urine.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliography. A {{study of}} {{the ecology of the}} Southern African Kestrel was made in two areas of differing {{topography}} in the Eastern Cape Province (32 Â°S) of South Africa. The main objectives of the study were to describe foraging parameters (behaviour-time budgets, hunting success and diet) and breeding parameters (clutch size, hatching and fledging success, nestling, fledging and post-fledging periods) of the Southern African Kestrel. These parameters were compared to those from studies made on the European Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus tinnunculus) in western Europe (53 Â°N) in an environment which fluctuates relatively more than the South African study sites. Predictions concerning foraging and breeding ecology made by life-history theory in stable and fluctuating environments prompted the erection of the following hypotheses which were examined in this study. 1. <b>Common</b> <b>Kestrels</b> (Falco tinnunculus) in relatively stable environments have a more consistent but lower foraging yield than those breeding in fluctuating environments. 2. <b>Common</b> <b>Kestrels</b> in relatively stable environments have lower reproductive rates (longer incubation, nestling and post-fledgling dependence periods, later age at first breeding and longer life-span) than those in fluctuating environments. Southern African Kestrels spent different proportions of time of the two main hunting methods used, perch- and hover-hunting, than the European Kestrel. Perch-hunting was the predominant hunting method used by the Southern African Kestrel compared to hover-hunting in the European Kestrel. Southern African Kestrels had a higher prey-capture success for both hunting techniques. However, daily food intake was lower in Southern African Kestrels because a high proportion of the diet consisted of small invertebrates. Average clutch size was smaller in the Southern African Kestrel than that of the European Kestrel and Southern African Kestrels fledged on average fewer young. However, incubation, nestling and post-fledging periods were within the range recorded for the European Kestrel. The hypothesis that <b>Common</b> <b>Kestrels</b> in relatively stable environments have lower foraging yields is supported by this study. Although results from this study suggest that food yields are more consistent in stable environments, it was unable to evaluate this adequately. The hypothesis that reproductive rates are lower in relatively stable environments is partly supported in this study, but more data are required for parameters such as incubation and nestling periods to confirm such trends...|$|R
25|$|UVS is also {{demonstrated}} to serve functions in foraging, prey identification, and frugivory. Similar advantages afforded to trichromatic primates over dichromatic primates in frugivory are {{generally considered to}} exist in birds. The waxy surfaces of many fruits and berries reﬂect UV light that advertise their presence to UVS birds. <b>Common</b> <b>kestrels</b> be able to locate the trails of voles with vision; these small rodents lay scent trails of urine and feces that reﬂect UV light, making them visible to the kestrels. However, this view has been challenged by the finding of low UV sensitivity in raptors and weak UV reflection of mammal urine.|$|R
