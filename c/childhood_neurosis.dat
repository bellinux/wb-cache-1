40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{will examine the}} {{implications}} of psychodynamic theory for teaching and learning in early childhood education. The indivudual pioneering efforts of Anna Freud and Melanie Klein in understanding <b>childhood</b> <b>neurosis</b> and in developing child analysis and "play therapy" will be described and compared. Anna Freud's strong early convictions {{of the need for}} a psychoanalytic pedagogy and later disillusionment will be discussed. Basic psychoanalytic terms such as "the unconscious", "Id, Ego, Superego", "transference" etc. will be broadly defined to illuminate early psychoanalytic theory. A psychohistorical perspective on initial attempts to create a psychoanalytic pedagogy in Europe will be synthesized and current pre-school developmental programs in North America described, programs which draw from psychodynamic theory. The theories of Eric H. Erikson, Susan Isaacs, Bruno Bettelheim, E. C. M. Frijling-Schreuder and Margaret Ribble will be presented. In conclusion, some criticisms of the psychodynamic theories' impact on education will be aired...|$|E
40|$|The {{general view}} {{of mental health}} {{professionals}} toward religion and its contribution to positive mental health has fluctuated over the years. This is shown as early as 1927, in Sigmund Freud’s book titled, “The Future of an Il-lusion ” in which he refers to religion {{as a form of}} <b>childhood</b> <b>neurosis</b> (Freud, 1927). Albert Ellis (1958) suggested that “Religious creeds encourage some of the craziest kinds of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors and favor severe mani-festations of neurosis, borderline personality states, and sometimes even psychosis. ” Concurrently, up until the pub-lication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, 1994), religious and spiritual experi-ences were referenced as characteristics of psychopathology such as paranoia, delusions, hallucinations and schizotypal symptoms (Levin, 2010). Despite early psychotherapists who supported reli-gion and spirituality (i. e., Carl Jung), the negative view of religion held by psychotherapists was widespread. Only more recently have the relationships among reli-giosity and spirituality been examined with significant emphasis on efforts to strengthen its positive impact on mental health (Witztum, 2011; Allen & Heppner...|$|E
40|$|A psychotherapeutic {{approach}} {{consisting of}} play therapy and family counselling on 30 cases of <b>childhood</b> <b>neurosis</b> was {{performed with the}} following results : 1) Attitudes about the therapy in the introductory phase of the patients and families were meaningfully concerned with symptoms, prognosis and family dynamics. From these findings, {{it was decided to}} divide the cases into 3 groups. Group I (7 cases), the families of the patients showed little interest in receiving psychotherapy, and the patients themselves displayed negative attitudes. Group II (14 cases), both the families and the patients showed positive attitudes towards the therapy. Group III (9 cases), the families showed superficial collaborative attitudes, but the patients showed little interest. 2) Group I, the patients 2 ̆ 7 predominant symptom was aggressive negative behavior. The parents 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards the patients was neglectful or rejective. The emotional integration of the families was severely disturbed and the families showed no family identity. Group II, these patients 2 ̆ 7 predominant symptom was anxiety and the parents 2 ̆ 7 attitude towards the patients was overanxious and overprotective. The family interpersonal relationship was close but interdependent, the family identity stayed immature. Group III, the symptoms of this group were nervous tics and obsessive compulsiveness. The parents 2 ̆ 7 attitude towards the patients was domineering and interfering. The family interpersonal relationship was static, and the family identity only superficial with latent conflicts. 3) In all groups the common problem was disturbance in development. However, in Group I the main problem was a lack of proper identification, in Group II of proper individuation and Group III had the problem of emotional inhibition. These developmental problems were pathogenetically meaningful in each group. 4) Considering the above findings, a different approach with each group that facilitated the bringing out of the identity resistance showed by the family as a whole against the therapy was developed...|$|E

These columns were collected in four nonfiction books, What's Not to Love?: The Adventures of a Mildly Perverted Young Writer (2000), My Less Than Secret Life (2002), I Love You More than You Know (2006), and The Double Life Is Twice As Good: Essays and Fiction (2009). Ames was also responsible for the Most Phallic Building contest which followed an article he wrote for Slate magazine where he claimed that the Williamsburg Bank Building in Brooklyn, New York, was the most phallic building he'd ever seen.|$|R
