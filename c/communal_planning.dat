The Nairs were the sole members of the village organisations, which existed for such purposes as managing the affairs of the temples and, at one time, organising military training and deployment.

There were other castes in these villages, and other religious groups also, but they were excluded from the organisations.

40|$|The {{environmental}} consequences of planning decisions are often undervalued. This {{can result from}} a number of potential causes: (a) there might be a lack of adequate information to correctly assess {{environmental consequences}}; (b) stakeholders might discount the spatial and temporal impacts; (c) a failure to understand the dynamic interactions between socio-ecological systems including secondary and tertiary response mechanisms; or (d) the gravity of the status quo, i. e., blindly following a traditional discourse. In this paper, we argue that a Planning Support System (PSS) that enhances an assessment of environmental impacts and is integral to a community or regional planning process can help reveal the true environmental implications of scenario planning decisions, and thus improve <b>communal</b> <b>planning</b> and decision-making. We demonstrate our ideas through our experiences developing and deploying one such PSS—the Land-use Evolution and impact Assessment Model (LEAM) Planning Support System. University of Illinois researchers have worked directly with government planning officials and community stakeholders to analyze alternate future development scenarios and improve the planning process through a participatory, iterative process of visioning, model tuning, simulation, and discussion.

40|$|Abstract Social {{services}} are rendered to those citizens, who require them considering their health, age or unfavourable social situation {{and who are}} unable of overcoming their social burdens and less than auspicious circumstances without external aid. Social {{services are}} essential not just because many people require them but particularly because were they not to be available, {{a large part of}} the public would lose their ability to participate in all aspects of life in a society. This would make it impossible for their human and civil rights to be upheld and lead to their exclusion from society. Social development, more favourable living standards, progress in the field of medicine and championing of social rights result in less people dying in childhood or at a productive age nowadays than before. It can be argued that the number of pensioners will be constantly increasing and that this is an accompaniment of a successfully developing civilisation. Because of their numbers, pensioners are becoming an exceptionally grave subject of social exclusion. It is therefore imperative that we realise the disadvantages the elderly face and devote appropriate attention to the issues surrounding the planning of social services. In terms of the set objective, it is necessary to evaluate and compare individual mid-term plans for the development of social services at certain locations and also to compare and evaluate the <b>communal</b> <b>plans</b> of selected cities. The dissertation proved that it is indeed necessary to pay due attention to the studied planning of social services. This is because there is a need to harmonise supply and demand in relation to social services. Ensuring the availability of a high-quality social services network for the elderly is only possible given the presence of a complex concept of social and medical care. One must however always take into consideration not just the current demographic trends but also the circumstances in the particular area as well as the degree of interest of the various subjects who are immediately involved in the issues surrounding the particular type of social services. One can undoubtedly say that the quality of social services on offer (not just for the elderly) is increasing both in relation to law No. 108 / 2006 Col. regarding social services but also in accordance with the recipients? wishes and demands...|$|R
40|$|Članak govori o izgradnji prve vukovarske sinagoge, 1845. godine, koja je ujedno i prva namjenski građena zgrada za sinagogu u tadašnjoj Trojednoj Kraljevini Hrvatskoj, Slavoniji i Dalmaciji. Protiv njezine gradnje ustalo je katoličko i pravoslavno stanovništvo. Projektirana je u klasicističkom stilu s reminiscencijama na egipatsku arhitekturu. The first synagogue in Vukovar, {{founded in}} 1845, {{was also the}} first {{dedicated}} building of synagogue in the Threefold Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia. The edifice of this synagogue provoked many protest of the majority of Catholic and Orthodox population. They tried to stop erection of synagogue by stressing that this construction was designed against <b>communal</b> <b>plan,</b> namely that it would narrow Gaj Street and thus complicate traffic in this street. In fact they were mostly afraid that this synagogue would encourage further immigration of Jews, who were considered as great competitors to the local tradesmen and craftsmen. Citizens of Vukovar protested before the government of County of Srijem, as well as before Josip Kuković the bishop of Đakovo. Regardless their efforts, they did not manage to stop the edification, since the Jewish Community acquired all the necessary legal grounds for their enterprise. Namely, Jews claimed that this was not to be a temple (synagogue), since such buildings were prohibited to build at that time, but only a praying house (Domus oratorium, Betthaus). Moreover, the president of Jewish Community at that time, Friedrich Singer, stated that this building had to have an auxiliary edifice with a kitchen. Finally, all this arguments were enough satisfactory to the city authorities and the synagogue was completed. This first synagogue in Vukovar was a rather small edifice but very interesting regarding its style, since embraced elements of classicism that dominate on the front facade (typical for the architecture {{of the first half of}} the nineteenth century) together with elements of Egyptian style (Egyptian revival) on the side facade. These Egyptian elements are rather common in the synagogue architecture at that time but in contemporary Croatia this was the only example. This edifice was used as synagogue till 1889, when it was replaced by a monumental temple in neo-Romanesque – neo-Mauro style. The old edifice was sold to the Calvin community in 1894 / 1895. Henceforth it was used as a Christian temple until it was demolished during the 60 s of the twentieth century...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} {{centered}} upon {{the conditions of}} the independent management of communal agriculture by local organs of state authority and administration and on the participation of those organs in planning and steering the agricultural production. The article discusses the notions of "steering" and "planning" and their interrelations in managing the agriculture in a commune. The object of managing is the agricultural production, the subjects of steering are all agricultural producers irrespective of the sectors they belong to, and the subjects of <b>communal</b> <b>planning</b> are farms designated in a plan (at present only private farms). Besides the introduction and conclusions, the article contains two main parts. The first is concerned with theoretical grounds of steering the agriculture and with the symptoms of the communal organs' activity in steering the agricultural production. The second part contains the remarks on the scope and forms of a socio-economic plan of a commune with respect to agriculture. The author points out to the indicative character of communal plans drafted at present. The author concludes that at present the degree of independence of local organs of state authority and administration in managing the development of agriculture in their territory is insignificant. The above referrs both to steering and planning since local organs are not authorized to determine the steering norms, nor have they adequate means to carry out independently the plans. Local organs are in the first place the executors of the state policy and their activity as the representatives of the interests of a local community is limited.

The research which was carried out among teachers working in the first triad of primary school in twelve different statistic regions of Slovenia has proved that inner differentiation and individualization are fulfilled at different subjects, at various stages of education and at different frequencies. The form, scale, instructions and writing time of written assessments and tests are adjusted as well. Work is mostly adjusted to average pupils’ abilities. The individual approach and frontal teaching are still most frequently used by teachers. Most of them apply a combination of various teaching methods. However, less {{emphasis is placed on}} the introduction of modern teaching approaches (project work, cooperative learning) and consideration of individual’s styles of perception.

40|$|Social and {{economic}} changes provoke changes in housing needs, aspirations and options. Families with children, who constitute the germ cells at {{the nucleus of}} society, are owed particular attention in this respect. Because parents are bound by their caring duties during the children's minority, {{they are subject to}} a number of restraints and exigencies as regards their choice of living environment. These kinds of households, therefore, have many special characteristics and needs which may be strongly affected by changes in their local environment which in turn affect their everyday life. In Germany, the shift from Fordism, with its prescribed role models, family structure and living patterns, into Late Modern Society, in which these patterns are seen to have evolved and changed, has been seen to have impacted on families' housing options. Suburban lifestyle has been regarded as the dominant pattern for decades; now urban environments are being discussed as suitable options for families as they are seen to provide more timely opportunities for enmeshing child rearing and career. Although in fact there is a certain awareness of families in inner city areas, official statistics continue to indicate that families are still moving to the outskirts. The thesis postulated for this study implies that the mobility of families is not in fact dictated by dominant pattern but rather by their individual lifestyle choices, as well as their typical needs {{and the quality of the}} settlement structures (open to them). Part A of the thesis defines “family” more precisely and explains the different dimensions of family life (parameters?) including individual needs of the individual members, effects of social change, and typical strategies for dealing with constraints. They can be separated into qualitative, (e. g. traffic abatement) quantitative, (e. g. number of rooms), and time management aspects, (e. g. saving time thanks to structures for improving flexibility, for externalizing and rationalizing). The results lead to a kind of catalogue of requirements. This catalogue serves for a matrix that allows comparison between different types of settlement structure and examination of their fitness for families. Part B presents the explorative section of the research. Duesseldorf and Neuss-Allerheiligen were chosen as examples of urban and suburban structures. In both places, families were selected for interviews from Late Modern Society - social types with both parents working. They were asked about their motivation in choosing the areas they lived in at present, about their housing situation and about their daily routines and on-site time management. Their answers have been described, systematized in theme complexes and analysed. Part C contains the conclusions of the research. One significant result is the evident increase of options, because urban as well as suburban settlement structures evidently provide opportunities for good living conditions. Families are interpreting spaces in new ways, modifying their functions and making them fit. Thus the importance of pattern is giving way to the superimposition of individual lifestyles. An ex-ample of the strengths of the suburban choice is the “home advantage” As many of the parents in the study grew up in suburban settings themselves, they are able to draw on a good supporting network, (friends, grandparents and their neighbors). Some even venture into establishing “multi-generational” households in a developing area. A strength of the urban ambiance is a certain “flatrate-city-character,” which allows parents the flexibility to open larger windows of time in their daily schedules allowing for more opportunities for their multiple activities. Furthermore, cities offer specialized locations for like-minded persons to share, where everyday life can be extended into public space and social networks developed in this way. The results of this research conclude with recommendations for action in the field of town planning, because one of the most important challenges for those responsible for <b>communal</b> <b>planning</b> is to provide attractive and suitable living spaces - especially for families...|$|E

Long term and short - term plans for Ivančna Gorica are initially introduced for the period from 1986 to 2000 and the new local spatial plan. Our interest was to know how many surface of building sites are there still free and within existing spatial plans. On the basic of comparison between short and long term plans in the municipality of Ivančna Gorica in the period 1986 - 2000 and the new <b>communal</b> spatial <b>plan,</b> we analyzed the structure of all kinds of sites in the existing and planned strategic spatial document, specially the range of farming lands and the inference on those lands. Considering that the number of constructing permits in cadastral counties is not going to change drastically, we were discovering how much the year acquirement on lands permitted to build is and how long will the existing stock of lands on the mentioned area will be enough. On the basic of the analyze on prices of real estate in the municipality of Ivančna Gorica in the period from 2007 to 2010 we were discovering if the prices of real estate on areas where they built the most in the past, increased faster than in other places. We discovered that there is 25, 50 ha of free building sites within existing spatial plans.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a draft {{sustainable development}} framework for Ngai Tahu landholders. The notion of sustainable development, {{by its very}} nature, is problematic. This is {{because there are so}} many criteria by which the development or growth of an entity through time can be assessed. For example there are multiple perspectives from various academic disciplines to be taken into account, as well as those embedded within traditional values and knowledge at a flax-roots level. This paper attempts to take account of this complexity through the development of a sustainable development planning process, which attempts to formulate courses of action that are well-informed by specialists from various academic disciplines, as well as by knowledge from within flax-roots Maori communities. Initially this paper provides a literature review regarding current Maori sustainable landuse research within Aotearoa, in the attempt to encapsulate the ‘complexity’ of the issue at hand. Although this body of research provides important insights regarding the sustainable development of Maori land, it has a number of limitations, which are critically highlighted within this paper. From this literature review the sustainable development planning processes is developed. Further a conceptual sustainable land development model is offered, which provides a ‘yardstick’ from which sustainable landuse can be monitored. This model however must be considered a work in progress open to continuous and ongoing revision. The overall purpose of this sustainable development framework is threefold. First it is a basis from which Maori landholders, including private, corporate and <b>communal,</b> can <b>plan</b> the development of their whenua. Second it is a basis from which landholders can derive, maintain and enhance cultural benefits from their whenua, from social, economic and environmental perspectives. Third, it is a foundation from which a monitoring framework can be developed to assess the performance of land management practices across a range of indices, including; social, economic, ecological and cultural criteria...|$|R
40|$|A {{position}} paper on {{land use planning}} and implementation in rural Zimbabwe. The paper explores the process and impact of land use planning and implementation in the communal lands of Kanyati, Kariba District, Mashonaland West Province in Zimbabwe. It traces history back to the colonial governments initial attempts to <b>plan</b> <b>communal</b> lands {{with the objective of}} marginalising Africans to less productive areas of the country. This fueled the war of liberation and Zimbabwe won its independence in 1980, Thereafter, the new government embarked on a Land Reorganisation and Resettlement Programme with the aim to address the inherited inequitable distribution of land. Both programmes have been implemented mostly in the marginal areas of Natural Regions III, IV (48 %) and NR V (6 %) which are subject to seasonal droughts. This, coupled with communal tenure systems and the continued population increase, means that renewable natural resources in communal lands (previously called Reserves) are often mismanaged and over-exploited, sometimes in favor of agricultural intensification or livestock production. This has already resulted in severe land degradation in the communal lands. This situation is continuing as the government is slowly implementing the land reform programmes...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{landscape and}} habitat (vegetation) scale foraging of cattle and sheep at two communal {{villages in the}} Eastern Cape, South Africa, to determine the key resources utilised during the dry season. At the landscape scale, cattle at both sites displayed overall preference for the arable lands at this time, although this diminished steadily as the dry season progressed. In contrast, sheep made considerably less use of these areas, showing only sporadic preference. At the vegetation scale, cattle demonstrated greatest preference for crop residues and uncultivated ‘commonage' areas, although foraging in grassland increased considerably in the latter stages of the dry season. Sheep utilised a much smaller range of vegetation types, preferring crop residues and fields that had been recently fallow and avoiding all other vegetation categories. We suggest that given the spatial limitations in <b>planned,</b> <b>communal</b> villages, the arable lands function as key resource areas for livestock during the dry season. It is recommended that management of these areas emphasise greater integration of sheep and cattle grazing and focus on maintaining vegetation heterogeneity {{in order to facilitate}} opportunistic ‘switching' in foraging patterns at different stages of the dry season...|$|R

Participatory forestry has the potential to provide benefits to local people and improve livelihoods but communities are obliged to formulate manage-ment plans for their common forest resources to realize this potential. The aim of the present study is to describe the use and relative importance of woodland tree species to rural people in semi-arid Tanzania, and to compare the findings with the use and importance of trees retained or planted on private land. This was done in order to match local needs and preferences in <b>planning</b> <b>communal</b> forests management as well as tree planting on private land. Quantitative ethnobotany was used to estimate use-values for tree species found in the area. The Kaguru people utilized all available tree resources in a diversified and complex manner. Use differed between user groups and gender, varied with land tenure systems, and fluctuated with seasons. Most informants expressed concern about dwindling tree resources and the need for changes in management schemes. Key informants listed 22 indigenous tree species as extremely valuable for construction and commercial purposes of which 10 were locally extinct. Wood scarcity and commercialisation are suggested as the main driving forces for tree planting. Villagers achieved greater access to scarce tree resources by plantin...|$|R

Waste will give a negative efect on health and the environment if not handled and managed properly. Hamlet Kepek 1, Kepek, Wonosari have realized the impact that arises when household waste is not managed properly. For that, some residents have initiated a communal waste management and manufacture of communal sanitation pipelines. Conventionally, communal sanitary pipe network planning and data requires a huge cost, for it takes breakthrough of utilization of appropriate technology to facilitate the planning process and reduce the cost incurred. Utilization of small format aerial photographs resulting from the unmanned aircraf vehicle (UAV) used as an alternative technology in the <b>planning</b> <b>communal</b> sanitation pipelines. Analytical methods to create a map of the communal sanitation pipelines through least cost path analysis. Utilization of UAV technology is expected to make the <b>planning</b> of <b>communal</b> sanitary pipelines with good results and at afordable costs. Te result of small format aerial photography from unmanned aircraf vehicle (UAV) can be used to produce the spatial data with high resolution. Small format aerial photographs produced is then processed to obtain the orthophoto image and the image of Digital Surface Model (DSM). Both kinds of remote sensing image are then used as the main data to create maps of the communal sanitation pipelines.

30|$|The {{preparedness}} of stakeholders {{to manage}} crises whose frequency and intensity {{is likely to}} increase is a key element in the management of vulnerable coastal spaces. Several {{studies have shown that the}} damages caused by recent disasters in coastal areas have been aggravated by the local authorities’ lack of preparedness (Daniels et al. 2011; Genovese et al. 2011; Genovese and Przyluski 2013). It is not enough to know and prevent risk: we also need to be prepared to manage the resulting crises (Lagadec 1993, 2001, 2004, 2012; Egli 2013). In this perspective, the CRISSIS project aims to help local stakeholders use the new findings produced through the analysis of the three dimensions of risk. Two crisis management exercises were thus organized from the outset: one took place halfway through the project to test the uptake of crisis management procedures (« <b>Plan</b> <b>Communal</b> de Sauvegarde » (PCS), or « Municipal Rescue Plan ») by local authority staff; a second more ambitious test took place at the end of the program, with the objective of testing the PCS again but this time by integrating new data produced as part of the program’s findings. Overall, the objective of CRISSIS has been to both generate new knowledge to improve risk prevention and help optimize crisis management by local stakeholders by facilitating the prioritization and classification of actions in the event of a flood. After a brief introduction of its study area, this paper will describe the methodology that guided its operational approach to coastal flood risk, before presenting its key findings.|$|R
40|$|The Mecca {{of today}} {{displays}} a concrete {{image of a}} modern city. Contemporary buildings and <b>planned</b> <b>communal</b> spaces following the rules of 21 st century architecture dominate the plains of this religious hub. This process of change on the Meccan cityscape can be traced {{through a number of}} factors; population growth, the globalization of the world, oil and its ties with the West. However, one factor lies key in triggering these changes - the Saudi-Wahhabi takeover of 1916. During the early beginnings of the First World War the Ottoman Empire was coming to a gradual end, loosing her power and influence on the lands under her rule. Challenged with fighting enemies on the western front, Ottoman focus on the Hijaz region shifted, offering a leeway for the Wahhabi faction to gain in strength and overthrow the Anatolian control, acclaiming the area known today as Saudi Arabia. This thesis aims to focus on what the consequential influences of the Wahhabi takeover in the 1920 s were for the cityscape of Mecca through discussing: the differences between Mecca’s administrative styles under the diverging rule of the Ottoman Empire and the current Saudi decree; the religious background and effects the main principles of Wahhabism played on Meccan architecture; the discovery of oil and its repercussions of modernization and globalization; and the possible instigation of a new Islamic paradigm of Mecca, since its image has been altered so drastically. A time frame will be placed 2, starting from {{the early stages of the}} 20 th century, where the Ottoman Empire’s reign came to an end, up until the modern day Wahhabi rule...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) {{have several}} important similarities including worldwide distribution, hepato-tropism, similar modes of transmission {{and the ability}} to induce chronic infection that may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since both viruses are individually known to cause the pathologies mentioned above, co-infection with both HBV and HCV would be expected to be linked with higher morbidity as well as mortality and impact healthcare resource utilisation. Precise estimate of the prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection would be needed to formulate policy decisions and <b>plan</b> <b>communal</b> health interventions. This systematic review and meta-analysis, therefore, aims to understand the prevalence of HBV and HCV co-infection in India based on the available literature. Following PRISMA guidelines, primary studies reporting the prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection in India were retrieved through searches conducted in PubMed, Google SCHOLAR, Medline, Cochrane Library, WHO reports, Indian and International journals online. All online searches were conducted between December 2016 and February 2017. Meta-analysis was carried out using StatsDirect statistical software. Thirty studies published between 2000 and 2016 conducted across six regions of India were included in this review. The pooled HBV/HCV co-infection prevalence rate across the thirty studies was 1. 89 % (95 % confidence intervals [CI] = 1. 2 %– 2. 4 %). A high heterogeneity was observed between prevalence estimates. The HBV/HCV co-infection prevalence in different subgroups varied from 0. 02 % (95 % CI = 0. 0019 %– 0. 090 %) to 3. 2 % (95 % CI = 1. 3 %– 5. 9 %). The pooled prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection in India was found to be 1. 89 %. This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed high prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection in chronic liver patients, followed by HIV-positive patients, and then followed by persons who inject drugs and kidney disease patients...|$|R
40|$|Improving the {{long-term}} sustainability and resilience of smallholder agriculture in Africa is {{highly dependent on}} conserving or {{improving the quality of}} the natural resource. Conservation agriculture is conceived around more integrated and effective management strategies for provisioning both food and other ecosystem services. If unattended to, land degradation would reduce agricultural productivity and increase pressure on marginal environments in the Tigray highlands of Ethiopia, adversely affecting food security and livelihoods of smallholder farmers. This paper answers some pertinent questions about mass mobilization of free compulsory labor for ecological restoration in Tigray. It details perception of changes in climate; the process of collective decisionmaking; resistance, documentation, and enforcement of rules; methods of conflict resolution; knowledge and information networks; arrangements for benefit sharing of communal resources; and the role of gender in mass mobilization for communal work. We analyzed data collected from 20 villages in 3 districts in the Tigray region through a household survey using a structured questionnaire, focus group discussions, and personal observations. The results reveal that the people are motivated to provide their free labor to restore the ecology to increase agricultural productivity and production to avoid food insecurity and improve their general livelihood. Availability of institutions in terms of grassroots organizations and rules and regulations was {{a major factor in the}} positive response to the call for action. The commitment of the government at both the national and local levels (through sensitization and mobilization for group formation and provision of tools and construction materials); the ethnic homogeneity of the population; and the existence of the Orthodox Church, where most of the people were members, were major factors for the success of the community mobilization for collective action in Tigray. Social networking with neighbors, the clergy, and leaders of grassroots organizations provided the knowledge and information on climate variability and solutions required to conserve the ecology and improve human livelihood. We also observed that there were no differences in gender division of labor except that women worked half the workload of men in a day; the women also did the cooking and cleaned up the surroundings after eating at the site. Both men and women played active roles in leadership with regard to mobilization of people, <b>communal</b> work <b>planning</b> and scheduling, conflict resolution, and sharing of community products. An impact assessment of the ecological conservation in Tigray on agricultural productivity and production and food security would be useful. It will be interesting to replicate the study in other areas in Ethiopia and other countries where the societies may not be homogenous to find out the level of commitment of the people to communal work.
