However, in odontocete cetaceans behavioural and/or genetic evidence from populations of four species indicate that {{both males and females}} {{remain in their}} natal group or site. For <b>coastal</b> <b>resident</b> bottlenose dolphins field data suggest that both sexes are philopatric to their natal site. Assignment tests and analyses of relatedness based on microsatellite markers were used to investigate this hypothesis in resident bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, from two small coastal populations of southeastern Australia. Mean corrected assignment and mean relatedness were higher for resident females than for resident males. Only 8 % of resident females had a lower probability than average of being born locally compared to 33 % of resident males. Our genetic data contradict the hypothesis of bisexual philopatry to natal site and suggest that these bottlenose dolphins are not unusual amongst mammals, with females being the more philopatric and males the more dispersing sex. 6 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{are one of}} only a few mammalian taxa {{where the}} males are known to cooperate within their social group in order to maintain mating access to single females against other males. Male bonds in bottlenose dolphins have been hypothesized as evolving through kinship and associated inclusive fitness effects. In this study we tested whether individually identified male bottlenose dolphins preferentially associate and form alliances with kin in a small <b>coastal</b> <b>resident</b> population of southeastern Australia using a combination of behavioural data, genetic sexing, sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control region and nuclear microsatellite markers. Males generally associated significantly more often than expected with one to three other males, with whom they jointly herded females for mating. Associations and alliance membership were not associated with either maternal kinship or genetic relatedness. The majority of male pairs within alliances were randomly related, although high relatedness values were found between males of different alliances in the resident population. These findings indicate that mechanisms other than kin selection may be foremost in the development and maintenance of cooperation between male bottlenose dolphins...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Sharing song types with {{immediate}} neighbors {{is widespread}} in birds with song repertoires, and sharing songs may confer a selective advantage in some cases. Levels of song sharing vary between dierent geo-graphical populations of several bird species, and eco-logical dierences often correlate with dierences in singing behavior; in particular, males in migratory sub-species often share fewer songs than males in resident subspecies. The song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) ap-pears to fit this pattern: resident song sparrows in western North America generally share 20 – 40 % of their repertoire (of about eight songs) with each neighbor, while migratory subspecies from eastern North America often share 10 % or less. We compared song sharing in two populations {{within a single}} subspecies of song sparrow (M. m. morphna) in Washington State. These populations, separated by only 120 km, nonetheless dier in migratory tendencies and several other ecolog-ical and life history variables.

40|$|With this poster {{we aim to}} {{disclose}} the ecological characteristics of the resident ichthyofauna in three distinct SE- NW aligned sites off the S coast of Terceira Island, Azores, Portugal. We collected both direct and indirect data about those species near the shoreline – Serretinha, in a close by islet complex – Cabras and over an offshore rocky outcrop – Fradinhos. The work was divided into two parts: a) specimen’s collection for biological sampling, namely the determination of both hepatic and gonadossomatic indexes for the eventual detection of reproductive peaks; and b) stomach content’s analyses to describe the food habits of these most common coastal species. We also developed a series of underwater transects in order to count individuals and thus to describe the resident communities in these three sites regarding a) richness, b) evenness and c) diversity. Main abiotic factors were also registered in order to study possible correlations with the above mentioned data. Azorean ichthyofauna is still poorly known {{especially in terms of}} ecological interactions between <b>coastal</b> <b>resident</b> species in several substrates. The few available literature references do present several gaps when reporting to the region’s coastal fish communities. Here we describe resident coastal fish communities in the three study sites as well as the determination of their dominant species, checking significant correlations within biotic and abiotic facts in their distribution and reproductive periods and determine main indexes for diversity, evenness and richness.

40|$|The rise of {{offshore}} water {{caused by the}} high winds of a low pressure weather system, or storm surge, is a hurricane’s greatest threat to human life. As weather forecasters struggle to enable <b>coastal</b> <b>residents</b> to make timely evacuation decisions, the need arises for more visually compelling and interactive storm surge visualization tools. This paper presents an interactive and three-dimensional storm surge visualization system. It integrates road, topographic, and building data to construct accurate three-dimensional models of major cities in the State of Florida. Storm surge data are then used to construct a three-dimensional ocean positioned over the terrain models. Ambient details such as wind, vegetation, ocean waves, and traffic are animated based on up-to-date wind and storm surge data. Videos of the storm surge visualizations are recorded and made available to <b>coastal</b> <b>residents</b> through a web-interface.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Protected area creation, {{including}} {{creation of}} marine reserves (MRs), is increasingly molded by ecosystem based management (EBM) that integrates biological and social {{information in the}} pre and post establishment phases. Collecting social data from large and representative samples of the public (as opposed to other stakeholder groups) before establishing a MR would provide information about residents proximal and more distant to the reserve. These data are currently lacking for Oregon's system of five newly established MRs. This thesis examines <b>coastal</b> <b>resident</b> knowledge, intentions, attachment, and attitudes toward these reserves, and their perceived similarity and social trust in agencies responsible for managing these areas. This information may inform management of Oregon's MRs, help create a scientifically grounded description of resident perceptions of MRs in this state, and fill {{an important component of}} the EBM approach. Policy creation and public engagement based on this information will yield more inclusive protected area creation and management strategies, increasing the probability of conserving resources in a socially acceptable manner. This thesis, therefore, contains two standalone articles based on a mail survey of Oregon coastal residents (n = 595) that sought to understand their knowledge, trust, attitudes, and intentions associated with MRs in this state, and how these cognitions vary depending on geographic proximity and level of attachment to these areas. The first article examined the influence of <b>coastal</b> <b>resident</b> proximity and place attachment on their self-assessed and factual knowledge associated with these MRs. Residents tended to report higher self-assessed knowledge than factual knowledge, which was low with 65 % answering half or fewer of the 16 factual questions correctly. Self-assessed and factual knowledge did not differ between communities proximate to and more distant from these MRs. Factual knowledge also did not differ substantively based on attachment to the reserves, but attachment did influence some aspects of self-assessed knowledge about the MRs where those with higher attachment to these areas felt that they had slightly higher self-assessed knowledge. The second article examined relationships among resident knowledge about the MRs, their perceived similarity and trust in the agency currently responsible for these areas, and their attitudes and behavioral intentions associated with the areas. Residents expressed relatively high similarity and trust in the agency, with those living closest to the MRs expressing the highest similarity and trust. The majority of residents had favorable attitudes toward possible benefits of these MRs and would vote in support of these reserves (69 %). Residents living in communities of place nearest these reserves had the most positive attitudes and would be the most likely to vote in support of these areas (82 %). Path modeling showed that residents who perceived themselves to share similar goals and opinions as the agency were most likely to trust this agency. Those with higher trust in this agency also had more favorable attitudes toward possible benefits of the MRs, and had less agreement with potential constraints of these areas. Residents who expressed more favorable attitudes toward potential benefits of the MRs would be most likely to vote in support of these areas, whereas those who agreed with potential constraints would be less likely to vote in support. Management and research implications of results presented in both of these articles are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Population-level {{distribution}} strategies, such as migration, nomadism or residency, form {{often as}} a result of spatio-temporal resource dynamics. While commonly a species will adopt a single strategy across its range, occasionally multiple strategies can be observed. In Australia, the eastern grass owl Tyto longimembris is considered nomadic over most of its range. However, resident populations have been reported along the eastern coastal zone. We collected and analysed regurgitated pellets of a <b>coastal</b> <b>resident</b> population across three seasons in a single year. We compared these data with the availability of prey in the field to investigate whether resource predictability and foraging behaviour facilitate shifts between nomadism and residency. Many of the prey species consumed by the resident population display little spatial or temporal variation compared with prey consumed by nomadic populations. Temporal differences were observed in the diet with the main prey species (house mouse) declining from 88. 9 % in summer to 66. 7 % in winter and 40. 0 % in spring (P< 0. 01). Conversely, bird and rat consumption increased across the three seasons (16. 3, 28. 6 and 34. 0 % for birds, P= 0. 08; and 15. 0, 33. 3 and 75. 0 % for rats, P< 0. 01; for summer, winter and spring, respectively). Trapping resulted in the capture of house mouse Mus domesticus only, which declined significantly from the first half to {{the second half of the}} year (P< 0. 01). These data indicate that the eastern grass owl in the coastal zone is a specialist predator of small rodents, but will broaden its diet to feed opportunistically on a range of other species when the preferred prey are less abundant. We conclude that the capacity to switch between specialized and opportunistic predation, combined with prey that are spatially and temporally more predictable, facilitates shifts between nomadism and residency in the eastern grass owl...|$|E
40|$|Global declines of shark {{populations are}} of concern {{because of their}} largely assumed role as moderators of {{ecosystem}} function. Without long-term data on movement patterns for many species, {{it is impossible to}} infer relative extinction risk, which varies as a function of range, dispersal and habitat specificity and use. The past 50 yr of research on coastal sharks has revealed common movement patterns among species. In the horizontal plane, measured home range size generally increases with body size. We demonstrate meta-analytically the effects of increasing body size and monitoring time on home range size. Changes in the extent of horizontal movement might arise from ontogeny, predator avoidance or environmental tolerances. In the vertical plane, movement patterns include oscillatory vertical displacement, surface swimming, diel vertical migration and swimming at depth. These vertical movements are often attributed to foraging or navigation, but have been quantified less than horizontal patterns. Habitat specificity is often correlated with environmental conditions such as depth, salinity, substratum, and in some cases, prey availability. Site fidelity is common in species that use nursery areas. However, fidelity to mating, pupping, feeding and natal sites has only been observed in a few species. To date, few studies have examined habitat partitioning, although some general patterns have emerged: habitats appear to be subdivided by benthos type, prey availability and depth. The conservation of coastal sharks can be facilitated in some cases by the use of marine protected areas, especially for <b>coastal</b> <b>resident</b> species using specific nursery, reproduction or feeding areas. Partial protected-area closures might be effective during aggregation or migration periods to protect older size classes, but these must be applied with other management strategies such as reduced fishing and size or bag limits to protect individuals throughout different life history phases. More long-term research on habitat use, migration patterns and habitat partitioning is essential for developing successful management initiatives for coastal shark populations. 19 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 94 - 111). This study {{seeks to}} explore relationships between social power and wetland management in Louisiana. Wetlands are an integrated component {{of nearly all}} aspects of life in coastal Louisiana. Not only do they provide habitat for a bounty of sea life, they also safeguard nationally significant shipping and oil and gas infrastructure from storm damage and other environmental elements. Furthermore, farming, fishing, and hunting have provided viable livelihoods for coastal residents for countless generations. Today, there is growing concern that coastal wetland restoration and protection is now increasingly urgent, as evidenced in Louisiana's 2012 Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast. Yet, state attempts to support wetland restoration and protection goals {{have in the past}} fared poorly, as economic imperatives are juxtaposed against socio-ecological ones. This is perhaps best exemplified by wetland management programs in Terrebonne Parish, a key site of wetland loss and of extractive activities from the oil and gas industry. These processes have disproportionately affected residents of Terrebonne Parish. While the first private wetland mitigation bank in the United States was established in Terrebonne Parish, this has not resulted in a decline in wetland loss - quite the contrary. The purpose of this thesis is to undertake a political ecology approach as a means to analyze how institutional arrangements for wetland management are embedded in social power relationships operating at different scales. In this way I critically examine the practical application of the meanings and practices of wetland management as presented in the current policy framework for managing Louisiana's wetlands, the 2012 Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast. This analysis reveals the contradictory logics and tensions of the Plan, demonstrating that while expressing concern over the wetlands of Louisiana, it does so without questioning the processes which destroy(ed) them in the first place. This serves to further prioritize economic interests over socio-ecological factors while couched in discourses of sustainability.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIOne of {{the fastest}} growing uses of stable isotope {{analysis}} in ecology is using hydrogen isotope (delta H- 2) values to characterize animal movement and migration strategies. Most studies measure delta H- 2 values in metabolically inert tissues such as feathers, which are typically grown during or just after the summer breeding season and provide a limited snapshot of an individual's annual life history. In contrast, isotopic analysis of metabolically active tissues can provide ecological information integrated over weeks to months prior to sampling. Here we characterize delta H- 2 patterns among multiple metabolically inert and active tissues in Cinclodes, a genus of South American songbirds noted for variation in altitudinal movement and foraging strategies. We also coupled delta H- 2 with carbon (delta C- 13) and nitrogen (delta N- 15) isotope data to combine information on movement with marine versus terrestrial resource use at the individual level. We find that a combination of physiological and ecological factors control delta H- 2 patterns among tissues, which mirrors results of feeding experiments on captive birds. For example, in the <b>coastal</b> <b>resident</b> C. nigrofumosus, metabolically active muscle collected during the winter has higher delta H- 2 values than feathers grown the previous summer, a tissue-specific discrimination pattern previously observed in captive birds. This pattern is reversed to various degrees for altitudinal migrants such as C. fuscus and C. oustaleti that spend winters foraging in marine intertidal habitats but migrate to high elevation and forage in stream habitats during the summer. We also find that among altitudinal migrants, individuals that forage sympatrically in intertidal habitats during the winter appeared to summer at a wide range of elevations, as evidenced by large differences of > 50 parts per thousand in delta H- 2 (muscle-feather) offsets. Lastly, a positive correlation between feather delta H- 2 and delta N- 15 values in Cinclodes that consume a mixed marine-freshwater diet confirms that delta H- 2 is a useful proxy for quantifying marine resource use. We anticipate that comparison of delta H- 2 values in metabolically active and inert tissues may allow for the reconstruction of animal movement and foraging strategies within the annual life cycle; however, more work is required to better understand the physiological mechanisms responsible for the observed delta H- 2 patterns among tissues.

40|$|With {{more people}} in the world living along coasts than any other environment, {{planning}} for the coastal zone requires negotiating the socially constructed human relationships that have traditionally produced severe inequality between <b>coastal</b> <b>residents</b> and users. In Louisiana, this inequality is apparent in the great deal of wealth external users have extracted from the coast at the direct environmental and economic expense of local residents. An examination of the economic history of Louisiana's coast reveals how this disparity between <b>coastal</b> <b>residents</b> and users has produced deleterious environmental consequences, which have grown exponentially precisely because this inequality between human residents and users persists today. The current coastal restoration and management strategy in Louisiana does not focus on the socially constructed origins of this continuing environmental destruction, but it must do so in order to restore any hope of saving, restoring, and improving the coast. This thesis offers a socially reconstructed strategy for coastal restoration and management in Louisiana that narrows the environmental and economic disparity between <b>coastal</b> users and <b>residents</b> to address the environmental harm. This new wealth creation strategy enables local firms and residents to offer their existing knowledge of the coast and participate in the implementation of restoring and improving the natural assets of their coast through a variety of economic incentives. (cont.) In this way <b>coastal</b> <b>residents</b> are empowered to gain both the economic and environmental benefits of managing their coast, which I define as wealth. A case study of the Pulicat coastal community in Tamil Nadu, India provides valuable insights on how such a strategy can be implemented utilizing the existing civic and institutional infrastructure in Louisiana.
