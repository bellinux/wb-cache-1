25|$|Falun Gong {{initially}} enjoyed considerable {{official support}} {{during the early}} years of its development. It was promoted by the state-run Qigong Association and other government agencies. By the mid-1990s, however, Chinese authorities sought to rein in the influence of qigong practices and enacted more stringent requirements on the country’s various qigong denominations. In 1995 authorities mandated that all qigong groups establish Communist Party branches. The government also sought to formalize ties with Falun Gong and exercise greater control over the practice. Falun Gong resisted <b>co-optation,</b> and instead filed to withdraw altogether from the state-run qigong association.|$|E
25|$|During {{its first}} anniversary in September 1997, the Republican Society itself sought {{publicity}} by showing a new, expanded list of members, which now included women and foreigners, such as Jeroen Brouwers, Remco Campert, Jaap van Heerden, André Haakmat, Jasperina de Jong, H.U. Jessurun d'Oliveira, Ite Rümke, André Spoor, Jan Timman, Adriaan Morrien, Theo Sontrop, Theo van Gogh and Theodor Holman. However, the Society's exclusivity by <b>co-optation</b> {{and the lack}} of public actions formed an obstacle to various politically active youths, who launched the New Republican Society (NRG) on 21 January 1998 in De Balie. On 28 January, the NRG jokingly proclaimed the Third Republic of the Netherlands on Dam Square, preceding queen Beatrix's 60th birthday celebrations. The two republican societies did soon decide to approach each other and possibly cooperate.|$|E

5000|$|The first Vinland Flags {{offered for}} sale were made by Patriotic Flags in 2004. Subsequently, the symbol has gained use as an ethnic flag by various groups in North America, {{including}} numerous vendors, some Germanic neopagan groups, and political groups who commodiously identify {{the name of the}} 11th century Norse colony at L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, called Vinland in the sagas, with the predominantly Anglo-American inhabited areas of the modern nations of Canada and the United States. (More narrowly it has been displayed at the Finnskogen festival, celebrating the Forest Finns, despite its Norwegian provenance.) [...] Also in the early 2000s the flag had been appropriated by the violent white supremacy skinhead group Vinlanders Social Club, and it was bruited that it could be defaced with the symbols of fellow hate groups. These initial inchoate <b>co-optations</b> had the philosophical concept of intentionality brought to bear, given the flag's change in usage.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{phenomenon}} of ‘Deep Learning,’ which {{has given us}} such science-fiction-like innovations as search tools in photographic applications and the growing reality of self-driving cars, is a new form, and subset, of ‘Machine Learning’ made possible by very recent innovations in computing. Machine Learning itself {{has been around for}} some decades – essentially pattern-recognition software that requires very substantial computing resources, which were, until very recently, mostly theoretical and hard to come by. Machine Learning was one avenue of the field of Artificial Intelligence known as Narrow A. I. – the kind of ‘artificial intelligence’ that was strictly limited in scope as a first-steps starting point of what came, as a result, to be known as General A. I. General A. I., known then as simply, ‘Artificial Intelligence’, was the 1950 s dream that brought us such things as Robbie the Robot, and more recently C 3 PO, and The Terminator: the kind of science fiction characters that remain the only manifestations of General Artificial Intelligence. ‘Deep Learning’ also continues engineering’s 1940 s trend of using language in a way that I will contest in this paper: a co-opting of words that have been used, in the past, to describe human activities, using them instead to describe what engineers have managed to make machines do. These <b>co-optations</b> reduce the richness of the word, making its referent an algorithm: a flow diagram that represents the bare essentials of what an engineer can understand and reproduce of a human activity; not the human activity itself. This diagram of the ‘engineering possible’ over-simplifies the human activity it tries to depict. With continued usage, {{the meaning of the word}} for us today has all-too-often become reduced to what the engineer has newly defined it to mean: something much less than it once was. In this paper I propose to attempt to roll back some of these <b>co-optations,</b> and to re-introduce some of the richness of the words that have been taken by engineering. I shall examine Turing’s seminal paper on the notion of a thinking machine. I shall be using the philosophical insights of Henri Bergson, especially in his book, Matter and Memory, and the discoveries of neuroscience and complexity scientists. I will try to show that the answer to Turing’s question, ‘Can machines think?’ remains a resounding, ‘No!’, and that notions such as ‘deep learning’ are in fact not only an inaccurate use of the very human experience of learning, but degrade the latter in using such a term...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} secure his power, Díaz engaged in various forms of <b>co-optation</b> and coercion. He played his people like a board game – {{catering}} to the private desires of different interest groups and playing off one interest against another. In order to satisfy any competing forces, such as the Mestizos and wealthier indigenous people, he gave them political positions of power {{that they could not}} refuse. He did {{the same thing with the}} elite Creole society by not interfering with their wealth and haciendas. Covering both pro and anti-clerical elements, Díaz was both the head of the Freemasons in Mexico and an important advisor to the Catholic bishops. Díaz proved to be a different kind of liberal than those of the past. He neither assaulted the Church (like most liberals) nor protected the Church. As for the Native American population, who were historically repressed, they were almost completely depoliticized; neither put on a pedestal as the core of Mexican society nor suppressed, and were largely left to advance by their own means. In giving different groups with potential power a taste of what they wanted, Díaz created the illusion of democracy and quelled almost all competing forces.|$|E
25|$|The church's {{situation}} {{began to}} improve in 1962, when {{relations with the}} state suddenly thawed, an event that coincided {{with the beginning of}} Romania's pursuit of an independent foreign policy course that saw the political elite encourage nationalism as a means to strengthen its position against Soviet pressure. The Romanian Orthodox Church, an intensely national body that had made significant contributions to Romanian culture from the 14th century on, came to be regarded by the regime as a natural partner. As a result of this second <b>co-optation,</b> this time as an ally, the church entered a period of dramatic recovery. By 1975, its diocesan clergy was numbering about 12,000, and the church was already publishing by then eight high-quality theological reviews, including Ortodoxia and Studii Teologice. Orthodox clergymen consistently supported the Ceaușescu regime's foreign policy, refrained from criticizing domestic policy, and upheld the Romanian government's line against the Soviets (over Bessarabia) and the Hungarians (over Transylvania). As of 1989, two metropolitan bishops even sat in the Great National Assembly. The members of the church's hierarchy and clergy remained mostly silent as some two dozen historic Bucharest churches were demolished in the 1980s, and as plans for systematization (including the destruction of village churches) were announced. A notable dissenter was Gheorghe Calciu-Dumitreasa, imprisoned {{for a number of years}} and eventually expelled from Romania in June 1985, after signing an open letter criticizing and demanding an end to the regime's violations of human rights.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the coup}} of June 1798, the Augereau coup did present a sharp {{break with the}} recent past. The new {{constitution}} reduced {{the role of the}} legislative branch (which now did not have the right of initiative), and expanded the powers of the Executive, which [...] now became known as the Staatsbewind (Regency of State). The elective principle was reduced to a formality: the Staatsbewind, originally consisting of the three directors taking part in the coup, expanded its membership by <b>co-optation</b> to twelve. This executive then appointed the first 35 members of the legislature. As vacancies arose, these were filled, as far as possible, on a provincial rota and according to national quotas of representatives of each province (much like the old States-General). Except for Holland, the old provinces were reconstituted. The local and provincial administrative organs continued to be elected - no longer by universal manhood suffrage, but by a system of census suffrage.|$|E
40|$|In {{this course}} {{we shall not}} {{investigate}} the praxis of the modern movements of architecture (such a thing would be impossible) but of the individual architects who have been singled out as the most prominent by an ongoing scholarship now some {{three quarters of a}} century old. In the ancient Greek language, the word praxis referred to activity engaged in by free men. To us, it is something that goes beyond practices, actions, or behavior. Today it is seen as a combination of reflection and action. Praxis, then, defines the historicity of the human person–that is, the place of each person in history. History, seen this way, becomes the combined result of individual historicities, each depending on individual praxis. Historical literature, in turn, {{is the result of the}} praxis of historians. In the method we shall follow, the “reflection and action that realizes pragmatically the historicity of human persons ” become, respectively, the iconology and iconography individually created by each architect. But created is here a relative term. Praxis usually results from transmuted <b>co-optations</b> of thoughts and works of others which the poeisis of the architect synthesizes and transforms into a metaphorical self-portrait. While our aim will be to discover through analysis these metaphorical self-portraits to the exten...|$|R
40|$|Palaeontologists Stephen J. Gould and Elisabeth Vrba {{introduced}} the term “ex-aptation” (Gould, Vrba, 1982; Vrba, Gould, 1986) {{with the aim}} of improving and enlarging the scientific language available to researchers studying the evolution of any useful character, instead of calling it an “adaptation” by default, coming up to what Gould named an “extended taxonomy of fitness” (Gould, 2002). With the extension to functional <b>co-optations</b> from non-adaptive structures (“spandrels”), the notion of exaptation expanded and revised the neo-Darwinian concept of “pre-adaptation” (which was misleading, for Gould and Vrba, in suggesting foreordination). Exaptation is neither a “saltationist” nor an “anti-Darwinian” concept and, from 1982 to date, was adopted by many researchers in evolutionary and molecular biology, and particularly in human evolution. Exaptation was also addressed with some theoretical objections. With respect to one of these - the “non-operationality objection” - we analyze the possible operationalization of the concept in two recent meaningful studies, and identify six directions of empirical research, necessary to test “adaptive vs. exaptive” evolutionary hypotheses. We then write on a comprehensive survey (available online) of the literature, and {{on the basis of this}} we make a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the adoption of the term among scientists who study human evolution. We discuss the epistemic conditions that may have influenced the adoption and appropriate use of exaptation, and comment on the benefits of an “extended taxonomy of fitness” in present and future studies on human evolution...|$|R

40|$|The {{cultural}} determinism summoned in {{the discourse}} on the ‘war on terror’ embraces gender frames that invigorate the Islam and the West divide. In a vacuum of historical, geo-political and economic contexts, such frames conjure a Muslim woman archetype in opposition to Western conceptualizations of modernity. Ignoring the social milieu, {{as well as the}} current global transformations affecting people’s lives globally, conjectures in singular <b>co-optations</b> that isolate traits from religious dispositions have implications in how Muslim gender issues are perceived and addressed. This thesis intends to reconceptualize the Muslim woman image in an attempt to move beyond the gender polemics of cultural determinism and divide. Using narrative enquiry, the study makes a comparative analysis to discover how Muslim women in two disparate societies – Australia and Kenya are responding to the dynamics of change accelerated by globalization. Through primary research, it captures the narratives of 40 women along the axis of the two major influences on their lives - modernization and Islamization enhanced by globalization. In tracing the way global paradigms and policy changes at the macro-level have affected Muslim women and the responses produced, it provides an unconventional frame to view the lives of contemporary Muslim women. The study contends that in general, the issues facing Muslim women in the rapidly changing environment can be understood as challenges internal and external to faith orientation. On the one hand, the forces of a modern global culture offer opportunities and channels to redefine aspects of daily living and lifestyles. On the other, a resurgence of Islam manifests itself in an assertion of religious observance, cultural identity, values and morality that increasingly question these settings. The challenges are not confined to minorities in the West, but also borne by many in non-Western societies. Through its research findings, the study proposes that culture in itself is not immutable or a constant, but cultural expression is a vital part of utilizing opportunities availed by development and central to the process of development itself. As the means of comprehension without which life, lifestyles, objectives, aspirations and much more cannot be expressed, given meaning or be implemented, cultural expression is a vital aspect of human development. Accommodating these in the multicultural settings of contemporary environments is evermore salient in the globalized world. As the world becomes more interdependent, the challenges for a global society manifest in how societies organize themselves; how citizens participate and how decisions on collective issues can be more congruent to facilitate a more socially sustainable development. Through its schedule, the study attempts to provide an insight into the issues and challenges facing Muslim women in contemporary times {{and in the course of}} its findings makes a case for the value of diversity, cultural expression and a sustained representation of Muslim women within development issues...|$|R

2500|$|This [...] "mutual liberation" [...] {{necessarily}} {{involves a}} [...] "liberation of oppressors from the evil they commit; otherwise {{there can be}} no liberation for a new community in justice and freedom." [...] However, the liberation of the oppressed takes priority and must involve their own agency in order for true justice and reconciliation to be enacted: [...] "In order to achieve this goal, the oppressed will have to free themselves from the constraints of oppression and cut themselves off from their oppressors, so as to find themselves and their own humanity. It is only after that that they can try to find a truly humane community with their previous oppressors." [...] This seeks to avoid either the dependency of the oppressed or the <b>co-optation</b> of the struggles of the oppressed by the oppressor. It is with this sensibility that Moltmann explores, in his Experiences in Theology, what various liberation theologies might mean for the oppressor: Black theology for whites, Latin American liberation theology for the First World, feminist theology for men, etc. He also moves beyond oppression as a mere personal sin and instead calls for oppressors to withdraw from the [...] "structures of violence" [...] that destroy the lives of the oppressed.|$|E

[...] Expressing a similar sentiment, director Jonathan Green acknowledges that [...] "Che is turning over in his grave" [...] because of the commercialization; in Green's view, Che's visage also {{has the potential to be}} a [...] "Trojan horse" [...] of capitalist marketing, by embedding itself into pop iconography.

I throw out these suggestions, as I have said, in ignorance of the practical difficulties that may lie in the way of carrying them into effect, on the general ground that personal and local influences are very subtle, and often unconscious, while the future greatness and efficiency of the noble institution which now commences its work must largely depend upon its freedom from them.|$|E
