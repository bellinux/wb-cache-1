50|$|In 1857, the Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science {{claimed the}} modern <b>chest</b> <b>expander</b> was invented and {{patented}} by Henry Cost, {{but does not}} provide the year it was invented.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chest</b> <b>expander</b> {{comprises}} {{a pair of}} handles {{joined by}} a variable number of springs or rubber cables. While still popular with some enthusiasts, steel springs have largely been superseded by rubber cables or tubing, although steel spring sets are still manufactured and sold {{around the world on}} a limited basis. The first rubberized versions appeared in 1857.|$|E
50|$|The Old Gym {{is on the}} National Register of Historic Places. The {{building}} {{consisted of}} a foundation of Tennessee limestone with a structure of wooden trusses and walls of natural finished red brick. The Mansard roof was covered with slate shingles. Some of the original gymnastic equipment included a leaping rig, a vaulting board, rowing machine, parallel bars, trapeze ropes, Indian clubs, dumb bells and a walnut <b>chest</b> <b>expander.</b>|$|E
30|$|Before implant insertion, {{especially}} in oncoplastic breast reconstruction, a tissue expander (Fig.  1) is usually {{placed in the}} mastectomy site to stretch the remaining skin {{in preparation for the}} placement of a permanent implant later. The expander is like an inflatable breast implant that is inserted into a pocket under the skin and muscle of the <b>chest.</b> The <b>expander</b> is usually placed in its collapsed form at the time of mastectomy and then, after surgery, fluid is introduced into the tissue expander to slowly inflate it. It is important to realise that, as their function is to expand, they might not be fully inflated and thus may appear to have multiple folds or wrinkles on the surface. This should not be interpreted as rupture [10]. Depending on the type of expander, the fluid is either introduced directly into the expander (magnetic marker) or is injected into a distant port. This process continues for several weeks until the tissue expander is filled to an optimal volume, when a permanent breast implant can be inserted.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Timely {{identification}} and prompt resuscitation of newborns {{in the delivery}} room may cause a decline in neonatal morbidity and mortality. We try to identify risk factors in mother and fetus that result in birth of newborns needing resuscitation at birth. Methods: Case notes of all deliveries and neonates born from April 2010 to March 2011 in Mahdieh Medical Center (Tehran, Iran), a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, were reviewed; relevant maternal, fetal and perinatal data was extracted and analyzed. Findings: During the study period, 4692 neonates were delivered; 4522 (97. 7 %) did not require respiratory assistance. One-hundred seven (2. 3 %) newborns needed resuscitation with bag and mask ventilation in the delivery unit, of whom 77 (1. 6 %) babies responded to bag and mask ventilation while 30 (0. 65 %) neonates needed endotracheal intubation and 15 (0. 3 %) were given <b>chest</b> compressions. Epinephrine/volume <b>expander</b> was administered to 10 (0. 2 %) newborns. In 17 patients resuscitation was continued for> 10 mins. There was a positive correlation between the need for resuscitation and following risk factors: low birth weight, preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, pre-eclampsia, prolonged rupture of membranes, abruptio placentae, prolonged labor, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, multiple pregnancy and fetal distress.

5000|$|The <b>chest</b> <b>expander</b> {{has been}} used for medical {{rehabilitation}} since at least 1851, and they have been used in some formal physical education programs since at least the 1880s. [...] By the end of the 1800s, they were a common household exercise device, found in many affluent homes in parts of Europe. [...] Strandpulling reached its height of popularity in the early 1900s, although they are still very commonly used as home-based exercise equipment.|$|E
50|$|Strandpulling with a <b>chest</b> <b>expander</b> can be {{done for}} a variety of fitness purposes, not just {{building}} chest muscles. There are several classic strandpulling movements, such as the Front Chest Pull and Lateral Raise, and many more totalling well over 30 movements for the upper body alone. Several of these classic strandpulling exercises have been used for competition, more so in the UK than elsewhere, and as a sport, it has enjoyed considerable popularity from time to time, with some competitors able to perform movements with enormous pullweights.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{horse racing}} {{starting}} barriers were simple ropes or occasionally wooden barriers behind which the horses stood. The first automated design was pioneered in Australia and {{was first used}} at an official race meeting in 1894. [...] Alexander Gray had concluded that the flapping of a starter's flag distracted the horses. An impetus for his invention was a £5 fine received by his son, Reuben, a jockey, for allowing his mount to step over the white chalk line that marked the start. His machine was first tried out at Canterbury Park Racecourse in New South Wales in February 1894. Gray's prototype consisted of a single strand of wire at about {{the height of the}} horse’s head that was attached to a spring at either end. When the device was activated the barrier sprang up and away from the horses. [...] Gray's single-strand barrier was among those first used. Versions of barriers designed by Alexander and Reuben Gray were installed at race tracks in Australia and overseas between 1894 and about 1932. By the 1920s the single strand barrier had evolved into a spring-powered five-strand device designed by Johnstone and Gleeson, but based on Gray's prototype, that resembled a strongman’s <b>chest</b> <b>expander.</b> Barriers assured fair starts to races. Fair race starts encouraged owners to enter horses in races and punters to bet, and they contributed to changing horse racing from a social sporting event into a billion dollar industry.|$|E
