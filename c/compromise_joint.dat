As part of this effort, agencies have used precast concrete slabs for more than 10 years with successive improvements in processes and systems. The Virginia Department of Transportation recently used two precast systems along with conventional cast-in-place repairs on a section of jointed reinforced concrete pavement on I- 66 near Washington, D.

40|$|SummaryRegenerative {{medicine}} is an emerging area that will influence {{the treatment of}} joint diseases in the future. It {{involves the use of}} biomaterials, cell therapy, and bioactive factors such as growth factors, drugs and small molecules, to regenerate damaged tissues. This “year in review” highlights a personal selection of promising studies published between March 2013 and March 2014 that inform on the direction in which this field is moving. This multidisciplinary field has been very active, with rapid development of new technologies that emerge from basic sciences such as the possibility to generate pluripotent stem cells without genetic modification and genetic engineering of growth factors to enhance their capacity to induce tissue repair. The increasing knowledge of the interaction between all tissues in the joint, such as the effect of bone remodeling and synovial inflammation on cartilage repair, will eventually make tissue regeneration in a <b>compromised</b> <b>joint</b> environment possible...|$|R
40|$|AbstractApart {{from the}} {{ergonomic}} inconveniences, LESS surgery presents some specific technical difficulties {{such as the}} loss of instruments triangulation, and closer proximity of instruments, leading to clashing and crossing of the instruments {{both inside and outside}} the patient. In this case, the surgeons need to adopt a posture particularly appropriate for this task. However, it is not clear whether the movements of the upper-limb joints are able to destabilize other body segments, like it is the head segment. The UCM framework allowed the quantiﬁcation of the overall upper-limb joint variability into a task-relevant and task-irrelevant component. It was supposed that LESS surgery needs more flexibility by the surgeon than conventional laparoscopy, and that could <b>compromise</b> <b>joint</b> coordination. The results of the UCM analysis showed a positive degrees of freedom synergy index indicating that the co-variation of the upper-limb joint angles stabilizes the head posture of the surgeons in the anterior-posterior direction. There was not a statistically significant difference in the synergy index between the LAP and LESS approach for the UCMs of both the left (t(7) = 1. 76,p = 0. 12) and right side joint spaces (t(7) = 1. 127,p = 0. 902). However, important differences can be appreciated individually. The results showed that the underlying framework was able to quantify surgeons’ motor variability, providing inspiration for new human-machine interaction designs, as well as more targeted ergonomics assessments...|$|E
40|$|Multi-agency public {{protection}} {{practice has}} received significant media and government scrutiny in recent years, {{in response to}} failings to protect those most vulnerable people in society. Despite an appreciation by agencies that there are resource and outcome benefits to collaborative practice, how safeguarding public protection policy may be integrated into practice and education is often challenging. Public protection legislation directs core agencies to co-operate and work together with governmental direction setting out key shared safeguarding responsibilities and arrangements for individuals, professional groups and teams. Despite this there still remain difficulties between organisations to understand each other's priorities and responsibilities. This can then transpose to an individual level where entrenched professional divisions can <b>compromise</b> <b>joint</b> working. Many health and social care curricula invest in inter-professional education to encourage exploration of information sharing, reporting and case management. However, when public protection issues are considered, uni-professional and inter-professional education tends to focus on single silos of harm, for example child and adult protection, radicalisation or domestic abuse. This paper discusses the development, application and future possibilities for innovation of a unique educational tool to address this gap in public protection multi-agency education. The tool aims to support understanding of key public protection issues in Scotland by encouraging learners within undergraduate and practice environments to recognise risk, explore overlapping and ?grey areas? of harm and understand partner agency best practice and response whilst encouraging cross-sector working, appreciation and support. Through gaining insight into other agencies safeguarding roles the learner {{has the opportunity to}} gain a deeper insight and broader perspective of the complexities of interventions beyond their own discipline whilst recognising opportunities for joint resource management...|$|E
40|$|Evolution {{has led to}} {{specialised}} shapes {{for each}} individual joint which are created during prenatal development through joint morphogenesis. Alterations or abnormalities in joint shape development can severely <b>compromise</b> <b>joint</b> function and have long-term health implications. Mechanical stimulation, due to fetal movements, {{plays an important role}} in the creation of joint shapes and a reduction in fetal movements has been highlighted as a risk factor for bone and joint shape malformation, which can lead to physical disability. This doctorate explored the relationship between mechanical stimulation and joint morphogenesis. A novel culture system was created in which embryonic chick hindlimb explants were subjected to controlled and quantified magnitudes of movements. The morphology of the knee joint from explants cultured under different mechanical conditions were compared to reveal how the magnitude of applied movement affects key aspects of the developing joint. A complex relationship was found between the magnitude of movement and the progression of joint shape development. This study provided evidence, for the first time, that the amount of movement experienced during development is a significant variable that impacts of the fate of prenatal joint development. Whilst dynamic movements were applied to developing joints, potential mechanotransduction pathways were tested for their involvement in modulating joint morphogenesis. Blocking the action of both stretch activated ion channels and voltage gated calcium channels produced joints shapes similar to those that had experienced no movement, suggesting the stimulating effects of dynamic movement were not acted upon. This research has provided a novel insight into how mechanical stimulation influences joint morphogenesis which is extremely valuable for understanding of the etiology of congenital joint conditions. Knowledge of how joints are first created is also valuable to the field of tissue engineering for developing treatments to regenerate degenerated joints. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Damage to the {{meniscus}} and {{articular cartilage}} {{in the knee}} can lead to loss of function and <b>compromise</b> <b>joint</b> stability. This {{has led to the}} development of in vitro models to investigate the biomechanics and biotribological response of cartilage and menisci. In high-volume laboratory studies of cartilage tribology, it is important to measure cartilage loss after experiments. In order to understand the relationship between the structure and function of the meniscus in health and disease, it is essential to interrogate the internal structural components of the meniscus. The aims of this project were to optimise protocols for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of menisci and articular cartilage in the knee in order to gain an increased understanding of their structure, and to detect and quantify morphological changes. A novel porcine medial knee model was developed for creation of physiological cartilage damage using a friction simulator. The cartilage damage models were subject to in vitro MRI quantification at both 9. 4 Tesla and 3. 0 Tesla for the first time. The two customised MRI-based wear quantification methods were validated using Pycnometer measurements. In addition, a novel approach was developed at 9. 4 T MRI to non-destructively investigate intrameniscal architecture and damage. Cartilage defect models were successfully created on the femoral condyle and tibia after friction simulator tests. The follow-up MRI investigation demonstrated the capability of MRI to assess cartilage defects using laboratory and clinical systems. At both of 9. 4 T and 3. 0 T, the two quantification methods were in excellent agreement with each other and with Pycnometer measurements. An optimised 10 -hour 3 D scan at 9. 4 T could clearly demonstrate 3 D intrameniscal architecture. The MRI quantification protocols showed promise for the non-destructive examination and quantification of cartilage defects in a large range of animal/human tissues after biomechanical/biotribological experiments. MRI at ultra-high-field strength also showed promise for the non-destructive examination of the intrameniscal structure in a 3 D manner. The proof of concept measurements presented in this study illustrates the potential of non-destructive 3 D MRI microscopy to bring a unique contribution to the field of functional cartilage/meniscus biomechanics and biotribology.

40|$|The {{skeleton}} is {{a dynamic}} organ that undergoes a continual process known as bone remodeling. Bone remodeling is necessary to maintain structural integrity, heal micro-fractures caused by from daily wear and tear, and to store and release essential ions and minerals. Remodeling is a highly regulated process, with bone resorption precisely balanced by bone formation under homeostatic conditions. In the setting of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an inflammatory condition affecting joints, this balance is lost and bone around inflamed joints is eroded. These so-called "bone erosions" <b>compromise</b> <b>joint</b> function, causing disability. Osteoclasts, multinucleated cells of hematopoietic origin, are the only cells known to resorb bone. Osteoclasts are found at erosion sites in human joints, and data from mouse models of inflammatory arthritis suggest that osteoclasts are required for erosions to form in bone. The canonical pathway of osteoclast differentiation requires stimulation of myeloid precursors by the cytokine Receptor Activator of NF-Kappa B ligand (RANKL) through its receptor, RANK. In the inflamed joint, RANKL expression can be induced on mesenchymal lineage cells by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Surprisingly, our lab observed bone erosions and osteoclast formation in a mouse model of RA {{in the absence of}} RANK. Thus we hypothesized that in addition to RANKL expression, the cytokine milieu in RA may directly stimulate osteoclast formation. It was recently reported that the inflammatory cytokines TNF alpha and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in combination stimulate osteoclast differentiation, independent of exogenous RANKL. We have reproduced these results and shown that these osteoclast-like cells form entirely independently of RANK signaling. However, TNF alpha/IL- 6 induced osteoclast formation still requires the transcription factor Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFATc 1), a master regulator of RANK-mediated osteoclast differentiation, as well as co-stimulatory signaling provided by the immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM) -containing DNAX-activating protein (DAP 12) molecules. We also showed that TNF alpha/IL- 6 induced osteoclast formation requires activity of IL- 6 receptor (IL- 6 R), as osteoclast formation can be inhibited through co-culture with an IL- 6 R blocking antibody (MR 16 - 1). Finally, using an in vivo mouse model of RA in RANK-deficient mice, we tested whether blocking IL- 6 R with MR 16 - 1 antibody protects against the formation of periarticular bone erosions. Our results suggest that a RANK-independent pathway of osteoclast formation contributes to inflammatory bone erosions. Targeting this pathway may improve outcomes for RA patients...|$|E
40|$|Articular Cartilage (AC) is a {{soft tissue}} {{covering}} the articulating surface {{of human and}} animal joints. The tissue has remarkable and highly complex mechanical and wear properties allowing the joint to undergo complex kinematics and function correctly for several decades. However, trauma and degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA) can cause damage and excessive wear of the tissue and due to its limited regenerative capabilities, can severely <b>compromise</b> <b>joint</b> movement and impair the quality of life. OA {{is the most common}} type of degenerative joint disease and the primary cause of joint replacement surgery leading to high associated healthcare costs. Although the exact cause of this pathology remains unknown, it is thought to be mechanically induced via excessive and abnormal stresses and strains in AC which cause altered biochemical properties and a gradual decrease in the mechanical quality of the tissue. There is currently no available cure for OA and the disease is currently being diagnosed only via imaging techniques which are based upon morphological changes of the tissue, when the pathology is already in its advanced stages and has caused irreversible changes to the AC. In this respect, one of the greatest challenges to now remains the early diagnosis of OA, potentially by assessing biochemical and mechanical changes, allowing early treatments and prevention of disability thus improving the patient’s life. Hence, there is a need to apply fundamental engineering principles to the medical world in order to shed light on the pathogenesis and progression of OA. Furthermore, the need for artificial substitutes of AC has called for a deep understanding of the mechanical behaviour of the tissue in order to design and mimic the response of the real tissue in the most accurate manner. In this research a combination of numerical (finite element) and experimental techniques involving mechanical and tribological tests were used to fully characterise the mechanical behaviour of the tissue. Selective degradation of the AC constituents was then induced to simulate OA (OA-like AC) and the effect of different stages of degradation on the mechanical and tribological response as well as the wear properties of the tissue was investigated. The mechanical properties of osteoarthritic AC were then evaluated and compared to the OA-like AC in order to correlate similarities in the variations to the structure and the mechanical response as a result of degradation. Quantifying the mechanical response of the tissue at different stages of OA and different levels of degradation was done to ensure both a thorough understanding of the effect of the pathology’s progression on AC as well as to provide a potential map of mechanical quality and degradation, contributing to the potential future diagnosis of OA via mechanical parameters rather than morphological alone. Having investigated structural and mechanical variation in early OA, a promising solution to treat localised early OA and AC defects was also investigated as part of this research. In particular, novel micro fibrous tissue engineered scaffolds have been mechanically and tribologically assessed and compared to AC demonstrating the strong potential of matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI). Finally, the numerical models developed to characterise the AC using numerical – experimental methods, namely advanced biphasic models incorporating fine material descriptions such as intrinsic viscoelasticity as well as transverse isotropy, were applied to a patient specific 3 D menisectomised tibio-femoral joint contact model in order to demonstrate the implications that the implementation of different AC models have for the prediction of the joint response to repeated walking cycles. The results obtained from the models were then used to predict the most likely location for the origin of mechanical damage and OA. Imperial Users onl...|$|E
40|$|Whilst the {{diversity}} of organisms present in the oral cavity is well accepted, there remains considerable controversy as to whether Staphylococcus spp. {{play a role in}} the ecology of the normal oral flora. Surprisingly little detailed work has been performed on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of colonisation or infection either by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) or S. aureus. The latter is especially interesting in the light of present difficulties in eradicating carriage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) from the oropharynx in affected individuals. This paper reviews the current knowledge of staphylococcal colonisation and infection of the oral cavity in health and disease. S. aureus has been isolated from a wide range of infective oral conditions, such as angular cheilitis and parotitis. More recently, a clinical condition classified as staphylococcal mucositis has emerged as a clinical problem in many debilitated elderly patients and those with oral Crohn's disease. Higher carriage rates of both CNS or S. aureus, or both, in patients prone to joint infections raises the interesting possibility of the oral cavity serving as a potential source for bacteraemic spread to <b>compromised</b> <b>joint</b> spaces. In conclusion, there is a surprising paucity of knowledge regarding the role of oral staphylococci in both health and disease. Further work in this area may lead to benefits, such as improved decolonisation regimens for eradication of MRSA and acknowledgement of the mouth as a source of bacteraemic staphylococci...|$|R

SPRjoints are traditionally tested by ultrasonic probing or manual disassembly, {{both of which}} are reliant upon to operator skill and opinion. Current real-time monitoring is restricted to the characterisation of a joint by monitoring the setting force and pWlch displacement. Througbout this researcb a variety of image processing techniques have been developed to provide practical nondestructive testing of the joint and surrounding processes to give reat-time decisions regarding the quality of the mechanical interlock. These techniques include examining the rivet status pre-process to ensure the punch slrikes the rivet head correctly, thereby preventing the production of <b>compromised</b> <b>joints</b> through tumbled rivets. The algorithm developed achieves 98 % accuracy in detecting the rivet status. Examining the depth of the materials about to be joined ensures that the materials presented are of the expected depth to prevent incorrect triggering, which can cause damage to the joining materials, and/or the riveting machinery. The material measurement algorithm achieves 2 % error when measuring 6 mm of stacked aluminium. Identifying the relative locations of multiple rivets post-process helps prevent substandard structures by ensuring that the rivets are present and suitably spaced to ensure optimum strength. The algorithm developed achieves 99 % accuracy. Each of these techniques provides considerable promise and adds greater confidence when predicting the quality of the mechanical interlock.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine whether individuals with anterior shoulder instability exhibit larger shoulder position sense errors than those with healthy shoulders in both passive matching and active positioning. Design. This was a between-groups study with repeated measures. Methods. Ten people with anterior shoulder instability and 15 people with healthy shoulders participated in the study. Shoulder position sense was examined with 3 different protocols (passive motion to remembered shoulder rotation angles and active shoulder abduction and rotation to verbally specified positions) in posi-tions of both mid-range and end-range of motion. Results. Participants with unstable shoulders exhibited significantly larger errors (by 1. 8 ° on average) in perception of shoulder position compared with those with healthy shoulders during passive matching. During active positioning, participants with unstable shoulders were able to voluntarily move the shoulder to verbally specified angles as accurately as those with healthy shoulders in both abduction (0. 85 ° difference) and rotation (0. 99 ° difference) tasks. Conclusions. Results of this study indicate that people with unstable shoulders can perceive shoulder angles as accurately as people with healthy shoulders in activities with voluntary arm movements. Compared with passive matching, better information from muscle spindles and other sources during voluntary arm move-ments may compensate for the potential joint position sense deficits after the injury. Therefore, individuals with an unstable shoulder may have adequate neuromuscular control to engage proper protective mechanisms to stabilize the shoulder joint during functional activities...|$|R
40|$|Because {{the hand}} {{is a complex}} poly-articular limb, {{numerous}} methods have been proposed to investigate its kinematics therefore complicating the comparison between studies and the methodological choices. With the objective of overcoming such issues, the present study compared the effect of three local frame definitions on local axis orientations and joint angles of the fingers and the wrist. Three local frames were implemented for each segment. The "Reference" frames were aligned with global axes during a static neutral posture. The "Landmark" frames were computed using palpated bony landmarks. The "Functional" frames included a flexion-extension axis estimated during functional movements. These definitions were compared {{with regard to the}} deviations between obtained local segment axes and the evolution of joint (Cardan) angles during two test motions. Each definition resulted in specific local frame orientations with deviations of 15 ° in average for a given local axis. Interestingly, these deviations produced only slight differences (below 7 °) regarding flexion-extension Cardan angles indicating that there is no preferred method when only interested in finger flexion-extension movements. In this case, the Reference method was the easiest to implement, but did not provide physiological results for the thumb. Using the Functional frames reduced the kinematic cross-talk on the secondary and tertiary Cardan angles by up to 20 ° indicating that the Functional definition is useful when investigating complex three-dimensional movements. Globally, the Landmark definition provides valuable results and, contrary to the other definitions, is applicable for finger deformities or <b>compromised</b> <b>joint</b> rotations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Degeneration of {{articular}} cartilage and associated osteoarthritic changes {{are the leading}} cause of <b>compromised</b> <b>joint</b> articulation worldwide. Early stages of osteoarthritis (OA) are characterised by partial thickness chondral defects that fail to heal spontaneously. It is crucial to repair these defects during the early stages of cartilage degeneration to prevent the progression of OA. Currently used clinical interventions however have been unable to completely restore/regenerate damaged {{articular cartilage}} to its native state. This has led to considerable interest in the development of effective cartilage tissue engineering strategies for the treatment of chondral defects in an increasing ageing population. The present study aims to address some of the hurdles in cartilage regeneration, in particular, (i) identification of an appropriate cell source, (ii) an understanding the effect of oxygen on cartilaginous matrix formation, and (iii) the application of a novel bioreactor design for the generation of neocartilage grafts. Human articular chondrocytes (HACs) demonstrated excellent cartilage formation in both scaffold-free pellet culture and culture using three-dimensional biomaterial scaffolds. Chondrogenic differentiation of STRO- 1 -immunoselected skeletal stem cells (STRO- 1 + SSCs) was significantly improved by the utilisation of scaffolds with a highly interconnected porous architecture in comparison to scaffold-free pellet culture. The predeposition of SSCs for hypertrophic differentiation however indicated a need for further development of cell culture protocols that may otherwise limit their application in cartilage bioengineering strategies. A combined experimental-computational approach was utilised to infer the likely effects of oxygen tension on cartilaginous matrix synthesis by HACs in the 3 -D pellet culture model, from which a threshold oxygen tension (pO 2 ≈ 8 % atmospheric pressure) that separated collagenous matrix formation from PG deposition was determined. This study has also demonstrated the first successful application of perfusion bioreactor technology in combination with ultrasound cell trapping for the generation of “scaffold-free” neocartilage grafts of HACs that were analogous to native hyaline cartilage. Furthermore, the neocartilage grafts were able to adhere to host articular cartilage and mediate repair of partial thickness chondral defects. The work presented in this thesis has demonstrated the successful application of a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing skeletal cell biology, bioengineering, mathematical modelling and acoustofluidics, for the generation of neocartilage grafts ex vivo that could be ultimately scaled-up and subsequently used in the clinic for resurfacingarticular cartilage defects...|$|R

In this linear region, the maximum slope of the load/displacement curve is reached. After this phase, the activation of damage mechanisms of the joint occurs. In particular, the samples, at low ageing time, lose gradually their stiffness. This {{is due to a}} bending effect {{at the edge of the}} sheets in the overlapping area. After that, the maximum load value is reached, and the mechanical stability of the joints is critically prejudiced. Then, the slope of the load/displacement curve becomes negative with a gradual reduction of load, thus confirming that the mechanical interlocking is <b>compromised.</b> The <b>joints</b> subsequently open as a press-stud, such rupture occurs in the most of the clinched joints (Varis 2006). The ageing treatment reduces significantly the performances of the joint giving rise premature failure mechanisms induced by localized corrosion phenomena. At long ageing times, where the joint presents an advanced state of degradation, breakages in the neck of the joint both on the aluminium side and on the steel one could occur.|$|R
40|$|Background: Upper {{extremity}} {{injuries are}} frequent {{in the elderly}} or those undertaking extreme sporting activities. Commercially available wrist guards reduce the frequency of wrist fractures but are not widely used as they greatly restrict movement. Methods: A new wrist guard was developed which provided protection to the “impact area” but does not restrict wrist or digital movement. A human hand model and a biomechanical test rig, which allowed the simulation of an adult fall from height, were developed. The ability of the new guard, which was tested with different levels of padding, to reduce peak impact forces and absorb energy on impact was measured and compared to a commercially available wrist guard. Findings: The use of any guard reduced peak impact forces by a minimum of 31. 8 %. The new guard, despite a substantially reduced impact surface area, demonstrated the same reductions in peak force (48 %) and ability to absorb energy on impact as the standard guard when fitted with comparable levels of padding. Interpretation: These {{results indicate that the}} new guard, which allows movement of the wrist and digits, demonstrates the same ability to reduce impact forces and absorb energy as a commercially available guard despite its substantially reduced impact area. Such a guard may provide a better <b>compromise</b> between <b>joint</b> flexibility and protection than the status quo...|$|R
40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) {{is rapidly}} {{penetrating}} the welding market in many materials and applications, particularly in aluminum alloys for transportation applications. As this expansion outside the research laboratory continues, {{fitness for service}} issues will arise, and process control and NDE methods will become important determinants of continued growth. The present paper describes research into FSW weld nugget flaw detection within aluminum alloy lap welds. We present results for two types of FSW tool designs: a smooth pin tool and a threaded pin tool. We show that under certain process parameters (as monitored during welding with a rotating dynamometer that measures x, y, z, and torque forces) and tooling designs, FSW lap welds allow significant nonbonded interface lifting of the lap joint, while forming a metallurgical bond only within the pin region of the weld nugget. These lifted joints are often held very tightly together even though unbonded, and {{might be expected to}} pass cursory NDE while representing a substantial <b>compromise</b> in <b>joint</b> mechanical properties. The phenomenon is investigated here via radiographic and ultrasonic NDE techniques, with a copper foil marking insert (as described elsewhere) and by the tensile testing of joints. As one would expect, these results show that tool design and process parameters significantly affect plactic flow and this lifted interface. NDE and mechanical strength ramifications of this defect are discussed...|$|R
25|$|As {{the seals}} can be {{performed}} at much lower temperature than with direct joining of glass parts and without use of flame (using a temperature-controlled kiln or oven), glass solders are useful in applications like subminiature vacuum tubes or for joining mica windows to vacuum tubes and instruments (e.g., Geiger tube). Thermal expansion coefficient has to be matched to the materials being joined and often is chosen in between the coefficients of expansion of the materials. In case of having to <b>compromise,</b> subjecting the <b>joint</b> to compression stresses is more desirable than to tensile stresses. The expansion matching is not critical in applications where thin layers are used on small areas, e.g., fireable inks, or where the joint will be subjected to a permanent compression (e.g., by an external steel shell) offsetting the thermally introduced tensile stresses.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Dialysis-related {{spondyloarthropathy}} {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} spinal deformity and cervical myelopathy. Optimal management of cervical spine spondyloarthropathy often requires circumferential reconstructive surgery, because affected patients typically have both the anterior column and the facet <b>joints</b> <b>compromised.</b> The occasional presence of noncontiguous or "skip lesions " adds an additional level of complexity to surgical management, because decompression and fusion in an isolated segment of neural compression can worsen spine deformity by applying increased stress to adjacent cervical spine segments. We report two cases of hemodialysis patients who presented with cervical myelopathy and initially had anterior cervical discectomy or corpectomy. Because symptoms recurred due to hardware failure, both patients required posterior spine fusion as well. In retrospect, because of the hardware failure, both of these patients might have benefited from a circumferential (combined anterior and posterior) cervical spine reconstruction as their initial treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In a RC {{structure}} {{subjected to}} column removal, beam-column <b>joints</b> <b>compromise</b> {{one of the}} critical regions. According to analysis, after column removal (result from deliberate attack, vehicle impact, natural causes, etc.), in some cases, plastic hinges will be formed and rotation of some of this hinges exceed acceptance criteria. An appropriate procedure to decrease plastic hinges rotation is FRP strengthening. This paper {{presents the results of}} a numerical study performed to evaluate the ability of L-shaped CFRP sheets in preventing the plastic hinge formation at the face of the column and decreasing the plastic hinge rotation in exterior RC joints. Two plain/CFRP-retrofitted joints of a typical intermediate RC frame were modeled in ANSYS and loaded under monotonic loads to failure. The results show that L-shaped strengthening with CFRPs can decrease plastic hinge rotation and effectively relocate the plastic hinge away from the column face...|$|R
50|$|The {{final report}} found that {{following}} the uncommanded autofeather of engine number 2 the pilot flying reduced power on and subsequently shut down the operative engine number 1. The flight crew failed to perform the failure identification procedure and did not comply with standard operating procedures resulting in the pilot flying’s confusion regarding the identification {{and nature of the}} propulsion system malfunction. The autofeathering was caused by <b>compromised</b> soldering <b>joints</b> in the auto feather unit. During the initial stages of the take-off roll the flight crew did not reject the take off when the automatic take off power control system ARM pushbutton did not light, and TransAsia did not have a clear requirement to do so. The loss of engine power during the initial climb and inappropriate flight control inputs by the pilot flying generated stall warnings and activation of the stick pusher to which the crew did not respond in a timely and effective manner. The loss of power from both engines was not detected and corrected by the crew in time and the aircraft stalled during the attempted restart at an altitude from which they could not recover. Ineffective flight crew coordination, communication, and threat and error management compromised the safety of the flight. The crew failed to obtain relevant data from each other regarding the status of both engines. The pilot flying did not appropriately respond to input from the pilot monitoring.|$|R

30|$|Different {{techniques}} {{based on}} the same surgical principles but utilizing different implants for internal or external fixation of either intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric valgus osteotomies have been described for the surgical correction of coxa vara. The surgical technique most commonly used to achieve correction is the laterally based, intertrochanteric Y-shaped wedge osteotomy described by Pauwels [6], considered to be state of the art in the surgical management of infantile coxa vara [2]. Pauwels’s Y-shaped osteotomy is performed between the lesser and greater trochanters and perpendicular to the femoral shaft. It corrects the neck–shaft angle but the femoral shaft is positioned medially. However, it <b>compromises</b> the hip <b>joint’s</b> integrity, potentially endangering the nourishing vessels of the femoral head and thus increasing the risk of avascular necrosis [2]. Medial displacement in such patients should be strongly avoided as it exacerbates the loading of the distal femoral physis and the lateral compartment of the knee in patients with knee deformity (genu valgum), which is commonly also seen in cases of coxa vara [7].|$|R
