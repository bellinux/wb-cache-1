5|$|In July 1889, the Metropolitan Police {{uncovered}} a male brothel operated by Charles Hammond in London's Cleveland Street. Under police interrogation, the male prostitutes and pimps revealed {{the names of}} their <b>clients,</b> <b>who</b> included Lord Arthur Somerset, an Extra Equerry to the Prince of Wales. At the time, all homosexual acts between men were illegal, and the clients faced social ostracism, prosecution, and at worst, two years' imprisonment with hard labour.|$|E
5|$|Tamagnino's six Caesars were {{relegated to}} the less frequented areas of the {{building}} - at the back and the south and west.

After these events, Tamagnino abandoned Brescia, probably never to return, leaving Cairano as the main sculptural worker in the city.|$|E

5|$|The artist {{emerged in}} 1489 {{as part of}} the {{cultural}} world of Milan, beginning a successful career that turned him into a leading exponent of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia, distinguishing himself with works of cultural import such as his cycle of the Caesars for the Loggia palace in Brescia, as well as the Martinengo mausoleum. He introduced a powerful and highly expressive classical taste, as opposed to the hitherto existing refined decorativeness. During {{the first decade of the}} sixteenth century, Gasparo was able to win over public and private <b>clients</b> <b>who</b> sought to translate into stone their pride in their supposed historical descent from ancient Rome.|$|E
5|$|Fifty {{people are}} interviewed in the film, {{including}} investigative journalist Paul Radu of Bucharest, Katherine Chon of the Polaris Project, and Iana Matei of Reaching Out Romania. Don Brewster of Agape International Missions {{says that all}} of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as the <b>clients</b> <b>who</b> were the most abusive to them. The film was dedicated to Richard Young, its cinematographer and co-director, after he died in December 2010. It had its premiere the following month at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. The narration was completely rerecorded in 2011, replacing Ashley Judd's voice with that of Glenn Close. The version of the film that was aired by CNN International as part of the CNN Freedom Project was shorter than the version shown at the premiere. In 2014, a re-edited version of the film was released.|$|E
5|$|While Parke's {{conviction}} cleared Euston, another {{trial began}} on 16 December 1889 when Newlove's and Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, {{was charged with}} obstruction of justice. It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond and the boys from testifying by offering or giving them passage and money to go abroad. Newton was defended by Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Ernest Parke, and the prosecutor was Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney General. Newton pleaded guilty {{to one of the}} six charges against him, claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his <b>clients,</b> <b>who</b> were not at that time charged with any offence or under arrest, from potential blackmail. The Attorney General accepted Newton's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges. On 20 May, the judge, Sir Lewis Cave, sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison, which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh. A petition signed by 250 London law firms was sent to the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, protesting at Newton's treatment.|$|E

5|$|While Wally goes to {{a funeral}} home to attend {{the wake of a}} former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a {{cholesterol-lowering}} drug developed by the (fictional) pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former <b>clients</b> <b>who</b> appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth. None of the three Finley & Figg lawyers has ever argued in a United States federal court, and they have only a vague idea of what is involved in confronting a major corporation which is able to hire the best legal talent around - which turns out to be Zinc's old firm.|$|E

Despite ethical commitments to religiosity and spirituality training, it seems that most training programs in professional psychology have neglected to incorporate content from these areas of diversity into their curricula. The current study evaluated religious and spiritual diversity training in both APA-accredited doctoral programs and predoctoral internships, garnering the perspectives of 292 students, interns, faculty, and training directors (54. 9 % response rate). Results revealed a clear hierarchy of preparatory efforts with regard to diversity training, with least attention given to the dimensions of diversity pertaining to disabilities, age, religion, and spirituality. Participants also perceived several areas of advanced competency to be neglected, including preparation efforts related to consultation with religious and spiritual leaders and understanding the major world religions and spiritual systems. The findings also revealed that doctoral programs and predoctoral internships rely on informal and unsystematic sources of learning to provide training in religious and spiritual dimensions of diversity, including clinical experiences and peer interaction. Coursework, research, and didactics are rarely used to enhance religious and spiritual diversity training. Implications regarding current perceptions of training in religious and spiritual diversity are included...|$|R
