5|$|In 1986–87, a {{cogeneration}} {{facility was}} added to the central heating plant to generate electricity from the plant's waste heat. A Cornell Combined Heat & Power Project, which was completed in December 2009, shifted the central heating plant from using <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> natural gas and enable the plant to generate all of the campus's non-peak electric requirements.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the hospital, {{under the control}} of the Hailsham Hospitals Management Committee since the 1948 {{establishment}} of the National Health Service, decided to convert its boilers from <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> oil. The railway was therefore no longer needed to transport coal; the last load was delivered on 10March 1959, and the empty coal wagon returned to Hellingly on 25March 1959.|$|E
5|$|The Rochdale Canal—one of {{the major}} navigable broad canals of Great Britain—passes along Milnrow's {{north-western}} boundary which divides it {{from the village of}} Wardle and districts of Belfield and Castleton in Rochdale.

5|$|A more {{immediate}} {{need for a}} canal covering the section between Givors and Rive-de-Gier emerged in the 1750s, when a cheaper method than pack mules was needed to carry <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> heat houses in Lyon and to fuel the glass works that had been opened in Givors in 1749. In 1751, there were 1,200 mules engaged in carrying the coal from Rive-de-Gier to Givors, from where it was taken by water north to Lyon and south to the towns of the Midi. Lyon was consuming 36,000 tons annually. The coal sold for 5 francs a ton at the mine head and 21.70 francs per ton at the Lyon docks.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} {{her guests}} to New York, West Alsek sailed to Baltimore, Maryland, for operation by the Oriole Line. She sailed for Cardiff, {{becoming the first}} ship depending only on pulverized <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed {{that in addition to}} making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek continued to be a test platform for assessing the pulverized coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the main}} canal was {{replaced}} by the railway, Kymer's dock continued to be used for the transfer of <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> coastal ships for another 50 years. Principal destinations included Laugharne, Carmarthen, St Clears and Llanstephan. The Kidwelly Corporation took out a lease on the dock in 1872, and the railway built a branch to it in 1873, which ran alongside the old canal. Most of the traffic had transferred to the railway by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s, and was bound for Llanstephan.|$|E
5|$|Another {{stress test}} for German–Japanese {{relations}} was the Russo-Japanese War of 1904/05, during which Germany strongly supported Russia. This circumstance triggered the Japanese foreign ministry to proclaim that any ship delivering <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> Russian vessels within {{the war zone}} would be sunk. After the Russo-Japanese War, Germany insisted on reciprocity in the exchange of military officers and students, and in the following years, several German military officers were sent to Japan to study the Japanese military, which, after its victory over the tsarist army became a promising organization to study. However, Japan's growing power and influence also caused increased distrust on the German side.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the Old Bay Line, its freight and {{passenger}} traffic remained relatively strong in the 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E

5|$|In 1827, at its peak, {{the canal}} {{transport}}ed 332,000 tons. The {{main purpose of}} the canal was still to transport <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> Givors, from where it could be taken to other towns on the river Rhone. On the return trip, boats carried some of the merchandise of the Midi including iron, oak wood and other things needed by the factories of the Loire department. By 1831, the population of Givors had risen to 9,210. There were many factories making window panes, bottles and glasses, and the port had a busy trade in coal shipment. Ten large glass works had been established at Rive-de-Gier that also transported their products by the canal.|$|E
5|$|In January, 1951, {{the student}} body of the Presbyterian McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago {{sponsored}} Béla, Eva, Tibor and Robert Banathy as refugees to the United States. Bánáthy lived with his family at the Seminary, where he worked nights 60 hours a week shoveling <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> fire the Seminary furnace. At the same time, he was studying English from a book. He occasionally preached at nearby Hungarian churches. His wife found work as a machine operator and Tibor, their third son, entered American public school.|$|E
5|$|Mark Whitton founded Whitton's in {{the early}} 1900s {{carrying}} timber with a horse and cart. After World War I the company carried <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> the gas works and local paper mills. In 1923 they bought their first Sentinel steam lorry and carried paper to Bristol, returning with animal feed. During the Second World War they were run by the Ministry of Transport {{and after the war}} were nationalised to become part of British Road Services. The brothers who had owned the company moved back into haulage, setting up a new firm which went into receivership in the 1970s and was then bought by Wild Transport of Exeter in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Opposition to Chicago's skyscrapers {{began to}} grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Even before the {{development}} of the skyscraper, some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private houses, and this sentiment strengthened. Critics complained that the concentration of tall buildings {{in the center of the}} city was causing huge congestion, and each new skyscraper was also burning additional <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> power its facilities, together consuming a total of over one million tons each year, leaving smoke and stagnant air hanging over Chicago. Many were concerned over the risk of a major fire breaking out and spreading, uncontrolled, from building to building.|$|E
5|$|Railways {{transport}} {{goods from}} China to the European Union through Kazakhstan and Russia. The country has {{pushed for the}} construction of more railway lines to connect Berlin to east China to reduce shipping time. It proposed major high-speed railway lines going towards Europe via Russia and Kazakhstan and another through the Middle East via Tajikistan, a potential future member for the union. China has signed numerous energy deals with Russia and Kazakhstan, as it tries to move from <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> less pollutant alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Steam {{ships of}} the period, which burned <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> fire their boilers, were {{naturally}} tied to coaling stations in friendly ports. The German Navy lacked sufficient overseas bases for sustained operations, even for single ships operating as commerce raiders. The Navy experimented with {{a device to}} transfer coal from colliers to warships while underway in 1907, though the practice was not put into general use. Nevertheless, German capital ships had a cruising range of at least , {{more than enough to}} operate in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Steam was {{provided}} by 12 Schulz-Thornycroft boilers, each of which had 2 fireboxes, {{for a total of}} 24. The machinery was divided into three engine and six boiler rooms. The wing turrets and their magazines further divided the machinery into three separated groups, thereby increasing survivability. The ships carried 2,700tons of coal, and were later modified to carry an additional 160tons of oil that was to be sprayed on the <b>coal,</b> <b>to</b> increase its burn rate. Electrical power {{was provided}} by eight turbo-generators, producing 1,280kW at 225V.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Western Canal ran between Taunton in Somerset and Tiverton in Devon in the United Kingdom. The canal had {{its origins}} in various plans, going back to 1796, to link the Bristol Channel and the English Channel by a canal, {{bypassing}} Lands End. An additional purpose of the canal was the supply of limestone and <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> lime kilns along with {{the removal of the}} resulting quicklime, which was used as a fertiliser and for building houses. This intended canal-link was never completed as planned, as the coming of the railways removed the need for its existence.|$|E
5|$|The Grantham Canal is a canal {{that runs}} for 33 miles (53km) from Grantham, falling through 18 locks to West Bridgford where it joins the River Trent. It was built {{primarily}} {{to allow for}} the transportation of <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> Grantham. It opened in 1797, and its profitability steadily increased until 1841. It was then sold to a railway company, after which it declined, and was finally closed in 1936.|$|E
