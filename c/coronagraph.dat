5|$|The Indian Space Research Organisation has {{scheduled}} {{the launch of}} a 100kg satellite named Aditya for 2017–18. Its main instrument will be a <b>coronagraph</b> for studying {{the dynamics of the}} Solar corona.|$|E
5|$|Using a <b>coronagraph</b> on the Subaru {{telescope}} in Hawaii in 2005, astronomers {{were able to}} further constrain {{the size of a}} planet orbiting Vega to no more than 5–10 times the mass of Jupiter. The issue of possible clumps in the debris disc was revisited in 2007 using newer, more sensitive instrumentation on the Plateau de Bure Interferometer. The observations showed that the debris ring is smooth and symmetric. No evidence was found of the blobs reported earlier, casting doubts on the hypothesized giant planet. The smooth structure has been confirmed in follow-up observations by Hughes et al. (2012) and the Herschel Space Telescope.|$|E

40|$|Unlike focal-plane <b>coronagraphs</b> {{that use}} {{occulting}} spots and Lyot stops to eliminate diffraction, pupil-plane <b>coronagraphs</b> operate by shaping the pupil to redirect the diffracted stellar light {{into a tight}} core. As in focal-plane <b>coronagraphs,</b> the optical aberrations in the telescope must be sufficiently corrected to enable high contrast imaging. However, in shaped-pupil <b>coronagraphs,</b> the low-order aberrations resulting from misalignment and optical figure drift have a much smaller influence upon the contrast at at the inner working angle. These weaker sensitivities greatly relax the strict low-order wavefront stability required for high-contrast imaging the cost of some throughput. In this paper, we present the simulated performance of the concentric ring shaped pupil concepts comparing them to focal-plane <b>coronagraphs</b> that are optimized for the same inner working angles...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} characterization in {{the near}} infrared of Neptune-like planets and super-Earths {{is one of the}} main science objectives of the E-ELT. The planetary camera and spectrograph (PCS) will be in charge of making it possible. We have designed three different instruments: pure apodizers, apodized Lyot <b>coronagraphs,</b> and apodized vortex <b>coronagraphs.</b> In each cases the central obscuration and the secondary supports are taken into account in the design of the apodizer. We present a trade study of the imaging performance of these <b>coronagraphs,</b> and we describe how sensitive these <b>coronagraphs</b> are to various aberrations. This is used to assess the potential complementarity between these three types of instruments. Finally, we also consider the feasibility of an active control of aperture discontinuities and/or a phase induced amplitude apodization using the two deformable mirrors of an extreme adaptive optics system associated with the <b>coronagraphs...</b>|$|R
40|$|HST <b>Coronagraphs</b> HST has {{supported}} 3 coronagraphs: NICMOS, ACS, and STIS. Bulk of image properties are {{set by the}} OTA, but instrumental effects are also present. None of the HST <b>coronagraphs</b> have been optimal:ACS spot size issues, NICMOS parts moving in dewar, STIS incomplete apodization, and lack of peakdown software...|$|R
25|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{demonstrated}} that a vortex <b>coronagraph</b> could enable small scopes to directly image planets. They did this by imaging the previously imaged HR 8799 planets, using just a 1.5 meter-wide portion of the Hale Telescope.|$|E
25|$|Large Angle and Spectrometric <b>Coronagraph</b> aboard SOHO is used {{to capture}} digital images of the Sun. One such sungrazing comet, SOHO 2198, was {{discovered}} using LASCO images.This sungrazer belongs to a family called Kreutz Sungrazers which usually disintegrate after discovery. With this discovery on 13 December 2011, Mulye became the second Indian to discover a sungrazing comet.|$|E
25|$|First methane {{brown dwarf}} verified. Gliese 229B is {{discovered}} orbiting red dwarf Gliese 229A (20 ly away) using an adaptive optics <b>coronagraph</b> to sharpen {{images from the}} 60-inch (1.5m) reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory on Southern California's Mt. Palomar; follow-up infrared spectroscopy made with their 200-inch (5m) Hale telescope shows an abundance of methane.|$|E
50|$|Since 2001, most of Vanderbei's {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} developing high-contrast imaging systems with the eventual aim of direct imaging of exoplanets. The concepts he has contributed to include shaped-pupil <b>coronagraphs,</b> PIAA-style pupil mapping <b>coronagraphs,</b> and space-based external occulters. Together with J. Richard Gott, Vanderbei {{is the author of a}} National Geographic book called Sizing Up The Universe (Book website).|$|R
50|$|The first {{principal}} investigator was Dr. Guenter Brueckner. These <b>coronagraphs</b> monitor the solar corona {{by using an}} optical system to create, in effect, an artificial solar eclipse. The white light <b>coronagraphs</b> C2 and C3 produce images of the corona {{over much of the}} visible spectrum, while the C1 interferometer produces images of the corona in a number of very narrow visible wavelength bands.|$|R
25|$|<b>Coronagraphs</b> have {{recently}} been used to detect faint objects orbiting bright visible stars, including Gliese 229B.|$|R
25|$|Visible Light <b>Coronagraph</b> (TPF-C): A large optical telescope, with {{a mirror}} {{three to four}} times bigger and at least 100 times more precise than the Hubble Space Telescope, would collect starlight and the very dim {{reflected}} light from the planets. The telescope would have special optics to reduce the starlight by a factor of one billion, thus enabling astronomers to detect faint planets.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} year 2010, telescopes could only {{directly}} image exoplanets under exceptional circumstances. Specifically, {{it is easier to}} obtain images when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than Jupiter), widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation. However, in 2010 a team from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory demonstrated that a vortex <b>coronagraph</b> could enable small scopes to directly image planets. They did this by imaging the previously imaged HR 8799 planets using just a 1.5 m portion of the Hale Telescope.|$|E
25|$|ISRO {{plans to}} carry out a mission to the Sun by the year 2019–20. The probe is named as Aditya-1 and will weigh about 400kg. It is the First Indian space based Solar <b>Coronagraph</b> to study the Corona in visible and near-IR bands. Launch of the Aditya mission was planned during the {{heightened}} solar activity period in 2012, but was postponed to 2019–2020 due to the extensive work involved in the fabrication, and other technical aspects. The main objective of the mission is to study Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), their properties (the structure and evolution of their magnetic fields for example), and consequently delineate parameters that affect space weather.|$|E
25|$|NIRCam and MIRI feature starlight-blocking <b>coronagraphs</b> for {{observation}} of faint targets such as extrasolar planets and circumstellar disks {{very close to}} bright stars.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, C/1979 Q1 (SOLWIND) was {{the first}} sungrazer to be spotted by US {{satellite}} P78-1, in <b>coronagraphs</b> taken on 30 and 31 Aug 1979.|$|R
5000|$|Guyon designs {{telescopes and}} other astronomical {{instrumentation}} that {{aid in the}} search for exoplanets planets outside our solar system. [...] Specifically, <b>coronagraphs</b> and extreme adaptive optics.|$|R
500|$|Japanese astronomers using a <b>coronagraph</b> saw {{the comet}} break into three pieces 30 minutes before perihelion. [...] When the comet reappeared {{in the morning}} sky in early November, two of these nuclei were {{definitely}} detected with the third suspected. [...] The comet developed a very prominent tail, about 25° in length, before fading throughout November. [...] It was last detected in January 1966.|$|E
2500|$|UltraViolet <b>Coronagraph</b> Spectrometer (...) which {{measures}} density and {{temperature in the}} corona.|$|E
2500|$|A corona (Latin, 'crown') is {{an aura of}} plasma that {{surrounds}} the Sun and other stars. The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into space and is most easily seen during a total solar eclipse, {{but it is also}} observable with a <b>coronagraph.</b> The word corona is a Latin word meaning [...] "crown", from the Ancient Greek κορώνη (korōnè, “garland, wreath”).|$|E
50|$|As a protege of Gordon Newkirk, Eddy {{worked with}} Princeton Professor Martin Schwarzschild in {{studying}} the solar corona with <b>coronagraphs</b> mounted on weather balloons at altitudes of 80000 ft. Eddy's thesis was {{in this area of}} study.|$|R
50|$|MIRI, or Mid-Infrared Instrument, is an {{instrument}} on the planned James Webb Space Telescope. MIRI is {{a camera and}} a spectrograph that observes mid infrared radiation from 5 microns to 28 microns. It also has <b>coronagraphs,</b> especially for observing exoplanets.|$|R
40|$|Phase masks <b>coronagraphs</b> {{can be seen}} as linear {{systems that}} {{spatially}} redistribute, in the pupil plane, the energy collected by the telescope. Most of the on-axis light must ideally be rejected outside the aperture so as to be blocked with a Lyot stop, while almost all of the off-axis light must go through it. The unobstructed circular apertures of off-axis telescopes make this possible but all of the major tele-scopes are however on-axis and the performance of these <b>coronagraphs</b> is dramatically reduced by their central ob-structions. Their performance can be restored by using an additional optimally designed apodizer that changes the amplitude in the first pupil plane so that the on-axis light is rejected outside the obstructed aperture of the on-axis telescope...|$|R
2500|$|Any {{planetary}} sized body 180 {{degrees from}} Earth {{should also have}} been visible to some space probes, such as NASA's STEREO <b>coronagraph</b> probes (two spacecraft launched into orbits around the Sun in 2006, one farther ahead of and one behind the Earth's orbit) which {{would have seen the}} Counter-Earth {{during the first half of}} 2007. [...] The separation of the STEREO spacecraft from Earth would give them a view of the L3 point during the early phase of the mission.|$|E
50|$|A band-limited <b>coronagraph</b> uses {{a special}} kind of mask called a band-limited mask. This mask is {{designed}} to block light and also manage diffraction effects caused by removal of the light. The band-limited <b>coronagraph</b> has served as the baseline design for the canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder <b>coronagraph.</b> Band-limited masks will also be available on the James Webb Space Telescope.|$|E
50|$|A stellar <b>coronagraph</b> {{concept was}} studied for flight on the {{canceled}} Terrestrial Planet Finder mission. On ground-based telescopes, a stellar <b>coronagraph</b> {{can be combined}} with adaptive optics to search for planets around nearby stars http://www.adaptiveoptics.org/News_0805_1.html.|$|E
40|$|High {{contrast}} imaging {{can find}} and characterize gas giant planets around nearby young {{stars and the}} closest M stars, complementing radial velocity and as-trometric searches by exploring orbital separations inaccessible to indirect meth-ods. Ground-based <b>coronagraphs</b> are already probing within 25 AU of nearby ar X i...|$|R
40|$|Classical externally-occulted <b>coronagraphs</b> are {{presently}} {{limited in their}} performances by {{the distance between the}} external occulter and the front objective. The diffraction fringe from the occulter and the vignetted pupil which degrades the spatial resolution prevent observing the inner corona inside typically 2 - 2. 5 solar radii. Formation flyers open new perspectives and allow to conceive giant, externally-occulted <b>coronagraphs</b> using a two-component space system with the external occulter on one spacecraft and the optical instrument on the other spacecraft at approximately 100 m from the first one. ASPICS (Association de Satellites Pour l’Imagerie Coronographique Solaire) is a mission proposed to CNES in the framework of their demonstration program of formation flyers which is presently under study to exploit this technique for coronal observations. In the baseline concept, ASPICS includes three <b>coronagraphs</b> operating in three spectral domains: the visible continuum (K-corona brightness), the HI Lyman alpha emission line at 121. 6 nm, and the HeII emission line at 30. 4 nm. Their unvignetted fields of view extend from 1. 1 to 3. 2 solar radii with a typical spatial resolution of 3 arcsec. In order to connect coronal activity to photospheric events, ASPICS further includes two disk imagers. The first one is devoted to the HI Lyman alpha emission line. The second one is a multi-channel instrument similar to SOHO/EIT and devoted to the HeII (30. 4 nm), FeIX/X (17. 1 nm) and FeXII (19. 5 nm) emission lines. Two concepts of the space system are under consideration: a symmetric configuration where the disk imagers and the external occulter are on one spacecraft and the <b>coronagraphs</b> on the other, an asymmetric configuration where the external occulter is on one spacecraft and the scientific instruments are regrouped on the other one...|$|R
40|$|High {{contrast}} imaging {{is necessary}} to search for and study sub-stellar objects and debris disks surrounding bright stars.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytic}} model {{to estimate the}} capabilities of space missions dedicated {{to the search for}} biosignatures in the atmosphere of rocky planets located in the habitable zone of nearby stars. Relations between performance and mission parameters such as mirror diameter, distance to targets, and radius of planets, are obtained. Two types of instruments are considered: <b>coronagraphs</b> observing in the visible, and nulling interferometers in the thermal infrared. Missions considered are: single-pupil <b>coronagraphs</b> with a 2. 4 m primary mirror, and formation flying interferometers with 4 x 0. 75 m collecting mirrors. The numbers of accessible planets are calculated as a function of ηearth. When Kepler gives its final estimation for ηearth, the model will permit a precise assessment of the potential of each instrument. Based on current estimations, ηearth = 10...|$|R
40|$|Vortex <b>coronagraphs</b> {{are among}} the most {{promising}} solutions to perform high contrast imaging at small angular separations from bright stars. They enhance the dynamic range at very small inner working angle (down to the diffraction limit of the telescope) and provide a clear 360 degree discovery space for high-contrast direct imaging of exoplanets. In this talk, we will report on the first scientific results obtained with Vortex <b>coronagraphs</b> installed on 10 -m class telescopes (i. e., the VLT and the LBT) and on the recent installation of one Vortex at Keck. We will describe the in-lab and on-sky performance of the Vortex, and describe the lessons learned after a few years of operation. Finally, we will discuss the prospects of our vortices for future extremely large telescopes and space missions...|$|R
