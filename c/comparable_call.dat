40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of constructing bandwidth-guaranteed multicast tree in multi-channel multi-interface wireless mesh networks. We focus on the scenario of dynamic multicast call arrival, where each call has a specific bandwidth requirement. A call is accepted if a multicast tree with sufficient bandwidth on each link can be constructed. Intuitively, if the carried load on both the most-heavily loaded channel and the most-heavily loaded node is minimized, the traffic load in the network will be balanced. If the network load is balanced, more room {{will be available for}} accommodating future calls. This would maximize the call acceptance rate in the network. With the above notion of load balancing in mind, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is formulated for constructing bandwidth-guaranteed tree. We show that the above problem is NP-hard, and an efficient heuristic algorithm called Largest Coverage Shortest-Path First (LC-SPF) is devised. Simulation results show that LC-SPF yields <b>comparable</b> <b>call</b> acceptance rate as the ILP formulation, but with much shorter running time. © 2010 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2009, p. 1 - 5 We {{consider}} multi-channel multi-interface wireless mesh networks with a schedule-based MAC protocol, where conflict-free {{transmission is}} ensured by requiring links assigned {{with the same}} channel and within the mutual interference range of each other to be active at different time slots. When a (point-to-multipoint) multicast call arrives, the call is accepted if a multicast distribution tree can be established for connecting the source node with all the receiving nodes, and with sufficient bandwidth reserved on each link. Otherwise, the call is rejected. To maximize the call acceptance rate, the multicast tree must be constructed judiciously upon each call arrival. Aiming at minimizing the carried load on the most-heavily loaded channel, and maximizing the residual capacity of the most heavily loaded node, an integer linear program (ILP) is formulated for multicast tree construction. Since solving ILP can be time-consuming, an efficient heuristic algorithm is then proposed. We compare the two tree construction algorithms by simulations. We found that both algorithms give <b>comparable</b> <b>call</b> acceptance rate, but the heuristic algorithm requires much shorter running time. © 2009 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|The Scinax perpusillus species group {{consists}} of thirteen bromeligenous treefrogs, of which only six {{have had their}} acoustic parameters appropriately described. In this work, we present the vocal repertory of Scinax littoreus (Peixoto, 1988) based on recordings obtained from three different populations {{in the state of}} Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Based on our observations we suggest that the vocal repertory of S. littoreus is composed of two distinct types of calls. The call named type A, which corresponds to a long series of multipulsed notes, is likely to have a mating function. This type of call is similar to that reported for Scinax arduous Peixoto, 2002, Scinax peixotoi Brasileiro, Haddad, Sawaya & Martins, 2007, and Scinax perpusillus (Lutz & Lutz, 1939). However, the type A call of S. littoreus is nonetheless readily distinguishable from the <b>comparable</b> <b>call</b> observed in other congeneric species. The call named type B, which exhibits a multipulsed structure, presumably has an aggressive function. We observed that different types of calls could be emitted alone or combined according to the social context.

5000|$|A small Rossby number signifies {{a system}} which is {{strongly}} affected by Coriolis forces, and a large Rossby number signifies {{a system in which}} inertial and centrifugal forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large (≈ 103), in low-pressure systems it is low (≈ 0.1 - 1) and in oceanic systems it is of the order of unity, but depending on the phenomena can range over several orders of magnitude (≈ 10−2 - 102). As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces (called cyclostrophic balance). Cyclostrophic balance also commonly occurs in the inner core of a tropical cyclone. In low-pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces (called geostrophic balance).
