If the web speed is 1200 m/min and web width 8.5 m, the web moves 280 m during a scan, and the sensor moves the same distance diagonally across the web. The measurements are taken on the diagonal line and act as basis for profile (machine and <b>cross-direction)</b> and variation calculations. This value is subject to integration depending on the machine speed.

Authorities cite public safety as the primary reason that the cameras are installed, while opponents contend their use is more for financial gain.There have been concerns that red light cameras scare drivers (who want to avoid a ticket) into more sudden stops, which may increase the risk of rear-end collisions. The elevated incentive to stop may mitigate broad-side crashes. Some traffic signals have an all red duration, allowing a grace period of a few seconds before the <b>cross-direction</b> turns green. Some studies have confirmed more rear-end collisions where red light cameras have been used, while broad-side crashes decreased, but the overall collision rate has been mixed. In some areas, the length of the yellow phase has been increased to provide a longer warning to accompany the red-light-running-camera. There is also concern that the international standard formula used for setting the length of the yellow phase ignores the laws of physics, which may cause drivers to inadvertently run the red phase.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{quality characteristic}} {{in the production}} of paper webs is the range of fluctuations in the basis weight. This should be kept as small as possible. The basis-weight profile is a measure of these fluctuations. Deviations in the profile that arise during the papermaking process can be rectified by installing slice screws across the web and by suitable control functions. However, due to web shrinkage and displacement in the cross direction, the location on which a slice screw is acting in the profile is not known. This relationship, or mapping, is an essential precondition for <b>cross-direction</b> control. If it cannot be implemented accurately enough, the profile develops unevenness and, in the worst case, becomes unstable. This paper describes a method that identifies this relationship by means of statistical process and a fuzzy decision logic, and that appropriately adapts <b>cross-direction</b> control...|$|E
40|$|Plane {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} step in feature extraction and 3 D modeling from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud. The accuracy and speed of plane segmentation are two issues difficult to balance, particularly when dealing with a massive point cloud with millions of points. A fast and easy-to-implement algorithm of plane segmentation based on cross-line element growth (CLEG) is proposed in this study. The point cloud is converted into grid data. The points are segmented into line segments with the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. Each point is then assigned to a cross-line element (CLE) obtained by segmenting the points in the <b>cross-directions.</b> A CLE determines one plane, and this is the rationale of the algorithm. CLE growth and point growth are combined after selecting the seed CLE to obtain the segmented facets. The CLEG algorithm is validated by comparing it with popular methods, such as RANSAC, 3 D Hough transformation, principal component analysis (PCA), iterative PCA, and a state-of-the-art global optimization-based algorithm. Experiments indicate that the CLEG algorithm runs much faster than the other algorithms. The method can produce accurate segmentation at a speed of 6 s per 3 million points. The proposed method also exhibits good accuracy...|$|R

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms shaping these swarms at the population level through a detailed characterization of the progeny of triploid Arabidopsis thaliana. We report that triploid meiosis predominately produced aneuploid gametes, most of which were viable. We performed reciprocal crosses between triploid and either diploid or tetraploid plants and karyotyped all surviving individuals. This allowed us to dissect the parent-of-origin (<b>cross-direction)</b> effects and also the effect of the dosage of the crossing partner on the inheritance of each chromosome type. Overall, our data indicate that the chromosomal composition of the swarms produced by the triploid A. thaliana were strongly influenced by selection acting against specific gamete combinations, but not necessarily associated with aneuploidy. Finally, each of the five chromosome types responded differently to this selection, suggesting the presence of dosage-sensitive factor(s) critical for viability and encoded on different chromosomes...|$|E

The upwind scheme is applied in our algorithm, to make it energy decay stable, which results in the fast speed of calculation. To make it more clear and understandable, we provide the specific code for forming the coefficient matrix used in Shift-Matrix Method. Our algorithm is compared with other methods in different scales, including Front Tracking and VOSET method in macroscopic and LBM method using RK model in mesoscopic scale.

40|$|During {{the drying}} {{stage of the}} {{papermaking}} process, paper undergoes dimensional changes caused by fiber dehydration, but exhibiting uneven width reduction magnitudes along the cross-machine direction. The degree of <b>cross-direction</b> (CD) shrinkage can be very different at the edges {{when compared to the}} center of the web. The highest shrinkage amplitude at the web edges can vary according to the operation conditions and the drying section configuration, as well. The difference in the degree of CD shrinkage gives rise to adverse effects on the finished CD paper sheet properties, particularly strength and hygroelastic properties, which can vary many percents from the edges {{to the center of the}} web. Extreme property values lead to different problems, such as sheet differential dimensional instability, which can limit paper quality and converting efficiency, especially in high speed machines (e. g., multi-color offset printing and office copier machines). The issues considered above make clear the advantages of measuring and carefully analyzing the differential CD shrinkage profile of finished paper. This work reviews the CD differential shrinkage profile development in the drying section, its impact on finished paper properties and presents an accurate and low cost measurement method based on image analysis techniques, supported by digital processing through the two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2 D-FFT).

Assumptions {{that are relevant to}} coating processes found in industry are used to develop a model for control design. We show how to identify the model from input-output data. This model is used to derive a model predictive controller to maintain flat profiles of coating across the substrate by varying the liquid flows along the cross direction. The model predictive controller computes the control action which minimizes the predicted deviation in cross-directional uniformity. The predictor combines the estimate obtained from the model with the measurement of the cross-directional uniformity to obtain a prediction for the next time step. A filter is used to obtain robustness to model error and insensitivity to measurement noise. The tuning of the noise filter and different methods for handling actuator constraints are studied in detail. The three different constraint-handling methods studied are: the weighting of actuator movements in the objective function, explicitly adding constraints to the control algorithm, i. e. constrained model predictive control, and scaling infeasible control actions calculated from an unconstrained control law to be feasible. Actuator constraints, measurement noise, model uncertainty, and the plant condition number are investigated to determine which of these limit the achievable closed loop performance. From knowledge of how these limitations affect the performance we find how the plant could be modified to improve the process uniformity. Also, because identification of model parameters is time-consuming and costly, we study how accurate the identification must be to achieve a given level of performance. The theory developed throughout the paper is rigorously verified though simulations and experiments on a pilot plant. The effect of interactions on the closed loop performance is shown to be negligible for this pilot plant. The measurement noise and the actuator constraints are shown to have the largest effect on closed loop performance...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. At Mondi Paper Ltd, Merebank, South of Durban, Paper Machine 2 has {{recently}} been transferred onto a Distributed Control System (DCS). This {{was seen as a}} good opportunity to enhance the control of the pulp feed to the machine. A prime concern in operating a paper machine is to ensure consistent set-point paper properties in the <b>Cross-Direction</b> (CD: ie. across the paper width) and in the Machine-Direction (MD: ie. along the paper length). Sophisticated adjustments are available to ensure an even feed of the stock (consistencies around 2 % m/m wood fibres in water) from the head-box across the receiving width of the paper machine. The properties of prime interest as the pulp is pumped through the head-box distributor onto the receiving belt of the machine are the basis weight (fibre mass per unit area) and moisture content (per unit area). However, the distribution system is highly dependent on the properties of the stock as it arrives at the head-box. Variations in upstream chest levels, the supplied pressure, flow-rate and fibre/water ratio, all cause MD and even CD variations. The problems of maintaining steady conditions at the head-box are well known, and are understood to arise from sub-optimal control in the preceding section involving a blend chest and machine chest, amongst other items, where several pulp streams and dilution water are combined. A number of control loops are involved, but appear to require different tuning for different paper grades. Often individual loops are taken off-line. In this study, an understanding of the controller interactions in the stock preparation section has been developed by detailed dynamic modelling, including all of the existing control loops. The model is built up in a modular fashion using a basic element, having one input (which can collect multiple streams originating elsewhere) and four outputs, linked through a vessel of variable volume. Several basic elements are linked together to form the overall system. All of the necessary properties can be defined so that the model allows the simulation of all features of the network: vessels, pipes, junctions, valves, levels and consistencies. A set of first order differential equations is solved which includes total water balance, species mass balances, derivatives of flow controller action, and derivatives of supervisory controller action. Supervisory controllers for consistency or level cascade onto flow controllers. Flow controllers manipulate valves which give a first-order dynamic response of actual flow. Where valves are manipulated directly by the supervisory level, the flow controller is effectively bypassed. This study involves a constraint problem around the blend chest, resulting in a loss of specification at the paper machine. This was solved by the implementation of a static optimiser. Its objective function penalizes deviations from setpoint of five parameters (ratios, consistency and level) using respective weight factors. Both the model and its optimiser were included in a simulator designed with the graphical user interface (GUI) of Matlab. The simulator has then been used to explore control performance over the operating range, by means of a set of scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Thermoacoustic engines {{promise to}} be a cost {{effective}} and reliable alternative to traditional Stirling engines, as {{the function of the}} piston is fulfilled by an acoustic wave. For the design and development of thermoacoustic devices, the one-dimensional thermoacoustic equations are commonly used. However, to further improve the performance of these devices {{a better understanding of the}} flow field and the acoustic losses inside of thermoacoustic components is required. To gain further insight, commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software is used in this thesis, as CFD allows revealing the entire flow field with all its physical quantities in the respective component of the thermoacoustic device. Reducing the numerical study to individual components of thermoacoustic devices is only possible with dedicated acoustic boundary conditions. As these boundary conditions are not yet readily available in commercial CFD packages, their implementation into ANSYS Fluent is included within the scope of this work. The boundary conditions are validated successfully in one- and two-dimensional cases against analytical solutions from the low-reduced frequency approximation. Furthermore, the analytical solutions are used in order to derive the optimal numerical parameters for thermoacoustic simulations and to give general rules of thumb for the spatial and time discretization. In a second step these parameters are applied to the simulations of four different thermoacoustic cases in order to show that CFD can lead to a better understanding of phenomena that are not incorporated in the one-dimensional thermoacoustic equations. The first investigated component is the thermal buffer tube. Its aim is to provide thermal insulation between the hot heat exchanger and the secondary ambient heat exchanger while transmitting the acoustic power out of the hot zone. However, due to the interaction of the acoustic wave with the temperature gradient, a two-dimensional steady mass flux called acoustic streaming occurs, which leads to undesired thermal losses. Using the implemented ideal heat exchanger boundary condition, the two-dimensional streaming field inside the thermal buffer tube is revealed and the influence of the wall properties on the streaming pattern is estimated. The temperature field resulting from the different streaming patterns as well as the repercussions on the acoustic properties are shown. The second investigated component is the U-bend that feeds back the acoustic wave in a traveling wave device. In the scope of reducing the size of the thermoacoustic devices, the bend becomes increasingly sharp, introducing additional losses and reflection as well as a velocity component in the <b>cross-direction,</b> which is expected to influence nearby components such as heat exchangers. The influence of the geometric parameters of the bend on the flow field are investigated in this thesis. The deviations from the analytical solution are revealed and for even sharper bends the onset of vortex generation is given. In general, this study shows the strength of numerical CFD simulations in thermoacoustics, as a large geometric parameter space could be investigated, leading to an in-depth understanding of the underlying flow phenomena. The subsequent study in this thesis makes the link between the one-dimensional thermoacoustic equations and the full time domain CFD, as it shows how the accuracy of the results from the one-dimensional equations can be increased when data from CFD is used. In this work the thermoacoustic functions, which incorporate the three-dimensional effects in the one-dimensional thermoacoustic equations, are calculated from CFD for a reduced model of a stacked screen regenerator, leading to more realistic values of the thermoacoustic functions. It is shown that the arrangement of the screens has an effect on the heat transfer inside the regenerator, while the viscous effects stay the same. This study shows that not only large components like bends and the thermal buffer tube can be successfully simulated with CFD, but so can small scale geometries like the ones inside the regenerator. In the last thermoacoustic study within this work, the entrance effects in a stacked screen regenerator are investigated for different geometric variations. The mean temperature profile due to the non-linear entrance effects and the heat pumped at the end of the stacked screen regenerator are calculated. Furthermore, a one-dimensional time dependent heat equation is used in order to predict the changes in mean temperature. In this one-dimensional time dependent heat transfer equation the thermal thermoacoustic function is used in order to estimate the heat transfer coefficient between the regenerator and the fluid. The results compare well with the CFD results. It can be concluded from the four studies conducted within this thesis that the simulation of components of thermoacoustic devices with commercial CFD is possible and that they will contribute to a better understanding of the flow phenomena inside of the respective components. This work paves the way towards the in-depth investigation of other components within the field of thermoacoustics using CFD...|$|E
