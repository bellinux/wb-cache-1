40|$|AbstractBackgroundPrevious reviews {{have shown}} that β-blocker use for the {{treatment}} of hypertension without <b>compelling</b> <b>indications</b> was associated with increased risk of stroke in the elderly. It remains unclear whether this increased risk was driven by the type of β-blocker. We sought to compare the efficacy of atenolol vs nonatenolol β-blockers in clinical trials enrolling young (< 60 years) and older patients with hypertension. MethodsThe Cochrane and MEDLINE databases were searched (January 2006 -May 2013) for randomized trials evaluating stroke, myocardial infarction, death, or composite cardiovascular end points. Twenty-one hypertension trials with data on 145, 811 participants were identified: 15 used atenolol, 7 were placebo-controlled trials, and 14 were active comparator trials. There were no trials of newer generation β-blockers identified. ResultsAmong the elderly, atenolol was associated with an increased risk of stroke (relative risk [RR], 1. 17; 95 % confidence interval [CI],  1. 05 - 1. 30) compared with other antihypertensive agents. The risk of stroke for nonatenolol β-blockers compared with other agents (RR,  1. 22; 95 % CI, 0. 99 - 1. 50) did not reach statistical significance in the elderly. In the young, atenolol was associated with reduced risk of stroke compared with other agents (RR, 0. 78; 95 % CI, 0. 64 - 0. 95), whereas nonatenolol β-blockers were associated with a lower risk of composite cardiac events (RR, 0. 86; 95 % CI, 0. 75 - 0. 996) compared with placebo, with no significant difference in events compared with active controls.

40|$|The {{description}} of the hadron production at very forward rapidities and low transverse momentum is usually made using phenomenological models based on nonperturbative physics. However, at high energies and large rapidities the wave function {{of one of the}} projectiles is probed at very small Bjorken x, being characterized by a large number of gluons. In this kinematical regime, a new state of matter - the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) - is expected to be formed. One the main characteristics of such system is the presence of a new dynamical momentum scale, the saturation scale Q_s, which can assume values very larger than the QCD confinement scale Λ_QCD and give the scale of the running coupling constant. In this paper we assume that in particular kinematical region probed by LHC forward (LHCf) experiment the saturation scale can be considered the hard momentum scale present in the process and calculate the forward neutral pion production at very low-p_T using a perturbative approach.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of drugs from 4 classes of antihypertensive medications commonly used in Nigeria in management of hypertension without <b>compelling</b> <b>indication</b> to use a particular antihypertensive drug. Methods The study employed decision analytic modeling. Interventions were obtained from a meta-analysis. The Markov process model calculated clinical outcomes and costs during a life cycle of 30 years of 1000 hypertensive patients stratified by 3 cardiovascular risk groups, under the alternative intervention scenarios. Quality adjusted life year (QALY) was used to quantify clinical outcome. The average cost of treatment for the 1000 patient was tracked over the Markov cycle model of the alternative interventions and results were presented in 2010 US Dollars. Probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulation, and results presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability frontiers. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and expected value of parameter perfect information (EVPPI) analyses were also conducted for the hypothetical population. Results Thiazide diuretic was the most cost-effective option across the 3 cardiovascular risk groups. Calcium channel blocker was the second best for Moderate risk and high risk with a willingness to pay of at least 2000 $/QALY. The result was robust since it was insensitive to the parameters alteration.

Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor contributing to increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Dual blood pressure (BP) -lowering and anti-inflammatory effect of renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) inhibitors may possess protective effect from MI in RA population. However, treatment of hypertension with RAS inhibitors and MI in RA population remains unclear. We investigated whether RAS blockade could decrease risk of incident MI in hypertensive patients with RA. We identified patients with RA and hypertension from the Registry for Catastrophic Illness, a nation-wide database encompassing almost all of the RA patients in Taiwan from 1995 to 2008. The primary endpoint was MI and the median duration of follow up was 2, 986 days. Propensity score weighting and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for MI. Among 27, 335 subjects, 9. 9 % received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), 25. 9 % received angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and 20. 0 % received ACEIs or ARBs alternatively. The incidence of MI significantly decreased in patients treated with ACEIs (hazard ratio 0. 707; 95 % confidence interval 0. 595 - 0. 840), ARBs (0. 641; 0. 550 - 0. 747) and ACEIs/ARBs (0. 631; 0. 539 - 0. 739). The protective effect of ACEI or ARB therapy was significantly better in patients taking longer duration. The effect remained robust in subgroup analyses.

ACEI/diuretic combination remained on the 3 rd position (16. 4 % and 15. 3 % respectively). Beta-blockers and diuretics as monotherapy shared 4 th and 5 th places in this rating. Calcium channel blockers popularity among Moscow prescribers remained unchanged and poor – 2. 1 %. The most popular medicine by trade name was Noliprel, perindopril/indapamide fixed combination, – 14. 0 % and 13. 7 % of respondents in 2011 - 12 and 2013 - 14, respectively. The share of medicine products recommended by INN went up from 11. 9 % to 22. 8 % among top- 10 popular medications (р< 0. 01). Conclusion. Blockers of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system remain the leading drugs for the initial treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate HT without <b>compelling</b> <b>indications</b> among Moscow primary care physicians. Regulatory requirement to prescribe medicinal products by INN was associated with significant increase in the share of drugs recommended by INN, though this effect was less than expected one. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, countless {{studies have shown}} that {{antihypertensive}} drug therapy substantially reduces the risk of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality. However, the optimal choice for initial pharmacotherapy of hypertension is still controversial. The guidelines for hypertension management agree on many items but differ on a very important point: the drug of first choice. The Seventh Report of the US Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure and the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension Statement on Management of Hypertension recommend, for uncomplicated hypertension, a thiazide diuretic, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes, and delineate specific conditions that are <b>compelling</b> <b>indications</b> for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes. The European guidelines state that all available drug classes are suitable for the initiation and maintenance of treatment and underline that the benefits of the antihypertensive therapy are, for the most part, due to lowering of blood pressure per se and depend scarcely on the type of drug used...|$|E
40|$|In this contributed talk I {{presented}} the observational evidence for supernova (SN) explosions {{of stars in}} the luminous blue variable (LBV) and the immediate post-LBV evolutionary phases. We now have <b>compelling</b> <b>indications</b> that two recent SNe of Type II-“narrow” (IIn) were the explosions of LBVs, including the direct identification of the progenitor LBV {{for one of these}} examples. A recent SN of Type Ic exploded as a helium star, two years after the powerful LBV outburst of its progenitor. These cases were also discussed by other presenters at this Workshop in some detail. I instead focus more on another example, SN 2001 em, which was first identified as a Type Ib/c, but later evolved to Type IIn. I argue that the progenitor of this SN exploded as a Wolf- Rayet (WR) star, following an eruptive LBV phase. Furthermore, I suggest that two “SN impostors,” i. e., extragalactic massive stars observed to undergo pre-SN LBV eruptions (similar to η Carinae), may well have evolved to the WR phase in real time...|$|E
40|$|Titan is {{the only}} world we know other than Earth that has a liquid on its surface. It has a thick {{atmosphere}} composed of nitrogen and methane with a thick organic haze. There are lakes, rain, and clouds of methane and ethane. Here, we {{address the question of}} carbon-based life living in Titan liquids. Photochemically produced organics, particularly acetylene, in Titan's atmosphere could be a source of biological energy when reacted with atmospheric hydrogen. Light levels on the surface of Titan are more than adequate for photosynthesis but the biochemical limitations due to the few elements available in the environment may lead only to simple ecosystems that only consume atmospheric nutrients. Life on Titan may make use of the trace metals and other inorganic elements produced by meteorites as they ablate in the atmosphere. It is conceivable that H 2 O molecules on Titan could be used in a biochemistry that is rooted in hydrogen bonds in a way that metals are used in enzymes by life on Earth. Previous theoretical work has shown possible membrane structures in Titan liquids, azotosomes, composed of small organic nitrogen compounds, such as acrylonitrile. The search for a plausible information molecule for life in Titan liquids remains an open research topic - polyethers have been considered and shown to be insoluble at Titan temperatures. Possible search strategies for life on Titan include looking for unusual concentrations of certain molecules reflecting biological selection. Homochirality is a special and powerful example of such biology selection. Environmentally, a depletion of hydrogen in the lower atmosphere may be a sign of metabolism. A discovery of life in liquid methane and ethane would be our first <b>compelling</b> <b>indication</b> that the Universe is full of diverse and wondrous life forms...|$|R
40|$|P 2 X 7 receptors are {{important}} in mediating the physiological functions of extracellular ATP, and altered receptor expression and function have a causative role in the disease pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the mechanisms determining the P 2 X 7 receptor function by following two human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations that replace His- 155 and Ala- 348 in the human (h) P 2 X 7 receptor with the corresponding residues, Tyr- 155 and Thr- 348, in the rat (r) P 2 X 7 receptor. H 155 Y and A 348 T mutations in the hP 2 X 7 receptor increased ATP-induced currents, whereas the reciprocal mutations, Y 155 H and T 348 A, in the rP 2 X 7 receptor caused the opposite effects. Such a functional switch is a <b>compelling</b> <b>indication</b> that these residues are critical for P 2 X 7 receptor function. Additional mutations of His- 155 and Ala- 348 in the hP 2 X 7 receptor to residues with diverse side chains revealed a different dependence on the side chain properties, supporting the specificity of these two residues. Substitutions of the residues surrounding His- 155 and Ala- 348 in the hP 2 X 7 receptor with the equivalent ones in the rP 2 X 7 receptor also affected ATP-induced currents but were not fully reminiscent of the H 155 Y and A 348 T effects. Immunofluorescence imaging and biotin labeling assays showed that H 155 Y in the hP 2 X 7 receptor increased and Y 155 H in the rP 2 X 7 receptor decreased cell-surface expression. Such contrasting effects were not obvious with the reciprocal mutations of residue 348. Taken together, our results suggest that residues at positions 155 and 348 contribute to P 2 X 7 receptor function via determining the surface expression and the single-channel function, respectively. Such interpretations {{are consistent with the}} locations of the residues in the structural model of the hP 2 X 7 receptor...|$|R
40|$|Background: Breastfeeding is {{considered}} as {{gold standard for}} infant nutrition and should be interrupted only when a <b>compelling</b> <b>indication</b> exists. Certain medical conditions such as abortion, stillbirth, HIV infection, or infant galactosemia and certain medications such as chemotherapy necessitate lactation inhibition to protect the health of mother and infant. Drug use evaluation (DUE) studies are done to explore the current practice in a setting and help to identify areas in which further information and education may be needed by clinicians. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct a DUE of cabergoline to assess indications for lactation inhibition, dosage regimen, and its safety. Method: A retrospective cross-sectional DUE study was conducted over a period of 4 months from September 1, 2013, till December 31, 2013, at the Women's Hospital, Qatar. All cabergoline prescriptions written for lactation inhibition within 10 days of delivery or abortion were included in the study. A descriptive data analysis was undertaken. Results: Of the 85 patients included, stillbirth (50. 6 %) was considered as the main reason for lactation inhibition, followed by abortion (27. 1 %) and neonatal death (12. 9 %). The remaining 9. 4 % of the patients had live baby, and the majority of them were prescribed cabergoline for lactation inhibition because their maternal medical conditions required the use of drugs with insufficient safety data (n= 6). Seventy-four percent of patients received cabergoline at accurate time and dose. However, 14 % of the patients had preexisting hypertensive disorder and 58. 3 % of them were diagnosed as uncontrolled hypertension. Conclusion: The current DUE study found that cabergoline was mainly used to inhibit lactation for patients with stillbirth, abortion, and neonatal death. In mothers who use medications for other medical conditions, benefits and risks of breastfeeding should be carefully balanced before prescribing cabergoline. Current prescribing pattern can be further enhanced through informing health care providers regarding appropriate cabergoline dosage regimen and its safety in patients with uncontrolled hypertension...|$|R
