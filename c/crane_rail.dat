Therefore, improvement of these components’ performance can be considered a task of high importance. A promising direction in this regard is surface treatment by highly concentrated energy flows such as laser beams or plasma jets. This thesis suggests that the use of gradient plasma surface treatment can improve the performance of <b>crane</b> <b>rails.</b> A research was conducted, according to which hardened zones were deposited on <b>crane</b> <b>rails</b> under different treatment modes. Microhardness was measured both at the surface and in depth using custom-made microsections. The article includes the results of study of plasma surface hardening effects on wear resistance of <b>crane</b> <b>rails.</b> Change of plasma surface treatment parameters (current, plasma torch movement speed, argon gas flow rate) allows for desired steel hardness and structure, while the choice of optimal location for hardened zones makes it possible to significantly improve wear resistance and crack resistance. As a result of plasma surface hardening, the fine-grained martensite structure is obtained with mainly lamellar morphology and higher hardness rate compared toinduction hardening or overlaying. Wear test of carbon steels revealed that plasma surfacing reduces abrasive wear rate compared to the irinitial state by 2 to 3 times. Enough sharp boundary between hardened and non-hardened portions has a positive effect on the performance of parts under dynamic loads, contributing to the inhibition of cracks during the transition from solid to a soft metal. For carbon and low alloy rail steels, the properties achieved by plasma surface hardening can effectively replace induction hardening or overlaying. The mode range for plasma surface treatment that allow sobtaining a surface layer with certain operating properties has been determined. </p...|$|R

Each <b>crane</b> <b>rail</b> was divided into segments, through which the planes were fitted and the characteristic rail lines were determined. Based on the profiles, positional and height rail offsets were determined between the characteristic points on the same profile, as well as the actual span and the height difference between the crane rails. Furthermore, it was verified whether the calculated geometry parameters complied with the rules set by the standard in question. The thesis also examined how the rail geometry parameters – as determined by the terrestrial laser scanning method – correspond with the parameters determined by the classical polar method of surveying. Furthermore, it was tested how the determination of patterns is influenced by the length of the segment as well as the density of rail points. Based on the conclusions drawn during the elaboration of this thesis, certain guidelines are given on how to ensure the quality of <b>crane</b> <b>rail</b> geometry determination using terrestrial laser scanning technology...|$|E

Guidelines, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 12488 - 1, define target values that must be determined by survey.
