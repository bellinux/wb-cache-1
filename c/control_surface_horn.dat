50|$|Like all Junkers duralumin-structured designs, {{from the}} 1918 J 7 to the 1932 Ju 46, (some 35 models), it used an {{aluminium}} alloy (duralumin) structure entirely covered with Junkers' characteristic corrugated and stressed duralumin skin. Internally, the wing was built up on nine circular cross-section duralumin spars with transverse bracing. All <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> were <b>horn</b> balanced.|$|R
50|$|The FC.12 was {{powered by}} a 450 kW (600 hp) FIAT A.30 R.A. liquid-cooled V-12 engine, fitted with a chin radiator. The two crew had tandem seats, the aft one behind the wing {{trailing}} edge, under a multi-framed canopy. The horizontal tail was elliptical in plan and mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage. Fin and rudder were similarly shaped, with the rudder ending at the upper fuselage. All the rear <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> were <b>horn</b> balanced and the elevators carried tabs. There was a small, faired tailwheel on the extreme fuselage.|$|R

50|$|The Georges Payre was {{powered by}} a 67 kW (90 hp) Continental C90 {{air-cooled}} flat four engine in the nose of its rectangular section, round decked fuselage. Fuel tanks were in the wings. The occupants sat in tandem under a long, framed canopy with individual, starboard-hinged sections for access. Solo control was from the forward seat, over the wing. The conventional cantilever tail had swept, straight-edged vertical surfaces, with a rudder that extended to the keel and horizontal surfaces mounted at mid-fuselage height forward of the rudder hinge. The <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> were <b>horn</b> balanced {{and there was a}} large trim tab on the port elevator.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around a rectangular steel tube structure. This was aluminium skinned around the engine, upper decking and extreme tail, and fabric covered over plywood elsewhere. The single cockpit was well aft of the wings and could be open or enclosed. The tailplane was wooden and plywood plus fabric covered, but the fin and <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> were fabric covered steel frames. The <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> were <b>horn</b> balanced and the tail plane incidence could be trimmed in flight. The fin, too, was directionally adjustable, but only on the ground. The undercarriage was fixed, with semi-cantilever faired legs from the leading edge stubs braced high up the legs and inwards to the fuselage bottom with faired struts. The optionally spatted wheels were oleo damped and had differential brakes. There was a sprung tailskid.|$|R
2500|$|The A1 is a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. The wing has straight edges, with sweep only on {{the leading}} edge, and squared tips. [...] It is a single piece structure of light alloy construction, with Frise type mass balanced ailerons which are fabric covered aft of the spar; a ground adjustable trim tab is fitted on the port side. [...] There are no flaps. [...] The empennage is also straight tapered and of similar construction to the wing, though the rudder is fabric covered. There is a small dorsal fin. [...] All rear <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> are <b>horn</b> balanced; the tailplane's incidence can be adjusted {{on the ground and}} the starboard elevator has a ground adjustable trim tab.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Breguet 900 was plywood-covered and of oval cross-section, nearly circular aft of {{the wing}} and deepening markedly to accommodate the cockpit. The fin and rudder were also ply-covered, bearing fabric-covered <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The <b>horn</b> balanced rudder was broad and reached between the elevators {{to the bottom of}} the fuselage. Some production aircraft had taller vertical surfaces than those of earlier 900s. The straight-tapered horizontal surfaces folded upwards for ease of transport. Early models used an angular, multi-piece canopy, later supplanted by a smooth single piece Plexiglas one. The rear of the canopy joined the high upper fuselage line continuously. The Breguet 900 landed on a fixed monowheel undercarriage with a protective ash noseskid ahead of it. Unusually, the tow-release involved two hooks, one on either side of the fuselage just under the wing leading edge.|$|R
5000|$|The MS.341 was {{a typical}} Morane-Saulnier parasol wing monoplane, though it was {{intended}} to bring this tradition into line with 1930s practice.

The fuselage was flat sided with a curved decking and tandem open cockpits, the forward one under the wing leading edge where there was a cut-out for better visibility.

50|$|The Bernard 200s {{were the}} company's only {{attempt to break}} into the growing 1930s market for touring aircraft. They were clean, single-engine, {{cantilever}} high-wing aircraft with a cabin carefully thought out for potential buyers. In plan the wings had straight leading edges and taper on the trailing edges. They were metal structures, built around twin spars and fabric-covered. Full-span ailerons were fitted, with flaps built into the innermost 1.5 m. The tail surfaces were straight-edged, swept only on their leading edges; their <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> were all <b>horn</b> balanced and fitted with trim tabs.

2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> (such as an elevator or rudder).

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework is}} developed {{for assessing the}} effect of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial loads on hypersonic vehicle response. The framework {{is based on a}} partitioned, time-marching approach in which the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> equations of motion are in-tegrated independently and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the two systems at pre-determined time intervals. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form. Equations of motion for both the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> are presented and a formulation for coupling the two systems is outlined which includes iterations within each aeroelastic time step. The methodology is applied to a representative hypersonic vehicle elevator <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> model which includes aerother-moelastic effects and is attached to a single degree of freedom oscillator representing the fuselage.
