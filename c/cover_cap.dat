50|$|One final {{development}} of the Stielhandgranate was implemented during the later stages of the First World War, and was very minor in differences to the original. Identical in function to the Model 1916, but yet another change was made to the actual priming system. The base of the Stielhandgrante's handle was slightly redesigned, and a metal <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> was introduced. This cap concealed the porcelain bead and pull cord, allowing it to simply rest freely inside of the handle. The <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> would simply be pulled off, and the M16's motions followed.|$|E
50|$|The Gonset's {{receiver}} was manually tuned {{over the}} unit's frequency range with an analog dial, while the transmitter frequency {{was controlled by}} a crystal oscillator. The original model had a single jack on the front panel for an FT-243 style crystal. A chain of frequency multipliers allowed crystals in the 8 MHz range to be used. Many such crystals were available as military surplus in the 1950s. Later models had jacks for four crystals with a switch to select which one to use. Models were available for the 6 meter and 2 meter amateur bands, as well for as the VHF aircraft airband where they were often used as ground stations at smaller airfields. The civil defense model was painted yellow with CD insignia, and was available for the 6 and 2 meter bands. The 2 meter model was also used for the Civil Air Patrol, and could <b>cover</b> <b>CAP</b> frequencies which were adjacent to the 2 meter amateur band.|$|E

40|$|The Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) {{incorporates}} plated seals for {{use with}} (1) the port cover plates, (2) process valves of the shield plug, and (3) test plug ofthe <b>cover</b> <b>cap.</b> These seals are required to maintain leakage rates as low as 10 {sup - 7 } scc/atm-sec. in the <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> to test plug seal. The seals are manufactured by EG&G division of Perkin Elmer. Currently, the MCO design calls for use of silver or gold plated seals in these locations. The seal plating materials are deposited on Inconel 718 or X- 750 substrates. Some of these seals are reused several times in service on the MCO. The MCO manufacturer has built several MCOs {{and is in the}} leak testing stage and has had great difficulty obtaining acceptable leakage rates at their plant in Camden, New Jersey. The seal manufacturer was called in to evaluate the situation and now the seal manufacturer recommends tin plated seals. This evaluation examines the Corrosion resistance and thermal stability of tin plating on the seals. The use of tin plating on MCO seals was evaluated for corrosion resistance and thermal stability. The corrosion resistance of tin in the expected MCO environments is acceptable. The effect of radiation hardening will offset creep deformation results. However, a low melting point indicates unsuitability at significantly elevated temperatures...|$|E

40|$|The MCO is {{designed}} to facilitate the removal, processing and storage of the spent nuclear fuel currently stored in the East and West K-Basins. The MCO is a stainless steel canister approximately 24 inches in diameter and 166 inches long with <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> installed. The shell and the collar which is welded to the shell are fabricated from 304 / 304 L dual certified stainless steel for the shell and F 304 /F 304 L dual certified for the collar. The shell has a nominal thickness of 1 / 2 inch. The top closure consists of a shield plug with four processing ports and a locking ring with jacking bolts to pre-load a metal seal under the shield plug. The fuel is placed in one of four types of baskets, excluding the SPR fuel baskets, in the fuel retention basin. Each basket is then loaded into the MCO which is inside the transfer cask. Once all of the baskets are loaded into the MCO, the shield plug with a process tube is placed into the open end of the MCO. This shield plug provides shielding for workers when the transfer cask, containing the MCO, is lifted from the pool. After being removed from the pool, the locking ring is installed and the jacking bolts are tightened to pre-load the metal main closure seal. The cask is then sealed and the MCO taken to the Cold Vacuum Drying (CVD) facility for bulk water removal and vacuum drying through the process ports. Covers for the process ports may be installed or removed as needed per operating procedures. The MCO is then transferred to the Canister Storage Building (CSB), in the closed transfer cask. At the CSB, the MCO is then removed from the cask and becomes one of two MCOs stacked in a storage tube. MCOs will have a <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> welded over the shield plug providing a complete welded closure. A number of MCOs may be stored with just the mechanical seal to allow monitoring of the MCO pressure, temperature, and gas composition...|$|E

40|$|Materials {{acting as}} a source of {{environmental}} contamination often consist of contaminated soil or sediment. A source also could involve sludge, debris, solid waste, non aqueous-phase liquids, equipment, drums, or storage tanks. 3 Remediation of contaminated sites often involves containment systems to address the contaminant source(s). Containment systems may operate ex situ and/or in situ. Ex situ processes may involve excavating contaminated source material and placing it in an engineered containment area (cell) that is lined, such as a landfill, or an area designated as a consolidation unit that is typically unlined. An ex situ source containment system often includes a <b>cover</b> (<b>cap),</b> which is required for a closed landfill. A hazardous waste landfill constructed under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act also requires a leachate collection and removal system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} is to document the structural adequacy of Multi-Canister Overpacks (MCOs) in two separate normal configurations for the 40 -year interim period in the storage tubes at the Canister Storage Building (CSB). The two configurations apply when the lower MCO is arranged with (1) just a shield plug mechanical closure or (2) with the canister cover welded over the shield plug. Multiple analyses have been conducted to show the MCO design is adequate for drop events involving a lower, passive MCO being struck by an overhead drop load MCO both in vertical position. Minimal plastic deformations are experienced for either the MCO with shield plug or the MCO with <b>cover</b> <b>cap.</b> This survivability at 35 g's demonstrates the package's worthiness for 40 years of storage. The force between the two MCOs created by a drop event far exceed that resulting from stacking two loaded MCOs. The stacking load condition is not a structural concern and is, therefore, acceptable for the design duration of 40 years of storage. Both mechanical and welded cap models have the lifting ring and associated flat plate for the top unit to rest on and, therefore, easily fit together. Both designs were analyzed for the top unit to be dropped onto the lower unit. The mechanical seal unit only has high localized stress. The capped unit {{has a tendency to}} buckle but is still acceptable. Both designs will still be adequate for leakage and pressure during passive storage and are acceptable for the design duration of 40 years...|$|E
40|$|The Sub-project W 379, ''Spent Nuclear Fuel Canister Storage Building (CSB),'' was {{established}} {{as part of}} the Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project. The primary mission of the CSB is to safely store spent nuclear fuel removed from the K Basins in dry storage until such time that it can be transferred to the national geological repository at Yucca Mountain Nevada. This sub-project was initiated in late 1994 by a series of studies and conceptual designs. These studies determined that the partially constructed storage building, originally built {{as part of the}} Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP) Project, could be redesigned to safely store the spent nuclear fuel. The scope of the CSB facility initially included a receiving station, a hot conditioning system, a storage vault, and a Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) Handling Machine (MHM). Because of evolution of the project technical strategy, the hot conditioning system was deleted from the scope and MCO welding and sampling stations were added in its place. This report outlines the methods, procedures, and outputs developed by Project W 379 to verify that the provided Structures, Systems, and Components (SSCs) : satisfy the design requirements and acceptance criteria; perform their intended function; ensure that failure modes and hazards have been addressed in the design; and ensure that the SSCs as installed will not adversely impact other SSCs. Because this sub-project is still in the construction/start-up phase, all verification activities have not yet been performed (e. g., canister <b>cover</b> <b>cap</b> and welding fixture system verification, MCO Internal Gas Sampling equipment verification, and As-built verification.). The verification activities identified in this report that still are to be performed will be added to the start-up punchlist and tracked to closure...|$|E

40|$|Bouillante {{geothermal}} field (Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe, French West Indies) is {{located near the}} Western coast of Guadeloupe Island, about 15 km from the presently active Soufrière volcano. We have studied the subsurface structure of a zone encompassing the geothermal area using geophysical data. The {{need to understand the}} geological context of the Bouillante geothermal Province has led to numerous onshore and offshore geophysical investigations. This work presents a compilation of all available, subaerial and marine, gravity and magnetic, electric and magnetotelluric data acquired during the last 30 years. To the first order, this synthesis could act as a guide in the implantation of upcoming surveys in order to better constrain the Bouillante geothermal Province, and to improve the knowledge the island evolution as a whole. Oldest electric and magnetotelluric data were digitalized from manuscripts. Although we faced different problems related to missing acquisition parameters, we partially reconstruct MT tensors to provide a qualitative interpretation of resistivity distribution at depth. Geophysical models have been initiated based on geological constraints and previous geophysical interpretations. We are able to differentiate structures pre- and post-dating the different magnetic inversions using the magnetic measurements according to the polarity of the anomalies. The gravity measurements are used to detect and characterise the dense complexes from the low dense areas, allowing us to complete the magnetic measurements in regard {{of the nature of the}} Bouillante Chain formations. The electromagnetic surveys allow us to determine the distribution of electrical resistivities which we interpret in terms of water saturation of rocks, hydrothermal alteration and the presence of hydrated mineral. The integration of the geophysical results has allowed us to build up an updated model of the geothermal system based on geological constraints and previous geophysical interpretations. At the scale of the Province of geothermal Bouillante, the previously proposed conceptual model is clarified through a formations layering associated with petrophysical parameters (density, magnetization, resistivity), in agreement with the classical scheme of geothermal reservoirs. The distribution of resistivities in depth highlights the succession of resistive-conductive-resistive layers, classic in volcanic field. The shallow resistant is relatively well explain in terms of massive formations, dense (not affected by hydrothermal alteration) and recent, associated with the Axial Chain or Chain Bouillante. The conductive intermediate layer marks the intermediate clay <b>cover</b> (<b>cap</b> rock) of the geothermal system, associated with low dense and demagnetized rocks altered by hydrothermal action (at least in the productive areas recognized on the surface). The deep resistive layer is associated with dense formations, older according to depth (oldest formations of the Axial Chain or lava flows from the northern chain). This latter could correspond to the deep geothermal reservoir whose morphology and extension are discussed. Based on our geophysical data and modeling, the geothermal activity could be more developed toward the north compared to the previously proposed extension. Moreover, a major volcano-structural control is evident on various configurations of the {{geothermal field}}. The various faults recognized in this key sector seem to affect significantly the internal structure of the Province of Bouillante, and consequently the development of geothermal activity. The horst and graben structure in conditions undoubtedly the morphology of the clay cover and operation of the field.
