5|$|According to verse 18, she is venerated because Devi {{is eight}} {{attendant}} deities of Indra ("Vasus"); the eleven Rudras; and the twelve Adityas or sun gods representing each month of a year.

Several retailers will distribute all varieties of the product, occasionally with an increased price for censored versions, while some sellers offer the amended pressings as their main options and <b>choose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> distribute the explicit counterparts. However, the label has been questioned for its perceived ineffectiveness in limiting the amount of inappropriate material that young audiences are exposed to.|$|E

5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who <b>choose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|The act {{has also}} faced {{challenges}} and opposition. In 2009, Senator Ted Kennedy died, {{and the resultant}} special election cost the Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof Senate majority before the ACA had been fully passed by Congress. The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in 2012 that states could <b>choose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> participate in the ACA's Medicaid expansion, although it upheld the law as a whole. The federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov, initially faced major technical problems during its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified Republican government failed to pass several different partial repeals of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by a slim plurality of Americans polled, although its provisions were generally more popular than the law as a whole, and the law gained plurality support by 2017.|$|E

25|$|Large {{negative}} earnings surprises {{may have}} legal and reputational costs to managers. Firstly, managers {{can be held}} personally liable if shareholders sue the firm for failing to disclose negative earnings news promptly. Secondly, money managers may <b>choose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hold, and analysts may <b>choose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> follow, the stocks of firms whose managers have reputations for withholding bad news. This may contribute to managers' voluntary disclosure of information related to negative earnings surprises: quarterly earnings announcements containing large negative earnings surprises are preempted by voluntary disclosures more frequently than are other earnings announcements.|$|E

Traders may, on the other hand, <b>choose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> accept banknotes as payment, as contract law across the United Kingdom allows parties not to engage in a transaction at the point of payment if they <b>choose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E
