50|$|Crown volumes can be {{measured}} {{as an extension of}} the basic crown spread measurement. One method is to map a network of points on the outer surface of the crown from various positions around the tree and plotted by map position and height. The crown itself can be subdivided into smaller segments and the volume of each segment calculated individually. For example, the crown could be subdivided into a series of disk-like slices by elevation, the volume of each disk calculated, and the total of all the disks are added together to determine crown volume. Frank developed a simpler method that requires measuring average crown spread, height of the crown from base to top, and matching the <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> to best fit of a family of <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> shapes. The method calculates the volume enclosed by rotating the selected profile around the axis of the tree given the measured crown length and average crown spread.|$|E
40|$|<b>Crown</b> <b>profile</b> {{is mostly}} {{related to the}} {{competition}} of individual trees in the stands, light interception, growth, and yield of trees. A total of 76 sample trees with a total number of 889 whorls and 3658 live branches were used to develop the outer <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> model of the planted Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica trees in Heilongjiang Province, China. The power-exponential equation, modified Kozak equation, and simple polynomial equation were used and the model which showed the best performance {{was used as the}} basic model. The dummy variable approach was used to analyze the effect of stand age and stand density on the <b>crown</b> <b>profile.</b> Quantile regression for linear mixed-effects model, where the correlations between the series measurements on the same subject were considered, was used to model the outer <b>crown</b> <b>profile.</b> The results indicated that the power-exponential equation had the smallest error and was used as the basic model. Based on the dummy variable approach, stand age and stand density showed significant effects on the <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> on the whole. Thus, they were directly included into the linear form of the power-exponential equation by a natural logarithm transformation to develop the quantile regression for the linear mixed-effects model. The 0. 95 th quantile regression model performed best in modeling the outer <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> when compared to other quantiles. The prediction accuracy of the 0. 95 th quantile regression model by adding the random effects increased when compared to the quantile regression without random effect. The quantile regression for the linear mixed-effects model also showed an excellent performance in the largest crown radius prediction when compared to the quantile regression model. From suppressed trees to dominant trees, the crown radius increased, with tree size increasing for the same stand age and stand density increases. The crown radius of the suppressed trees from 21 to 40 year stands was the largest and the smallest was from older (> 40 years) stands. The crown radius for both the intermediate and dominant trees from 21 to 40 year stands were similar and were larger than the younger (10 – 20 years) stands. The crown radius increased with tree size when the stand variables were constant. Furthermore, the crown radius increased with the increase of stand age, decreased with increasing stand density, and decreased with increased ratio of tree height to diameter at the breast height (HD) for trees with the same tree variables. Stand density had a weaker effect on the <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> when compared to the HD. The growth rate of the crown radius of planted Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica trees increased with increasing stand age, and decreased with decreasing stand density. The growth rate of the crown radius decreased with increasing HD...|$|E
40|$|Taiwan red cypress (Chamaecyparis formosensis Matsum) is an {{indigenous}} and important cypress conifer {{with a broad}} area of natural forests and plantations in Taiwan. Because of the high economic value and multiple uses of the species, numerous researchers have studied its growth and yield within plantation forests. However, {{few studies have examined}} how the crown characteristics of the tree respond to different thinning regimes, particularly in the long run. The crown is a dominant outline of aboveground component of a tree that can sensitively reflect competitions from trees located nearby.  This study evaluated the crown form of Taiwan red cypress at three different growth stages with different thinning intensities over 20 years. The study began in 1982, when the three plantations examined were aged 7, 15, and 21  years, and when thinning treatments began. In 2002, crown form parameters (CFPs) and <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> equations (CPEs) were used to analyze the thinning effects at the tree level. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that age class influenced most CFPs and that thinning treatments influenced all CFPs, indicating that both factors could simultaneously affect the CFPs.  Moreover, the CPEs fit the observed data well for all age classes, demonstrating that the equation had a high capacity for predicting crown form.  The CPEs were used to determine the mean crown shape profile for each thinning treatment and age class. According to the mean <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> predicted by CPEs, we found that crown length and width increased with thinning intensity for all aged trees, especially after a heavy thinning treatment. </p...|$|E

There are three major components of these models: a polynomial trend, an ARMA model, and unaccounted for variation. The polynomial trend was used to achieve a stationary series.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 <b>Crown</b> <b>profile</b> {{was modeled}} using {{a system of}} {{equations}} with three components. The first equation predicts the maximum crown width of an open grown tree based on the tree's diameter at breast height. The second equation modifies maximum crown width to represent the largest width of the crown in stand grown trees. The third component {{of the system is}} a group of equations which model the relative position of a stand grown tree's largest crown width and modify the largest width of the crown to represent the width of the crown at all heights throughout the crown. Existing maximum crown width equations were scaled to match the geographic region of the Western Willamette Valley. Independent datasets and non-linear regression techniques were used to fit the remaining models. Equations for modeling crown widths at heights at and above the height of the largest crown width were highly predictive. Unfortunately, equations for modeling crown widths at lower heights than the largest crown width were considerably less accurate.

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of the absolute and relative size of individual cusps, {{the arrangement of the}} primary fissure system and the shape of coronal cross sections of the tooth crown have been used to investigate the pattern of variation in Plio-Pleistocene hominid mandibular molar teeth. Teeth were either grouped into one of six taxonomic categories or considered as individual cases. Univariate analysis of relative cusp areas shows that the two taxonomic categories of 'robust' hominids from East and Southern Africa have relatively small mesial cusps, but a relatively large entoconid and hypoconulid and Principal Component plots of the data show that the 'robust' categories can be distinguished on the basis of relative cusp size. Other evidence suggests that these differences {{are not likely to be}} the result of allometric phenomena. Fissure pattern was analysed using the X/Y coordinates of defined reference points. Patterns were compared by Procrustes analysis and the relationships between teeth contained in the resulting similarity matrix were portrayed using Principal Coordinates plots and a nearest neighbours table. The positions of the posterior fovea and the mesial longitudinal fissure were important for distinguishing taxonomic categories. The shape of the coronal profiles proved difficult to quantify, but there were consistent and distinct differences between the South African 'robust' sample and teeth included within the East African Homo category. When these results are combined with those of a previous study of overall crown size and the distribution of extra cusps, they allow the affinities of isolated teeth or contentious specimens to be assessed. For example, our results show that KNM-ER 1506 and 1802 are more similar to the East African Homo group than any other category, and they indicate that though SK 1587 and 1588 are small teeth, they nonetheless are closest to the South African 'robust' category in terms of relative cusp size, fissure pattern and <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> shape.

40|$|Spray-forming is a newly {{developed}} industrial metal forming {{process in which}} a cylindrical metal billet is produced by the incremental deposition and solidification of an atomised metal spray on a moving substrate. A mathematical model is developed to describe billet growth and heat flow within spray-formed aluminium alloy billets. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, growth dynamics of the billet are considered. Conservation of mass at the billet surface yields a single first order quasi-linear partial differential equation for the movement of the billet surface; the nonlinearity arising from the possibility of surface shadowing. The existence of two distinctly different timescales, amongst the process motions governing billet growth, prompts the use of an averaging method. The resulting averaged equations permit analysis and are shown to provide a valid asymptotic approximation to the billet surface motion on the timescale 1 /∊, for a suitably defined class of billet surfaces. The parameter ∊ ≪ 1 is the ratio of the two process timescales. Conditions under which the <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> of the cylindrical billet becomes steady are analysed, through the averaged equations, and the stability of such profiles is examined. Computed examples of single and multiple steady state crown profiles are given. The averaged equations are also solved numerically to provide a model for transient billet growth on a "slow" timescale; results are presented. The second part of the thesis considers heat flow within the growing billet. Phase change is incorporated using an enthalpy formulation of the energy equation. The resulting equation is a nonlinear heat equation that must be solved in an expanding domain, the boundary of which is determined by solution of the billet growth model equations. Conduction on the billet length-scale takes place only on the slow timescale, with more rapid heat flow taking place only close to the billet surface. Accordingly, billet heat flow is analysed through the assumption that there is a thermal boundary layer close to the billet surface, which is driven by the "rapid" timescale spray deposition, with heat flow in the remainder of the billet driven by the time-averaged growth. The boundary layer equation is a one dimensional nonlinear advection-diffusion equation, with a nonlinear boundary condition that incorporates the intermittent deposition from the spray in the form of an irregular pulse. This equation is solved numerically using an implicit finite difference method. The slow-time heat flow is two dimensional, (assuming axisymmetric slow-time billet growth), and must also be solved numerically. For this an implicit predictor-corrector method is used. The predictor stage uses a "splitting" method, adapted from the fully implicit L. O. D. method to take account of the expanding domain. The method appears to be stable and consistent. Various numerical results are presented. The model provides significant new understanding of the dynamics of billet growth and succeeds in providing a useful framework within which the transient heat flow that occurs during spray deposition, on a number of different timescales and length-scales, can be understood. Comparison of computed model predictions with real sprayed billets confirms the validity of the model. The thesis is concluded with a summary of results and a look at possible future directions for research in this area. </p...|$|E
40|$|Four roller {{profiles}} used in {{cylindrical roller}} bearing design and manufacture were analyzed using both a closed form solution and finite element analysis (FEA) for stress and life. The roller profiles analyzed were flat, tapered end, aerospace, and fully crowned loaded against a flat raceway. Four rolling-element bearing life models were chosen for this analysis and compared. These were those of Weibull, Lundberg and Palmgren, Ioannides and Harris, and Zaretsky. The flat roller profile without edge loading has the longest predicted life. However, edge loading can reduce life {{by as much as}} 98 percent. The end tapered profile produced the highest lives but not significantly different than the aerospace <b>profile.</b> The fully <b>crowned</b> <b>profile</b> produces the lowest lives.

The form of tip relief profile adopted is shown to be highly influential in determining the peak contact pressures and thinnest oil films within the contacts. These conditions are experienced at all axial positions on the tooth flanks at the locations of the start of tip relief profile modifications.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{a museum}} of {{avalanche}} phenomena, glide cracks and glide avalanches might be housed in the “strange but true ” section. These oddities are uncommon in most snow climates and tend to be isolated to specific terrain features such as bedrock slabs. Many glide cracks never result in avalanches, and when they do, {{the wide range of}} time between crack formation and slab failure makes them highly unpredictable. Despite their relative rarity, glide cracks and glide avalanches pose a regular threat and complex forecasting challenge during the annual spring opening of the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park, U. S. A. During the 2006 season, a series of unusual glide cracks delayed snow removal operations by over a week and provided a unique opportunity to record detailed observations of glide avalanches and characterize their occurrence and associated weather conditions. Field observations were from snowpits, <b>crown</b> <b>profiles</b> and where possible, measurements of slab thickness, bed surface slope angle, substrate and other physical characteristics. Weather data were recorded at one SNOTEL site and two automated stations located from 0. 6 - 10 km of observed glide slab avalanches. Nearly half (43 %) of the 35 glide slab avalanches recorded were Class D 2 - 2. 5, with 15 % Class D 3 -D 3. 5. The time between glide crack opening and failure ranged from 2 days to over six weeks, and the avalanches occurred in cycles associated with loss of snow water equivalent and spikes in temperature and radiation. We conclude with suggestions for further study...|$|R

Crown width and shape equations were derived and used to quantify the stand crown area at incremental heights above the forest floor. <b>Crown</b> area <b>profiles</b> describe the spatial arrangement of aboveground forest vegetation and the total pore spaces between crowns. Plot by plot profiles were combined to produce vertical and horizontal displays of the stand crown area distribution. In complex stands, the forest space was moderately occupied by crowns from the forest floor up to heights over 30 m, producing uniform distributions of between-crown porosity. The structurally complex stands had between-crown porosity values of 70 % to 90 % for more than 23 vertical metres of canopy, and they had total between-crown porosities of 86 % to 91 %. The structurally simple stands had between-crown porosity values of 70 % to 90 % for less than 8 vertical metres of canopy, and they had total between-crown porosities of 69 % to 85 %.

Prior to evaluating the baking {{properties of}} small quantities {{of all these}} proteins, a micro method for cake-baking was developed using a high-ratio white layer cake formulation. All blood plasma proteins denatured at lower temperatures than ovalbumin and globulins of egg white. Denaturation temperature of ovalbumin, the major protein of egg white, was about 9 °C {{higher than that of}} albumin which is the predominant protein in blood plasma. Fibrinogen was the most heat sensitive, and [gamma]-globulins were the most heat stable proteins in blood plasma with denaturation temperatures of 57 and 83. 5 °C, respectively. Plasma had similar foam capacity as egg white, but the foam stability of plasma was significantly less than that of egg white. Contrary to whole blood plasma, some of its constituent proteins, such as albumin, Cohn fraction IV- 1 (predominantly [alpha]-globulins), and fibrinogen, exhibited good foaming capacities and stabilities.

Results are shown of a transient elastohydrodynamic (EHL) analysis of the conditions at the contact of two pairs of helical gears operating with different gear ratios. The effects of the variation of contact geometry, kinematics and tooth loading during the meshing cycle are taken into account together with both tip relief and axial <b>crowning</b> <b>profile</b> modifications. The form of tip relief profile adopted is shown to be highly influential in determining the peak contact pressures and thinnest oil films within the contacts. These conditions are experienced at all axial positions on the tooth flanks at the locations of the start of tip relief profile modifications. If the tip relief profile introduces a slope discontinuity to the gear profile then this can cause a significant stress concentration and very poor film forming behaviour. A range of tip relief profiles are investigated, from linear tip relief to fully parabolic forms.

40|$|Although {{isolated}} theropod dinosaur teeth occur {{frequently in}} Late Mesozoic rocks, {{an understanding of}} their taxonomic utility remains elusive. This neglect of theropod tooth data {{is based on an}} impression that it is difficult or impossible to discriminate these elements. However, while theropod crowns are simple structures possessing few homologous landmarks from which measurements concordant with modern morphometrics can be made, theropod dental anatomy is largely unexplored and opinions regarding theropod tooth usefulness are premature. An attempt was made to devise a methodology by which isolated teeth could be confidently assigned to or discriminated from a standard dataset obtained from the in situ dentitions of a number of well established taxa (e. g., Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus, Gorgosaurus). The standard was established using a number of revised and newly derived variables that describe total crown length, base length and width, base shape, “squatness,” and apex location, as well as those that examine serration size. Crown recurvature was described by collecting X, Y data from digitized images of the mesial and distal <b>crown</b> <b>profiles.</b> The square root function Y = a + bX 0. 5 was fit to the data after they were translated to 0, 0 and normalized to 1 (by dividing the data by the range of x values). The b value generated from this nonlinear regression provides a measure of crown face curvature and can be isolated for use in additional analyses. These methods were combined with qualitative description to produce the first detailed study of the dentition of a single theropod, Tyrannosaurus rex, to assess the feasibility of obtaining valid systematic characters from theropod dentitions. The variables developed were then used to analyze a number of isolated theropod crowns. Using discriminant function analysis, isolated tooth test cases of presumed tyrannosaurid and non-tyrannosaurid affinities were compared against the standard. Using these methods, cf. Tyrannosaurus teeth were correlated with Tyrannosaurus and teeth thought not to be Tyrannosaurus were separated from T. rex with statistical confidence. These results suggest that increasing the number of taxa in the standard should permit confident identification of numerous types of isolated crowns. ...|$|R

The idea {{is based on the}} fact that most conifer crowns are in a form of solid geometry. We model a conifer crown as a generalized ellipsoid; establish the optimal tree model using a geometric equation; and then apply the optimal tree model to guide a conventional pyramid image matching in crown surface reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed- approach is illustrated using an example of a redwood tree on 1 : 2, 400 aerial photographs. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{aesthetic}} outcome of treatment was analysed after immediate implant placement in 16 patients. During implant installation {{the gap between}} the implant and the buccal plate was filled with a bone substitute. Only single tooth replacements were included; the final crowns were placed 3 - 6 months after implant installation, all with individual manufactured abutments with an emerging profile and platform switching. Postoperative aesthetics were analysed based on clinical photographs and satisfactionquestionnaires. The objectively attained White Esthetic Score and Pink Esthetic Score with an average value of 8. 4 and 11. 8 respectively, scored high, as was also observed for patient’s satisfaction on both treatment and outcome (an average of 8. 7). It may be concluded that flapless immediate implant placement together with the application of a bone substitute into the buccal gap in combination with a final <b>crown</b> with emerging <b>profile</b> results in objective and subjective good aesthetics and high patient satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Forest {{management}} requires {{classification of}} forest stands into groupings or types based on structural similarities, even when structure varies continuously along gradients. Managed, mixed-species, multi-aged forest stands often display complex structures containing extreme variation in trees size, density, and species composition, {{and as a}} result have diverse canopy structures. A classification of these stands is quite challenging and has usually been done rather subjectively. The first objective {{of this study was to}} identify and apply an effective methodology to classify stand structures in mixed-species, multi-aged stands. Cluster analysis provided an approach for objective classification of stands based on a set of structural variables available from typical inventory data. A commercial forest ownership in northern California comprised the target population. Stands investigated were primarily mixed-species, multi-cohort stands that had been managed predominantly using single tree selection methods, resulting in a diverse range of vegetation structures. <b>Crown</b> area <b>profile</b> (cross-sectional <b>crown</b> area per relative stand height) (Dubrasich et. al 1997) served as basis for the classification since it embodies the size, density, and crown structure attributes necessary to characterize complex stands. The stand types identified were then fully characterized and differentiated from each other with respect to various attributes allowing realization of the full benefit of the classification developed. The second objective was to fully characterize the stand types identified through cluster analysis. Three categories of attributes were regarded as most important for making silvicultural decisions in the target mixed conifer forests: 1) size distribution and density, 2) canopy structure, and 3) growth dynamics...|$|R
40|$|On 21 May 1986, while {{searching for}} {{evidence}} of breeding birds in atlas block 2 G 04 near Lisco, Garden County, Nebraska, I discovered a Cassin’s Sparrow (Aimophila cassinii). This sighting was at 5 : 20 PM Mountain Daylight Time, along the county road in {{the northeast corner of}} Section 11. I was driving slowly down the road and stopped to observe an odd sparrow. I nearly drove past, thinking it was another Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), which I had heard and seen all day. The sparrow, which appeared larger than a Grasshopper Sparrow, was perched on the low wire of a barbed wire fence along the road. In the few moments before the bird disappeared into the grass I observed that it was plain-breasted, had dark “whiskers” and tail, a grayish back, pinkish-yellow legs, and yellow at the bend of the wing. As it flew away into the grass it sang a short song. After I consulted my field guide I presumed this bird to be a Cassin’s Sparrow, but I wanted a second and better look. “Pishing,” owl imitations, squeaking, etc., failed to return the bird to view. Remembering the short song, I played Peterson’s field tapes in an attempt to match the song. When I played the recording of a Cassin’s Sparrow the bird flew overhead (about 10 feet high) and sang a matching song to the tape’s. I did this several times and the Cassin’s. Sparrow sat on the wire fence between the tape-playings, scolding me with sharp, short, rapid, chipping notes. During these sittings I was able to see all field marks with a 22 x spotting scope at a range of 30 to 40 feet: the lightly streaked <b>crown,</b> flat <b>profile</b> of the head, darkish line through the eye, with light above the eye. Because the bird was singing and behaving defensively to another song of the same species I presume this bird to have been a territorial male, which possibly bred this year...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Quantitative {{analysis}} {{of the quality of}} nuchal translucency (NT) measurements. Methods. First-trimester combined screening for Down syndrome was performed to all pregnant women attended in our Department from October 2003 to November 2009. NT was measured according to the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) criteria by 20 trained obstetricians. The performance of NT measurements was retrospectively analyzed with regard to several quality control standards. Accuracy according to experience, professional <b>profile,</b> <b>crown</b> rump length (CRL) values, and FMF certification was statistically tested. Results. A total of 14978 NT measurements were assessed. (1) The mean operator-specific median NT-MoM values was 0, 98. (2) Mean percentage of cases > 95 th and < 5 th centiles were 5, 0 % and 4, 2 %, respectively. (3) Logarithmic mean and SD of the NT MoM values were 0, 00 and 0, 13, respectively. (4) The DR for trisomy 21 at screening time was 90, 7 % for a FPR of 6, 7 % for standard screening strategy. (5) According to Cumulative SUM (CUSUM) figures, the performance was more acceptable in FMF-certified operators. Conclusion. Overall, quality standards show optimal NT measurements in our unit. Operator experience, a dedicated profile to fetal medicine, CRL over 60 [*]mm, and FMF certification have a significant positive impact on the quality standards...|$|R
40|$|A {{hot rolled}} strip {{produced}} by any integrated steel plant would require satisfying some stringent requirements of its surface <b>profile.</b> <b>Crown</b> and Flatness are two industrially accepted quantifiers {{that relate to the}} geometric tolerances in the rolled strips. This study attempts to regulate both crown and flatness within an acceptable limit, satisfying more than one objective at a time. Mathematically, this leads to a multi-objective optimization problem where the solution is no longer unique and a family of equally feasible solutions leads to the so called Pareto-Front, where each member is simply as good as the others. To implement this concept in the present context, one needs to realize that the surface deformation, which is ultimately imparted to the rolled sheets, comes from more than one source. The wear of the rolls, their thermal expansion, bending, and also deformation, contribute significantly towards the crown and flatness that is ultimately observed. During this study a detailed mathematical model has been worked out for this process incorporating all of these phenomena. Computation for the Pareto-optimality has been carried out using different forms of biologically inspired Genetic Algorithms, often integrated with an Ant Colony Optimization Scheme. Ultimately the model has been fine tuned for the hot rolling practice in a major integrated steel plant and tested against their actual operational data...|$|R

40|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} is already {{impacting}} native vegetation world-wide. Thus accurate mapping of current vegetation condition is necessary for benchmarking and conservation planning. We examine {{the potential for the}} mapping of native vegetation of forested ecosystems in south-western Australia using LiDAR data. Airborne LiDAR (distance between data points 1. 2 m) and RGB imagery was acquired with a discrete 4 -return Leica ALS 50 -II system in April 2011 and vertical canopy profiles determined in Boyagin Nature Reserve. Elevation, slope and geomorphological descriptions of the terrain in combination with vertical canopy profiles based on presence/absence of returns within voxels were derived from the LiDAR data and processed at a spatial resolution of 4. 0 meters. Based on these <b>profiles,</b> <b>crown</b> height and depth, ground cover, mean intensity of crown returns, presence of understory and number of vegetation layers were determined for each grid cell. Unsupervised classification revealed distinctive canopy profiles. Vegetation is strongly linked to geomorphology in this old landscape. Thus Kwongan shrubland occurs on the plateaus, Allocasuarina heugeliana woodland on the fringes of rock outcrops, Eucalyptus astringens and E. accedens woodland on breakaways and E. wandoo and Corymbia calophylla woodland in more fertile valley systems. The vegetation types present within distinctive spatial clusters were determined in two field visits. Vegetation types were mapped with an object-based image analysis approach at geomorphological, vegetation and tree scales using the geomorphology of the terrain and structural, textural and reflective characteristics of the canopy. All vertical profiles identified were present on each geomorphological unit. Tree species with a distinctive vertical profile such as Eucalyptus astringens and Allocasuarina heugeliana were defined and distinguished i...|$|R
