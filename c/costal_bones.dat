40|$|Two of {{the major}} controversies {{in the present study}} of turtle shell {{development}} involve the mechanism by which the carapacial ridge initiates shell formation and the mechanism by which each rib forms the <b>costal</b> <b>bones</b> adjacent to it. This paper claims that both sides of each debate might be correct—but within the species examined. Mechanism is more properly “mechanisms,” and {{there is more than one}} single way to initiate carapace formation and to form the <b>costal</b> <b>bones.</b> In the initiation of the shell, the rib precursors may be kept dorsal by either “axial displacement” (in the hard-shell turtles) or “axial arrest” (in the soft-shell turtle Pelodiscus), or by a combination of these. The former process would deflect the rib into the dorsal dermis and allow it to continue its growth there, while the latter process would truncate rib growth. In both instances, though, the result is to keep the ribs from extending into the ventral body wall. Our recent work has shown that the properties of the carapacial ridge, a key evolutionary innovation of turtles, differ greatly between these two groups. Similarly, the mechanism of costal bone formation may differ between soft-shell and hard-shell turtles, in that the hard-shell species may have both periosteal flattening as well as dermal bone induction, while the soft-shelled turtles may have only the first of these processes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With aim {{to report}} the {{ontogeny}} of the osseous elements of the carapace in Peurodiras, 62 embryos and 43 nestlings of Podocnemis expansa were collected and submitted to the clearing and staining technique of bones and cartilages and study of serial histological slices. The carapace has mixed osseous structure of endo and exoskeleton, formed by 8 pairs of <b>costal</b> <b>bones</b> associated with ribs, 7 neural bones associated with neural arches, 11 pairs of peripheral bones, 1 nuchal, 1 pygal and 1 suprapygal. This structure begins its formation {{in the beginning of}} stage 16 with the ossification of the periosteal collar of the ribs. With exception of the peripheral bones, the other ones begin their ossification during the embrionary period. In histologic investigation {{it was found that the}} <b>costal</b> <b>bones</b> and neural bones have a close relation to the endoskeleton components, originating themselves as intramembranous expansions of the periosteal collar of the ribs and neural arches, respectively. The condensation of the mesenchyme adjacent to the periosteal collar induces the formation of spikes that grow in trabeculae permeated by fibroblasts below the dermis. The nuchal bone also ossifies in an intramembranous way, but does not show direct relation to the endoskeleton. Such information confirms those related to the other Pleurodira, mainly with Podocnemis unifilis, sometimes with conspicuous variations in the chronology of the ossification events. The formation of dermal plates in the carapace of Pleurodira and Criptodira follow the same pattern...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Medulloblastoma is a primitive-neuroectodermal (PNET) tumor, mostly {{localized}} infratentorially {{and mostly}} seen in childhood. It {{can be seen}} rarely in adults. Medulloblastoma metastasis is generally seen at bone marrow and bone, such as pelvis, femur, vertebra and <b>costal</b> <b>bones.</b> Case Presentation: A 32 -year-old male patient admitted to our clinic with complaints of headache, giddiness, and ataxia. Cystic tumoral lesion {{was seen in the}} cerebellum on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The tumor was excised totally by a paramedian suboccipital craniectomy. Pathological examination results were consistent with medulloblastoma. One year after the operation, the patient was admitted to our clinic with back pain, weakness in his legs and urinary incontinence. A sacral tumor was seen on lumbosacral MRI. Conclusion: This is the first report of a sacral medulloblastoma metastasis case successfully treated with a partial sacrectomy and total tumoral excision.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 77 -year-old woman who {{presented}} with skull metastasis as an initial manifestation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). She suffered from headache and dysethesia in the right parietal lesion and was transferred to our hospital. CT of the head demonstrated a bone tumor with destruction of the parietal bone. MRI showed enhanced bone tumor attached with dura mater. CT of the abdomen and chest revealed a right renal tumor and sixth <b>costal</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis. The skull tumor was suspected to be metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. Surgical resection for parietal bone tumor was performed and pathologic examination revealed clear cell carcinoma. After surgical resection for the skull tumor, nephrectomy was performed. After nephrectomy, local radiation therapy (40 Gy) to the sixth <b>costal</b> <b>bone</b> was given. At the 6 -month follow-up, she was found to be in a stable state with no progression of skull metastasis. RCC should be part of differential diagnoses of skull tumors...|$|R
40|$|Augmentation mammoplasty is {{the most}} common {{aesthetic}} surgical procedure performed in the USA. Prosthetic failure is a major reason for surgical reintervention. A number of causes for this have been documented, but <b>costal</b> <b>bone</b> abnormalities leading to perforation of the prosthesis are very unusual. We present the case of a woman who experienced spontaneous deflation of both saline implants in close succession, andwhowas found to have sharp bony spicules on both sides of her chest. Pathology examination reported reactive changes, suggestive of heterotopic bone. Examination of the implants showed no defects besides small punctures on the backwall, which coincidedwith the position of the spicules of bone. There are a number of possible causes for these bony growths which we examine in turn. The chest wall should be examined in all cases where unexplained implant deflation has occurred...|$|R
40|$|A new, thin-shelled fossil {{from the}} Upper Triassic (Revueltian: Norian) Chinle Group of New Mexico, Chinlechelys tenertesta, {{is one of}} the most {{primitive}} known unambiguous members of the turtle stem lineage. The thin-shelled nature of the new turtle combined with its likely terrestrial habitat preference hint at taphonomic filters that basal turtles had to overcome before entering the fossil record. Chinlechelys tenertesta possesses neck spines formed by multiple osteoderms, indicating that the earliest known turtles were covered with rows of dermal armour. More importantly, the primitive, vertically oriented dorsal ribs of the new turtle are only poorly associated with the overlying <b>costal</b> <b>bones,</b> indicating that these two structures are independent ossifications in basal turtles. These novel observations lend support to the hypothesis that the turtle shell was originally a complex composite in which dermal armour fused with the endoskeletal ribs and vertebrae of an ancestral lineage instead of forming de novo. The critical shell elements (i. e. costals and neurals) are thus not simple outgrowths of the bone of the endoskeletal elements as has been hypothesized from some embryological observations...|$|E
40|$|Ewing sarcoma is a bone tumour that {{commonly}} appears {{between ages}} five and 10 in the diaphysis {{of the long}} bones and predominantly presents with pain and swelling. The case of an 18 -year-old girl who presented with back pain, cough, dyspnea, weakness and fever is described. Chest radiograph showed a homogenous density {{in the middle and}} inferior zones of the right hemithorax. Thoracic computed tomography revealed a diffuse pleural effusion and a 6. 99 cmx 4. 45 cm solid mass composed of lobulated, small cystic lesions and calcifications in the right hemithorax. Biochemical analysis of pleural fluid showed hemorrhagic effusion and exudate. A pleural needle biopsy demonstrated solid uniform tumour cells with narrowed cytoplasm, round nuclei and uncertain nucleoli. All of the tumour cell cytoplasms stained with CD 99. The pathological examination supported Ewing sarcoma. Three-phase Tc- 99 m methylene diphosphonate scintigraphy of the whole body showed pathological tracer uptake in a broad area of the eighth costal bone and in smaller areas of the ninth and 10 th <b>costal</b> <b>bones.</b> This case is reported because Ewing sarcoma is a rare cause of pleural effusion in clinical practice among younger adults...|$|E
40|$|Reinvestigation of a fragmentary lindholmemydid turtle from a Mongolian {{locality}} Sheeregeen Gashoon (late Turonian-Santonian) suggested reassignment to Lindholmemys martinsoni Ckhikvadze, 1975. This {{restricts the}} stratigraphic {{range of the}} genus Mongolemys, to which the specimen was originally assigned. Additionally, new morphological data on L. martinsoni have been gathered and are presented in this paper. The Lindholmemydidae are considered here as a paraphyletic group uniting primitive tcstudinoids (all of which are known from Cretaceous to Paleocene of Asia). Their shell morphology is characterized by well developed plastral but-tresses, which contact <b>costal</b> <b>bones</b> (synapomorphy of testudinoids, see Gaffney & JVleylan 1988) and by complete (uninterrupted) row of inframarginal scutes (primitive character). Lindholmemys martinsoni {{is based on the}} incomplete shell and shell fragments from the Sheeregeen Gashoon locality in Trans-Altai Gobi, Mongolia which can be correlated with {{the upper part of the}} Bayn Shire Formation (late Turonian-Santonian) of Eastern Gobi Desert (Shuvalov & Ckhikvadze 1975). A more complete specimen of this species is known from the Usheen Khuduk locality in East-ern Gobi (Shuvalov & Ckhikvadze 1979). However, some important characters of L. martinsoni (pygal morphology, the shape and number of the suprapygals) have remained unknown...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{complete}} resection {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial requirements to achieve favorable outcomes in oncologic surgery. The apex of the lung is surrounded complicatedly by the clavicle, the first rib, the subclavian artery and vein, and the brachial plexus. Therefore, the image information especially about the infiltration of adjacent anatomic structures, facilitates the surgery in the apical lung cancer. Case presentation A 70 -year-old man presented at our hospital with a computed tomography (CT) scan showing a tumor at the left lung apex that infiltrated the chest wall. Two anatomical anomalies were found, which were the first rib hypoplasia and the aberrant pulmonary artery branch. The three-dimensional (3 D) CT enhanced with using bolus tracking method, simultaneously revealed that the subclavian vessels existed between the clavicle and the second rib, and the left lingual pulmonary artery and the ventrobasal pulmonary artery diverged from the left main pulmonary artery as the first branch. We diagnosed the tumor as a primary lung squamous cell carcinoma that infiltrated the second rib, because sputum cytology suggested squamous cell carcinoma. Left lung upper lobectomy with lymph node dissection and chest wall resection (the second and third ribs) were performed with caution for the anatomical anomalies. The pathological diagnosis was pleomorphic carcinoma (5. 02 ̆ 00972 ̆ 0093. 02 ̆ 00972 ̆ 0091. 90 cm) that invaded the second <b>costal</b> <b>bone,</b> and the pathological stage was confirmed to be pT 3 N 0 M 0. Pathologically curative resection was accomplished. The patient was discharged from the hospital on 100 days after surgery. Conclusion The 3 D-CT precisely detected the anomalous structure consisted with the clavicle, the second rib, the subclavian artery and vein, the aberrant pulmonary artery branch. In the present case with the apical lung cancer, the evaluation of the anatomical structure via 3 D-CT facilitated to achieve a pathological complete resection...|$|R

30|$|A 6 -year-old, 14  kg, 91  cm {{girl with}} trisomy 21 was {{scheduled}} for elective pacemaker implantation with lead attachment to the epicardium under thoracotomy. She was born with trisomy 21, and presented with coarctation of aorta and atrioventricular septal defect, which have being surgically repaired {{at the age of}} 9  days and 9  months, respectively. SSS as well as bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome was diagnosed by manifestation of bradycardia and tachycardia after the surgical repair of mitral insufficiency at the age of 3  years. Her pulse control was unfavorable despite the administration of isoprenaline hydrochloride, leading to a decision of pacemaker implantation. Diazepam (9  mg) was given as a premedication. Anesthesia was induced uneventfully with sevoflurane (5  %) in 66  % nitrous oxide and 33  % oxygen although we prepared atropine and transcutaneous pacing in case of hemodynamic deterioration. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with propofol (10 to 12  mg/kg/h) and remifentanil (0.1 to 0.2  μg/kg/min). With anesthesia induction, the heart rate decreased from approximately 140 /min (atrial tachycardia) to 120 /min, changing from atrial tachycardia to atrial flutter, but the blood pressure was maintained. The ultrasound-guided TPVB was performed through the 5 th intercostal space, with the patient placed in the right lateral position. A probe was placed in parallel to the <b>costal</b> <b>bone,</b> and an 18 G Tuohy needle was inserted from the lateral side using the in-plane approach. When the needle tip reached the paravertebral space, 5  mL of saline was infused to confirm the ventral transposition of the pleura and widening of the paravertebral space. Subsequently, a catheter was inserted into the paravertebral space (length of insertion: 3  cm). At this point, a mixture of 3  mL of saline and 0.5  mL of air was injected through the catheter, but no hyperechoic flash could be confirmed in the paravertebral space. Immediately before the start of surgery, 7  mL of 0.375  % ropivacaine (1.85  mg/kg) was administered in divided doses over 1  min. At this point, the catheter was aspirated, but there was no blood regurgitation. Approximately two minutes after the start of ropivacaine administration, the electrocardiographic waveform showed asystole. Immediately, chest compression was started, and adrenaline (0.1  mg) was intravenously administered, and a pulse was established after approximately 2  min. Under a tentative diagnosis of intoxication with the local anesthetic, blood was collected through an arterial line to measure its plasma concentration (6  min after ropivacaine administration), and 20  mL of 20  % lipid emulsion was administered (7  min after ropivacaine administration). As the effect of single-dose administration of adrenaline gradually decreased over time reducing the blood pressure (38 / 20  mmHg) and heart rate (54 beats per minute), the continuous administration of catecholamine was considered necessary. After a catheter for transesophageal pacing was inserted into the esophagus, central venous catheterization was performed. The continuous administration of adrenaline (0.03  μg/kg/min), dobutamine (5  μg/kg/min), and dopamine (5  μg/kg/min) was started. After the hemodynamic parameters became stable, we decided to proceed to the surgery because we believed that pacemaker implantation would also treat the bradycardia caused by ropivacaine. The surgery was done uneventfully. When the catheter was examined after surgery, blood into the catheter (about 12  cm) was observed. Since the blood had coagulated, the catheter was removed.|$|R
40|$|Use of a {{composite}} auricular graft in nasal alar reconstruction Enxerto composto auricular na reconstrução da asa nasal Since the nose {{is located in}} the center of the face, small asymmetries and imperfections are easily recognized. One subunit of the nose is the nasal ala, a region that, when reconstructed, requires the achievement of esthetic and functional results. This poses a challenge to the plastic surgeon. In this article, we describe 3 cases of composite auricular grafts used for nasal alar reconstruction. The grafts presented total integration and provided satisfactory esthetic and functional results. A literature review revealed no differences in the complica-tion rates between grafts and local flaps. Moreover, the shape of the auricular cartilage was maintained over time, showing rare distortions and no or minimal absorption, contrary to <b>costal</b> cartilage and <b>bone</b> grafts. The use of composite auricular grafts is versatile and safe. This procedure ensures excellent results in nasal alar reconstruction and guarantees low morbidity within the donor areas. Therefore, the use of this technique efficiently enables the repair of nasal defects...|$|R
