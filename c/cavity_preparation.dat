40|$|Objectives : The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the microleakage in the 5 th and 6 th generation bonding agents with that compared with the newly introduced 7 th generation bonding agents using three bonding agents. Materials and Methods : A total of 50 recently extracted human upper premolars were subjected to the study. Class V <b>cavity</b> <b>preparations</b> were prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces of the extracted premolars with occlusal margins in the enamel and gingival margins in the cementum/dentin. The teeth were divided into five groups of 10 teeth each and 20 <b>cavity</b> <b>preparations</b> per group. In the experimental groups, cavities were treated with Single-Bond, Adper Prompt, i-Bond, Clearfil S 3, and G-Bond as the dentin bonding agents. After the application of the dentin bonding agents, the <b>cavity</b> <b>preparations</b> were restored with resin composite (Clearfil APX). The specimens were thermocycled, stained with methylene blue dye, and sectioned to evaluate the dye penetration.

50|$|Most modern {{composite}} resins are light-cured photopolymers, {{meaning that}} they harden with light exposure. They can then be polished to achieve maximum aesthetic results. Composite resins experience a very small amount of shrinkage upon curing, causing the material {{to pull away from}} the walls of the <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation.</b> This makes the tooth slightly more vulnerable to microleakage and recurrent decay. Microleakage can be minimized or eliminated by utilizing proper handling techniques and appropriate material selection.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} laser types used in {{medicine}} for ablation, including argon, carbon dioxide (CO2), dye, erbium, excimer, Nd:YAG, and others. Laser ablation {{is used in}} a variety of medical specialties including ophthalmology, general surgery, neurosurgery, ENT, dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and veterinary. Laser scalpels are used for ablation in both hard- and soft-tissue surgeries. Some of the most common procedures where laser ablation is used include LASIK, skin resurfacing, <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation,</b> biopsies, and tumor and lesion removal. In soft-tissue surgeries, the CO2 laser beam ablates and cauterizes simultaneously, making it the most practical and most common soft-tissue laser.|$|E

50|$|Pulp capping is a {{technique}} used in dental restorations to prevent the dental pulp from necrosis, after being exposed, or nearly exposed during a <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation.</b> When dental caries is removed from a tooth, {{all or most of}} the infected and softened enamel and dentin are removed. This can lead to the pulp of the tooth either being exposed or nearly exposed which causes pulpitis (inflammation). Pulpitis, in turn, can become irreversible, leading to pain and pulp necrosis, and necessitating either root canal treatment or extraction. The ultimate goal of pulp capping or stepwise caries removal is to protect a healthy dental pulp and avoid the need for root canal therapy.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{much care}} and {{attention}} to detail must be exercised in the experimental setup of SRF cavities {{so that there is}} not Qo degradation due to RF losses in ancillary components, such as stainless steel vacuum flanges that are too close to the cavity's evanescent fields. However, careful SRF <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> and experimental configuration have achieved the ideal Qo not only for low field amplitudes, but up to cavity fields that are typically 75% of the magnetic field quench limit. Few cavities make it to the magnetic field quench limit since residual losses and vanishingly small defects heat up localized spots, which eventually exceed the superconducting critical temperature and lead to a thermal quench.|$|E
50|$|Secondary dentin {{is formed}} after root {{formation}} is complete, normally after the tooth has erupted and is functional. It grows {{much more slowly}} than primary dentin, but maintains its incremental aspect of growth. It has a similar structure to primary dentin, although its deposition is not always even around the pulp chamber. It is the growth of this dentin that causes the decrease {{in the size of}} the pulp chamber with age. This is clinically known as pulp recession; <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> in young patients therefore carries a greater risk of exposing the pulp. If this occurs, the pulp can be treated by different therapies such as direct pulp capping. Pulp capping is most successful if followed by a stainless steel crown. In order to maintain space in the primary dentition, attempts are made not to extract a pulpal exposure.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} influence of different sterilization methods on cutting effectiveness and durability of cylindrical ultrasonic burs compared with conventional cylindrical diamond-coated burs. Material and Methods: Fifteen conventional cylindrical diamond-coated (1092) (KG Sorensen) coupled to a high-speed turbine, and fifteen cylindrical ultrasonic (8. 2137) (CVDentus®) burs coupled to an ultrasound-handpiece were used to perform standardized <b>cavity</b> <b>preparations</b> in healthy bovine tooth fragments, cleaned with rubber cup, pumice stone and water. After every 10 preparations, burs were sterilized 9 times in autoclave (SA), oven (SO), or cleaned with brush, soap and water (C). Fragments were weighed and microphotographs of burs were taken {{at the beginning and}} end of experiment. Another 9 conventional diamond-coated and 9 CVD burs underwent the same sterilization cycles in autoclave (SAC), oven (SOC) or washed with soap and water (CC) however, without being used for making <b>cavity</b> <b>preparations,</b> serving as control. Descriptive analyses were made of the values found by weighing and microphotography scores. Results: Statistically significant differences (Paired Student’s-t test) were observed among burs after sterilization (p = 0. 0001). SO and SA did not influence cutting effectiveness and durability of ultrasonic and conventional diamond-coated burs. The microphotographs showed morphological differences between the burs used for preparation and the control. Conclusion: Sterilization by oven and autoclave did not influence cutting effectiveness and durability of CVD and conventional diamond-coated burs. Conventional diamond-coated burs presented greater structural alterations after performing <b>cavity</b> <b>preparations</b> and cleaning/sterilization procedures, irrespective of the process used.

Background Data: The Er:YAG laser has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective alternative to the conventional turbine bur, but the relatively low cutting speed prevented the wide application of Er:YAG laser in clinical <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation.</b> Methods: A Smart 2940 D laser developed by Deka Corporation was used for <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> in 95 teeth of 45 patients. Parameters were as follows: wavelength 2. 94 μm, pulse energy 700 mJ, repetition rate 8 Hz. Pain, discomfort, assessment during <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation,</b> prognosis factor, and overall clinical evaluation were assessed during or after treatment. Results: No adverse reaction was observed in any tooth. No intraoperative pain or only slight intraoperative pain was described in 85 teeth (89. 5 %). <b>Cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> was completed with the laser system alone in 90 teeth (94. 7 %).

40|$|Today laser {{has a lot}} of usage in {{medicine}} and dentistry. In the field of dentistry, laser is used in soft tissue surgery, sterilization of canals (in root canal therapy) and in restorative dentistry laser is used for <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation,</b> caries removal, sealing the grooves (in preventive dentistry), etching enamel and dentin, composite polymerization and removal of tooth sensitivity. The use of Co 2 lasers and Nd: YAG for <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation,</b> due to creating high heat causes darkness and cracks around the region of laser radiation. Also due to high temperature of these lasers, pulp damage is inevitable.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to compare the histopathologic effects of kinetic <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> to the histopathologic effects of conventional high-speed handpiece preparation on the human dental pulp. The objective was to test the following hypothesis: kinetic <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> results in significantly fewer pulpal effects than does conventional preparation using the high-speed handpiece. Class V cavity preparations were made in 26 teeth of seven patients who required extraction of these teeth for orthodontic purposes. Thirteen teeth were prepared using kinetic <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation,</b> using 27 -um aluminum oxide particles at 160 pounds per square inch pressure. Thirteen were prepared using the high-speed handpiece and 330 bur. Glass ionomer restorations were placed in all teeth. Extractions were done 10 to 15 days after preparation. On teeth with closed apices, the apical one-third of the root was removed. All teeth were placed in 10 percent formalin solution. Teeth were sectioned and selected slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic evaluation. Microscopic findings indicated that the amount of remaining dentin was of significant thickness to be protective to the pulp. Pulpal responses ranged from no response in 22 specimens to a mild response in 4 specimens. Based on the results of this study, it was concluded that shallow preparation into the dentin does not cause pulpal damage at 10 to 15 days post-preparation, when using either kinetic <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> or high-speed handpiece preparation. The hypothesis that kinetic <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> causes significantly fewer pulpal effects than does conventional preparation with the high-speed handpiece was rejected...|$|E
40|$|Rat incisors were {{evaluated}} radioautograph-ically for metabolic changes induced by high-speed <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation.</b> Label uptake was redutced substantially in those odontoblasts whose processes had been cut; labeling also was diminished {{in all other}} areas of the pulp, especially in that area immediately ad-jacent to the <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation.</b> High-speed <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> techniques were first introduced by Huet ' in 1919, {{but it was not until}} 30 years later, when Walsh and Symmons 2 developed a microturbine capable of rotations up to 60, 000 rpm that there was a serious move toward implemen-tation of high-speed techniques in clinical dentistry. It was recognized that pulpal changes resulting from the high-speed <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> techniques probably would be different from those observed after the use of slower speeds. In the two decades subse-quent to the introduction of the high-speed techniques, a number of researchers 3 - 13 in-vestigated the trauma caused by high-speed rotary <b>cavity</b> <b>preparation</b> and concluded that intrapulpal heat generation probably was the causative factor for most changes. It was conceded, however, that cavity depth (or, more precisely, the thickness of remain-ing dentin) and pressure applied during the operative procedure might also be contrib-uting factors. Several authors 7 ' 10, 13 indicated that a water coolant, applied to the inter-face between the bur and tooth structure being cut, is essential for prevention of in-trapulpal burn lesions.
