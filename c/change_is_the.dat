5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, {{and the introduction of}} exotic species. An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> pallid sturgeon, a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Climate <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{variation}} in global or regional climates over time. It reflects {{changes in the}} variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes {{can be caused by}} processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can either}} choose {{to play a}} ranked Deathmatch or DarkOps, {{where they will be}} matched with other players using a system called TrueSkill Matchmaking, or they may choose a player match where they can choose their game from a list of player hosted games. Like the {{original}} Perfect Dark, these games can be highly customized and can also include computer game bots. Features such as their difficulty and behavior can be changed to match player preference. For example, the Judge bot always attacks leading players with the highest kills score. Players can also issue commands to them {{as long as they are}} on their respective team, such as follow or hold position, and set waypoints for them to walk to. The game includes by default six different maps and each has two variants; the only <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> placement of the bases. Most of the maps are large ones, ideal for 32 players at once, with small variants for 4-16 player games.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but, once they are, will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The Sharia courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E

The Warm/Wet outcome represents a model whose average temperature <b>change</b> <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> lower end and whose average rainfall <b>change</b> <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> wetter end of the spectrum. <b>The</b> Median outcome <b>is</b> for a model whose temperature and rainfall <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> closest to <b>the</b> median of all models.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{formation of}} a plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died {{come up to the}} surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the {{formation of a}} whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E
5|$|The game is set during World War II and the {{campaign}} mode is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers: one in the Red Army, one in the United States Army, and two in the British Army. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories, {{with a total of}} twenty-seven missions. Activision officially announced the game on April 7, 2005 in a press release. Many features were added and changed from the original Call of Duty. The most notable <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> regenerating health. Additions include an icon that indicates a nearby grenade about to explode.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tadpole phase, {{hind legs}} appear, {{followed}} by front limbs, and the phase ends when the front limbs are developed. This normally occurs between October and April due to the breeding season, but tadpoles been observed in the wild throughout the year, suggesting some tadpoles overwinter; this has been seen to occur for captive tadpoles. The length of the tadpole stage, in the wild and in captivity, is usually between 10 and 12 weeks, but can range from five weeks to a year. The slower-growing tadpoles usually progress during winter, as there is a positive correlation between growth rates and temperatures. Variation in growth rate across pH values of 4, 7 and 9 was insignificant. In the first four weeks, there was no significant dependence of the growth rate across the 18–26°C range, but from this point on, growth was significantly hindered at 18°C. At the beginning of the metamorphing stage, all limbs are present and developed, along with a tail. During this phase, the tail is resorbed, and the only other visible <b>change</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> spiracle closing. Metamorphing tadpoles typically have a SVL of 22–28mm, and will complete metamorphosis between two and 11 months, depending on the temperature of the water and available food. The process is slowed at low temperatures, but generally takes between three and eight days after the tadpole stage is complete. Breeding occurs in a significantly higher proportion of sites where no predatory fish are present, and water bodies are ephemeral rather than permanent. Populations in Victoria, however, have been recorded as breeding in permanent ponds as readily as they do in ephemeral ponds.|$|E

25|$|Before Darwin, {{adaptation}} {{was seen}} as a fixed relationship between an organism and its habitat. It was not appreciated that as the climate changed, so did the habitat; and as the habitat changed, so did the biota. Also, habitats are subject to changes in their biota: for example, invasions of species from other areas. The relative numbers of species in a given habitat are always changing. <b>Change</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rule, though much depends on the speed and degree of the change.|$|E
