40|$|In a {{variable}} <b>core</b> <b>flow</b> <b>engine,</b> the corrected mass flow {{can be adjusted}} according to the flight conditions. The thermal efficiency can then be improved by decoupling the unfavorable relation between pressure ratio and corrected mass flow that exists in conventional turbofan engines.

40|$|Nearly all {{supersonic}} V/STOL aircraft {{concepts are}} dependent on the thrust deflecting capability of a nozzle. In one unique concept, {{referred to as the}} reverse flow dual fan, not only is there a thrust deflecting nozzle for the fan and <b>core</b> <b>engine</b> exit <b>flow,</b> but {{because of the way the}} propulsion system operates during vertical takeoff and landing, the supersonic inlet is also used as a thrust deflecting nozzle. This paper presents results of an experimental study to evaluate the performance of a supersonic inlet used as a thrust deflecting nozzle for this reverse flow dual fan concept. Results are presented in terms of nozzle thrust coefficient and thrust vector angle for a number of inlet/nozzle configurations.
