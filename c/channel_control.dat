40|$|Abstract—A {{constantly}} available <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> facilitates <b>control</b> message {{exchange and}} spectrum coordination in cognitive radio (CR) ad hoc networks. When a dedicated <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is unavailable, a <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> must be dynamically allocated in licensed channels and vacated {{for the presence}} of primary users (PUs). As a result, the establishment of such a <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is a challenge. In this paper, an efficient recovery <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (ERCC) design is proposed to address this challenge. This heuristic and distributed design approach is essentially based on the observed spectrum homogeneity in a neighborhood. By adaptively updating a list of channels commonly available to neighbors, each secondary user is able to efficiently establish new <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> among neighbors in response to PU activity changes. Therefore, a virtually “always on ” <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> robust to PU activity can be realized by the proposed method. The contributions are summarized as follows: 1) The proposed method efficiently recovers <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> from PU activity changes and maintains network connectivity. 2) It extends the <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> coverage to facilitate broadcast and reduce control overhead and delay. 3) It minimizes the interference with PUs. Simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms the classic group- and sequence-based solutions in the responsiveness to rapidly changing PU activity and the maintenance of connectivity. Furthermore, the increase in <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> coverage and the allocation of the highest quality <b>channels</b> to <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> can be well balanced with reliability and scalability in various network scenarios.

30|$|Efficiency of <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> {{depends upon}} the time {{required}} for CR nodes to discover a common <b>control</b> <b>channel.</b> Subsequent communication amongst CR nodes could not occur until CR nodes are aware of a channel that is available for all CR nodes.

30|$|When {{setting up}} a CRAHN, a <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is {{essential}} in the carrying out of functions such as spectrum sensing, sharing, decision, and mobility as all these require extensive control information exchange [1]. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature pertaining {{to the design of}} <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> for CRAHNs. Most of the proposed techniques can be divided into two categories: (1) dedicated common <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> and (2) group/cluster-based <b>control</b> <b>channels.</b> Using a dedicated common <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> simplifies the process of coordination among SUs. However, reliance on a dedicated common <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> results in several limitations. Firstly, there is a single point of failure; for example, a dedicated common <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> can result in loss of connectivity among SUs in cases of saturation or jamming. Secondly, in the case of CRAHNs, the dynamically changing availability of the spectrum in the temporal and spatial domain makes it difficult to maintain a dedicated common <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> that is globally available.|$|R
30|$|The {{protocols}} (Song and Lin 2009 a, b; Zhang and Su 2011; Chao et al. 2011) in {{this category}} do not delve into a <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> setup mechanism and simply assume that a <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> has already been established prior to any data transmission. The cognitive radio-enabled multi-channel MAC (CREAM-MAC) (Zhang and Su 2011) is a decentralized CR MAC protocol that applies a four-way handshake with communicating nodes on the <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> {{under the assumption that}} the <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is always available and reliable. CREAM-MAC assumes that a CCC has been found and agreed upon by all CR nodes in the neighbourhood before the CREAM-MAC starts its operation. Further to the assumed existence of a <b>control</b> <b>channel,</b> CREAM-MAC also assumes that the <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is always reliable and PU-interference free. It is strongly believed that finding a common <b>channel</b> to exchange <b>control</b> information is the prime task of cognitive nodes and subsequent operations could not succeed unless the existence of a <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> has not been addressed. Hence, the assumption of an available <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is unrealistic. Moreover, emphasis has been given to only data transmission while the overheads of determining and agreeing upon the <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> are completely ignored.|$|R
