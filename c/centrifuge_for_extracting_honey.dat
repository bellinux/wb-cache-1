50|$|Major Francesco De Hruschka was an Italian {{military}} officer who made one crucial invention that catalyzed the commercial honey industry. In 1865 he invented a simple machine <b>for</b> <b>extracting</b> <b>honey</b> from the comb {{by means of}} centrifugal force. His original idea was simply to support combs in a metal framework and then spin them around within a container to collect honey as it was thrown out by centrifugal force. This meant that honeycombs could be returned to a hive undamaged but empty, saving the bees {{a vast amount of}} work, time, and materials. This single invention greatly improved the efficiency of honey harvesting and catalysed the modern honey industry.|$|R
50|$|Once a good {{location}} for an apiary is selected, techniques {{under the control}} of a beekeeper <b>for</b> maximizing <b>extracted</b> <b>honey</b> production depend mostly on maximizing the number of foraging bees at the peak time of the honey flow. Techniques may include interrupting brood production right before the main honey flow to free up nurse bees for foraging. A main objective is to prevent swarming.|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the honey extractor almost all honey produced was in the form of comb honey. Today, most honey is produced for extraction but comb honey remains popular among consumers both for eating 'as is' and <b>for</b> combining with <b>extracted</b> <b>honey</b> to make chunk honey. Hobbyists and sideliners can develop their beekeeping skills by producing comb honey, which takes more rigorous attention to beekeeping than the production of <b>extracted</b> <b>honey.</b> Because of the more demanding labor involved, comb honey has greater retail value than <b>extracted</b> <b>honey.</b> ($17/pound compared to $6.50/pound US). [...] Comb honey production is more suitable for areas with an intense prolonged honeyflow from eucalyptus, alfalfa, alsike, and yellow clover. Wooded areas are not as suitable for comb honey production, as bees tend to collect more propolis, making the harvesting of comb honey more difficult. This problem has been largely circumvented with the adoption of specialized frames, such as the Ross Round frame, which prevent accumulation of propolis on saleable units.|$|R

25|$|Orangutans (genus Pongo) {{were first}} {{observed}} using {{tools in the}} wild in 1994 in {{the northwest corner of}} Sumatra. As with the chimpanzees, orangutans use tools made from branches and leaves to scratch, scrape, wipe, sponge, swat, fan, hook, probe, scoop, pry, chisel, hammer, cover, cushion and amplify. They will break off a tree branch that is about 30cm long, snap off the twigs, fray one end and then use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites. Sumatran orangutans use a variety of tools—up to 54 types <b>for</b> <b>extracting</b> insects or <b>honey,</b> and as many as 20 types for opening or preparing fruits such as the hard to access Neesia Malayana. They also use an 'autoerotic tool'—a stick which they use to stimulate the genitals and masturbate (both male and female). In parts of Borneo, orangutans use handfuls of leaves as napkins to wipe their chins while orangutans in parts of Sumatra use leaves as gloves, helping them handle spiny fruits and branches, or as seat cushions in spiny trees. There have been reports that individuals in both captivity and in the wild use tools held between the lips or teeth, rather than in the hands. In captivity, orangutans have been taught to chip stone handaxes.|$|R

For hives of the dangerous African honeybees, chimps use longer and thinner sticks to <b>extract</b> the <b>honey.</b> Chimps also fish for ants using the same tactic.|$|R

The Agar diffusion method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of the plant <b>extracts,</b> <b>honey</b> and combination of both against Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli and Candida albican. The growth of all test organisms were inhibited though to varying degrees by the plant <b>extract</b> and <b>honey</b> and with greater effect when combined thus justifying their use in traditional medicines in treating enteric infection and other diseases across Africa...|$|R
5000|$|Radial baskets {{have the}} top {{bar of the}} frame facing {{outwards}} while tangential baskets have {{one side of the}} comb facing outward. Large commercial extractors are radial and rely on the upward slope of the comb cells. This slope allows to <b>extract</b> <b>honey</b> by applying centrifugal force toward the upper edge of the comb (opposite to the direction of gravity while in the hive). The amount of work during extraction is reduced in the radial type because the frames {{do not have to be}} turned over to <b>extract</b> the <b>honey</b> from the other side of the comb (however some extractors are capable of turning combs automatically). Hobbyist extractors can be hand or electric motor powered. If the extractor is hand powered, it often has accelerating gear to spin with less effort.|$|R
