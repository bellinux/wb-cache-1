25|$|Due to the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997 to 1998, {{and the long}} and difficult negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, ASEAN+3 agreed {{to set up a}} mainly bilateral <b>currency</b> <b>swap</b> scheme known as the 2000 Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) in anticipation of another {{financial crisis}} in the future. In 2006 they agreed to meld the CMI with multilateralisation and call it CMIM. On 3 May 2009, they agreed to make a currency pool consisting of contributions: US$38.4billion each by China and Japan, US$19.2billion by South Korea, and US$24billion from all ASEAN members, totalling US$120billion. A key component has also been added recently, with the establishment of a surveillance unit.|$|E
25|$|The Term Securities Lending Facility is a 28-day {{facility}} that will offer Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's primary dealers {{in exchange for}} other program-eligible collateral. It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. Like the Term Auction Facility, the TSLF was done {{in conjunction with the}} Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The resource allows dealers to switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable. The <b>currency</b> <b>swap</b> lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were increased.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>currency</b> <b>swaps</b> as a hedging mechanism for the exchange rate risk associated with foreign investment in real estate. Earlier studies have concentrated on short-term hedging instruments such as options and forward contracts. <b>Currency</b> <b>swaps</b> are better suited for use on investments with long-term holding periods such as real estate. The findings indicate that, although hedging United States real estate investments with <b>currency</b> <b>swaps</b> suppresses most of the risk induced by currency instability, the improvements are insufficient to produce diversification gains for foreign investors {{in the context of}} mean-variance portfolio performance.

500|$|A team of Icelandic negotiators {{arrived in}} Moscow on 14 October {{to discuss the}} {{possible}} loan. Russian deputy finance minister Dmitri Pankin said that [...] "The meeting {{took place in a}} friendly atmosphere.... We are working thoroughly on the issue to take a final decision". On the same day, the Central Bank of Iceland drew on its swap facilities with the central banks of Denmark and Norway for €200 million each. Iceland has swap facilities with the other Nordic countries for a total of €1.5 billion. Iceland is also seeking assistance from the European Central Bank (ECB): there is some precedent for the move, as the ECB already has <b>currency</b> <b>swap</b> arrangements with Switzerland, another non-member of the European Union.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Prime {{minister}} Yousaf Raza Gillani and Russian Prime minister (now President) Vladimir Putin held a frank {{discussion in}} a cordial atmosphere on 10th Heads of Government meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Gilani successfully convinced Russia finance and invest in the large energy projects including Central Asia-South Asia 1000 (CASA-1000) to allow the international transition of the power generation from Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Pakistan. Russia has provided US$500million for the CASA-1000 for the power transmission project. In 2011, both countries initiated {{the work on the}} framework n the proposed Free Trade Agreement and <b>currency</b> <b>swap</b> arrangement to boost bilateral trade and further strengthen their economic ties. On 4 March 2012, only few hours being re-elected, Gilani telephoned Putin and greeted him on his success in the election for the President of Russia, and quoted: [...] "it was a testimony to the confidence the people of Russia had reposed in his leadership".|$|E
2500|$|While in {{the offing}} of an ASEAN common currency, {{the leaders of the}} member-states of ASEAN agreed in November 1999 to create the {{establishment}} of currency swaps, and repurchase agreements, as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, the finance minister of the ASEAN agreed through the [...] "Chiang Mai Initiative" [...] to plan for closer monetary and financial co-operation. The [...] "Chiang Mai Initiative" [...] or CMI, named after the City of Chiang Mai in Thailand, has two components: an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement, and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among ASEAN countries, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The ASEAN Swap Arrangement or ASA preceded the regional financial crisis. ASA was originally established by the ASEAN central bank and monetary authorities of the five founding members of ASEAN with a view to help countries meet temporary liquidity problems. An expanded ASA now includes all ten ASEAN countries with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has a combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and repurchase agreements among ASEAN countries, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for members which may be in balance-of-payments difficulties. In 200, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) have been successfully concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion. The original CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 which took effect on 20 March 2014, while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. CMIM is a multilateral <b>currency</b> <b>swap</b> arrangement with a total size of US$240 billion, governed by a single contractual agreement, while the CMI is a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the [...] "Plus Three" [...] and ASEAN countries' authorities. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse regional economies, and to support the CMIM decision-making process. The amendments will effectively allow access of the ASEAN+3 member countries and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the level of access not linked to an International Monetary Fund program from 20%–30%, [...] and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's financial safety net in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.|$|E
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of such agreements is asymmetrical liability - absent a specific agreement, when one party defaults on the loan, {{the other party}} may still {{be held responsible for}} repayment. Another disadvantage in comparison with <b>currency</b> <b>swaps</b> is that back-to-back loan transactions are customarily recorded on banking institutions' records as liabilities and thereby increase their capitalization requirements, while <b>currency</b> <b>swaps</b> were, during the 2000s, widely exempted from this requirement.|$|R
