2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of glass research it was most important to know {{the relation between the}} glass composition and its properties. For this purpose Otto Schott introduced the additivity principle in several publications for calculation of glass properties. This principle implies that the relation between the glass composition and a specific property is linear to all glass component concentrations, assuming an ideal mixture, with Ci and bi representing specific glass component concentrations and related coefficients respectively in the equation below. The additivity principle is a simplification and only valid within narrow composition ranges as seen in the displayed diagrams for the refractive index and the viscosity. Nevertheless, the application of the additivity principle lead the way to many of Schott’s inventions, including optical glasses, glasses with low thermal expansion for cooking and laboratory ware (Duran), and glasses with reduced freezing point depression for mercury thermometers. Subsequently, English and Gehlhoff et al. published similar additive glass property <b>calculation</b> <b>models.</b> Schott’s additivity principle is still widely in use today in glass research and technology.-Al2O3-Na2O-K2O-CaO-MgO in the composition range of technical glasses |journal=Glass Technology |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=88–95 |date=June 1972 }} ...|$|E

Along the planning cycle unfavorable solutions are excluded stepwise but others will are specified more closely.

Use is made of existing theoretical and experimental knowledge to establish a <b>calculation</b> <b>model</b> for the pressure distribution on the front core slope and the attenuation of pore pressures within the breakwater core. The new model formulae are derived empirically and calibrated by means of a non-linear regression analysis of pore pressure measurements in a large-scale conventional breakwater model, under non-overtopping and non-breaking wave conditions. They relate the {{spatial distribution}} of pore pressure height to the sea state in front of the breakwater considering a homogeneous breakwater core, but do not contain any material properties related to the porous flow resistance.

Nowadays most calculations are made in computer programs, such as Novapoint Geosuite Settlement. Geosuite Settlement includes a variety of <b>calculation</b> <b>models,</b> where some of the models include an addition of creep behaviour. The main purpose of this diploma work is to compare the results from different geotechnical settlement <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> in Geosuite Settlement. As a reference object, an undrained test bank on clay in Lilla Mellösa outside of the community Upplands Väsby was selected.

The result of this diploma work shows that the <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> containing creep give result more like the measured settlements, than the <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> that do not include creep. Despite of this, the measured settlement is greater than the settlement in <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> containing creep. The most remarkable in this work are high excess pore pressures when using models containing creep. These excess pore pressure, in the result of this work, also decreases very slowly in time. One conclusion of this diploma work, based on the obtained results of this study, in comparison with other studies, is to use a calculation model containing creep, if the conditions are similar to those at the test site Lilla Mellösa...|$|E

But Polar Sea ice-ocean parameter <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> are broad and derived from many diverse scientific disciplines. Hence, knowledge of numerous scientific disciplines is required to successfully develop models that can provide better parameterization schemes for the global climate system models. Additional difficulties include inconsistent data structures, formats, and metadata required by models as well as limitations on computing, storage, and connectivity. Traditional standalone and closed network systems cannot fully support sharing and integrating interdisciplinary models from variant sources. To address this need, we have identified methods for sharing Polar Sea ice-ocean parameter <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) techniques and open geospatial standards. The service-oriented model sharing service is accessible using any tools or systems compliant with open geospatial standards, {{making it possible to}} utilize vast scientific resources available {{from around the world to}} solve highly sophisticated application problems. The methods also allow model services to be empowered by diverse computational devices and technologies.

Polar Sea ice-ocean parameter <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> are shared on model services, where the computational processes provided by models can be accessed through tools and systems compliant with WPS.

We compared two massive and two light designs of building envelopes. The massive building envelopes have a load-bearing structure made of bricks and reinforced concrete and are thermally insulated on the outer side. The light building envelopes are examples of envelopes used in wooden prefabricated buildings. All of the above mentioned building envelopes are regularly used in Slovenia. This master's thesis is divided into several stages. Firstly, we calculated the prescribed parameter values of thermal comfort. Then we made four <b>calculation</b> <b>models</b> {{with the help of the}} EnergyPlus and placed them at the location Udine.
