25|$|As noted, a {{few months}} after his {{appointment}} as ABA President Ehnat was fired by the ABA under bad circumstances and was replaced by the new ABA management by Clayton John, a former motorcycle racer and BMX track operator and who is still the current (2006) ABA President. Ehnat became Vice President of the USBA and became active in the campaign to shore up the image of the USBA which was beginning to take damaging hits in the BMX industry, including its dealings with disgraced BMX promoter Renny Roker. Bob Hadley*, team manager of the Huffy BMX team noticed at one time that Erhart was pretty prescient in questions he had with him even before he mentioned them. At the time only Clayton John was privy to the specific concerns in a letter Mr. Hadley had that he had shared only with Mr. John at the time. The timing of Ehnat responses {{and the fact that the}} USBA seemed to always be one step ahead of the ABA in court actions was so uncanny Mr. Hadley joked that someone must have bugged Mr. John's office. Clayton John took the whimsical joke seriously and had ABA headquarters swept for bugs by experts in counter surveillance and corporate espionage. After the sweep, two experts, one a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent and the other a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent found evidence of tampering in one of the telephone trunk lines leading to Mr. John's office. The lines were stripped in a way that it was evidence that a telephone tap was in place at some time. No conclusive proof only circumstantial evidence has suggested that the USBA was responsible. Another suspect, the IRS <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> given the pressure they put the ABA under, including showing up during ABA nationals but aside from it being illegal without a court order, the IRS had perfectly legal ways available to them to get once sensitive information about the ABA, including financial assets. Most of it was public record particularly court proceedings. The IRS had no real motive to go through the unnecessary risk of wire-tapping the ABA offices.|$|E

500|$|Chaplin {{finished}} editing City Lights in December 1930, {{by which}} time silent films were an anachronism. A preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success, but a showing for the press produced positive reviews. One journalist wrote, [...] "Nobody {{in the world but}} Charlie Chaplin <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> He is the only person that has that peculiar something called 'audience appeal' in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk." [...] Given its general release in January 1931, City Lights proved to be a popular and financial success – eventually grossing over $3 million. The British Film Institute cites it as Chaplin's finest accomplishment, and the critic James Agee hails the closing scene as [...] "the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies". City Lights became Chaplin's personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life.|$|E

500|$|The band {{spent the}} {{remainder}} {{of the year in the}} studio, recording what would become Seventh Star. Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band's manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as [...] "Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi" [...] in January 1986. [...] "It opened up a whole can of worms really", Iommi explained, [...] "because I think if we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more." [...] Seventh Star, which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album [...] "often misunderstood and underrated".|$|E

500|$|Although the Association {{unveiled}} the completed head of Lee on January 19, 1924 (the general's birthday), within months, {{its relations with}} Borglum had become strained. [...] Technical problems over the medal and {{the work on the}} mountain caused tensions, and political differences between Borglum, a Republican, and Randolph, an active Democrat, led to poor relations between the two. [...] Borglum, Venable, and Randolph backed different KKK members for national leadership. [...] Both Borglum and the Association accused each other of graft; the sculptor proposed that he form a syndicate to purchase the half dollars from the Mint and sell them with the profits to be applied directly to construction costs. [...] Randolph ridiculed the suggestion, stating that it would allow Borglum to carve [...] "whatever he pleased on the mountain". [...] Borglum accused Randolph of using donations for his own benefit, and spending freely on an expense account. These dissensions became public, and in February 1925, the Association fired Borglum. [...] Randolph stated, as one reason for dismissing the sculptor, that Borglum had taken seven months to design the coin, when, he said, any competent artist <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> in three weeks. [...] He accused Borglum of delaying so that the Association would be embarrassed.

500|$|The storyline {{was created}} in spring 2009 during a story conference, where {{executive}} producer Diederick Santer, storyliner Dominic Treadwell-Collins, series consultant and lead writer Simon Ashdown, series producer Lorraine Newman, script producer Sharon Batten, and Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke were considering what {{to do for the}} Christmas Day 2009 and 25th anniversary episodes. They discussed the character Archie Mitchell and how everyone hated him, and decided on a storyline with characters' hatred and anger towards Archie building up before Christmas, with a peak on Christmas Day when he is killed and another for the reveal on the 19 February 2010 anniversary. They decided to keep the killer's identity a secret within the small group and decided to reveal it during a live episode so that the secret could be kept for as long as possible, and managed the story on a need-to-know basis. The live episode's director, Clive Arnold, became the seventh person to discover the identity of the murderer. They went through the characters to decide who would create a [...] "shiver" [...] moment, and decided against Janine, even though she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> because she has killed before. The killer was going to be Archie's wife Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), until producers discovered Windsor had planned to leave the show, so they decided on Stacey. Although scripts initially diverted attention away from Stacey, Santer realised that drawing attention away from her too much might make it more apparent.|$|E
500|$|In what {{proved to}} be one of the {{tightest}} ever pitching duels in a perfect game, Joss took the mound for the Naps, while the White Sox pitcher was future Hall of Famer Ed Walsh. Neither pitcher would give up an earned run in the 1–0 game. Walsh, blistering through his own 39 win season, struck out 15 batters, gave up only one base on balls and allowed only four scattered hits by the Naps. The Naps' Joe Birmingham scored the team's only run, which came in the third inningthe lone, unearned run scored as a result of a botched pickoff play and a wild pitch. The tension in the ballpark was described by one writer as [...] "a mouse working his way along the grandstand floor would have sounded like a shovel scraping over concrete." [...] Joss, having faced the minimum 24 batters in the first eight inning, retired the first two batters in the bottom of the ninth. [...] Joss then faced White Sox pinch hitter John Anderson. Anderson hit a line drive that could have resulted in a double had it not gone foul. He then hit a ball to Naps third baseman Bill Bradley, which Bradley bobbled before throwing to first baseman George Stovall. Stovall dug the ball out of the dirt to achieve the final out. With the win, Joss recorded the second ever perfect game in MLB's modern era. He accomplished the feat with just 74 pitches, the lowest known pitch count ever achieved in a perfect game. Fans swarmed the field. After the game, Joss said, [...] "I never <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> without Larry Lajoie's and Stovall's fielding and without Birmingham's base running. Walsh was marvelous with his splitter, and we needed two lucky strikes to win." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Frank {{responded to}} what he called [...] "wholly {{inaccurate}} efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats, and [...] in particular" [...] for the subprime mortgage crisis, which {{is linked to the}} financial crisis of 2007–2009. He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations, but met resistance from Republicans, with the main exception being a bill with Republican Mike Oxley that died because of opposition from President Bush. The 2005 bill included Frank objectives, which were to impose tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing. Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and it passed the House. But the Senate never voted on the measure, in part because President Bush was likely to veto it. [...] "If it had passed, that would {{have been one of the}} ways we could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing," [...] Oxley told Frank. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote that Frank [...] "is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters." [...] Once control shifted to the Democrats, Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act (...) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (...) to passage in 2007. Frank also said that the Republican-led Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks, contributed to the financial meltdown. Frank stated further that [...] "during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2007, a few months after I became the Chairman, the House passed a strong reform bill; we sought to get the [...] administration's approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008; and finally got it passed and onto President Bush's desk in July 2008. Moreover, [...] "we were able to adopt it in nineteen months, and we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> much quicker if the [...] administration had cooperated." ...|$|E
