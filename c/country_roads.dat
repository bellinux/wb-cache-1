5|$|During Ruisdael's last period {{he began}} to depict {{mountain}} scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses {{all but two of}} them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and <b>country</b> <b>roads,</b> panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November, Haislip gave Leclerc {{permission}} to advance on Strasbourg. Leclerc surprised the Germans by advancing over <b>country</b> <b>roads</b> and tracks to bypass their defences. Strasbourg was reached on 25 November, and that afternoon the Tricolour {{flew over the}} Strasbourg Cathedral. The German offensive in the Ardennes in December and in Alsace in January led Eisenhower to consider abandoning Strasbourg, but strong opposition to the idea from the French caused him to back down. As a result, the 2e DB was transferred to de Lattre's command {{to assist in the}} reduction of the Colmar Pocket.|$|E

50|$|Kutno is {{important}} communication junction in central Europe. Two main roads lead through town: <b>country</b> <b>road</b> nr. 92 (former road nr. 2) connecting Miedzichowo near Nowy Tomyśl with Łowicz and Warsaw; <b>country</b> <b>road</b> nr. 60 connecting Kutno with Płock and Ostrów Mazowiecka <b>country</b> <b>road</b> {{which is the}} transit corridor for trucks, leading from Baltic countries to Germany. Both roads leading through town are bypassed which helps transport though country and to reduce traffic in the town.|$|R

5|$|Past Cullen, NY167 makes {{a gradual}} bend to the northeast, passing {{by a series}} of farms {{on its way to the}} hamlet of Jordanville. Here, the highway intersects with Jordanville Road (CR18), an east–west two-lane road that NY167 briefly follows as it runs through the community. A short {{distance}} east of Jordanville, NY167 splits from Jordanville Road to head northeast as a two-lane rural road. It intersects with <b>country</b> <b>roads,</b> such as Rock Hill Road (CR 135) and Robinson Road (CR 46) For the next , the route meanders across Warren, following an erratic northeasterly course across largely undeveloped areas to reach the rural hamlet of Paines Hollow, located at the junction of NY167 and NY168.|$|E
5|$|The trail follows forest tracks, {{mountain}} paths, boreens {{and quiet}} <b>country</b> <b>roads.</b> Mountains, upland lakes and steep-sided glacial valleys {{make up the}} terrain of the initial northern sections of the Way before giving way to gentler rolling foothills in the latter southern sections. Much of the route follows the contact point between the igneous granite of {{the western side of}} Wicklow and the metamorphic schists and slates of the eastern side. The principal habitat of the upland sections is a mixture of broadleaf and coniferous woodland, heath and blanket bog while in the lowland sections the hedgerows marking the boundaries between fields support a variety of wildlife. The Way also passes the Monastic City at Glendalough, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was born}} oldest of nine {{children}} in Barnet, {{a town in}} Caledonia County in northeastern Vermont, and {{spent much of his}} childhood in Rhode Island. In his autobiography, Senator from Vermont, Flanders described life on his family’s subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island, before he left to work in the machine tool industry for most of his career. In his first years as a machinist and draftsman, he spent his vacations traveling by bicycle over <b>country</b> <b>roads</b> between Rhode Island and Vermont and New Hampshire. Later, he lived for a time in New York City where he edited a machine tool magazine, but after five years decided to move back to Vermont. In 1911, he married Helen Edith Hartness, daughter of inventor and industrialist James Hartness. They made their home in Springfield, Vermont, where Flanders became president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company. Flanders and his wife had three children: Elizabeth (born 1912), Anna (also known as Nancy—born 1918), and James (born 1923).|$|E

50|$|Building {{of houses}} {{occurred}} in spurts. Initially most building occurred {{within a mile}} (2 km) of the harbor. Few houses were built south of North <b>Country</b> <b>Road</b> until the late 19th century. Much of the land south of North <b>Country</b> <b>Road</b> was owned and cultivated by farmers.|$|R

5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the <b>country</b> <b>roads.</b> Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
25|$|Bedfordshire {{boasts a}} 40-mile (64km) walk {{traversing}} the county from Leighton Buzzard {{at the southern}} end point and Sandy, Bedfordshire/Gamlingay in southern Cambridgeshire to the east.

5000|$|Beginning 2003, <b>Country</b> <b>Road</b> {{entered into}} an {{exclusive}} agreement with Myer department stores. Under this agreement, <b>Country</b> <b>Road</b> {{agreed to sell}} exclusively to Myer and not to its main rival, David Jones. It also included joint marketing and in-store visual merchandising. This arrangement ended in January 2007 when <b>Country</b> <b>Road</b> became a concession store in David Jones and Myer stores. There were also stores in Boston, Chicago, New York City and other cities in the United States, as recent as 2000 or later, which closed due to poor sales.|$|R
25|$|However, even as {{the railway}} was being officially opened, the roads that would {{ultimately}} lead to its closure were already on the way.

25|$|Disengaging {{slowly and}} {{protecting}} his captured wagons, Stuart withdrew {{to the northeast}} through Jefferson towards York, known from recent newspapers to be the location of Early's division. En route, Stuart heard at New Salem that Early's Division had recently left York and marched northwestly through Dover. Stuart changed course and headed northward through the night on winding, hilly <b>country</b> <b>roads,</b> still trying to locate Early or Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, thinking the latter still to be towards the Susquehanna River.|$|E
25|$|The second {{category}} included private or <b>country</b> <b>roads,</b> originally constructed by private individuals, in whom their soil was vested, {{and who had}} the power to dedicate them to the public use. Such roads benefited from a right of way, in favor either of the public or of the owner of a particular estate. Under the heading of viae privatae were also included roads leading from the public or high roads to particular estates or settlements. These Ulpian considers to be public roads in themselves.|$|E

25|$|Attlebridge {{airfield}} had runways of 1,220, 1,120 and 1,080 yards length but, {{when the}} base was earmarked for USAAF use, these were extended and the airfield was enlarged to meet heavy bomber requirements. The main E-W runway was increased to 2,000 yards {{and the others}} to 1,400 yards each. The perimeter track was also extended {{and the number of}} hardstands was increased to fifty. In enlarging the airfield, several small, <b>country</b> <b>roads</b> were closed in the parish of Weston Longville, in which the larger part of the airfield was sited.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 {{and again}} in 1926, Alfred Stephens {{suggested}} in newspaper articles that more suitable employment should be found for him. The difficulty was that Neilson's poor eyesight unfitted him for most kinds of work. However, a movement began in Melbourne to help {{him and he was}} granted a small literary pension; and eventually in 1928 a position was found for him as an attendant {{in the office of the}} Victorian <b>Country</b> <b>Roads</b> Board. This office was in the Exhibition Gardens, Melbourne, and in these pleasant surroundings Neilson spent his days until near the end of his life.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{his older}} brother Tony who {{attended}} a grammar school (selective secondary school), Taupin was not a diligent student, although he showed an early flair for writing. At age 15, he left school and started work as a trainee in the print room of the local newspaper, The Lincolnshire Standard, with aspirations of becoming a journalist. Taupin soon left that job, and {{spent the rest of}} his teenage years hanging out with friends, hitchhiking the <b>country</b> <b>roads</b> to attend youth club dances in the surrounding villages, playing snooker in the Aston Arms Pub in Market Rasen and drinking. Taupin had worked at several part-time, dead-end jobs when, at age 17, he answered the advertisement that eventually led to his collaboration with Elton John.|$|E

Many visitors pause on their journey on the A1 to photograph their arrival in Scotland or their departure to England at the border crossing. Though the border has significance to many visitors, most local people {{think of themselves as}} 'Borderers' rather than as Scots or English.
