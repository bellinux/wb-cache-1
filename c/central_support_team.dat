5000|$|The {{founder and}} the largest cadet scheme are {{operated}} by the Metropolitan Police Service, with over 5000 cadets as of March 2016. Launched in 1987 as a community initiative, the then-Commissioner Peter Lambet wanted to engage with young people. The first documented volunteer police cadet unit started in South Norwood (Lambeth) in March 1988. However, there is a suggestion that units were opened in 1987 after the commissioner's launch. Started by local officers it soon grew to a success and was expanded across other boroughs. By 2010 every London borough had a VPC unit, along with a <b>central</b> <b>support</b> <b>team</b> within the Territorial Policing Command Unit. Metropolitan Police Cadets (aged from 10 to 24) [...] are involved in continuing further education, DofE, learning about the police service, carrying out attachments to divisions and specialist departments, learning first aid, and engaging in community work projects with the disabled and disadvantaged. London Police cadets annually compete in a police scenario completion, which was traditionally held in Hendon, in North London, for the annual Police Cadet Competition. This involved cadets competing {{in a range of}} police activities and scenarios, in which they were competitively assessed. In 2015 the Metropolitan Police announced that the Cadet Competition was no longer to be held at Hendon due to the resizing of Hendon; some of the land was sold off for development. However, the Annual Cadet Competition continues a long tradition at the GRAVESEND public order site. 2013 also saw the launch of Junior Police Cadets capturing those young people from school Year 6 to Year 9 at which point they become eligible to join the senior VPC.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} project as a whole, as commissioned by Sport Wales, was to examine whether and in what ways the Mentro Allan Programme was successful in increasing and sustaining increased physical activity levels amongst target groups of relatively inactive people in Wales. The research brief provided an exciting opportunity to undertake a relatively novel approach to this kind of evaluative research, for at the core of {{the research}} was the opportunity to capture the experiences and ‘voices’ of individuals and social groups from different backgrounds, to chart their perceptions and perspectives in order to facilitate understanding of what they themselves considered was likely to stimulate engagement with physical activity and to encourage sustained participation. Rather than imposing Sport Wales’ or the Research Team’s conceptual framework upon participants, therefore, we wanted to hear from the participants themselves and to undertake the qualitative element of the research as inductively as possible. A quantitative dimension was also incorporated into the research design in terms of analysing quantitative data collected by the MA <b>Central</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Team</b> via their Physical Activity Level (PAL) forms and attendance records for each project throughout the duration of the MA Programme. Mentro Allan targeted specific demographic groups (‘target groups’), which are considered to be generally less active than the wider population in Wales. Fifteen Projects initially were granted funding for four years to increase the physical activity levels of their target group(s), making use of the local outdoor environment. Subsequently one of these Projects terminated, leaving 14 Projects in total, all of which were researched by the Research Team, including via extended fieldwork with six Projects...|$|E

Such a team might be a subset of an existing enterprise architecture capability and generally consists of {{a small number of}} staff (1-5).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} the uMeeting system, a {{co-located}} meeting {{system on the}} large-scale tabletop. People are used to sitting around a table to hold a meeting. It is natural and intuitive. The table has a <b>central</b> role to <b>support</b> <b>team</b> activities. Horizontal surfaces rather than vertical ones have inherent features to support the co-located meeting. Existing tabletops aren’t large enough to support more than 4 people’s meeting and the display area for each person is not large enough. Thus we develop uTable, a large-scale multi-touch tabletop. Based on uTableSDK we developed earlier, we develop uMeeting system that supports co-located meeting on the large tabletop uTable...|$|R

40|$|Sixteen {{studies on}} the {{effectiveness}} of palliative <b>support</b> <b>teams</b> were analyzed. It was established that in most cases uncontrolled designs with repeated measurements were used. The assessment methods varied strongly. However, the <b>Support</b> <b>Team</b> Assessment Schedule was the most frequently used instrument. Effects reported on patients' physical symptoms, such as pain, were for the most part positive. Fewer effects were reported regarding psychosocial and spiritual problems of patients and relatives. For instance, various studies indicated that feelings of anxiety did not diminsh after referral to a palliative <b>support</b> <b>team.</b> Results about the effects on use and costs of health care services did not point in a clear direction. Accordingly it is unclear whether palliative <b>support</b> <b>teams</b> reduce or increase care consumption and costs. Given the sometimes contradictory findings and the small number of studies conducted, future high-quality research into the effectiveness of palliative <b>support</b> <b>teams</b> is needed.

40|$|This essay {{deals with}} the support and help offered to elderly people over 65 with mental disabilities out of {{personnel}} from a special <b>support</b> <b>team.</b> We have chosen to use the qualitative method to answer our questions. We have four semi-structured interviews with all staff from the <b>support</b> <b>team</b> {{we have been in}} contact with, three nurses/nursing assistants and project manager for the <b>support</b> <b>team.</b> We have recognized five themes and divided the text into six different categories and disciplines that answers and highlights the importance of meeting clients' needs, increase their independence and quality of life. Our theme is security, continuity, time, treatment and relations. Our topics are quality of life and health, personalized and holistic, empowerment, motivation and participation, activity and disengagement and stigma. The conclusion of our essay {{is that there is a}} need for a special team to meet the needs of older people with mental disabilities. The <b>support</b> <b>team</b> has more time and can give clients the support they need. The time gives staff the opportunity to increase clients' quality of life by listening and understanding. The staff provides security with their presence and attitude while becoming a social contact for the client. The staff has the knowledge required to provide good treatment. The staff of the <b>support</b> <b>team</b> works with high professionalism and flexibility. The <b>support</b> <b>team</b> is working from the client's needs when the operation should be given and how it should be. The <b>support</b> <b>team</b> works with the continuity that provides a better and deeper relationship with the client. We have found that staff in the <b>support</b> <b>team</b> is working to get their clients to feel that they are able to do things themselves and build up their confidence and self esteem. This is the <b>support</b> <b>team</b> doing by lifting up what clients can and try to motivate clients to do things. By the <b>support</b> <b>teams</b> encouragement and <b>support</b> clients can find faith in themselves to handle things and become independent. <b>Support</b> <b>team</b> works with their clients so that they feel the meaningfulness of everyday life. By the motivation from the <b>support</b> <b>team</b> clients has managed to become more involved in their daily work. The <b>support</b> <b>team</b> provides personalized care to their clients. We have found it impossible to generalize and think that all older people with mental disabilities can be satisfied by for example activity and interaction with other people. For many of these clients their need may change. Passivity and aloofness can be an experience of tranquility and well-being and to decrease stress. Another aspect we have found, the reason why clients withdraw and isolate themselves at home is that clients put “stamp” on themselves as mentally ill. This negative self-image can be influenced by impressions from the surroundings. By that clients are treated with respect and sensitivity of personnel, client's view of themselves can change. The <b>support</b> <b>team</b> works to ensure opportunities in their clients' daily lives and not obstacles...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} inquiry {{evaluated the}} Student <b>Support</b> <b>Team</b> Project {{and its effects}} on preservice teachers’ knowledge and perceptions of prereferral intervention and student <b>support</b> <b>teams.</b> This investigation is important because prereferral intervention and student <b>support</b> <b>teams</b> have been used increasingly to provide assistance to teachers and to students who need assistance with academic, social and emotional problems. This has created a need to provide preservice education that helps to prepare teachers to use these resources to help their students. This investigation demonstrated a specific approach to such instruction for preservice teachers (i. e., the Student <b>Support</b> <b>Team</b> Project), including an evaluation to determine changes in perceptions and knowledge that resulted during and after participation in this project. Participants were preservice teachers enrolled in an alternative teacher certification program. The research design was qualitative. Data collection included semi-structured interviews, written reflections from the preservice teachers, input from key informants, field notes and research team reflective journals. The collection and analysis of data were done recursively and used constant comparative methods. Analysis of the data revealed three main categories: Knowledge, Knowledge Needed, and Project Feedback. Knowledge reflected the participants’ understanding of student <b>support</b> <b>teams</b> and their implementation and included the following themes: Knowledge about Data Collection, Knowledge about Intervention, Knowledge about Student <b>Support</b> <b>Teams,</b> and Generalization of Knowledge. Knowledge Needed reflected the knowledge participants needed to understand and work effectively with these teams, including the following themes: Knowledge Needed about Data Collection, Knowledge Needed about Intervention, Knowledge Needed about Student <b>Support</b> <b>Teams,</b> and Other Knowledge Needed. Project Feedback included perceived strengths and weaknesses of the Student <b>Support</b> <b>Team</b> Project, including the following themes: Project Helpful, Project Struggles, and Project Suggestions. One key finding was how preservice teachers’ understanding of student <b>support</b> <b>teams</b> evolved from vague ideas about teams, to increasingly specific case-focused ideas, and finally, to generalized understandings. Findings are discussed in relationship to the literature on prereferral intervention and teacher development. Implications for preservice teacher education are discussed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore parents??? and guardians??? {{perceptions}} of their experiences with Family <b>Support</b> <b>Team</b> (FST) meetings at Orville Wright Elementary School. This qualitative study focuses on allowing parents and guardians to provide input in order to improve the quality of Family <b>Support</b> <b>Team</b> meetings at Orville Wright Elementary School. A non-probability sampling method is utilized for identifying potential participants. A total of five interviews are conducted with parents and guardians who participated in a Family <b>Support</b> <b>Team</b> meeting at Orville Wright Elementary School. The major results from this study suggest that Family <b>Support</b> <b>Team</b> meetings are a valuable strategy to incorporate in school services. The participants of this study indicate that they have had positive experiences with Family <b>Support</b> <b>Teams</b> meetings at Orville Wright Elementary School. In addition, the responses of the participants suggest that parents gain a sense of empowerment as a result of participating in these meetings. According to this study, having a number of diverse staff members present during Family <b>Support</b> <b>Team</b> meetings is important to parents. In addition, participants of this study suggested that the way to improve FST meetings at Orville Wright Elementary School is for all parents to become more involved in their children???s education...|$|R
