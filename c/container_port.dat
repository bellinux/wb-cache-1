5|$|Port Newark is {{the part}} of Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal and the largest cargo {{facility}} in the Port of New York and New Jersey. On Newark Bay, it is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and serves as the principal container ship facility for goods entering and leaving the New York metropolitan region and the northeastern quadrant of North America. The Port moved over $100 billion in goods in 2003, making it the 15th busiest in the world at the time, but was the number one <b>container</b> <b>port</b> as recently as 1985. Plans are underway for billions of dollars of improvements – larger cranes, bigger railyard facilities, deeper channels, and expanded wharves.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{operating}} efficiency, the scale efficiency targets, and the variability of DEA efficiency estimates of Asian <b>container</b> <b>ports.</b> This study applies data envelopment analysis (DEA) with the traditional DEA model, most productive scale size concept, returns to scale approach, and bootstrap method to assess the operating performance, set scale efficient targets, and determine efficiency rankings of Asian <b>container</b> <b>ports.</b> The results of this study can provide port managers with insights into resource allocation, competitive advantages, as well as optimization of the operating performance.

40|$|AbstractThe {{accumulation}} and repositioning {{of empty}} containers have become acute problems for <b>container</b> <b>ports</b> {{and are expected}} to intensify in the future given the expected growth in trade imbalances among trading nations. These problems are major costs and operational challenges for <b>container</b> <b>ports.</b> More accurate forecasting of volumes of <b>port</b> empty <b>containers</b> will enable <b>container</b> <b>ports</b> to develop more cost efficient plans for the repositioning of empty containers. This paper compares the Tioga Group, United Nations and Winters method (utilizing empty container volumes of three U. S. <b>container</b> <b>ports)</b> in forecasting volumes of <b>port</b> empty <b>containers.</b> The Winters method is found to provide more accurate forecasts of volumes of <b>port</b> empty <b>containers</b> than the Tioga Group and United Nations methods...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, some {{hypotheses}} can {{be tested}} {{in relation to the}} efficiency rankings of the <b>container</b> <b>ports</b> in the region. The two hypotheses stated here are: (i) Large <b>container</b> <b>ports,</b> in terms of the TEUs serviced, are more efficient than small <b>container</b> <b>ports,</b> and (ii) Italian <b>container</b> <b>ports</b> are systematically more efficient than the other <b>container</b> <b>ports</b> in the SEE region. The Mann–Whitney U-test, which tests for the existence of systematic differences between the efficiency scores, is adopted. This test is considered as suitable for the non-parametric statistical analysis of DEA results [19], because the efficiency scores do not typically follow a standard normal distribution. The CRS Super-Efficiency scores are chosen for the analysis, because they capture the total technical efficiency and adequately discriminate the efficient DMUs. Regarding the first hypothesis, the whole sample of ports is divided into two subsamples, based on the TEUs. The statistic value z[*]=[*]− 3.463 with Prob > |z|[*]=[*] 0.0005 demonstrates, as expected, that the larger ports are significantly more efficient because of economies of scale. In other words, the size of operations and technical efficiency of ports are systematically positively related to each other. Regarding the second hypothesis, the subsample of the twelve Italian <b>container</b> <b>ports</b> is compared to a subsample comprising the twelve most efficient SEE <b>container</b> <b>ports.</b> The statistic value z[*]=[*]− 0.462 with Prob > |z|[*]=[*] 0.6442 indicates that there is no systematic difference in the efficiency between the Italian and the other SEE <b>container</b> <b>ports.</b> This outcome may be explained by the different natures and characteristics pertaining to the ports within each subsample {{and the fact that the}} competitive advantage of Italian ports, in terms of their increased scale efficiency, is somewhat compensated by the relatively higher pure technical efficiency of the other SEE ports.|$|R
5|$|A Master Plan {{adopted in}} 2000 {{called for the}} port to be {{transformed}} into a <b>container</b> <b>port,</b> which led to the purchase of the largest harbor crane in the state. In 2002, the Port District Commission took the lead in the development of Albany's Riverfront Park in the Corning Preserve as part of a development to enhance Albany's access to the river. The port helped in financing the project and in the construction of two bulkheads which have seasonal floating docks attached. In a 2005 audit, the Office of the State Comptroller questioned the port's involvement in the construction and financing. Two issues raised were the port district's lack of authority to build docks for non-commercial use and that the port would receive no income for facilities it was financing. The port received $3.3million in 2002 to upgrade and {{become a member of the}} Inland Distribution Network, a select group of ports that are used as satellite locations for the distribution of container cargo from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, resulting in less congestion at downstate ports and highways.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong is the world's {{eleventh}} largest trading entity, {{with the}} total value of imports and exports exceeding its gross domestic product. It is the world's largest re-export centre. Much of Hong Kong's exports consist of re-exports, which are products made outside of the territory, especially in mainland China, and distributed via Hong Kong. Its physical location has allowed the city to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure that includes the world's second busiest <b>container</b> <b>port</b> and the world's busiest airport for international cargo. Even before the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong had established extensive trade and investment ties with the mainland, which now enable it to serve as a point of entry for investment flowing into the mainland. At the end of 2007, there were 3.46million people employed full-time, with the unemployment rate averaging 4.1% for the fourth straight year of decline. Hong Kong's economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounts for over 90% of its GDP, while industry constitutes 9%. Inflation was at 2.5% in 2007. Hong Kong's largest export markets are mainland China, the United States, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Rijeka {{development}} master plan, {{devised by}} Rotterdam Maritime Group, specifies further expansion of port facilities by 2030, including {{the construction of}} a large container terminal in Omišalj on Krk Island, near the JANAF Omišalj oil terminal. The container terminal would increase the annual capacity of the port by 2.5million TEUs. The plan requires construction of a high performance railway to Zagreb and a rail link planned by Croatian Railways to the proposed island terminal. The new line entails building a new bridge to Krk Island in addition to the existing Krk Bridge. The plan also includes expansion of the existing terminals, and is estimated to require an additional US$150 million. Likewise, an expansion of the Liquid Cargo Terminal is planned, as well as an expansion of the Bakar Bay facility, where a car terminal is planned. The expansion of the port, improvement of transportation links and the strategic partnership are aimed at establishing Rijeka as the largest <b>container</b> <b>port</b> on the Adriatic Sea.|$|E

5|$|Sabah has a {{total of}} eight ports {{operating}} in Sepanggar, Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Tawau, Kudat, Kunak and Lahad Datu. The Sapangar Bay <b>Container</b> <b>Port</b> is the main transshipment hub for the BIMP-EAGA region. Another port, the Sapangar Bay Oil Terminal is the main terminal for refined petroleum products and liquid chemical in the West Coast. Kota Kinabalu Port remain as a general cargo port. While all ports in the northern and eastern Sabah served to handle palm oil related products such as fertiliser, palm kernel as well for general cargo. Ferry service in the West Coast side provide trips to Labuan from the Jesselton Point Waterfront and Menumbok Ferry Terminal in Kuala Penyu. In the East Coast, the service are provided from the Tawau Ferry Terminal to Nunukan and Tarakan in Kalimantan, Indonesia. There is also ferry services from Sandakan to Zamboanga City and a new one from Kudat to Buliluyan, Bataraza of Palawan in the Philippines, but both services were terminated at the moment {{due to lack of}} security enforcement from the Philippine side prior to the persistent attack by pirates and kidnapping by militant groups based in the Sulu Archipelago of the southern Philippines. The ferry service from Kudat to Palawan was restored on 1 February 2017 after the increasing of security enforcement from the Philippines side.|$|E
5|$|From 2010 to 2011, {{the state}} {{experienced}} a slower growth due to weaker {{performance on the}} oil and gas sector. Based on 2014 survey, Sabah GDP recorded a 5.0% growth and remained as the largest contributor in agriculture sector with 18.1%, followed by Sarawak, Johor, Pahang and Perak. Its GDP per capita however are still lowest with RM19,672, the third lowest after Kelantan (RM11,815) and Kedah (RM17,321) from all 13 states. In the same year, the state export value stood at RM45.3billion with an import value of RM36.5billion. Machinery and transportation equipment accounted for most of the imported products followed by fuel, mineral lubricants and others. While Sabah mostly exports raw petroleum and palm oil. The state currently has a total of eight ports with two in Sepanggar while each one in Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Tawau, Kudat, Kunak and Lahad Datu that was operated and maintained by the Sabah Ports Authority owned by Suria Group. As part of the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP), the federal government has approved an allocation of RM800million to expand the cargo handling of Sapangar Bay <b>Container</b> <b>Port</b> from 500,000 to 1.25million TEUs per annum as well to accommodate larger ship like Panamax-size vessels. An additional allocation of RM333.51million was given in the same year, making it a total of RM1.13billion with the project will start in 2017. The fisheries industries remain the important part of Sabah primary sector economy with a contribution for about 200,000 metric tonnes of fish worth RM700 annually as well contributing 2.8% to the state annual GDP. While the aquaculture and marine fish cage sector have produce 35,000 metric tons of brackish and fresh waters aquaculture and 360 metric ton of groupers, wrasses, snappers and lobsters worth around RM60million and RM13million respectively. Sabah {{is also one of the}} producer of seaweed, with most of the farms are located in the seas around Semporna. Although recently the seaweed industry was heavily affected by spate of kidnappings perpetrated by the southern-Philippine-based Abu Sayyaf militant group.|$|E
