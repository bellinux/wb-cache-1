He took Pizacura to Mexico with him, where he died not long afterwards of a fatal illness. Gonzalo de Sandoval also returned to Mexico, marching overland via Guatemala. Cortés installed his cousin Hernando de Saavedra as governor of the new territory, and left Saavedra with instructions to treat the natives fairly; however Saavedra's actions reopened underlying divisions between rival groups of colonists. Saavedra rapidly established rule over {{what is now the}} department of Olancho; he sent Bartolomé de Celada inland to find a good location for a new Spanish town. He founded Frontera de <b>Cáceras</b> upon the savannah of the Olancho valley, near the Indian towns of Telica and Escamilpa, within the disputed territory between Honduras and Nicaragua.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe chansons de geste and chivalric romances {{from the}} 12 th and 13 th centuries are a {{faithful}} {{testimony of the}} reality of their time, and sensory perceptions are among these testimonies. The written word provides not only descriptive and objective information, but also the impressions perceived and conveyed by the author, which are the sensations the reader has to get acquainted with {{in order to make the}} story their own. Mentions to sound effects and the sound features of a particular space are remarkable, and a compilation of these references from various texts allows us to study the sounds, resonances, and spaces through which the sound event gains prominence in the narrative. These include confined spaces such as halls and palaces, and open spaces such as woods, and war and hunting scenes. The voices, cries, sounds of instruments, sound gestures, and sound experiences of spaces thus acquire a theatrical quality that becomes part of the reading experience. The authors often evoke the effect of a resonance, an echo, a reverberation or a stereophonic effect, thus endowing the text with the emotional qualities of a soundtrack.

The Hospital of San Lazaro in Manila was run by Franciscan Friars until September 1898, when it was turned over to the American authorities. The other Islands, Cebu, Palestina, and Nueva Cáceres were ordered abandoned by general Leonard Wood.|$|E
