5|$|Moreover, any object {{traveling}} at a <b>constant</b> <b>velocity</b> must {{be subject to}} zero net force (resultant force). This {{is the definition of}} dynamic equilibrium: when all the forces on an object balance but it still moves at a <b>constant</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E
5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in <b>constant</b> <b>velocity</b> motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing <b>constant</b> <b>velocity</b> motion.|$|E
5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas.

Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E

5|$|Photons mediate {{electromagnetic}} {{interactions between}} particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron at a <b>constant</b> <b>velocity</b> cannot emit or absorb a real photon; {{doing so would}} violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|E
5|$|Philosophers {{in antiquity}} used {{the concept of}} force {{in the study of}} {{stationary}} and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a <b>constant</b> <b>velocity.</b> Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.|$|E
5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a <b>constant</b> <b>velocity</b> to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a body {{immersed in a}} perfect gas, moving under the action of a constant force E along the x axis. We assume the gas to be described by the mean-field approximation and interacting elastically with the body, we study the friction exerted by the gas on the body fixed at <b>constant</b> <b>velocities.</b> The dynamic in this setting was studied in previous papers for object with simple shape, showing new features in the dynamic {{but not in the}} friction term. The case of more general shape of the body was left out for further difficulties, we believe indeed that there are actually non trivial issues to be faced for these more general cases. To show this and in the in the spirit of getting a more realistic perspective in the study of friction problems, in this paper we focused our attention on the friction term itself, studying its behavior on a body with a more general kind of concavity and fixed at <b>constant</b> <b>velocities.</b> We derive the expression of the friction term for <b>constant</b> <b>velocities,</b> we show how it is time dependent and we give its exact estimate in time. Finally we use this result to show the absence of a stationary velocity in the actual dynamic of such a body. Comment: 13 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1401. 594...|$|R

A flywheel offers the combination of high energy density and high power density not attainable with other energy storage medium. In many situations, it is desirable to store energy at a <b>constant</b> angular <b>velocity.</b> This work proposes a novel self-governing fluidic variable inertia flywheel that can maintain a <b>constant</b> angular <b>velocity</b> {{across a range of}} energy storage. The fluidic flywheel uses a piston to separate the liquid filled chamber from a chamber vented to atmosphere. A force balance is created on the piston due to the radial pressure gradient of the liquid reacted by a constant force spring. Energy added to the system is stored in equally two forms: increases the kinetic energy of the flywheel at a <b>constant</b> angular <b>velocity</b> and increasing the potential energy of the constant force spring. A design example demonstrates that the fluidic flywheel enables a <b>constant</b> angular <b>velocity</b> with an order of magnitude lower mass moment of inertia than a conventional flywheel. This promising technology enables a simple <b>constant</b> angular <b>velocity</b> energy storage system, yet requires future work in numerous areas. I...|$|R
