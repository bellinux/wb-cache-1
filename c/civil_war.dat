5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is <b>Civil</b> <b>War,</b> a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American <b>Civil</b> <b>War.</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
40|$|When do ethnic <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> last {{especially}} long? This dissertation examines when, why, and how ethnicity {{affects the}} length of <b>civil</b> <b>wars.</b> Two-thirds of <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> pit ethnic combatants against each other; the duration of these conflicts varies considerably. Existing work on ethnicity in <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> is effectively stalemated on the questions of how or even whether ethnicity influences the lengths of these wars. Yet the answer has vital normative, policy, and research implications. In this dissertation, I argue that ethnicity will prolong <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> under two conditions. First, when information derived from ethnic interactions exacerbates combatants’ fears of the future, conflicts will last longer. Second, when support from ethnic kin in other states alters the balance of capabilities or introduces uncertainty into wars, conflicts will be protracted. Using duration analysis of a new dataset of all ethnic <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> from 1945 to 2004, I show that both of these dynamics prolong ethnic <b>civil</b> <b>wars.</b> Case studies from two post-Soviet republics demonstrate that ethnic interactions are especially likely to prolong conflicts when they exacerbate commitment or signaling problems. Two <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> in Indonesia show that ethnic kin are especially influential when they influence the balance of capabilities. Case studies of <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> in Central America and Sri Lanka indicate that these findings also may have implications for both variation within non-ethnic <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> and between ethnic and non-ethnic <b>civil</b> <b>wars...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>wars</b> {{since the}} end of World War II have lasted on average just over four years, a {{dramatic}} rise from the one-and-a-half-year average of the 1900-1944 period. While the rate of emergence of new <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> has been relatively steady since the mid-19th century, the increasing length of those wars has resulted in increasing numbers of wars ongoing at any one time. For example, there were no more than five <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> underway simultaneously {{in the first half of}} the 20th century while there were over 20 concurrent <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> close to the end of the Cold <b>War.</b> Since 1945, <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> have resulted in the deaths of over 25 million people, as well as the forced displacement of millions more. <b>Civil</b> <b>wars</b> have further resulted in economic collapse; Somalia, Burma (Myanmar), Uganda and Angola are examples of nations that were considered to have had promising futures before being engulfed in <b>civil</b> <b>wars.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} empirically {{the relationship}} between <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> and international trade. We first show that trade destruction due to <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> is very large and persistent and increases with {{the severity of the}} conflict. We then identify two effects that trade can have on the risk of civil conflicts: it may act as a deterrent if trade gains are put at risk during <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> but it may also act as an insurance if international trade provides a substitute to internal trade during <b>civil</b> <b>wars.</b> We find support for the presence of these two mechanisms and conclude that trade openness may deter the most severe <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> (those that destroy the largest amount of trade) but may increase the risk of lower scale conflicts. ...|$|R

25|$|Evolutionary {{psychologist}} Satoshi Kanazawa {{has argued}} that an important cause of intergroup conflict may be the relative availability of women of reproductive age. He found that polygyny greatly increased the frequency of <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> but not interstate wars. Gleditsch et al. did not find a relationship between ethnic groups with polygyny and increased frequency of <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> but nations having legal polygamy may have more <b>civil</b> <b>wars.</b> They argued that misogyny is a better explanation than polygyny.

40|$|Were rebel {{movements}} that adopted a Marxist ideological agenda {{different from those}} that did not? We find that a Marxist profile made a difference, both in <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> featuring Marxist rebels (compared to those with non-Marxist ones), but also (and maybe more surprisingly) for nationalist or ethnic insurgents that adopted a Marxist political agenda, often known as national liberation movements. More specifically, we find that <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> where insurgents sported a Marxist outlook were longer, more lethal, {{and more likely to}} end in a negotiated compromise, compared to non-Marxist ones. We also find that, for the most, <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> featuring Marxist National Liberation movements resemble <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> with Marxist non-ethnic rebels much closer compared to wars with non-Marxist ethnic rebels, i. e. ethnic <b>civil</b> <b>wars.</b> Theoretically, our findings call for both a rethinking of the role of Marxism in <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> and of the category of “ethnic war. ” From a policy perspective, our findings provide a measure of optimism, insofar as the disappearance of Marxist ideology is associated with shorter and less severe conflicts, but also of pessimism given the demise of highly disciplined Marxist insurgents who were more likely to compromise (or perhaps stick by it) appears to lower the likelihood of negotiated agreements.
