5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will <b>control</b> <b>our</b> ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
500|$|This work's title, {{translatable}} as [...] "tutor", {{refers to}} Christ {{as the teacher}} of all mankind, and it features an extended metaphor of Christians as children. It is not simply instructional : the author intends {{to show how the}} Christian should respond to the Love of God authentically. Clement, following Plato (Republic 4:441), divides life into three elements: character, actions and passions. The first having been dealt with in the Protrepticus, he devotes the Paedagogus to reflections on Christ's role in teaching us to act morally and to <b>control</b> <b>our</b> passions. Despite its explicitly Christian nature, Clement's work draws on Stoic philosophy and pagan literature; Homer alone is cited over sixty times in the work.|$|E
500|$|Icke {{has emerged}} as a {{professional}} conspiracy theorist within a global counter-cultural movement that combines New World Order conspiracism, the truther movement and anti-globalization, with an extraterrestrial conspiracist subculture (Roswell, alien abduction, crop circles, men in black, The X-Files). Thanks to Icke's prominence, public figures are regularly asked whether they are lizards. An Official Information Act request was filed in New Zealand in 2008 to ask this of John Key, the prime minister, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was asked the same during a Q in 2016. (Both men said they were not lizards. Key added that he had taken the unusual step of consulting not only a doctor but a vet.) In a 2013 survey in the United States by Public Policy Polling, 4% believed that [...] "'lizard people' <b>control</b> <b>our</b> societies." ...|$|E

500|$|When Alberta and Saskatchewan {{were made}} provinces in 1905, the federal {{government}} retained control over their lands and natural resources, which made the new provinces unique in Canada. [...] The Rutherford government acquiesced to this state of affairs; because the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it was natural for the provincial Liberal Party to cast itself as their defender. [...] In this capacity, Rutherford pointed to the $375,000 per year that the provincial government received from {{the federal government}} as compensation. [...] In 1910, however, Liberal MLA Alwyn Bramley-Moore (who was a staunch provincial rights advocate and who many years later would be called [...] "Alberta's first separatist" [...] by the Edmonton Journal) moved a resolution calling on the Sifton government to [...] "take such steps as may be deemed necessary to acquire the control of all such natural resources as are of purely local concern". [...] Sifton responded that it was already the intention of his government to begin negotiations with the federal government to this end. [...] He asserted [...] "I have always believed... that we should administer our mines and timber. [...] The question is not now whether we would like to <b>control</b> <b>our</b> natural resources, but {{what is the best way}} to get them." ...|$|E

Brown's speech mentioned Ayn Rand and lamented the triumph of [...] "the collectivist impulse" [...] in which capitalism receives [...] "contemptuous tolerance but only for its capacity to feed the insatiable maw of socialism." [...] She argued that [...] "where government moves in, community retreats, civil society disintegrates, and our ability to <b>control</b> <b>our</b> own destiny atrophies" [...] and suggested that the ultimate result for the United States has been a [...] "debased, debauched culture which finds moral depravity entertaining and virtue contemptible." ...|$|E

[...] For a new state to be carved out of one already in existence requires the approval of both the old state legislature and the U.S. Congress. New states have been created from the territory of older states before: in 1792, Kentucky was formed from part of Virginia, and West Virginia broke away from Virginia and became a state in 1863. Mailer proposed that the first step, following his election, should be a citywide referendum on the question of statehood for the city.|$|E

They did things [...] "for the lulz" [...] and focused on the possible comedic and entertainment value of attacking targets. The group occasionally claimed a political message. When they hacked PBS, they stated they did so in retaliation for what they perceived as unfair treatment of Wikileaks in a Frontline documentary entitled WikiSecrets. A page they inserted on the PBS website included the title [...] "FREE BRADLEY MANNING. FUCK FRONTLINE!" [...] The 20 June announcement of [...] "Operation Anti-Security" [...] contained justification for attacks on government targets, citing supposed government efforts to [...] "dominate and <b>control</b> <b>our</b> Internet ocean" [...] and accusing them of corruption and breaching privacy.

[...] Castellio concluded: [...] "We can live together peacefully only when we <b>control</b> <b>our</b> intolerance. Even though there will always be differences of opinion from time to time, we can at any rate come to general understandings, can love one another, and can enter the bonds of peace, pending the day when we shall attain unity of faith."

2500|$|La Torre {{wrote the}} lyrics to [...] "Don't Look Back", {{predominantly}} basing them on a poem about moving on, which he wrote many years prior when he was [...] "in a really weird place personally". He explains that the song is about [...] "taking charge of [...] own life and not making up excuses for why life is such {{a pain in the}} ass sometime," [...] because La Torre believes that we <b>control</b> <b>our</b> own destiny, and are responsible for our own successes and failures. He has also said: [...] "It's about scenarios of despair, but people are finding the beauty in the very simple things in life." [...] Looking for [...] "some kind of resolver or conclusion" [...] to make the lyrics make sense, he came up with a chant: [...] "Magnetize what you conceptualize because your thoughts become things", a thought process based on the law of attraction from the book The Secret. The chant is repeated three times near the end of the song; La Torre says [...] "it used to build up even more" [...] in the original demo.|$|E
