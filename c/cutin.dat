5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a <b>cutin</b> containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the leaves are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{structural}} proteins (1-5%) {{are found}} in most plant cell walls; they are classified as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP), arabinogalactan proteins (AGP), glycine-rich proteins (GRPs), and proline-rich proteins (PRPs). Each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic, highly repetitive protein sequence. Most are glycosylated, contain hydroxyproline (Hyp) and become cross-linked in the cell wall. These proteins are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners. Cell walls of the epidermis may contain <b>cutin.</b> The Casparian strip in the endodermis roots and cork cells of plant bark contain suberin. Both <b>cutin</b> and suberin are polyesters that function as permeability barriers to the movement of water. The relative composition of carbohydrates, secondary compounds and proteins varies between plants and between the cell type and age. Plant cells walls also contain numerous enzymes, such as hydrolases, esterases, peroxidases, and transglycosylases, that cut, trim and cross-link wall polymers.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of cell walls varies between species and {{may depend on}} cell type and developmental stage. The primary cell wall of land plants is composed of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. Often, other polymers such as lignin, suberin or <b>cutin</b> are anchored to or embedded in plant cell walls. Algae possess cell walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides such as carrageenan and agar that are absent from land plants. In bacteria, the cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan. The cell walls of archaea have various compositions, and may be formed of glycoprotein S-layers, pseudopeptidoglycan, or polysaccharides. Fungi possess cell walls made of the glucosamine polymer chitin. Unusually, diatoms have a cell wall composed of biogenic silica.|$|E
50|$|Extraction {{procedures}} {{are bound to}} alter some of the chemical linkages present in the soil humic substances (mainly ester bonds in biopolyesters such as <b>cutins</b> and suberins). The humic extracts are composed {{of large numbers of}} different bio-organic molecules that have not yet been totally separated and identified. However, single classes of residual biomolecules have been identified by selective extractions and chemical fractionation, and are represented by alkanoic and hydroxy alkanoic acids, resins, waxes, lignin residues, sugars, and peptides.|$|R
40|$|Soil water {{repellency}} or hydrophobicity {{is a common}} and important soil property, which may diminish plant growth and promotes soil erosion leading to environmentally undesired situations. Hydrophobic organic compounds in the soil are derived from vegetation (leaves, roots, mosses) or microorganisms (fungi, bacteria), and these compounds induce soil {{water repellency}} (SWR) and can be called SWR-biomarkers. As common hydrophobic constituents of organic matter, plant lipids are mainly from wax layers of leaves and roots, whereas <b>cutins</b> and suberins as aliphatic biopolyesters occur in leaves and roots, respectively. Their unique compositions in soil can indicate the original vegetation sources. To investigate the individual or combined effects of the hydrophobic compounds on SWR and their possible associations with each other, we conducted experiments to analyse the organic composition of Dutch coastal dune sandy soils in relation to SWR. DCM/MeOH solvent is used to remove solvent soluble lipids. BF 3 -methanol is utilized to depolymerize <b>cutins</b> and suberins from isopropanol/NH 3 extractable organic matter. Total organic carbon (TOC) has a positive linear relation with SWR only for those soils containing low TOC (Effect of Plant-derived Hydrophobic Compounds on Soil Water Repellency in Dutch Sandy Soils - ResearchGate.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{distribution}} of some {{internal and external}} markers along the gastrointestinal tract of cattle was measured and used to estimate diet digestibility and transit time. On the day before slaughter, part of the cows' hay diet was replaced with chromium and ytterbium mordanted hay. The cows were subsequently slaughtered and their digestive tracts dissected and the contents analysed. Chromium concentrations along the gastrointestinal tract had a lower variability than ytterbium, as had the <b>cutins</b> {{in comparison with the}} lignin. The external markers always had lower concentrations than in the feed whilst the internal markers generally had higher concentrations. There was a general decrease of external and internal marker concentrations up to the small intestine; thereafter, internal markers increased and approximated the values observed in the rumen while the concentrations of the external markers remained lower than in the rumen. The estimated rumen rate of passage did not differ between lignin and <b>cutins,</b> with an average value of 0. 011 h- 1, but these were both significantly lower (P < 0. 01) than those estimated with external markers (0. 022 h- 1 and 0. 024 h- 1 for chromium and ytterbium, respectively). Calculated rumen digestibility showed significant variations between external and internal markers for crude protein and neutral detergent fibre (NDF), but not for dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) degradability; generally, data based on chromium or ytterbium gave higher degradation values in comparison with the internal markers. The rate of digestion (k(d)) digestibility values calculated at the abomasum were more variable and lower than values measured in the rumen. Total tract digestibility (measured at the second section of the colon) varied widely between markers for DM, OM, crude protein and NDF...|$|R
500|$|Unlike {{in animals}} (which lack chloroplasts), plants and their {{eukaryote}} relatives have delegated many biochemical roles to their chloroplasts, including synthesising all their fatty acids, and most amino acids.

2500|$|In {{the primary}} (growing) plant cell wall, the major {{carbohydrates}} are cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The cellulose microfibrils are linked via hemicellulosic tethers {{to form the}} cellulose-hemicellulose network, which {{is embedded in the}} pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose [...] in the primary cell wall is xyloglucan. In grass cell walls, xyloglucan and pectin are reduced in abundance and partially replaced by glucuronarabinoxylan, another type of hemicellulose. Primary cell walls characteristically extend (grow) by a mechanism called acid growth, which involves turgor-driven movement of the strong cellulose microfibrils within the weaker hemicellulose/pectin matrix, catalyzed by expansin proteins. The outer part of the primary cell wall of the plant epidermis is usually impregnated with <b>cutin</b> and wax, forming a permeability barrier known as the plant cuticle.|$|E

30|$|Humic {{substances}} (humics, HS) are refractory, dark-colored heterogeneous {{organic compounds}} {{produced in the}} decay of the total biota in the environment (Stevenson 1994). From the chemical point of view, they are a heterogeneous mixture of fragments of lignins, cellulose, suberins and <b>cutins.</b> Their unique structure makes them a versatile material with applications in industry, medicine, environmental protection, and agriculture. It is becoming clearer, {{that the presence of}} humics in soil is necessary for sustainable agriculture, due to their ability to condition the soil, enhance its stability and increase its resistance to erosion (Laker et al. 1993; Spaccini et al. 2002), ensure enhanced biological activity (Canellas et al. 2002; Canellas et al. 2008; Nardi et al. 2000 a, b; Zandonadi et al. 2007) and obtain higher crop yields (Antošová et al. 2008; Brownell et al. 1987; Eyheraguibel et al. 2008). In addition, humics have the ability to sequestrate soil pollutants (Evdokimov and von Wandruszka 1998; Sanjay et al. 1999; Senesi and Loffredo 2001; von Wandruszka 2000), and may be used in soil remediation (Fava et al. 2004; Stehlíčková et al. 2009; von Wandruszka 2000).|$|R
50|$|Crooked Pond is {{a typical}} coastal plain pond occupying a {{depression}} connected hydrologically to an underground aquifer; hence, the water level of the pond changes with the water table. The water level is usually high in winter and spring, and generally much lower by late summer, exposing the shoreline. Three other ponds, Island, Gunners Exchange and Hoyts, are within 1 km of Crooked Pond. The southeastern corner of Gunners Exchange Pond and parcels on Island Pond {{are part of the}} Refuge. The upland habitat surrounding ponds on the Refuge is a mix of pitch pine — scrub oak and coastal oak/heath forest. Common species include: red maple, pitch pine, white pine, and scrub oak. The under-story consists of highbush blueberry, low sweet blueberry, bearberry and greenbrier. Pitch pine scrub oak communities need fire to maintain the community structure and diversity. The resinous, waxy <b>cutins</b> in the leaves of many of the plant species found in this community are highly flammable and easily ignite during dry periods. Today the area is generally protected from fire, resulting in a closed-canopy pine forest.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA two-step {{off-line}} thermochemolysis {{was developed}} to characterize successively free and bound compounds in humic fractions from a wooded Sphagnum-dominated mire peat (Frasne, Jura Mountains, France). Two reactants with different strengths were used: hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) followed by tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Analysis of the thermolysates showed obvious {{differences between the two}} steps regarding the nature and/or the distribution of the numerous identified products. The first step with HMDS revealed the occurrence of thermolabile compounds and/or molecular units occurring initially in (bio) polymers susceptible to be cracked by HMDS, mostly carbohydrates and aromatics. The second step with TMAH released products resulting from the cracking of units with a relatively high thermal and/or chemical stability (monomers from biopolymers such as lignin and <b>cutins,</b> suberins or waxes). Two-step thermochemolysis thus appears as an interesting tool to help deciphering the composition, origin and nature of soil and sediment organic matter. Moreover, the comparison of the three humic substances fractions (fulvic acids, humic acids and humin) shows that a part of the analyzed compounds (lipids, aromatic and carbohydrates) were lost during this chemical fractionation...|$|R

40|$|Two {{centuries ago}} Heinrich Einhof {{developed}} the so-called Weende method (crude fibre), to first {{deals with the}} fibre content of the feeds for ruminants, and proposes to isolate a residue called the "crude fibre". Then, dietary fibre concepts evolve and differ in animal feeding compared to human nutrition and health. Animal nutritionists deal with various fibre sources, often from whole plants (forages, by products of seeds processing), and recover a larger range of polysaccharidic components, including other polymers, such polyphenolic (lignins, tannins) or polylipidic compounds (<b>cutins).</b> Dietary fibres are generally defined as polysaccharides and associated substances resistant to mammal enzyme digestion and absorption that can be partially or totally fermented in the gut. However, today this topic is still subjected to very active research, because {{of the complexity of}} the physical structure and chemical composition of the plant cell walls, and in the wide and different physiological effects of these different constituents.

40|$|Fungal {{decomposition}} of lignin {{leads to the}} whitening, or bleaching, of leaf litter, especially in temperate and tropical forests, but less is known about such bleaching in forests of cooler regions, such as boreal and subalpine forests. The purposes {{of the present study}} were to examine the extent of bleached area on the surface of leaf litter and its variation with environmental conditions in subboreal and subalpine forests in Japan and to examine the microfungi associated with the bleaching of leaf litter by isolating fungi from the bleached portions of the litter. Bleached area accounted for 21. 7 %- 32. 7 % and 2. 0 %- 10. 0 % of total leaf area of Quercus crispula and Betula ermanii, respectively, in subboreal forests, and for 6. 3 % and 18. 6 % of total leaf area of B. ermanii and Picea jezoensis var. hondoensis, respectively, in a subalpine forest. In subboreal forests, elevation, C/N ratio and pH of the FH layer, and slope aspect were selected as predictor variables for the bleached leaf area. Leaf mass per area and lignin content were consistently lower in the bleached area than in the nonbleached area of the same leaves, indicating that the selective {{decomposition of}} acid unhydrolyzable residue (recalcitrant compounds such as lignin, tannins, and <b>cutins)</b> enhanced the mass loss of leaf tissues in the bleached portions. Isolates of a total of 11 fungal species (6 species of Ascomycota and 5 of Basidiomycota) exhibited leaf-litter-bleaching activity under pure culture conditions.

40|$|Cytochrome P- 450 is not {{self-sufficient}} for the catalysis of monooxygenase reaction but re-quires NADPH and NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 (c) reductase. The {{activity of}} NADPH-cyto-chrome P- 450 reductase was strongly enhanced by wounding and aging in Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) tuber tissues. This stimulation {{was correlated with}} the synthesis of the enzyme protein based on i) quantitation of the reductase protein by Western blotting, ii) incor-poration of [35 S]methionine into the immunoprecipitable enzyme and iii) an increase in translatable mRNA for the reductase in a cell free system. Key words: Helianthus tuberosus — Immunoprecipitation — NADPH-cytochrome P 450 (c) reductase — In vitro translation — Western blot. Cytochrome P- 450 monooxygenases from higher plants are involved in important biosynthetic pathways: the production of hormones (Hasson and West 1976), lignins and flavonoids (Benveniste and Durst 1974, Potts et al. 1974, Grand 1984), phytoalexins (Fujita et al. 1982), <b>cutins</b> (Soliday and Kolattukudy 1977), suberins (Kolat-tukudy 1980), hydroxyfatty acids (Salaiin et al. 1978), sterols (Rahier and Taton 1986) and alkaloids (Madyastha et al. 1976). The activity of these monooxygenases is de-pendent upon the NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 (c) reductase (EC 1. 6. 2. 4) which provides the electrons necessary for the activation of oxygen at the heme center of the cytochrome. An interesting feature, common to these enzymes, is their sensitivity to environmental factors such as light (Benveniste et al. 1978), infections (Hagmann et al. 1984), wounding (Benveniste et al. 1977), and xenobiotics (Reichhart et al. 1979). As described previously, excision and aeration of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) tubers provoke the appearance of cytochrome P- 450 and of cytochrome P- 450 dependent cinnamic acid 4 -hydroxylase activity (Benveniste et al. 1977).

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of morphologically well-preserved cuticular {{remains of the}} Cretaceous Gymnosperm Squamastrobus tigrensis found in the Bajo Tigre locality (Patagonia) was analysed by a progressive chemical degradation sequence involving: (i) lipid extraction after ultrasonic treatments; (ii) further BF 3 -MeOH transesterification; and (iii) repeated mild NaBO 2 -H 2 O 2 degradation of the final residue. The compound assemblages released after the successive treatments were considered to reflect lipid speciation patterns in the different levels of the cuticular structure. In particular, after all the treatments, the dominance of a homologous series of α,ω-alkanedioic acids with maxima at C 9 and C 10 indicates a polymethylene network based on macromolecules; the units of this network contain in-chain unsaturations or substitutions in positions {{similar to those in}} precursor unsaturated C 16 and C 18 acids. The low yields of ω-hydroxyacids typical of <b>cutins</b> and suberins of extant plants are interpreted as an intense microbial alteration and/or diagenetic transformation of the fossil cuticle. In conjunction with data from infrared spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis, this suggests that the Squamastrobus remains consist of a macromolecular alkyl mixture in which the original C backbone has been defunctionalized, reoxidized, and subjected to additional condensation by the probable contribution of newly-formed, nonhydrolyzable bridges. It appears that this cellulose-lacking material includes a small moiety of altered lignin, and has been subjected to extensive oxidation, but not to further thermal alteration leading to decarboxylation. A possible result of this diagenetic alteration is that a portion of the resin constituents were transformed into lower molecular weight alkylbenzenes and alkylnaphthalenes, whereas another portion condensed into a very stable, nonhydrolyzable residue. The chemical stability of this residue is not due to aromatization, but to secondary condensation of altered aliphatic biomacromolecules. | The chemical deposition of morphologically well-preserved cuticular remains of the Cretaceous Gymnosperm Squamastrobus tigrensis found in the Bajo Tigre locality (Patagonia) was analyzed by a progressive chemical degradation sequence.
