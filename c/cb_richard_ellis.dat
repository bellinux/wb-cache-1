5|$|Lenders, {{including}} Bank of America, {{moved to}} foreclose on the retail and transit {{portion of the}} mixed-use development on October 19, 2009, because the developer, Joseph Freed and Associates LLC, ran out of money. Freed technically defaulted in March. With cost overruns exceeding $34million as of August 25, Freed owes $128.5million on a $205million construction loan, according to a lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court. On November 3, the developer announced it had landed 13 new tenants to open within the succeeding few months. On November 20, a circuit court judge stripped Freed of the development rights and turn the responsibility over to <b>CB</b> <b>Richard</b> <b>Ellis.</b> On the same day a partial occupancy permit for the underground pedway connecting the red line and the blue line {{as well as the}} first floor retail space was granted. Freed claimed that the loan payments were current and that the default was based on a technicality. As receiver, <b>CB</b> <b>Richard</b> <b>Ellis</b> was scheduled to file a status report with the court December 8 and a full report, including financials, on January 15, 2010. In March 2011, Bank of America acquired the $206 million property with a credit bid of $100 million at a sheriff's foreclosure sale. Then in February 2012, CIM Group was expected to close on a negotiated purchase of the entire 305,000-square-foot shopping center from Bank of America Corp.|$|E
5|$|Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have {{histories}} of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included {{the demolition of}} the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation groups did not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority {{to make up for}} a shortfall of over $100million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and <b>CB</b> <b>Richard</b> <b>Ellis</b> was named receiver.|$|E

2500|$|Luc Despins, the {{creditors}} committee counsel, said: [...] "The reason we're not objecting is really {{based on the}} lack of a viable alternative. We did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it." [...] In the amended agreement, Barclays would absorb US$47.4billion in securities and assume US$45.5billion in trading liabilities. Lehman's attorney Harvey R. Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said [...] "the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be US$1.29billion, including US$960million for Lehman's New York headquarters and US$330million for two New Jersey data centres. Lehman's original estimate valued its headquarters at US$1.02billion but an appraisal from <b>CB</b> <b>Richard</b> <b>Ellis</b> this week valued it at US$900million." [...] Further, Barclays will not acquire Lehman's Eagle Energy unit, but will have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. Finally, Lehman will retain US$20billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays. Barclays had a potential liability of US$2.5billion to be paid as severance, if it chooses not to retain some Lehman employees beyond the guaranteed 90 days.|$|E
