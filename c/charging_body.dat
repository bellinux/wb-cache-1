If such a source of a static field is {{accelerated}} (for example stopped) with regard to its formerly constant velocity frame, its distant field continues to be updated as though the <b>charged</b> <b>body</b> continued with constant velocity.

40|$|One {{can get the}} {{impression}} from the Reissner-Nordstrom solution of Einstein's equations that the <b>charge</b> of a <b>body</b> reduces its gravitational field. This looks surprising since {{the energy of the}} electrostatic field surrounding a <b>charged</b> <b>body,</b> must contribute positively, as an additional, "electromagnetic mass", to the gravitational field produced by the body. We resolve this puzzle by showing that the mass M in the Reissner-Nordstrom solution is not the "bare mass" of the body, but its "renormalized mass". I. e. M, in addition to the bare mass, includes the total electromagnetic mass of the body. But at finite distances from the body only a part of the electromagnetic mass contributes to the gravitational field. That is why the gravity of a <b>charged</b> <b>body</b> is determined by the quantity smaller than M.

As far as I recollect, it {{is assumed}} that no change will occur under such {{variation}} of circumstances, and that the relations of B find C to A depend entirely upon their distance. I only remember one experimental illustration of the question, and that is by Coulomb[A], in which he shows that a wire surrounded by shell-lac took exactly the same quantity of electricity from a <b>charged</b> <b>body</b> as the same wire in air. The experiment offered to me no proof of the truth of the supposition: for it is not the mere films of dielectric substances surrounding the <b>charged</b> <b>body</b> which have to be examined and compared, but the whole mass between that body and the surrounding conductors at which the induction terminates. Charge depends upon induction (1171. 1178.); and if induction is related to the particles of the surrounding dielectric, then it is related to all the particles of that dielectric inclosed by the surrounding conductors, and not merely to the few situated next to the <b>charged</b> <b>body.</b> Whether the difference I sought for existed or not, I soon found reason to doubt the conclusion that might be drawn from Coulomb's result; and therefore had the apparatus made, which, with its use, has been already described (1187, &c.), and which appears to me well-suited for the investigation of the question.|$|R
