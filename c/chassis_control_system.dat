DPC is a drivetrain and <b>chassis</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that works to regulate traction and especially correct over- and understeer by actively spreading out drive forces across the rear axle. Torque is distributed not only between {{the front and rear}} wheels (xDrive) but also from side to side at the rear, for improved agility and added stability (through the DPC rear axle).

A {{significant difference between the}} limited-slip differential systems listed above and this brake-based system, is that brake-based systems do not inherently send the greater torque to the slower wheel, plus the added brake friction material wear that results from the use of such a system if the vehicle is driven in an environment where the brake-based system will activate on a regular basis.|$|E

The Concours received real-time damping and Integrated <b>Chassis</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> ICCS as standard.

50|$|BMW's Dynamic Performance Control torque-vectoring {{system works}} in unison with xDrive all-wheel drive and Dynamic Stability Control. DPC is a {{drivetrain}} and <b>chassis</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> {{that works to}} regulate traction and especially correct over- and understeer by actively spreading out drive forces across the rear axle. Torque is split not only between the front axle and rear axle (xDrive), but also between wheels at the rear for improved agility and added stability (through the DPC rear axle). DPC works at all speeds and normal driving, not just during hard cornering, in order to steer the car. DPC also interfaces with DSC to initially try to correct the vehicle's path using torque vectoring which results in smooth turns, whereas DSC by itself would only reduce engine power and apply the brakes to steer the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|In recent days, {{mechatronic}} {{systems are}} getting integrated in vehicles ever more. While stability and safety {{systems such as}} ABS, ESP have pioneered the introduction of such systems in the modern day car, the lowered cost and increased computational power of electronics along with electrification of the various components has fuelled an increase in this trend. The availability of <b>chassis</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> onboard vehicles has been widely studied and exploited for augmenting vehicle stability. At the same time, for the context of high performance and luxury vehicles, <b>chassis</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> offer a vast and untapped potential to improve vehicle handling and the driveability experience. As performance objectives have not been studied {{very well in the}} literature, this thesis deals with the problem of <b>control</b> <b>system</b> design for various active <b>chassis</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> with performance as the main objective. A precursor to the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> design is having complete knowledge of the vehicle states, including those such as the vehicle sideslip angle and the vehicle mass, that cannot be measured directly. The first half of the thesis is dedicated to the development of algorithms for the estimation of these variables in a robust manner. While several estimation methods do exist in the literature, there is still some scope of research in terms of the development of estimation algorithms that have been validated on a test track with extensive experimental testing without using research grade sensors. The advantage of the presented algorithms is that they work only with CAN-BUS data coming from the standard vehicle ESP sensor cluster. The algorithms are tested rigorously under all possible conditions to guarantee robustness. The second half of the thesis deals with the design of the control objectives and controllers for the control of an active rear wheel steering system for a high performance supercar and a torque vectoring algorithm for an electric racing vehicle. With the use of an active rear wheel steering, the driver's confidence in the vehicle improves due a reduction in the lag between the lateral acceleration and the yaw rate, which allows drivers to push the vehicle harder on a racetrack without losing confidence in it. The torque vectoring algorithm controls the motor torques to improve the tire utilisation and increases the net lateral force, which allows professional drivers to set faster lap times...|$|R

40|$|The {{current work}} aims at {{bridging}} {{the gap between the}} current vehicle handling characteristics and the future demands of higher vehicle handling performance, required to guarantee higher safety and facilitate the application of autonomous driving, platooning and automated highways systems. For this task a state 'of the art vehicle <b>chassis</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> known as "Wheel Speed Distribution Control" (WSDC) has been proposed. WSDC in principle relies on controlling the vehicle driven wheel speeds to enforce better vehicle handling performance. The WSDC system capacity has been investigated using numerical simulation. Tberefore, an innovative vehicle handling simulation model has been developed from first principles. It employs the Magic Formula (MF) tyre model for combined slip, has 23 degrees of freedom and includes more than 60 vehicle handling parameters. The vehicle handling model has been developed using the novel Cartesian Geometric Translation (CGf) technique which employs geometry, trigonometry, Cartesian coordinates and finite difference approximation in the time domain to facilitate development of high speed models. The model has been built using the BASIC'O programming code in the DOS'O environment and optimised to meet the novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) based feedforward WSDC yaw rate controller requirements, such as small code size (less than 35 kb) and processing speed faster than real time. The simulation results validated the WSDC principles as it showed the capacity of WSDC to enforce the desired yaw rates, with acceptable driven wheel longitudinal forces. To put WSDC into practice,an original hardware" Wheel Speed Distribution Differential" (WSDD) design has been developed and optimised for lower speed, torque, power,production and maintenance requirements. It has the capacity to precisely differentiate the driven wheels speed under the influence of a DC motor with relatively small power requirements. It has linear speed and torque characteristics which facilitate its control. It also has been developed to allow many beneficial differential modes. The simulation results of the whole WSDC system have clearly demonstrated that it can in fact achieve its development target of feasibly enhancing vehicle handling performance.

40|$|Recently, mostly due {{to global}} warming {{concerns}} and high oil prices, electric vehicles have attracted {{a great deal of}} interest as an elegant solution to environmental and energy problems. In addition to the fact that electric vehicles have no tailpipe emissions and are more efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles, they represent more versatile platforms on which to apply advanced motion control techniques, since motor torque and speed can be generated and controlled quickly and precisely. 	The chassis control systems developed today are distinguished by the way the individual subsystems work in order to provide vehicle stability and control. However, the optimum driving dynamics can only be achieved when the tire forces on all wheels and in all three directions can be influenced and controlled precisely. This level of control requires that the vehicle is equipped with various chassis control systems that are integrated and networked together. Drive-by-wire electric vehicles with in-wheel motors provide the ideal platform for developing the required control system in such a situation. 	The focus of this thesis is to develop effective control strategies to improve driving dynamics and safety based on the philosophy of individually monitoring and controlling the tire forces on each wheel. A two-passenger electric all-wheel-drive urban vehicle (AUTO 21 EV) with four direct-drive in-wheel motors and an active steering system is designed and developed in this work. Based on this platform, an advanced fuzzy slip control system, a genetic fuzzy yaw moment controller, an advanced torque vectoring controller, and a genetic fuzzy active steering controller are developed, and the performance and effectiveness of each is evaluated using some standard test maneuvers. Finally, these control systems are integrated with each other by taking advantage of the strengths of each <b>chassis</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and by distributing the required control effort between the in-wheel motors and the active steering system.

40|$|Nowadays, every product {{manufacturing}} industry is continuously driven to develop innovative and sustainable products that differentiate through outstanding performance, customer satisfaction and appealing brand values. Intelligent, mechatronic systems are instrumental to accommodate this increasing demand for product quality, flexibility and customization. Since its intelligent nature {{is essentially the}} raison dëtre of a mechatronic system, {{it is crucial to}} have a seamless integration between the development cycles of the multi-physics hardware and the embedded controls software. In the current industrial practice, this connection is mainly realized by sharing closed, black-box simulation models of the physical design and the control software between departments, enabling the virtual verification of functional requirements long before a first physical prototype is built. This doctoral research demonstrates how model-based methodologies for control and estimation can extend the usage of system models beyond this simulation-based verification of requirements. On the basis of four industrially relevant applications, this thesis analyzes the capabilities of a model-based paradigm for control and estimation to accelerate controls development in the early stage of the design process and to expand the usage of system models into the products operational phase. In a first contribution, this dissertation studies how Model Predictive Control (MPC) techniques can accelerate the development process of a hydraulic active suspension system. A second contribution comprises an innovative estimation algorithm for the inertial properties of a road vehicle, which can be employed in an adaptive model-based <b>chassis</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Combining a control architecture based on Internal Model Control (IMC) with an identification procedure based on Experimental Modal Analysis, a third contribution proposes a vibration control system for a multi-axis hydraulic shaker platform, that is used in the aerospace industry for testing satellites. A final contribution demonstrates the value of MPC methodologies in the control architecture of autonomously driving road vehicles. By positioning model-based control in the industrial context of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), this doctoral research has created a clear interest from several industrial partners in model-based control and the underlying state-of-the-art methodologies. This transfer of state-of-the-art academic methodologies into state-of-the-use industry practice is fully in line with the objectives of the IWT-Baekeland mandate that has supported this doctoral research. 1.

If these systems are to achieve their full potential for improved safety, however, two critical issues must be resolved: (i) the design of a controller integrating all sub-control systems, and (ii) rigorous evaluation to ensure their functionalities. A decentralized design that coordinates the commands from sub-chassis <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> is achieved under the current business practice, in which suppliers provide OEMs with proprietary controllers. For effective coordination of sub-control commands and for avoidance of liability, the coordination strategy of saturating sub-control commands is used.

In this paper, a novel driver steering control model based on stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) is proposed to effectively incorporate the variations in the vehicle-road system parameters. The proposed SMPC-based driver steering control framework consists of three modules, namely perception, decision and execution, where a multi-point driver preview approach is employed. An internal vehicle dynamics model with the parameter uncertainty in road friction coefficient is formulated to represent the driver's knowledge and adaptation about the variations in road conditions.

In order to improve the precision of vehicle rollover prediction, a back-propagation neural network was adopted to regulate time to rollover online by considering multi-state parameters of the vehicle. Second, a rollover prevention algorithm based on integrated <b>chassis</b> <b>control</b> was investigated, where the active front steering and the active yaw moment control were coordinated by model predictive control methodology. Finally, the algorithms were evaluated under several typical maneuvers utilizing MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim co-simulation. The results show that the proposed neural network time-to-rollover metrics can be a good measure of the danger of rollover, and the roll stability of the simulated vehicle is improved significantly with reduced side slip angle and yaw rate by the proposed integrated <b>chassis</b> <b>control</b> rollover prevention <b>system...</b>|$|R
