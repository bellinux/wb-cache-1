5|$|The System Has Failed is {{the tenth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth. Released on September 14, 2004, {{it was the}} band's second and final studio album {{distributed}} by Sanctuary Records. The System Has Failed was the first album released after Mustaine recovered from his arm injury sustained in 2002 which prevented him from playing guitar. It is also {{the first of three}} Megadeth records not to include original bassist and co-founder David Ellefson. Instead, the album features session players, including former Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland on lead guitar. However, Poland only provided lead guitar parts and solos on a <b>contractual</b> <b>basis</b> and did not rejoin the band. To date, it is the only Megadeth album where the only certified member of the band was the sole Mustaine.|$|E
5|$|Australia having {{declared}} war on 3September 1939, the RAAF Air Board met in November to discuss Mary Bell's letter, but postponed taking any further action. Bell continued to lobby, as did various women's groups seeking to support the war effort and free male staff for overseas postings. In July 1940, the new Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, invited her to produce {{a proposal for a}} women's auxiliary, supervised by her husband John, who had rejoined the Air Force at the war's outbreak and was now a wing commander in the Directorate of Organisation at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Mary recommended forming the new service under the Air Force Act to permit women to enlist {{for the duration of the}} war under conditions similar to RAAF members, rather than enrolling on a short-term <b>contractual</b> <b>basis,</b> a radical idea at the time which would not be put in place until 1943. She also suggested a volunteer reserve or 'citizen' force to augment the enlisted women, effectively the existing WATC, though this was seen as placing too much emphasis on her personal command. Various senior Air Force officers, including the recently promoted Air Marshal Williams, and the Director of Personnel Services, Group Captain Joe Hewitt, opposed a women's service. Burnett, an RAF member who appreciated how the WAAF proved its worth during the Battle of Britain, championed its establishment as the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF).|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{staff at}} Square Enix works mainly from Japanese to English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, {{as well as}} Russian, Korean and Mandarin {{for a number of}} titles. In 2016, Final Fantasy XV became the first major title from the company to release in Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. Minor titles are occasionally localized from English to European languages. Prior to the merger of Square and Enix in 2003, Enix did not initially have a localization department and outsourced its Western releases to translators who had no close contact with the original development teams, as was the case for Dragon Quest VII. Square also did not initially have a localization department, though a number of localizers such as Kaoru Moriyama and Ted Woolsey worked with them regularly on a <b>contractual</b> <b>basis</b> in the early 1990s. Moriyama described the work at the time as leaving very little leeway for polishing text due to the limitations of the ROM sizes. She also commented Hironobu Sakaguchi was not willing to put extra work for the English version at that time. Following the massive international success of Final Fantasy VII, however, the company looked into improving the quality of its translated products-the game was widely criticized for its rushed English translation, which had been handled entirely by Michael Baskett, the company's only in-house translator at the time. To that end, Square tasked Richard Honeywood, originally a programmer, with creating a dedicated localization team in the Tokyo headquarters. His first major project was Xenogears. While there were only two members at first, including Honeywood, the staff grew to include more than 40 employees by 2007, and over 70 in 2015. The success of Final Fantasy VII also {{led to the creation of}} a London-based European office in 1998, which would handle marketing and quality assurance for the PAL market.|$|E

40|$|SHG-Banking is a {{programme}} {{that helps}} to promote financial transactions between the formal rural banking system in India comprising {{of public and private}} sector commercial banks, regional rural banks and cooperative banks with the informal Self Help Groups(SHGs) as clients (SHGs are financial intermediaries owned by the poor). They usually start by making voluntary thrift on a regular mostly fortnightly or monthly <b>basis</b> (<b>contractual</b> savings). They use this pooled resource (as quasi-Equity) together with the external bank loan to provide interest bearing loans to their members. Such loan provides additional liquidity or purchasing power for use in any of the borrower's production, investment or consumption activities. The main focus of the study is on the performance of SHG Bank linkages on women and also sees how the effective measures adopted by the government and banks have enabled the women to raise their standard of living. The study also focused on the economic impact of Self- Help Groups with reference to; capital formation through savings mobilization, credit – savings ratio, interest rates and repayment performance,...|$|R
40|$|Governments in many {{countries}} -at all levels of development- struggle with increasing budget deficits and soaring national debts. Over the last century, government spending, {{as a percentage of}} gross domestic product has tended to increase and with it has increased the range of services offered by governments and the volume of public procurement resulting from it. The growth in public procurement has been accompanied by a growth in public procurement legislation. As the public sector grew, a need made itself to seek assistance form the private sector to provide public services on a <b>contractual</b> and sub-contractual <b>basis.</b> In various countries, especially those characterized by a civil law system, government contracts took on a peculiar nature, distinct from private contracts constituting a distinct legal category, separated form private contracts rules concerning contract formation, termination, settlement of disputes and other situations. As public procurement grew in volume and value, so did its importance to employment and the national economy. In most countries, the early procurement laws were protective of domestic industry. At the same time, competition for public business grew among nationals in step with the growth of public expenditure devoted to procurement of goods and services. These laws recognized the right of nationals to be treated equally, to have equal access to public contracts. As a result, the standard method of procurement would consist in an advertised opportunity for all interested firms to bid for public contracts on auction basis...|$|R

25|$|A {{shortage}} of High Court judges {{led to an}} amendment to Article 94 of the Constitution in 1971 to permit the appointment of supernumerary judges. These were judges who were engaged to continue their duties on a <b>contractual</b> <b>basis</b> after having reached the constitutionally-mandated retirement age of 65. A subsequent amendment to the Constitution created the position of judicial commissioner. This amendment took effect on 4 May 1979.|$|E

25|$|After the 1970s {{oil boom}} in the Middle East, {{numerous}} Indians emigrated to work in Persian Gulf countries. This work was done on a <b>contractual</b> <b>basis</b> rather than permanently as in the 19th century cases. The countries in the Persian Gulf have a common policy of not naturalising non-Arabs, {{even if they are}} born there. Some Persian Gulf nations grant citizenship if the family has lived there for many generations or years. Two examples are Kuwait and the UAE.|$|E

25|$|Initially Diamond-Star Motors was a 50-50 {{joint venture}} between Chrysler and Mitsubishi. However, in 1991 the Japanese company {{purchased}} its partner's interest, and thereafter the manufacture of Chrysler vehicles was on a <b>contractual</b> <b>basis.</b> Chrysler sold its equity stake to Mitsubishi in 1993, and Diamond-Star Motors was renamed to Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA) on July 1, 1995. Despite the departure, the two companies have maintained various co-operative manufacturing agreements since and considered all vehicle produced until 1995 as Diamond Star Motors.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Chrysler {{sold its}} equity stake in Diamond-Star Motors to its partner, {{and from then}} on they {{continued}} to share components and manufacturing on a <b>contractual</b> <b>basis</b> only.

Senior officers from the U.S. Pacific Command observed the annual Han Kuang military exercises in 2005. The US also upgraded its military liaison position in Taipei from a position held by retired officers hired on a <b>contractual</b> <b>basis</b> to one held by an active duty officer the same year. The US remains committed to protecting Taiwan from PRC attack, though not if Taiwan were to declare formal independence first – Washington has stated it will not back such a declaration with military support.|$|E
500|$|On 20 November 1939, the RAAF formed No.1 Group in Melbourne, which {{evolved into}} Southern Area Command early in 1940 with Hewitt as senior {{administration}} staff officer. Having been promoted group captain, {{he was made}} Director of Personnel Services (DPS) after completing his posting to Southern Area, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 11July. Described as having [...] "a Calvinist background and rigid ideas on women's place in society", as DPS he opposed {{the creation of the}} Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) and later advocated that its members be enrolled on a <b>contractual</b> <b>basis</b> rather than enlisted or commissioned as Permanent Air Force staff. In 1941, Hewitt became Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, before being assigned in April the following year to the newly formed Allied Air Forces Headquarters (AAFHQ), South West Pacific Area (SWPA), as Director of Intelligence. He established cordial working relations with his American peers at AAFHQ, becoming a confidant of its commander, Major General George Kenney.|$|E
500|$|LoPiccolo {{composed}} the game's score—called [...] "dark", [...] "electronic" [...] and [...] "cyberpunk" [...] by the Boston Herald—on a Macintosh computer and inexpensive synthesizer, using Audio Vision. It dynamically changes {{according to the}} player's actions, a decision made {{in keeping with the}} team's focus on emergent gameplay. Each track was [...] "written at three different intensity levels", which change depending on the player's nearness to enemies; and certain events, such as victory in combat, trigger special music. The game's tracks were composed of four-bar segments that could be rearranged dynamically in reaction to game events, with [...] "melodies through-composed on top". LoPiccolo noted that, when using this method, it is necessary to write music that [...] "still flows with the overall theme and doesn't jump around". Because the score was closely tied to the gameplay, LoPiccolo had to work closely with Church and Rob Fermier, the latter of whom wrote the [...] "interactive scoring module" [...] that allowed for dynamic music. After recording the music, LoPiccolo recorded all of the game's sound effects. He later recalled visiting an automobile repair shop with [...] "portable recorder and a mic", and [...] "having [...] mechanic [...] hit things with wrenches and so forth, just to get the raw material". He developed the game's audio over 16 months, working on a <b>contractual</b> <b>basis</b> until Tribe disbanded in May 1994; Ned Lerner gave him a full-time job as audio director the next day. Tim Ries {{composed the}} [...] "Elevator" [...] music.|$|E

[...] "We believe that the possibility of inadvertently punishing someone for exercising her First Amendment rights makes such care necessary." [...] She then addressed Stevens' claim in dissent that this was less protection than the Court had required for lesser rights. [...] "We have never held that it is a violation of the Constitution for a government employer to discharge an employee based on substantively incorrect information. Where an employee has a property interest in her job, the only protection we have found the Constitution gives her is a right to adequate procedure." ...|$|E
60|$|What, then, was the {{substance}} of this Contract to which the Allies had bound themselves? An examination of the documents shows that, although {{a large part of}} the Addresses is concerned with spirit, purpose, and intention, and not with concrete solutions, and that many questions requiring a settlement in the Peace Treaty are not touched on, nevertheless, there are certain questions which they settle definitely. It is true that within somewhat wide limits the Allies still had a free hand. Further, it is difficult to apply on a <b>contractual</b> <b>basis</b> those passages which deal with spirit, purpose, and intention;--every man must judge for himself whether, in view of them, deception or hypocrisy has been practised. But there remain, as will be seen below, certain important issues on which the Contract is unequivocal.|$|E
