25|$|<b>Conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> {{begins with}} some stressor, trauma, or {{psychological}} distress. Usually the physical {{symptoms of the}} syndrome affect the senses or movement. Common symptoms include blindness, partial or total paralysis, inability to speak, deafness, numbness, difficulty swallowing, incontinence, balance problems, seizures, tremors, and difficulty walking. These symptoms are attributed to <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> when a medical explanation for the afflictions cannot be found. Symptoms of <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> usually occur suddenly. <b>Conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> is typically seen in individuals aged 10 to 35, and affects between 0.011% and 0.5% of the general population.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> {{presents}} {{with symptoms}} that typically resemble a neurological disorder such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy or hypokalemic periodic paralysis. The neurologist must carefully exclude neurological disease, through examination and appropriate investigations. However, {{it is not}} uncommon for patients with neurological disease to also have <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{the number of}} women {{diagnosed}} with female hysteria sharply declined. This decline has been attributed to many factors. Some medical authors claim that the decline was due to laypeople gaining a greater understanding of the psychology behind <b>conversion</b> <b>disorders</b> such as hysteria.|$|R
25|$|ICD-10 classifies <b>conversion</b> <b>{{disorder}}</b> as a {{dissociative disorder}} while DSM-IV classifies it as a somatoform disorder.|$|E
25|$|Empirical {{studies have}} found that the {{prognosis}} for <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> varies widely, with some cases resolving in weeks, and others enduring for years or decades. There is also evidence that there is no cure for <b>Conversion</b> <b>Disorder,</b> and that although patients may go into remission, they can relapse at any point. Furthermore, many patients who are 'cured' continue to have some degree of symptoms indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Much {{recent work}} has been done to {{identify}} the underlying causes of conversion and related disorders and to better understand why conversion and hysteria appear more commonly in women. Current theoreticians tend to believe that there is no single cause for these disorders. Instead, the emphasis tends to be on the individual understanding of the patient and a variety of therapeutic techniques. In some cases, the onset of <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> correlates to a traumatic or stressful event. There are also certain populations that are considered at risk for <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder,</b> including people suffering from a medical illness or condition, people with personality disorder, and individuals with dissociative identity disorder. However, no biomarkers have yet been found to support the idea that <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> is caused by a psychiatric condition.|$|E

25|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology explanation for <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> {{is that the}} symptoms may have been evolutionarily advantageous during warfare. A non-combatant with these symptoms signals non-verbally, possibly to someone speaking a different language, that she or he is not dangerous as a combatant and also may be carrying some form of dangerous infectious disease. This can explain that <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> may develop following a threatening situation, {{that there may be}} a group effect with many people simultaneously developing similar symptoms (as in mass psychogenic illness), and the gender difference in prevalence.|$|E

"several {{types of}} disease known as somatoform disorders, in which somatic {{symptoms}} appear either without any organic disorder or without organic damage that {{can account for}} {{the severity of the}} symptoms. ...

The third type, pain disorder, involves sensation either {{in the absence of an}} organic problem or in excess of actual physical damage." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Conversion</b> <b>disorders</b> {{are defined}} as {{neurological}} symptoms arising without organic damage to the nervous system, presumably in relation to various emotional stress factors, but the exact neural substrates of these symptoms and the mechanisms responsible for their production remain poorly understood. In the past 15 years, novel insights have been gained {{with the advent of}} functional neuroimaging studies in patients suffering from <b>conversion</b> <b>disorders</b> in both motor and non-motor (e. g. somatosensory, visual) domains. Several studies have also compared brain activation patterns in conversion to those observed during hypnosis, where similar functional losses can be evoked by suggestion. The current review summarizes these recent results and the main neurobiological hypotheses proposed to account for conversion symptoms, in particular motor deficits. An emerging model points to an important role of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), precuneus, and perhaps other limbic structures (including amygdala), all frequently found to be hyperactivated in <b>conversion</b> <b>disorders</b> in parallel to impaired recruitment of primary motor and/or sensory pathways at the cortical or subcortical (basal ganglia) level. These findings are only partly shared with hypnosis, where increases in precuneus predominate, together with activation of attentional control systems, but without any activation of VMPFC. Both VMPFC and precuneus are key regions for access to internal representations about the self, integrating information from memory and imagery with affective relevance (in VMPFC) and sensory or agency representations (in precuneus). It is therefore postulated that conversion deficits might result from an alteration of conscious sensorimotor functions and self-awareness under the influence of affective and sensory representations generated in these regions, which might promote certain patterns of behaviors in response to self-relevant emotional states...|$|R
25|$|In <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> (previously called hysteria), a {{neurological}} deficit appears with no organic cause. The patient, again, is truly experiencing the symptoms and signs {{and has no}} intention to deceive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> (CD) is a {{diagnostic}} category {{used in some}} psychiatric classification systems. It is sometimes applied to patients who present with neurological symptoms, such as numbness, blindness, paralysis, or fits, which are not consistent with a well-established organic cause, which cause significant distress, and {{can be traced back}} to a psychological trigger. It is thought that these symptoms arise in response to stressful situations affecting a patient's mental health or an ongoing mental health condition such as depression. <b>Conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> was retained in DSM-5, but given the subtitle functional neurological symptom disorder. The new criteria cover the same range of symptoms, but remove the requirements for a psychological stressor to be present and for feigning to be disproved.|$|E
25|$|Misdiagnosis does {{sometimes}} occur. In {{a highly}} influential {{study from the}} 1960s, Eliot Slater demonstrated that misdiagnoses had occurred in one third of his 112 patients with <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder.</b> Later authors {{have argued that the}} paper was flawed, however, and a meta-analysis has shown that misdiagnosis rates since that paper was published are around 4%, the same as for other neurological diseases.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a short {{historical}} perspective on the neurophysiological approach to hysteria and <b>conversion</b> <b>disorders.</b> The body of this paper will be constituted of three main parts. In the first part, we will present the significant progress due to some pioneers of neurology/psychiatry during the XIXth century. As we shall see, this period was particularly rich in personalities whose work gradually laid the foundations to a true medical approach to hysteria. In the first half of the XXth century, different factors have led to a long eclipse of the neurological approach to hysteria. In the second part, we will show how, by the 1960 's- 1970 's, the conceptual and methodological advances in neurophysiology, as well as the turning point of cognitive sciences (and cognitive psychology in particular) allowed agradual reinstatement of hysteria within the fields of neurology and clinical neurophysiology. Finally, and this is the third part of this paper, we will show how over the past three decades, an entirely new neurophysiological approach to hysteria and <b>conversion</b> <b>disorders</b> has emerged...|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, {{there was a}} general {{acceptance}} that emotionally traumatic experiences could cause long-term disorders which might display a variety of symptoms. These <b>conversion</b> <b>disorders</b> were found to occur in even the most resilient individuals, but with profound effect in someone with emotional instability like Louis Vivet (1863-?) who suffered a traumatic experience as a 17-year-old when he encountered a viper. Vivet was the subject of countless medical papers and became the most studied case of dissociation in the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|There are {{problems}} with classification, diagnosis and therapeutic strategies of dissociative and <b>conversion</b> <b>disorders</b> {{which can be}} understood by the historic context of hysteria. Even current systems used to diagnose DD such as the DSM-IV and ICD-10 differ {{in the way the}} classification is determined. In most cases mental health professionals are still hesitant to diagnose patients with Dissociative Disorder, because before they are considered to be diagnosed with Dissociative Disorder these patients have more than likely been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety disorder, and most often post-traumatic disorder.|$|R
25|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence-based}} treatment of <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder.</b> Other treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, EMDR, and psychodynamic psychotherapy, EEG brain biofeedback need further trials. Psychoanalytic treatment may possibly be helpful. However, most studies assessing {{the efficacy of}} these treatments are of poor quality and larger, better controlled studies are urgently needed. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy {{is the most common}} treatment, however boasts a mere 13% improvement rate.|$|E
25|$|An {{accurate}} diagnosis may {{be difficult}} {{because of the way}} the disorder manifests itself. Sufferers may be diagnosed as having similar and perhaps related disorders including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, carpal tunnel syndrome, TMD, Tourette's syndrome, <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> or other neuromuscular movement disorders. It has been found that the prevalence of dystonia is high in individuals with Huntington's disease, where the most common clinical presentations are internal shoulder rotation, sustained fist clenching, knee flexion, and foot inversion. Risk factors for increased dystonia in patients with Huntington's disease include long disease duration and use of antidopaminergic medication.|$|E
500|$|The anxiety induced in Christian Shaw by Catherine Campbell's curse {{may have}} brought on a <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder</b> {{in the young}} girl, the modern name for what was once known as hysteria.

40|$|Focusing on a {{systemic}} view of <b>conversion</b> <b>disorders,</b> {{this paper presents}} a particular system of family and couple interactive patterns that we have called narrative relationships. This theoretical framework is illustrated through a case example and the verbatim transcript of a hypnotic couple session, in order to demonstrate how systemic psychotherapy and Ericksonian hypnotherapy can happily meet and perfectly integrate. The hypnosystemic approach {{is based on the}} assumption that patterns of behaviour that take place in a family or couple system are not independent from the individual thinking of its members, and vice versa. <b>Conversion</b> <b>disorders</b> seem to be the context in which the individual and family drama provide the greatest evidence, to the point of making the story prevail over any subjective or intersubjective authenticity. The narrative relationship is characterized by: (1) communication patterns centred on the presence of 'secrets'; (2) a fantastic and dramatizing facade built on everyday life events; and (3) a pervasive tendency to transform all experiences into a narrative to be told continuously to interested and unconcerned listeners. The results of our clinical experience confirm that the therapeutic intervention demonstrates effectiveness mostly when the basic conflict and the symbolism embedded in the disorder is understood in terms of a specific system of relations. © 2011 British Society of Clinical and Academic Hypnosis...|$|R
25|$|The {{person may}} not {{remember}} what actually happened, while emotions experienced during the trauma may be re-experienced without the person understanding why (see Repressed memory).

500|$|Affect is {{described}} by labelling the apparent emotion conveyed by the person's nonverbal behavior (anxious, sad etc.), and also by using the parameters of appropriateness, intensity, range, reactivity and mobility. Affect may be described as appropriate or inappropriate to the current situation, and as [...] or [...] with their thought content. For example, someone who shows a bland affect when describing a very distressing experience would be described as showing incongruent affect, which might suggest schizophrenia. The intensity of the affect may be described as normal, blunted affect, exaggerated, flat, heightened or overly dramatic. A flat or blunted affect is associated with schizophrenia, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder; heightened affect might suggest mania, and an overly dramatic or exaggerated affect might suggest certain personality disorders. Mobility refers {{to the extent to}} which affect changes during the interview: the affect may be described as fixed, mobile, immobile, constricted/restricted or labile. The person may show a full range of affect, in other words a wide range of emotional expression during the assessment, or may be described as having restricted affect. The affect may also be described as reactive, in other words changing flexibly and appropriately with the flow of conversation, or as unreactive. A bland lack of concern for one's disability may be described as showing la belle indifférence, a feature of <b>conversion</b> <b>disorder,</b> which is historically termed [...] "hysteria" [...] in older texts.|$|E
