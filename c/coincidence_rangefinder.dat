500|$|Jean Bart was {{refitted}} again between 7 August 1929 and 29 September 1931. This {{was much}} more extensive than her earlier refit as another set of boilers was converted to oil-firing, her direct-drive cruising turbines were replaced by geared turbines and her fire-control systems were comprehensively upgraded. A large cruiser-type fire-control director was added atop the foremast with a 4.57-m <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder</b> and a [...] stereo rangefinder. The rangefinder above the conning tower {{was replaced by a}} duplex unit carrying two 4.57-m rangefinders and another 4.57-m rangefinder was added in an armoured hood next to the main mast.

Her condition was poor enough that she was not thought to be worth the expense of a third refit like those her sisters were given. She was hulked, disarmed and became a harbour training ship in 1936. She was renamed Océan that year to free her name for use by the new [...] then being constructed.|$|E

500|$|Finding the British Barr & Stroud <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder</b> design {{superior}} to existing French designs, the Dantons mounted {{a pair of}} [...] FQ rangefinders atop the conning tower and a [...] rangefinder on each turret top {{for use by the}} turret commanders. Integrating these into the overall fire-control system took some time so eight Ponthus & Therrode stadimeters, which required knowledge of the target's mast height and overall length, were used in the interim. During the war, the rangefinders were replaced by longer, more precise instrument. A triple [...] model was installed above the conning tower and 2-meter models replaced the smaller ones on the turret roofs.|$|E
500|$|Asahi, {{like all}} the other Japanese battleships of the time, was fitted with four Barr and Stroud FA3 <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinders</b> that had an {{effective}} range of [...] The ships were also fitted with 24-power magnification telescopic gunsights.|$|R
50|$|Other devices measure {{distance}} using trigonometry (stadiametric rangefinders and parallax, or <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinders).</b> Older methodologies {{that use}} {{a set of}} known information, usually distances or target sizes, to make the measurement, have been in regular use since the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with two Barr and Stroud <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinders</b> that used two images {{that had to}} be {{superimposed}} to derive the range. The gunnery officer then calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target and transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each turret.|$|R
500|$|The control {{positions}} {{for the main}} armament were located in the spotting tops {{at the head of}} the fore and mainmasts. Data from a [...] Barr and Stroud <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder</b> located at each control position was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into elevation and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations, and control positions could be connected in almost any combination.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{plan was}} to fit each ship with a {{director}} that fed data to the Mle 1923B electro-mechanical fire-control computer, but development was protracted {{and it was not}} ready in time for the first four ships. They were fitted with the simpler Mle 1919 type aviso mechanical computer; only Léopard and Lynx had the Mle 1923B computer upon completion. The earlier ships had their Mle 1919 computers replaced by the later computer beginning in 1927. Development of the director was abandoned and the ships were fitted with a [...] Mle B.1926 <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder</b> that fed data to the computers. This was replaced by a stereoscopic rangefinder in 1931 and by a [...] PC.1936 model from 1937.|$|E
500|$|The main guns of the battleships {{could be}} {{controlled}} {{from any of the}} two director-control towers (DCT). The primary DCT was mounted {{at the top of the}} forward superstructure. Another was mounted on the roof of the conning tower in an armoured hood. Each main gun turret was provided with a [...] <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder</b> in an armoured housing on the turret roof. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by two DCTs mounted on each side of the bridge. The anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a high-angle control system mounted on the mizzenmast. Each pom-pom mount had its own director and there was also a height-finder aft. Two [...] torpedo rangefinders were located on the sides of the funnels.|$|E

500|$|Two Type 94 fire-control directors, one {{atop the}} bridge and the other abaft the funnel, {{were going to be}} fitted to control the main guns. They used range data {{received}} from three [...] <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinders.</b> Two of these were to be installed in turrets Nos. 3 and 4 while the primary rangefinder was mounted above the bridge. A pair of Type 94 high-angle directors, one {{on each side of the}} bridge, were intended to control the Type 89 guns. Each director was fitted with a [...] rangefinder. The 25mm guns would have been controlled by two Type 95 directors mounted on the bridge.|$|R
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. <b>Coincidence</b> <b>rangefinders</b> used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|R
500|$|The control {{positions}} {{for the main}} armament were located in the spotting tops {{at the head of}} the fore and mainmasts. Data from a [...] Barr and Stroud <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder,</b> located at each control position, was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations, and control positions could be connected in almost any combination. As a back up, two turrets in each ship could take over if necessary.|$|E
500|$|Paris {{received}} {{the first of}} her upgrades at Brest between 25 October 1922 and 25 November 1923. This included replacing one set of boilers with oil-fired boilers, increasing the maximum elevation of the main armament from 12° to 23°, removal of her bow armour to make her less bow-heavy, the installation of a fire-control director, with a [...] rangefinder, and the exchange of her Mle 1897 AA guns for Mle 1918 guns. After her return to service she supported an amphibious landing at Al Hoceima by Spanish troops {{during the summer of}} 1925 after the Rifs attacked French Morocco during the Third Rif War. She destroyed coastal defence batteries there despite taking light damage from six hits and remained there until October as the flagship of the French forces. She was refitted again from 16 August 1927 to 15 January 1929 at Toulon and her fire-control systems were comprehensively upgraded. A large cruiser-type fire-control director was added atop the foremast with a 4.57-m <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder</b> and a [...] stereo rangefinder. The rangefinder above the conning tower was replaced by a duplex unit carrying two 4.57-m rangefinders and another 4.57-m rangefinder was added in an armoured hood next to the main mast. Two directors for the secondary guns were added on the navigation bridge, each with a [...] <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder.</b> A [...] rangefinder was added to the roof of 'B' turret, the second one from the bow. Three [...] rangefinders were provided for her anti-aircraft guns, {{one on top of the}} duplex unit on the conning tower, one on 'B' turret and one in the aft superstructure. She resumed her role as flagship of the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Squadron until 1 October 1931 when she became a training ship.|$|E

5|$|The Borodino {{class were}} {{originally}} fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the crow's nest, {{to estimate the}} range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He then transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret. While fitting out, these rangefinders were replaced on the first four ships by two Barr and Stroud <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinders</b> that used two images {{that had to be}} superimposed to derive the range. Perepelkin telescopic sights were also installed for their guns, but their crews were not trained in how to use them.|$|R
2500|$|T-72 [...] "Ural" [...] (Ob'yekt 172M) (1973): Original version, {{armed with}} 125mm D-81TM smoothbore tank gun. Unlike the later {{versions}} {{it had the}} searchlight mounted on left. It also has flipper type armour panels. It had the TPD-2-49 <b>coincidence</b> optical <b>rangefinder</b> sight protruding from its turret.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1890s, {{it was thought}} that around 3 to 4 miles would be the norm for {{battleship}} engagements. Although 305 mm/40 caliber guns were quite capable of reaching out to the ranges that the Yellow Sea battle had opened up with (8 miles), the lack of effective range-finders and gun sights forced practical 305 mm (12 inch) gunfire to be held within a 3 to 4 mile range. During the battle, Russian battleships had Liuzhol Rangefinders with a range out to 4,000 m, while Japanese pre-dreadnoughts had the latest (1903) Barr and Stroud <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinders,</b> which had a range of 6,000 m. Notwithstanding all of the above, the world was quite surprised after the opponents opened fire upon one another while still over 8 miles apart.|$|R
500|$|The main guns of the G3 battlecruisers {{could be}} {{controlled}} {{from any of the}} three director-control towers (DCT). The primary DCT was mounted {{at the top of the}} forward superstructure. Another was mounted on the roof of the conning tower in an armoured hood and the third was aft. Each main gun turret was provided with a [...] <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder</b> in an armoured housing on the turret roof. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by three DCTs. Two mounted on each side of the bridge and the third was aft. The anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a high-angle control system mounted on the very top of the forward superstructure. Each pom-pom mount had its own director and there was also a height-finder aft. Two [...] torpedo rangefinders were located on the sides of the funnels.|$|E
500|$|The control {{position}} for the main armament were located in the spotting tops {{at the head of}} the foremast. Data from a [...] Barr and Stroud <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder</b> located there was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations, and {{control position}}s could be connected in almost any combination. By 1912, another nine-foot rangefinder was added at the forward side of the compass platform. In late 1914, more nine-foot rangefinders, protected by armoured hoods, were installed on the turret roofs.|$|E
500|$|Sea trials {{with the}} battlecruiser [...] {{showed that the}} {{placement}} of the fore funnel between the forward superstructure and the foremast meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the forward boilers were alight and that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind. The King George V class also used the same arrangement and they were altered while under construction to remedy the problem at a cost of approximately £20,000 per ship. The fore funnel was moved aft and a makeshift foremast was built from one of the struts of the original tripod mast. The spotting tower {{at the rear of the}} conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, and the <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder</b> was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower.|$|E
2500|$|T-72 [...] "Ural" [...] modernization. Large {{numbers of}} early T-72 {{production}} models were modernized in 1980s. The modernization included placing the search {{light on the}} right-hand-side of main armament, blanking off the TPD-2-49 <b>coincidence</b> optical <b>rangefinder</b> and fitting of rubber skirts protecting the tracks instead of the flipper type armor panels.|$|R
50|$|Some {{sophisticated}} 20th century cameras {{with direct}} viewfinders had <b>coincidence</b> (split-image) <b>rangefinders,</b> initially with separate windows from the viewfinder, later integrated with it; {{they were called}} rangefinder cameras. Cameras with interchangeable lenses had to indicate {{the field of view}} of each lens in the viewfinder; more usually, interchangeable viewfinders to match the lenses were used.|$|R
500|$|Trento and Trieste {{were armed}} with a main battery of eight [...] Mod 24 50-caliber guns in four gun turrets; each turret carried the guns in a single cradle rather than {{independent}} mounts.

50|$|Original version, {{armed with}} 125 mm smoothbore tank gun and optical <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{coincidence}} {{range finder}} uses a single eyepiece. Light {{from the target}} enters the range finder through two windows located {{at either end of}} the instrument. At either side the incident beam is reflected to the center of the optical bar by a pentaprism. The optical bar is ideally made from a material with a low coefficient of thermal expansion so that optical path lengths do not change significantly with temperature. This reflected beam first passes through an objective lens and is then merged with the beam of the opposing side with an ocular prism sub-assembly to form two images of the target which are viewed by the observer through the eyepiece. Since either beam enters the instrument at a slightly different angle the resulting image, if unaltered, will appear blurry. Therefore, in one arm of the instrument a compensator is adjusted by the operator to tilt the beam until the two images match. At this point the images are said to be in coincidence. The degree of rotation of the compensator determines the range to the target by simple triangulation. <b>Coincidence</b> <b>rangefinders</b> made by Barr and Stroud used two eyepieces, and may be confused with stereoscopic units. The second eyepiece showed the operator a range scale so the user could range and read the range scale simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Trento and Trieste {{were armed}} with a main battery of eight 203 mm Mod 24 50-caliber guns in four gun turrets; each turret carried the guns in a single cradle rather than {{independent}} mounts. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft, and allowed for elevation to 45 degrees, for a maximum range of 30000 yd. They had a rate of fire of three rounds per minute, and the guns had to reset to 15 degrees to reload. The turrets were electrically operated, including the training and elevation gear and the ammunition hoists. The guns suffered from excessive shell dispersion, like many other Italian guns of the period. Initially supplied with 125 kg shells fired at a muzzle velocity of 905 m/s, the shells and propellant charges were reduced - to 118 kg at 840 m/s - in an unsuccessful attempt to tighten shell grouping. The problem was in large part due to poor quality control in Italian munition factories, which failed to ensure tight manufacturing tolerances necessary for accurate shells. In addition, the single cradle mounts required the guns to be very close together; this caused the shells to interfere {{with each other in}} flight and contributed to the dispersion problem. Fire control was provided by a pair of Barr & Stroud 5 m <b>coincidence</b> <b>rangefinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stadiametric range-finders were {{successively}} {{replaced by}} <b>coincidence</b> and laser <b>rangefinders.</b> Accuracy of modern tank guns is improved over earlier weapons by computerized fire control systems, wind sensors, and muzzle referencing systems which compensate for barrel warping, wear and temperature.
