The kinetic {{parameters}} of Huadian oil shale and its solid residues <b>after</b> <b>preheating</b> treatment at different temperatures {{were evaluated by}} thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. As per distinct properties of oil shale, TG curves were divided into five separate stages during pyrolysis. The kinetic parameters were calculated based on TG results related to three stages ranging from 250 to 550 °C, using the Arrhenius theory and Coats-Redfern and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa methods. The {{results showed that the}} burning of oil shale and its solid residues was a complicated multi-step kinetic process. The activation energies of residues were reduced <b>after</b> <b>preheating</b> treatment below 300 °C. Moreover, the activation energies calculated from the Coats-Redfern method increased with increasing heating rate...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} fully {{nonlinear}} {{study of the}} development of equilibrium <b>after</b> <b>preheating.</b> Preheating is the exponentially rapid transfer of energy from the nearly homogeneous inflaton field to fluctuations of other fields and/or the inflaton itself. This rapid transfer leaves these fields in a highly nonthermal state with energy concentrated in infrared modes. We have performed lattice simulations of the evolution of interacting scalar fields during and <b>after</b> <b>preheating</b> for a variety of inflationary models. We have formulated a set of generic rules that govern the thermalization process in all of these models. Notably, we see that once one of the fields is amplified through parametric resonance or other mechanisms it rapidly excites other coupled fields to exponentially large occupation numbers. These fields quickly acquire nearly thermal spectra in the infrared, which gradually propagates into higher momenta. Prior to the formation of total equilibrium, the excited fields group into subsets with almost identical characteristics (e. g. group effective temperature). The way fields form into these groups and the properties of the groups depend on the couplings between them. We also studied the onset of chaos <b>after</b> <b>preheating</b> by calculating the Lyapunov exponent of the scalar fields. Comment: 15 pages, 23 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} bosonic trilinear interactions in <b>preheating</b> <b>after</b> chaotic inflation. A trilinear interaction term allows for the complete decay of the massive inflaton particles, which {{is necessary for the}} transition to radiation domination. We found that typically the trilinear term is subdominant during early stages of preheating, but it actually amplifies parametric resonance driven by the four-legs interaction. In cases where the trilinear term does dominate during preheating, the process occurs through periodic tachyonic amplifications with resonance effects, which is so effective that preheating completes within a few inflaton oscillations. We develop an analytic theory of this process, which we call tachyonic resonance. We also study numerically the influence of trilinear interactions on the dynamics <b>after</b> <b>preheating.</b> The trilinear term eventually comes to dominate <b>after</b> <b>preheating,</b> leading to faster rescattering and thermalization than could occur without it. Finally, we {{investigate the}} role of non-renormalizable interaction terms during preheating. We find that if they are present they generally dominate (while still in a controllable regime) in chaotic inflation models. Preheating due to these terms proceeds through a modified form of tachyonic resonance. Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, refs added, published versio...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a curvaton {{scenario in which}} the late-time domination and the generation of the curvature perturbation is achieved by a non-oscillatory (NO) curvaton potential. Instead of considering the conventional curvaton oscillation, we consider ``weak trapping'' <b>after</b> <b>preheating,</b> which modifies {{the evolution of the}} curvaton density <b>after</b> <b>preheating.</b> The primordial isocurvature perturbation related to the curvaton is once converted into the fluctuation of the number density of the preheat field through inhomogeneous preheating. Then the evolution of the curvatons and the preheat field is controlled by the preheat-field number density. The density of these fields decreases slightly slower than the standard matter density which suggests that these fields will grow with time. Finally, the preheat field decays to reheat the Universe leaving behind the curvature perturbation. In our scenario the task of the standard curvaton is not executed solely by the curvaton itself but is partially shared with the preheat field. NO curvatons can be considered as the hybrid version of the quintessential inflationary model. Comment: 12 pages, no figure, added reference...|$|R
