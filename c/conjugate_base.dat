5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its <b>conjugate</b> <b>base.</b> This process, known as homoconjugation, {{has the effect of}} enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the <b>conjugate</b> <b>base.</b> Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the <b>conjugate</b> <b>base</b> than does the acid.|$|E

5|$|A {{calculated}} {{titration curve}} for oxalic acid is {{shown at the}} right. Oxalic acid has pKa values of 1.27 and 4.27. Therefore, the buffer regions will be centered at about pH 1.3 and pH 4.3. The buffer regions carry the information necessary to get the pKa values as the concentrations of acid and <b>conjugate</b> <b>base</b> change along a buffer region.|$|E
5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl, they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak <b>conjugate</b> <b>base</b> and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound {{is the result of}} a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, the result is an acidic salt. If it {{is the result of a}} reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it is the result of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the <b>conjugate</b> <b>base</b> ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E

25|$|The <b>conjugate</b> <b>base</b> of {{oxalic acid}} is the hydrogenoxalate anion, and its <b>conjugate</b> <b>base</b> (oxalate) is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme.

Restoring NAD+ levels {{is essential to the}} continuation of anaerobic energy metabolism through glycolysis. As cancer cells preferentially use anaerobic metabolism (see Warburg effect) inhibition of LDH has been shown to inhibit tumor formation and growth, thus is an interesting potential course of cancer treatment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{article is}} {{intended}} to have a systematic study on the nominal system and conjugation of nominals in Buzābādi dialect. Since Buzābādi is a dialect of central Iran and is considered as a western Iranian language, its nominal system is studied from three aspects: numerals (singular – plural), definite – indefinite nouns and gender (masculine- feminine). The research was carried out through synchronic methodology (describing language in a specific period). Having studied {{the results of the}} researches done on the dialects of cenral Iran, the researcher started her field study in Buzābād area. The data were basically gathered through observation, experience, questionnaires and interviews. Findings: _ As in all ancient Persian – rooted languages, nouns in this dialect are conjugated. _ Adjectives are <b>conjugated</b> <b>based</b> on the gender (feminine-masculine). _ Pronouns are <b>conjugated</b> <b>based</b> on the gender. Numerals (singular – plural) are <b>conjugated</b> <b>based</b> on the gender _ Based on the gender, some verbs are conjugated differently. _ Definite / indefinite indicators are specific characteristic of the dialect.
