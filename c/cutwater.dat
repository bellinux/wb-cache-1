25|$|On 26 January 1811 Westmoreland, of Liverpool, ran foul of Hibernia off Scilly, causing Hibernia to {{lose her}} bowsprit, head, and <b>cutwater.</b> Hibernia, which had sailing from London to St Thomas's, put back into Portsmouth on 1 March.|$|E
25|$|A sharp {{bottom and}} {{prominent}} keel create a “wine glass” shaped hull {{with a large}} leeboard. A strongly curved hull profile {{and the depth of}} the keel prevented the ship from drifting, enabling it to sail windward. This hull design is characterized by a reverse stempost with a <b>cutwater,</b> enabling the vessel to compensate for its large, non-specialized, powerful square sails and giving it speed.|$|E
25|$|Preparation for the patrols {{began in}} November, {{with all the}} ship's equipment, {{including}} masts, sails, rigging, boats, tackle, steering gear, pumps etc. being carefully inspected and repaired or renewed where necessary. New towing hawsers and heaving lines would also be procured. The ship would additionally be fitted over the <b>cutwater</b> with an iron, V-shaped icebreaker 3/8 of an inch thick and extending 18inches {{above and below the}} waterline, secured by a number of heavy chains. Officers would discard their normal uniforms in preference for reefer jackets, fur cap and gloves.|$|E
50|$|Thorp Arch bridge {{has five}} arched spans, {{two of which}} are over the current course of the river Wharfe is built of Ashlar {{magnesian}} limestone. The central arch has triangular <b>cutwaters</b> which accommodate pedestrian refuges in the parapets (the bridge has a footpath only to its upstream side), the remaining piers have <b>cutwaters</b> terminating in offsets.|$|R
25|$|The {{triangular}} <b>cutwaters</b> {{extend up}} {{to the level of}} the deck to become pedestrian refuges.|$|R

25|$|The vessel {{contained}} framing {{composed of}} various elements (keel, fore foot, stempost, <b>cutwater,</b> sternpost, inner post, false post), double planking (assembled entirely by mortise-and-tenon joints pegged from the inside) and {{was covered with}} a sheet of lead. What is referred to as a large keelson is actually a 7.5m long mast-step timber made of oak which doubles the axial frame. The stringers, nailed onto the frames, reinforced the hull longitudinally. Regularly alternated floor timbers and half frames comprised the framing of the vessel. The wreck indicates the vessel was about 40m long (35.10m remains preserved on the seabed), 9m wide, and 4.5m deep with a length-to-beam coefficient of 4.4(if L=40m, L/W=4.4). This coefficient of elongation-rate of length to width allows the ship to be much faster than those with a lower coefficient.|$|E
25|$|The {{vessel was}} built by a method of {{construction}} known as shell-first or plating, meaning that the frame was built first with the later addition of a skeleton. It was, however, not built entirely shell-first, but involved some elements of skeleton or frame-first construction. The keel, extended by a long fore foot ending with a concave stempost tilted towards the back, was laid first, then edge jointed by mortise (10 to 12cm deep and 8cm wide) and tenon (20 to 22cm long, 8cm wide, and 1.5cm thick), construction to three strakes. This first section of the ship, the keel and the first three planks, was made from elm. Floor timbers were then bolted directly to the keel, giving greater rigidity to the internal skeleton. Next, {{the rest of the}} framing was added, joined with straight nails and treenails. These few early frames acted as guides and supports during construction. Then, the rest of the planking was added, the lower skeleton first, followed by the upper shell (independent of the frames, with treenails inserted from inside the hull). Futtocks were inserted last and a second skin of thinner planks of fir was fitted to the exterior of the ship and covered in lead. A layer of planks, 6cm thick, was also fitted inside in order to cover the internal frames, strengthening the hull through double planking and elaborate, complex keel scarves. A massive <b>cutwater,</b> over a length of 1.45m, placed against the front-butt protected and strengthened the stern of the axial frame.|$|E
500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, Bellerophon was commissioned in March 1793, under her former captain, Thomas Pasley. Pasley fitted her for sea and sailed to join the Channel Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe. The Channel Fleet sailed on 14 July, with orders to patrol off Brest in the hope of intercepting and destroying the French fleet based there. While south-west of the Scilly Isles on 18 July, Bellerophon collided with [...] in gale-force winds. Bellerophon lost her bowsprit, foremast and main topmast, and had her figurehead and <b>cutwater</b> smashed, which necessitated putting into Plymouth for repairs.|$|E
50|$|While {{the twin}} bridges were built decades apart, they appear nearly identical. It {{is clear that}} {{builders}} in the 1960s took great care in matching the original 1930s architecture, but there are slight differences. The 1935 bridge has stone <b>cutwaters</b> on the piers, while the 1963 bridge has steel-faced <b>cutwaters.</b> Also, renovations of the southbound bridge have created a guard rail that looks {{quite different from the}} one on the northbound bridge.|$|R
50|$|The piers were {{reinforced}} by starlings (<b>cutwaters)</b> pointing upstream, {{to break up}} pieces of ice floating downstream during the annual spring thaw.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge is}} officially listed as [...] "probably {{built by the}} monks of Waverley Abbey"; it is made of local rubble stone with thin slabs of Bargate stone set in mortar to form {{voussoirs}} over the arches. Its top is of 18th century bricks with no parapet but instead for safety, twentieth century wooden posts and railings. The east span consists of three arches and the west four. Pointed <b>cutwaters</b> to upstream side and rounded <b>cutwaters,</b> [...] "very rare", to downstream side.|$|R
500|$|Just {{south of}} the village is the medieval Tun Bridge with three pointed arches {{including}} double arch rings, spanning [...] over the river, approached along one of the high pavements that are {{a feature of the}} village centre. It has three pointed arches, two of which have double arch rings built in two orders. At its widest point it is [...] wide and [...] in the centre. The two main arches are separated by a sharp <b>cutwater</b> [...] and tapering to [...] above which a [...] string course runs throughout the length of bridge. The bridge is thought to date from the late 15th century and is a Grade II listed building ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of December 11, 1872, Shoo Fly, then running {{under the control of}} the Oregon Steamship Company, loaded a cargo of wheat and {{departed}} downriver with the objective of reaching the ship <b>Cutwater,</b> then moored at Astoria. [...] Downriver from St. Helens, the Columbia was clogged with masses of floating ice. [...] That evening a telegram was received in Portland, stating that Shoo Fly had safely reached Kalama, Washington, which was 14 miles downriver from St. Helens.|$|E
2500|$|Discovered by divers {{from the}} French Navy Diving School in 1967, the archaeological {{investigations}} of the Roman wreck at Madrague de Giens constituted the first large scale, “truly scientific underwater excavation carried out in France”. The wreck lies at around 18 to 20 metres depth {{off the coast of}} the small fishing port of La Madrague de Giens on the Giens peninsula, east of Toulon, on the southern Mediterranean coast of France. Sunk around 75-60 BCE, the vessel {{has been found to be}} “a large merchantman of considerable tonnage - 400 tons deadweight with a displacement of around 550 tons”, making it one of the largest Roman wrecks excavated, [...] with only the wreck at Albenga, Italy (around 600 tons deadweight) exceeding it at the time of its discovery. [...] The vessel wrecked at Madrague de Giens measured around 40 metres in length; “showed a sharp bottom with “wine glass” section and a prominent keel creating a large leeboard”; displayed extended raking of the stem and stern; and had two masts. The hull was characterised by a reverse stempost in the shape of a ram with a big <b>cutwater</b> which “must have given... craft high-performance sailing qualities”. The ship sunk while transporting a large cargo of wine and black glazed pottery from Italy. It is not known why it sank.|$|E
50|$|The {{main road}} {{through the village}} crosses the river on a stone bridge with high <b>cutwaters.</b> There is a shop and a pub in the village.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge is}} 48 m long, and 11.5 m wide. It {{comprises}} three arches, two central piers with triangular upstream-facing <b>cutwaters</b> and downstream-facing buttresses with sloping cills.|$|R
50|$|The viaduct {{is in good}} condition, {{having been}} renovated between 1992 and 1995. Repairs {{included}} replacement of masonry and brickwork, grouting, and underwater repair {{to one of the}} <b>cutwaters.</b>|$|R
60|$|Job {{had caught}} {{hold of the}} <b>cutwater,</b> and, digging his fingers into the wood, held on by main {{strength}} for a few minutes.|$|E
60|$|The <b>Cutwater</b> {{was quite}} a good sized craft, and though {{the force of the}} {{collision}} did not damage her to any extent, it checked her progress considerably.|$|E
60|$|He was {{astride the}} row-boat, {{directly}} in {{the centre of the}} bottom, and {{it seemed as if the}} prow of the <b>Cutwater</b> must strike him in a second more.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{parts of}} the Church of England parish church of All Hallows are Saxon. Woolbeding Bridge across the River Rother is a medieval one, with three arches and two <b>cutwaters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The stone bridge {{has five}} arches {{each with a}} span of 9 ft. It has pointed arches with <b>cutwaters.</b> On {{either side of the}} road {{carriageway}} are parapets 0.6 m high.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{has five}} spans of dressed granite, and rounded <b>cutwaters</b> that carry up to road level to form {{pedestrian}} refuges. The spans are 75 ft, with {{a rise of}} 25 ft.|$|R
6000|$|Hardly {{had they}} reached it {{when a new}} peril confronted them. The <b>Cutwater</b> was bearing {{directly}} down upon them. With every sail set, {{she was in the}} very act of cutting them to pieces! ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>Cutwater</b> {{was put on}} a {{different}} track, {{and they began to}} move across the lake, it being Jerry's idea to cross and recross at a distance of every six or seven hundred feet.|$|E
60|$|But {{the words}} were hardly {{out of his mouth}} when there came an extra puff of wind. It sent the <b>Cutwater</b> almost over on her side, and threw a monstrous wave into the row-boat.|$|E
5000|$|Clifton Aqueduct, {{built in}} 1796, carried the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal across the River Irwell in Clifton, near Manchester, England. It is {{preserved}} as a Grade II listed structure. [...] The aqueduct is constructed of dressed stone with brick arches. Three segmental arches with keystones rest on triangular-ended <b>cutwaters.</b> Above the <b>cutwaters</b> are flat Pilasters. A C20 brick parapet {{remains on the}} eastern side. There is a towpath on each side, and the aqueduct contains grooves for stop planks to be inserted, to drain the canal. [...] The aqueduct was engineered by Charles Roberts and John Nightingale.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{has seven}} voussoired arches and <b>cutwaters</b> below. The {{parapets}} were rebuilt in the 20th century, and have flat coping stones. It is a Grade II* listed building and a Scheduled Monument.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} built {{of red and}} buff {{sandstone}} ashlar. It has five arched spans with the original pointed arches visible beneath, but with both faces covered by segmental arches carried on the sharply pointed <b>cutwaters.</b>|$|R
60|$|Harry was unconscious, and he {{was taken}} to the cabin, where Dora and the other girls did all in their power for him; and then the <b>Cutwater</b> was headed for Lakeview, two miles distant.|$|E
60|$|There, {{beating up}} {{in the teeth of}} the wind in the most hap-hazard manner, was the <b>Cutwater.</b> Evidently Clarence Conant was nearly paralyzed with fear, for he had almost lost control of the craft.|$|E
60|$|The <b>Cutwater</b> {{was a large}} sloop {{owned by}} one of the gentlemen living in Lakeview. As she came past, those in the row-boat noticed several young ladies on board, who were sailing the boat under {{directions}} of a young man named Clarence Conant.|$|E
5000|$|The Grade II listed {{bridge was}} {{built out of}} rock-faced stone {{in the early to}} mid-19th century. Its parapet, {{terminating}} in square piers, was renewed later that century. It has three basket arches and rounded <b>cutwaters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Llangynidr Bridge {{lies in the}} Hundred (county division) of Crickhowell and {{is similar}} in style to the Crickhowell Bridge over the Usk, which dates from 1706. It has six arches, which vary in span from 22 to 30 feet, divided by {{v-shaped}} <b>cutwaters</b> topped by pedestrian refuges and parapets with plain coping stones. The <b>cutwaters</b> continue up to the parapet, {{in order to provide}} spaces for pedestrians to stand to avoid wheeled traffic crossing the bridge. It is 69m (230 ft) long and the road is 2.4m (8 ft) wide. It is considered a particularly impressive example because of its height - reducing the danger of flooding - and its location, which gives {{a good view of the}} architecture.|$|R
50|$|The 1825 {{depiction}} {{shows the}} Bridge did not at its completion have the 1823 stone plaques attached above its central pier; the three middle piers were originally traditional vertical <b>cutwaters</b> {{identical to the}} two piers as still seen today at water's edge, {{and did not have}} the quite bulky elongated hexagonal plan <b>cutwaters</b> (added in 1884/5); and the townside Bridge approach followed the same gentle downward slope design as still exists at the eastern end and as seen in the lower road level string course. This modification was made in 1834/5 and was undertaken for Bridge approach safety reasons. The bronze plaque is of course a very recent addition on the roadside inner wall, added in 1991.|$|R
