40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{evaluate}} the response of coastal community comprehensive plans to the threats posed by sea level rise. The communities evaluated are Chincoteague, VA, Ocean City, MD, and Rehoboth Beach, DE. The results of the evaluations illustrate to what extent these communities are {{prepared to deal with}} sea level rise and provide a basis for recommendations to improve plan quality. The level of community risk and the components of the individual comprehensive plans are evaluated using new models created for this project. Risk level is measured using <b>computer</b> <b>disaster</b> simulations, topographic and demographic data. The plan evaluation criteria include standard plan quality benchmarks and hazard mitigation and adaptation elements suggested by numerous agencies and resources. The plan evaluations range in quality from “poor” to “excellent”. These evaluations will be used to create policy strategies and recommendations for addressing the threat of sea level rise...|$|E

The various components of system documentation are then explained, followed by descriptions of the three stages of creation of complete system documentation: (1) design and development documentation; (2) backup documentation; and (3) documentation reports. Environmental controls, a second major aspect of disaster recovery planning, are then discussed, with emphasis on problems with the 3 lectrical power supply such as "blinks, " "brownouts, " and "blackouts.

Evento aupiciado por la Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM) y la Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC). One of {{the reasons}} that we know so little of ancient life is because much of written history of those times has been lost. We can only {{speculate}} what really happened. If only we had not lost all the treasures…If only we had preserved that knowledge somewhere else or in some other medium, then probably mankind need not have {{to start all over again}} re-discovering knowledge. The loss of knowledge is due to three reasons - Disasters, Media Deterioration, and Alternative Formats & Obsolete Technology A clear idea about what could be lost will only lead us to take precautionary steps or to lessen the damage. Within a library and information service (LIS), the most likely disasters are fire or flood, but those caused by wind, earthquakes and other natural phenomena can also happen. Acts of sabotage or terrorism may occur which can destroy, or seriously disrupt the LIS. And with more and more information being held in electronic format, <b>computer</b> <b>disasters,</b> whether caused by system failure or unauthorized access and hacking into files, are becoming more common. Information is necessarily recorded on some kind of medium. All media deteriorate over time, at different rates and for different reasons. When information is provided in alternative formats – for example microforms or digitized form - equipment for using them must not only be provided, but also kept maintained in good working condition. Preserving long-term access to digital information resources is one of the key challenges facing libraries and information centers today. The paper iterates what steps have been taken by Physical Research Laboratory, Library to overcome this challenge...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Informatics) The-utilization of {{information}} technology is essential for an organization, not only to handle daily business activities but also to facilitate management decisions. The greater the dependence of the organization upon information technology, the greater the risk the organization is exposed to {{in case of an}} information systems interruption. <b>Computer</b> <b>disasters,</b> such as fires, floods, storms, sabotage and human error, constitute a security threat which could prejudice the survival of an organization. Disaster recovery planning is a realistic and imperative activity for each organization whether large or small. In the light of the potential economic and legal implications o fa disaster, it is no longer acceptable not to be prepared for such an occurrence today. A well designed and tested disaster recovery plan, as part of the total information security strategy of the organization, is therefore not only essential in the terms of the recovery of business functions, but for the SURVIVAL of the organization. In viewpoint above, it can be expected that disaster counterrevolutionary be standard practice for all organizations. However that is not the case. The literature study undertook, as well as exposure in practice, indicate clearly that disaster recovery planning enjoys low priority in most organizations. The majority existentialists are superficial, unstructured and insufficient and will not be successful when real disaster strikes. :The most important single cause for the failure of an organization ~ disaster recovery plan, will be that too much emphasis is being placed on the technical aspects rather than on the management or organizational aspects. The solutions an integrated approach of strategies and the multiple technologies which are available today. These strategies and technologies should be combined to meet the specific needs of the individual organization. The purpose of this dissertation was firstly to identify the most critical problems related to disaster recovery planning and secondly to provide a methodology for {{the development and implementation of}} a disaster recovery plan which addresses these problems. This methodology constitutes an enhancement on an existing information security methodology in order to establish a total information security strategy for a large organization with disaster recovery as an essential aspect of this strategy. The final disaster recovery planning methodology as proposed in this dissertation, was developed as a result of an extensive literature study undertook as well as involvement during the development of a disaster recovery system by the company which initiated this study...|$|R

In this work, we consider the vulnerability of a network to disasters, and we propose an efficient method to compute the distribution of a network performance measure, based on a finite set of disaster areas and occurrence probabilities. Compared to other approaches, our approach is more accurate and gives more information about the vulnerability of the network. Based on our approach, we have implemented a tool to help visualize the vulnerability of a network to disasters. We give general methods to obtain finite disaster sets from empirical disaster data and showcase these methods on actual earthquake and hurricane datasets.

40|$|Abstract: Critical {{infrastructure}} {{systems are}} very important to the socioeconomic stability of any nation and the overall well-being of humans. However, those infrastructure systems are vulnerable to the distractive forces of natural and anthropogenic episodic events. In response to security and safety concerns related to the infrastructure new applied computing methodologies have been developed for training of law enforcement and security personnel, improving assessment tools for first responders, detailing mitigation and evacuation planning, and providing realistic analysis of various emergency scenarios. Those methodologies involve development of simulation, animation and visualization <b>computer</b> applications for <b>disaster</b> prevention, response and mitigation. These applications can also assist in incident analysis, and planning of massive emergency evacuation and transportation. The applications involve an integrated combination of a variety of software packages. This study describes some infrastructure safety and security projects that utilized a combination of different software such as AutoCad, Adobe Photoshop, Global Mapper, ArcGIS (ESRI), Di-Guy (Boston Dynamics), Presagi...|$|R
