We propose an algorithm (method) that analyzes a video sequence, detects moving objects and their moving direction and filters {{them according to}} some criteria (ex only humans). As result one obtains in and out counters for objects passing the defined perimeter. Automatic object counting is a growing size application in many industry/commerce areas. Counting {{can be used in}} statistical analysis and optimal activity scheduling methods. One of the main applications is the approximation of the number of persons passing trough, or reaching a certain area: airports (<b>customs),</b> <b>shopping</b> centers and malls and sports or cultural activities with high attendance. The main purpose is to offer an accurate estimation while still keeping the anonymity of the visitors...|$|E
