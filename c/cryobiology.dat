25|$|<b>Cryobiology</b> is {{the branch}} of biology that studies the effects of low {{temperatures}} on living things within Earth's cryosphere or in science. The word <b>cryobiology</b> {{is derived from the}} Greek words κρῧος , « cold », βίος , « life », and λόγος , « word » (hence science). In practice, <b>cryobiology</b> is the study of biological material or systems at temperatures below normal. Materials or systems studied may include proteins, cells, tissues, organs, or whole organisms. Temperatures may range from moderately hypothermic conditions to cryogenic temperatures.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cryobiology</b> (publisher: Elsevier) is the {{foremost}} scientific publication in this area, with about 60 refereed contributions published each year. Articles concern {{any aspect of}} low-temperature biology and medicine (e.g. freezing, freeze-drying, hibernation, cold tolerance and adaptation, cryoprotective compounds, medical applications of reduced temperature, cryosurgery, hypothermia, and perfusion of organs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryobiology</b> {{history can}} be traced back to antiquity. As early as in 2500 BC, low {{temperatures}} were used in Egypt in medicine. The use of cold was recommended by Hippocrates to stop bleeding and swelling. With the emergence of modern science, Robert Boyle studied the effects of low temperatures on animals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryobiology</b> as an {{applied science}} is {{primarily}} concerned with low-temperature preservation. Hypothermic storage is typically above 0°C but below normothermic (32°C to 37°C) mammalian temperatures. Storage by cryopreservation, on the other hand, {{will be in the}} 80 to 196°C temperature range. Organs, and tissues are more frequently the objects of hypothermic storage, whereas single cells have been the most common objects cryopreserved.|$|E
25|$|In <b>cryobiology</b> DMSO {{has been}} used as a {{cryoprotectant}} and is still an important constituent of cryoprotectant vitrification mixtures used to preserve organs, tissues, and cell suspensions. Without it, up to 90% of frozen cells will become inactive. It is particularly important in the freezing and long-term storage of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, which are often frozen in a mixture of 10%DMSO, a freezing medium, and 30% fetal bovine serum. In the cryogenic freezing of heteroploid cell lines (MDCK, VERO, etc.) a mixture of 10%DMSO with 90%EMEM (70%EMEM + 30%fetal bovine serum + antibiotic mixture) is used. As part of an autologous bone marrow transplant the DMSO is re-infused along with the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells.|$|E

2500|$|The Society for <b>Cryobiology</b> {{was founded}} in 1964 to bring {{together}} those from the biological, medical, and physical sciences who have a common interest in the effects of low temperatures on biological systems. [...] As of 2007, the Society for <b>Cryobiology</b> had about 280 members from around the world, and one-half of them are US-based. [...] The purpose of the Society is to promote scientific research in low temperature biology, to improve scientific understanding in this field, and to disseminate and apply this knowledge {{to the benefit of}} mankind. The Society requires of all its members the highest ethical and scientific standards in the performance of their professional activities. According to the Society's bylaws, membership may be refused to applicants whose conduct is deemed detrimental to the Society; in 1982, the bylaws were amended explicitly to exclude [...] "any practice or application of freezing deceased persons in the anticipation of their reanimation", over the objections of some members who were cryonicists, such as Jerry Leaf. The Society organizes an annual scientific meeting dedicated to all aspects of low-temperature biology. [...] This international meeting offers opportunities for presentation and discussion of the most up-to-date research in <b>cryobiology,</b> as well as reviewing specific aspects through symposia and workshops. [...] Members are also kept informed of news and forthcoming meetings through the Society newsletter, News Notes. [...] The 2011-2012 president of the Society for <b>Cryobiology</b> was John H.

2500|$|At {{least six}} major areas of <b>cryobiology</b> can be identified: 1) study of cold-adaptation of microorganisms, plants (cold hardiness), and animals, both {{invertebrates}} and vertebrates (including hibernation), 2) cryopreservation of cells, tissues, gametes, and embryos of animal and human origin for (medical) purposes of long-term storage by cooling to temperatures below the freezing point of water. [...] This usually requires {{the addition of}} substances which protect the cells during freezing and thawing (cryoprotectants), 3) preservation of organs under hypothermic conditions for transplantation, 4) lyophilization (freeze-drying) of pharmaceuticals, 5) cryosurgery, a (minimally) invasive approach {{for the destruction of}} unhealthy tissue using cryogenic gases/fluids, and 6) physics of supercooling, ice nucleation/growth and mechanical engineering aspects of heat transfer during cooling and warming, as applied to biological systems. <b>Cryobiology</b> would include cryonics, the low temperature preservation of humans and mammals with the intention of future revival, although this is not part of mainstream <b>cryobiology,</b> depending heavily on speculative technology yet to be invented. Several of these areas of study rely on cryogenics, the branch of physics and engineering that studies the production and use of very low temperatures ...|$|E

5000|$|Cryochemistry is {{the study}} of {{chemical}} interactions at temperatures below [...] It is derived from the Greek word cryos, meaning 'cold'. It overlaps with many other sciences, including chemistry, <b>cryobiology,</b> condensed matter physics, and even astrochemistry. Cryochemistry has been a topic of interest since liquid nitrogen, which freezes at −210°C, became commonly available. Cryogenic-temperature chemical interactions are an important mechanism for studying the detailed pathways of chemical reactions by reducing the confusion introduced by thermal fluctuations. Cryochemistry forms the foundation for <b>cryobiology,</b> which uses slowed or stopped biological processes for medical and research purposes.|$|E
