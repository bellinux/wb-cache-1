40|$|Abstract: The cassava roots {{used for}} flour {{production}} contain high amounts of cyanogenic glycosides and are, therefore, potential hydrogen cyanide (HCN) releasers. This {{fact is the}} <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increasing health <b>concern</b> in the sector of cassava processing. Brazilian workers engaged in the flour production may be chronically exposed to HCN in levels above the safety limits. This hypothesis {{is based on the}} drastic reduction in cyanide content of cassava roots during a traditional Brazilian method of processing and in the physical properties of the compound, which makes it very susceptible to volatilization and air contamination. As an attempt to explore this issue, HCN exposure in Brazilian “flour houses” was evaluated in this study through environmental and biological monitoring. Four flour houses placed in Alagoas State, Brazil, were investigated. The results indicated that the cassava processors are chronically exposed to HCN at average levels between 0. 464 and 3. 328 mg/m 3 (TWA), in the work environment. This range is below the TLV-C of 5 mg/m 3 but not below the Action Level of 2. 5 mg/m 3. These data may be interpreted as a possible risk to susceptible individuals. Additionally, the biological monitoring indicated a high cyanide exposure in the population study, considering urinary thiocyanate (SCN-) levels...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{seasonal}} variation {{of different types}} of particulates was investigated in a fixed roadside station in heavily trafficked urban area of Hong Kong. Aerosol samples for total suspended particles (TSP), PM 10 and PM 2. 5 were collected from June 1998 to May 1999 at a roadside site. Meteorological conditions such as relative humidity (RH), rainfall and prevailing wind direction were found to affect the mass concentration of TSP, PM 10 and coarse particulates at roadside level. Large size particles had an apparent seasonal variation, with higher concentration level in winter and lower in summer. The dry continental winter monsoon and the wet oceanic summer monsoon are the dominating factors. On the other hand, annual variation of PM 2. 5 is relatively insignificant, suggesting that they are mainly from local traffic emission. PM 10 accounted for 62 % of the TSP, while PM 2. 5 accounted for 46 %. The annual PM 2. 5 /PM 10 is high with PM 2. 5 responsible for 74 % of PM 10. In our heavily trafficked roadside fixed site, TSP exceeded the annual average of the Hong Kong Air Quality Objective by <b>a</b> factor <b>of</b> 1. 53 while PM 10 exceeded by 1. 39.

40|$|The {{multi-media}} sculptures {{that constitute}} {{this body of}} work are extensions and representations of my perceptions and feelings related to {{the social and political}} mores of the world [...] past, present and future. The messages from newspapers, magazine articles, lectures and television commentaries, are often very disturbing and the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> much <b>concern.</b> <b>As</b> a result, my work has evolved into a political and social commentary. This is my way of transcending inner feelings and conflicts, making strong observations that might cause people to confront some of the realities of life. It is necessary for me to contemplate each concept for <b>an</b> extended period <b>of</b> time before beginning fabrication. Mentally, this is difficult because the subject matter is intense and exceedingly draining. In order to present these political and social commentaries I utilize non-specific human forms. This approach started several years ago in Cliff Dwellings (Plates # 1 and # 2), <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> pit-fired vessels, which have Lilliputian saw-dust fired people scaling their mountainous ridges. The more recent works use people to express my ideas; however, they have grown considerably in scale and meaning. I have used clay, glazes, paints, hardware cloth, wood, plexi-glass tubing, metal, etc., to create the sculptures. Red, black and yellow are used in many of the works, red and black denoting power and evil, yellow for its disturbing quality. Among the early works, prior to the master's series, are Things Are Seldom What They Seem, Skim Milk Masquerades As Cream (Plate # 3), Reaganism or Darwin's Theory of Evolution (Plate # 4) and Corporate Capitalism (Plate # 5). They were my initial attempts at political analysis through the sculptural form. The themes include the false god of materialism, the economic recession and the tarnishing of the American dream. In the master's series the portrayal of these and additional political thoughts become considerably darker, more macabre and less hopeful. Animal Farm (Plates # 6, # 7, # 8 and # 9) is inspired by George Orwell's 1946 allegorical novel, which dealt with totalitarianism. Orwell said he tried to "fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole. " This statement applies to my work in general. This work has three sets built like theatre-in-the-round. In the barnyard scene, the pigs and their guard dogs are holding court over the other farm animals, laying down the rules and regulations. The bedroom depicts the pigs sleeping on mattress ticking. Commandment Number Four states "Animals must not sleep in beds with sheets. " The next scene, the farmhouse kitchen, is the final chapter of the story. By now, the pigs are hard to distinguish from the humans with whom they are playing cards and drinking beer. Sitting at the kitchen table, wearing identical clothes, they are both cheating at their game of cards. Of the list of commandments introduced by the pigs, Number Seven, "All animals are equal. But some are more equal than others. ", is the only one left. (See more in text...|$|R

40|$|Chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) is {{a forest}} species {{widespread}} in Mediterranean area and chestnut wood is considered as valuable for several uses due to good mechanical properties, natural duration and its design. But, unfortunately, the ring shake defect very often occurs in chestnut wood after trees felling, leading to qualitative degradation and causing problems to chestnut’s wood utilization. Ring shake {{is a phenomenon}} with unknown <b>causes</b> and <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great <b>concern</b> among people that deal with chestnut wood allover the Europe. This work included <b>a</b> research <b>of</b> ring shake occurrence in chestnut coppice forests and chestnut trees from orchards, {{as well as on}} chestnut logs at woodcutting areas and log storage yards in order to detect possible relations with morphological or growth characteristics with ring shake occurrence. Basic mechanical and physical properties of ring-shaken chestnut logs were determined. Afterwards, comparisons between wooden areas at different distance from ring shake, of the same log and between ring-shaken and non ring-shaken logs were made. Finally, three ringshaken and three non ring-shaken logs were transformed to lumber in order to calculate the qualitative and quantitative performance. Relationships between age, log’s diameter and ring width with ring shake were established. Ring shakes presence was frequent at logs with some stem or cross section abnormalities such as forking, double-pith, large knots, burls, pith eccentricity and elongated cross sections (ellipsoid-oval). The ring shake defect mainly occurred on logs from the older trees with large diameters (at base or breast height) coming from orchards. On logs coming from a coppice forest (origin of Halkidiki, Greece), where young chestnut trees were cut without reaching large diameter, ring shake didn’t occur on logs from trees cut after one rotation and rarely occurred on logs from trees cut after two rotations (9. 5 %). The presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wider ring followed by narrower rings or the width differentiation along the same ring <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cross section, consist an area that ring shake is possible to be developed. Differentiations between wooden areas from ring-shaken logs were determined for some mechanical and physical properties (areas close or at a distance from ring shakes, juvenile, mature wood. Mature wood from the ring shakes area had lower axial compression and hardness strength compared with mature wood away from ring shakes. Wood from ring shakes area had lower tangential swelling and, precisely, at the shakes position, wood had higher coefficient of anisotropy than the surrounding wood. The juvenile wood’s density from the ring-shaken logs was higher compared to mature wood, as well as proportional limit and hardness strength. From comparisons between ring-shaken and non ring-shaken logs properties, the following results came up: Mature wood from any area (independently of shake’s presence) of ring-shaken logs had lower modulus of rapture, proportional limit, modulus of elasticity under static bending, axial compression, toughness and hardness strength compared with mature wood from non ring-shaken logs. Moreover, lower radial swelling was determined for ring-shaken logs. The juvenile wood’s density from the ring-shaken logs was higher compared either to mature or to juvenile wood from non ring-shaken logs. Juvenile wood from ring-shaken logs had higher modulus of elasticity under shearing compared to juvenile wood from non ring-shaken logs. A prognostic statistical model based on logistic regression, and using age and diameter as estimators, was built giving <b>an</b> efficiency <b>of</b> success up to 80 %. This model could be useful into selecting trees for cutting process by finding the proper age/diameter for the selected trees {{in order to reduce the}} possibility of ring shake occurrence. Ring shakes rarely occur on juvenile or overmature wood. They usually occur on adult wood from logs of tree’s base and the proportion of timber affected by ring shake defect can be relatively estimated only after 20 - 30 days after trees felling. This proportion is expected to be increased during drying process. All above factors cause many difficulties to chestnut wood manufacture. From <b>a</b> test sawing <b>of</b> logs that took place in this research, significant qualitative and quantitative degradation was determined for ring-shaken logs. Specifically, lumber performance from ring shaken logs was found degraded to 28 %- 29 % compared with 55 %- 64 % from non ring-shaken logs. ...|$|R
