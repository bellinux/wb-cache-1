5|$|Elves {{have few}} <b>children,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rule (Fëanor and Nerdanel were an exception, conceiving seven sons), {{and there are}} {{relatively}} sizeable intervals between each child (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman). They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their libido wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E
5|$|Margaret Pollard, born Margaret Akers in Bristol, Virginia, in {{the early}} 1880s, was the {{youngest}} {{in a family of}} ten <b>children.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> young adult she moved to Washington, D.C., and found employment in various government offices before marrying Pollard and moving to Baltimore. The Pollards had one son, Roy, who was ten years old when Pollard died. After the marriage to Agnew in 1917 and Spiro's birth the following year, the new family settled in a small apartment at 226 West Madison Street, near downtown Baltimore.|$|E
5000|$|In another tradition, Julia Kristeva {{points out}} how a pairing {{of mothers and}} fathers, overprotective and uneasy, who have chosen the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> narcissistic {{artificial}} limb and keep incorporating that <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> restoring element for the adult psyche intensifies the infant's tendency toward omnipotence.|$|R

5|$|Non-genetic, environmental, post-infectious, or psychosocial factors—while not causing Tourette's—can {{influence}} its severity. Autoimmune processes {{may affect}} tic onset and exacerbation in some cases. In 1998, a {{team at the}} US National Institute of Mental Health proposed a hypothesis based on observation of 50 children that both obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders may arise in a subset of <b>children</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of a poststreptococcal autoimmune process. Children who meet five diagnostic criteria are classified, according to the hypothesis, as having Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS). This contentious hypothesis {{is the focus of}} clinical and laboratory research, but remains unproven.|$|E
5|$|Raised by Mormon {{parents and}} devout to the faith, Dalton was a feminist; as a child, she felt jealous of boys {{for the freedom}} and {{privileges}} they enjoyed and felt that girls were neglected by the education system. She became a women's rights activist, believing that women {{should have the right}} to suffrage, education, property, control over their money, and custody of their <b>children.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> teacher, she advocated for equal educational and recreational opportunities for girls.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{language of the}} region is Mayali, a dialect of Bininj Gun-Wok traditionally associated with the region surrounding Maningrida, in Western Arnhem Land. As it is a strong language with hundreds of speakers and {{a high rate of}} child acquisition, members of the Wagiman ethnic group gradually ceased teaching the Wagiman language to their <b>children.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, many Wagiman people speak Mayali, while only a handful of elders, possibly no more than six, speak Wagiman.|$|E

5|$|Writing in {{the journal}} Social Problems, Jessica Fields {{characterized}} Not in Front of the <b>Children</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> significant monograph which effectively criticized the rhetoric of protection of the sexual purity of youths {{as a form of}} ideology. Cynthia A. McDaniel wrote in a piece for the journal Counterpoints assessing that Heins had put forth a thesis that attempting to shield youths from events led to negative unintended consequences. McDaniel emphasized that rationale debate is key to a functional society which values freedom of choice. She wrote that debate and introspection were critical to growth in this area, {{in order to determine the}} need to modify behavior patterns.|$|E
5|$|Connie Smith {{was born}} Constance June Meador on August 14, 1941 to Wilma and Hobart Meador in Elkhart, Indiana. Her parents were {{originally}} from West Virginia, and when Smith was five months old, the family returned there. They would later move to Dungannon, Ohio. Her father was abusive {{when she was}} a child, which would eventually cause her to suffer a mental breakdown {{when she was a}} teenager. When she was seven, her mother divorced her father and married Tom Clark. Clark brought 8 children to the new marriage; Meador brought five, including Smith. The couple would eventually have two more children together, which in total added up to fifteen <b>children.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> child, Smith was surrounded by music. Her stepfather played mandolin, while her brother played fiddle, and her other brother played guitar. On Saturday nights Smith would listen to the Grand Ole Opry radio broadcast. While she was a teenager, she was injured in a lawnmower accident, which nearly cut her leg off. While in the hospital recovering, she was given a guitar and learned how to play different chords. Following the recovery, she began to perform in various local talent contests. In 1959, Smith graduated from Salem-Liberty High School as the class salutatorian.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} Nils Johan Nilsen to a Norwegian family in Seljeskog in Salangen on 3 June 1894, {{as the oldest}} of six <b>children.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> child, Nelsen was an active skier and ski jumper, with more than fifteen ski jumps located in the area. In 1913, his family emigrated to Big Eddy near Revelstoke. Once in Canada, he anglicized his name. His brother, Ivind Nilsen was also a {{champion}} ski jumper, and became among other things Boy's World Champion in 1922. Ivind, who chose not to anglicize his last name, {{was known for his}} supreme style, while Nels was better known for his length. Nelsen married Emma Pickard, with whom he had ten children. Except for a brief period as a ski instructor, he worked as a brakeman and conductor for the Canadian Pacific Railway, whose flexibility made it easer to participate in tournaments. He moved to North Vancouver where he raised his family.|$|E

5|$|Hoshino {{was born}} on April 21, 1980, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, as the younger of fraternal twin girls and the second of three <b>children.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> child, she {{originally}} dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Hoshino confessed she was not too interested in school, often making excuses to avoid taking classes. Additionally, she added that would often practise drawing {{in the middle of}} the classes which gave her doubts when she had to erase them. She drew her first manga at twenty-one. In 1998, Hoshino moved to Tokyo. She dreamed of bringing her mother to the city and was able to in 2006. After graduating from high school, Hoshino did not know what career should she follow as she was offered the work of joining video game companies. Ultimately, she decided to become a manga author despite her fears of the difficulty it takes.|$|E
5|$|Makeba's {{music was}} also popular in Europe, and she {{travelled}} and performed there frequently. Acting {{on the advice}} of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of the country's independence from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader Jomo Kenyatta. Later that year she testified before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid about the effects of the system, asking for economic sanctions against South Africa's National Party government. She requested an arms embargo against South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used against black women and <b>children.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became a stateless person, but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. In her life, she held nine passports, and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries.|$|E

They also found wealth {{in the sale of}} medicinal herbs, the family stressed the importance of helping the less fortunate. Ieoh Ming Pei was born on 26 April 1917 to Tsuyee Pei and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to Hong Kong one year later. The family eventually included five <b>children.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout Buddhist who was recognized for her skills as a flautist. She invited him, his brothers, and his sisters to join her on meditation retreats. His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} examine {{the ways in which}} the idea of the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> high {{vulnerable}} to risk is constituting new pedagogical subjects, ie, the teacher/caregiver <b>as</b> <b>a</b> professional risk-manager, and the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> risk-management ‘case’. It does so by indicating how an expanded notion of the duty of care has reconstituted the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> work-in-progress case rather than 'the concrete subject of [educational] intervention' (Castel, 1991 : 288). It examines how the new teacher <b>as</b> <b>a</b> risk-conscious professional caregiver both needs and comes to acquire a new intimacy with the <b>child</b> not <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fleshly body but <b>as</b> <b>a</b> case of risk minimisation...|$|R

The project works with Gateshead Council and the Gateshead Housing Company to provide a community cafe promoting healthy eating (the T–Junction), a gymnasium, indoor sports hall, outdoor Five-a-side football pitches and a meeting place for resident groups. The project has education provision for young <b>children</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> registered day–care provider and it also offers adult education and training. The project hosts the Carnival on the Hill/Deckham Festival, a collaborative enterprise between Route 26, Gateshead Council and Home Group, offering free activities such as go-karting and children's soft play, {{against the backdrop of}} a steel band. The second Carnival on the Hill was held on 3 September 2011 and attracted more than 1,000 visitors, including the Mayor of Gateshead and BBC local weatherman Paul Mooney.|$|E
5|$|While {{growing up}} in Calgary, Sing {{attended}} numerous Stampede Wrestling events with her mother. She knew {{she wanted to be}} a wrestler from a young age and frequently beat up the neighborhood <b>children.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> teenager, Sing approached members of the Hart wrestling family and asked to be trained, but she was rejected as they did not train women wrestlers at the time. Bret Hart, however, claims it had more to do with scheduling conflicts. During a trip to Hawaii in 1978, she saw Japanese women's wrestling on television and decided she wanted to pursue the sport. She later wrote to Mildred Burke, after a friend gave her a magazine with Burke's contact information, and sent her a biography and photo. Shortly thereafter, she joined Burke's training facility in Encino, California.|$|E
