40|$|School curriculums in {{physical}} education are conceptualised that {{students are expected to}} overcome many motoric assignments and vast area of disciplines (athletics, gymnastics, sports games, rhythmic gymnastics, ethnic dances, etc). Drawbacks of this kind of curriculum are: students superficially adopt only basic elements of motions; there is no automatization and complete control of motoric motions. Teaching practice is mainly focused on development of technical elements in contrast to development of motoric and functional abilities of students. Physical education efficiency can be improved by realistic, expertly and economical planning and monitoring {{of the effects of the}} teaching, as well as by increase in weekly number of classes. Sports games are, among others, by nature of comprising motions, important factors and tools in teaching of physical education of students. It seems that all of this has been considered when school reform has been done in Montenegro. By this very kind of work the effects of the increment in weekly class number are meant to be <b>checked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>Our</b> sample consisted of 73 8 th grade boys, 42 in experimental group involved in additional basketball programme, and 31 boys in control group without additional classes of physical education. Level of motoric abilities has been followed by 14 test battery which measured levels of speed, coordination, precision, balance, flexibility and explosive strength. We concluded that subjects in experimental group had shown improved levels of abilities in each test at final measurement, except at the test of vertical aiming – darts. However, keep in mind that boys in control group had also show certain improvements in results of the t test for dependent samples at initial and final measurement of the horizontal wall bouncing for 15 seconds test and hand and foot tapping test, by using ANOVA we compared measured results at final measurement of the each group. We concluded that there are statistically significant differences between groups in left hand basketball dribbling test and pull-through and jump-over tests, at which experimental group shown better results, as well as that control group had better results at hand and foot tapping test. Therefore, it can finally be conclude that conveyed basketball programme had positive impact at motoric abilities of students, although not as much as expecte...|$|R

The book Check In / <b>Check</b> <b>Out.</b> The Public Space as an Internet of Things shows us how our digital and physical worlds are rapidly merging into an Internet of Things. We’ve checked in, but can we still <b>check</b> <b>out?</b> As <b>our</b> information society is entering a new phase, we no longer surf on the net, {{we live in the}} net. While we are travelling, working and shopping, we continuously check in and <b>check</b> <b>out.</b> These digital transactions show governments and companies where we are and what we are doing. We have become moving dots on a digital map. In exchange for this loss of privacy, we get access to information, spaces and goods. But what are the risks? And what price will we pay? Identity Management The authors of Check In / <b>Check</b> <b>Out</b> - researchers from the Dutch science and technology think tank The Rathenau Instituut - demonstrate how we should start managing our digital identity, by providing a set of design principles for this Internet of Things. These design principles are aimed to balance the power struggle between governments, businesses and the users of digitized public space. Protecting privacy is just one side of the story, more important is the empowerment of users. Questions answered are: {{what can we do to}} make technology work for users and not against them? When can the right to privacy be revoked because the security stakes are too high? How can users profit from their personal data? Should governments allow their citizens more control over their digital identities? Similar technologies, different implementation The international case studies in the book show how countries deal with the digitalized public space in their own particular way. The book includes case studies on Japan, China, the United States and Europe. The authors focus primarily on the Netherlands, a country with high ambitions on IT projects, combined with a lively public debate on any failures. An example of this is the smart cards used in {{public transport}} systems. These cards were first introduced in large Asian cities, were the technology had to be proven to be safe and well functioning before the old system was discarded. The Dutch public transport card, however, was forced upon its users. Detailed personal and travel data are being collected and used by transport companies, marketers and for police investigations. From the ensuing and evolving public controversy, lessons can be learned...|$|R

5000|$|Passengers {{travelling}} on pre-loaded credit {{must always}} <b>check</b> <b>out</b> {{at the end}} of their journey in order for the deposit, which was deducted upon check-in, to be reimbursed to their OV-chipkaart. While <b>checking</b> <b>out</b> is unavoidable at railway or metro stations closed off with ticket barriers, stations with free-standing validator units as well as trams and buses can be exited without <b>checking</b> <b>out.</b> An estimated 2% of occasional passengers and 0.5% of frequent travellers forget to <b>check</b> <b>out.</b> Even though passengers can reclaim their deposit, many are not aware of their failure to <b>check</b> <b>out.</b> In addition, the reimbursement procedure requires submitting a paper or online form with the transport operator concerned which some passenger consider too cumbersome in relation to the amount lost. An investigation commissioned by passenger associations showed that the check-out problem results in an estimated profit of nearly €23 million a year for public transport operators. About half of this amount would go to NS as the principal rail operator. Transport operators have questioned the validity of the numbers, claiming the total amount is not more than a few million euros and that they are willing to reimburse lost deposits. However, an NS spokesperson responded, [...] "the travellers who have forgotten to <b>check</b> <b>out</b> have to announce themselves".|$|R
