5000|$|Tube-shunt {{surgery or}} {{drainage}} implant surgery involves {{the placement of}} a tube or glaucoma valves to facilitate aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber. Trabeculopuncture uses a Q switched Nd:YAG laser to punch small holes in the trabecular meshwork. Goniocurretage is an [...] "ab interno" [...] (from the inside) procedure that used an instrument [...] "to scrape pathologically altered trabecular meshwork off the scleral sulcus". A surgical <b>cyclodialysis</b> is a rarely used procedure that aims to separate the ciliary body from the sclera to form a communication between the suprachoroidal space and the anterior chamber. A cyclogoniotomy is a surgical procedure for producing a <b>cyclodialysis,</b> in which the ciliary body is cut from its attachment at the scleral spur under gonioscopic control.|$|E
50|$|It has a microlumen of 300 microns and is {{designed}} to augment outflow to the suprachoroidal space {{in order to control}} intraocular pressure; it is indicated for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma. The stent is implanted through an ab interno approach and inserted into the supraciliary space (between the ciliary body and sclera), effectively creating a controlled <b>cyclodialysis</b> cleft, which is kept open by the device.|$|E
50|$|Intraocular {{pressure}} may {{be lowered}} by allowing drainage of aqueous humor {{from within the}} eye to the following routes: (1) filtration through the sclerostomy around {{the margins of the}} scleral flap into the filtering bleb that forms underneath the conjunctiva, (2) filtration through outlet channels in the scleral flap to underneath the conjunctiva, (3) filtration through connective tissue of the scleral flap to underneath the conjunctiva. into cut ends of Schlemm's canal, (4) aqueous flow into cut ends of Schlemm's canal into collector channels and episcleral veins and (5) into a <b>cyclodialysis</b> cleft between the ciliary body and the sclera if tissue is dissected posterior to the scleral spur.|$|E
50|$|The CyPass Micro-Stent is {{the first}} MIGS device {{developed}} for lowering of IOP through the suprachoroidal space (virtual space between the choroid and sclera created by implantation of the device), {{a part of the}} uveoscleral outflow pathway for aqueous humor. The uveoscleral pathway is an important pathway for aqueous outflow and drainage which can account for up to 57% of total outflow. <b>Cyclodialysis</b> cleft procedures were initially used to access this pathway with significant IOP lowering, but the cleft was prone to high anatomic variability as well as early postoperative closure {{due to the lack of}} a permanent drainage implant with a standardized and uniform conduit.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the clinical effect of vitrectomy combined with <b>cyclodialysis</b> repair on primary stage for complicated ocular trauma with <b>cyclodialysis.</b> METHODS: The 13 consecutive cases(13 eyes) of complicated ocular trauma with <b>cyclodialysis</b> from January 1, 2011 to October 31, 2014, were treated and studied, including 2 contusions, 7 penetrating injuries and 4 rupture injuries. The concomitant symptoms were corneal laceration, limbus laceration, scleral laceration, hyphema, iridodialysis, mydriasis, traumatic cataract or lens dislocation, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal contusion, retinal detachment, choroid contusion, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, intraocular foreign body, etc. The preoperative visual acuity(VA) ranged from light perception(LP) to hand movement(HM) or before eye(BE). The <b>cyclodialysis</b> {{was determined by}} ultrasound bio-microscopy(UBM), three-mirror contact lens or was found in operation. The limits of <b>cyclodialysis</b> were about 2 : 00 ～ 6 : 00 o'clock. Intraocular pressures(IOP) of contusion eyes before surgeries were 5. 4 mmHg and 10. 2 mmHg. The operation opportunity was 6 h～ 3 d after injuries and the main operation stages included closing wound in cornea and sclera, vitrectomy, lensectomy, and/or removal of intraocular blood, retinal reattachment, <b>cyclodialysis</b> repair by suturing. The external scleral puncture and draining were carried out in suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Inert gas or silicon oil was tamponaded. RESULTS: The ciliary body reattached in all cases determined by UBM and three-mirror contact lens. The BCVA was improved to HM/BE～ 4. 7 and the IOP was 9. 8 ～ 24. 5 mmHg at 1 mo after surgeries, except that one eye was corneal edema after corneal laceration sutura. Retinal reattachment was determined by ultrasound or ophthalmoscope examination.

40|$|AIM:To {{explore the}} {{operation}} methods and effects for wide range cyclodialysis(≥ 180 °) sutured under the interrupted scleral flaps. METHODS:Thirteen patients(13 eyes) with wide range traumatic <b>cyclodialysis</b> received surgeries. Intermittent lamellar scleral flaps {{were made in}} the region of <b>cyclodialysis.</b> Each flap was 5 mm wide, and the distance between two flaps was 2 mm. Then the deep lamellar was cut 1. 5 mm behind the limbus and the <b>cyclodialysis</b> was sutured. Intraocular pressure, visual acuity, anterior chamber depth and complications after the surgery were observed. The follow-up time was 3 ～ 6 mo. RESULTS:The visual acuity of all patients improved to varying degrees, the anterior chamber depth returned to normal, and no obvious complications such as severe corneal astigmatism, anterior segment ischemia or others occurred in all patients after the surgery. The <b>cyclodialysis</b> was completely fixed in 11 eyes(85 %, 13 eyes in total) after the first operation. And the <b>cyclodialysis</b> was completely fixed in other 2 eyes(15 %) after the second operation on 30 d and 35 d respectively. Postoperative ocular hypertension occurred in 8 eyes.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} effects and {{complications}} of direct cyclopexy (DC) versus vitrectomy, endophotocoagulation, and gas/silicone oil endotamponade (VEE) treatment {{in patients with}} <b>cyclodialysis</b> and persistent hypotony. METHODS: This is a prospective, comparative, nonrandomized clinical trial which includes 52 patients with <b>cyclodialysis</b> and persisting hypotony. Fifty-two patients suffering from <b>cyclodialysis</b> and persistent hypotony in one eye were divided into 2 groups (groups DC and VEE) and treated, respectively, with direct cyclopexy or vitrectomy, endophotocoagulation, and gas/silicone oil endotamponade. The patients were followed up for 12 months. Assessments included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber volume (ACV) and subjective rating of the pain caused by the treatments. RESULTS:After a follow-up of 12 months, significant improvement was seen in postoperative mean BCVA, IOP, ACD and ACV in both treatment groups (which {{were not significantly different}} from each other). The success rates for the treatments were not significantly different (DC: 50. 0 % vs VEE: 62. 5 %, P= 0. 383). Postoperative morbidity of cataract and subjective pain rating were significantly higher in the VEE group vs the DC group (P= 0. 003 and P< 0. 001 respectively). CONCLUSION: DC and VEE were effective surgical procedures in treating patients with <b>cyclodialysis</b> and persistent hypotony. Patients had better tolerance to DC treatment and VEE was more likely lead to cataract complications. Taking into consideration the ease of the operation, success rate, and patient comfort, DC treatment seems preferable to VEE treatment in patients with simple <b>cyclodialysis.</b> While VEE has the advantage of treating patients with <b>cyclodialysis</b> combined with vitreous hemorrhage...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY A case is {{reported}} {{of a young}} man in whom blunt injury caused a horizontal corneal tear superiorly. Aniridia, aphakia, <b>cyclodialysis</b> with angle recession, minimal hyphaema, vitreous haemorrhage, choroidal rupture and striae, and scleral buckling resulted. Vision improved to 6 / 12 +. Aniridia from blunt or perforating injuries usually occurs in association with severe damage to the eye. ' Aniridia with aphakia resulting from such injuries is rare. To find <b>cyclodialysis,</b> angle recession, choroidal ruptures and striae, and scleral buckling associated with aniridia and aphakia with an intact vitreous face and minimal hyphaema must be unique.

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} efficacy of vitrectomy combined with two surgical methods {{for the treatment}} of complex <b>cyclodialysis.</b> METHODS: The clinical data of 42 patients(42 eyes) with cyclodialysis(the range of fracture≥ 60 °) accompanied by injured lens and vitreoretinopathy were retrospectively analyzed. They were all examined by B-ultrasound and ultrasound biomicroscopy(UBM) before surgeries. They were divided into group A(20 eyes) with vitrectomy combined with ciliary body scleral interrupted suture and group B(22 eyes) with vitrectomy combined with ciliary body scleral continuous mattress suture. In the group A, the suture was performed first, then the vitrectomy. In the group B, the lentectomy and vitrectomy were performed first, then the continuous mattress suture suture. Postoperative visual acuity, intraocular pressure(IOP), the condition of ciliary body reset and the suture time for ciliary body reset were observed and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: After operations, the visual acuity and IOP had {{no significant differences between the}} two groups(P > 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractA 29 -year-old male {{experienced}} abrupt visual loss in {{the left}} eye following an elastic cord rebounding injury that resulted in ocular hypotony. He received topical atropine and prednisolone eye drops {{for more than one}} month without improvement. On examination, his visual acuity was 1. 0 OD and counting fingers at 80 cm OS. Initial intraocular pressure (IOP) was 15 mmHg OD and 6 mmHg OS. Gonioscopic evaluation of his left eye revealed a <b>cyclodialysis</b> cleft positioned between 6 and 7 o'clock. A fundus photograph showed signs of hypotony maculopathy including optic disc edema, tortuous vessels, and chorioretinal folds. B-scan ultrasound displayed choroidal thickening and optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated macular edema, subretinal fluid, retinal striae, and choroidal folds. Pars plana vitrectomy and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) tamponade were performed. After gas absorption, IOP was 11 mmHg OS and remained steady during follow-up.

40|$|AIM—To {{introduce}} a new concept of anterior chamber angle microsurgery, designed to scrape pathologically altered trabecular meshwork from the scleral sulcus as a potential treatment in primary open angle glaucoma.  METHODS—Gonioscopically controlled ab interno abrasion of the trabecular meshwork was performed on six human eye banking eyes for morphological analysis. Thereafter, four eyes suffering from terminal glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy {{as a result of}} medically uncontrolled intraocular pressure were also treated by `goniocurettage'. The newly designed instrument resembles a modified <b>cyclodialysis</b> spatula with a bowl-shaped tip, 300  µm in diameter, and with its edges sharpened. The treatment zone comprised 4 - 5 clock hours of the chamber angle circumference.  RESULTS—Microscopic examination of the treatment zone revealed that in addition to a complete disruption of the trabecular meshwork and internal wall of Schlemm's canal goniocurettage also caused damage to intracanalicular septa. A splitting along the posterior wall of Schlemm's canal was also noted in one specimen. The clinical data of goniocurettage also showed some promising results. Mean pretreatment IOP averaged 40. 7  (SD 8. 8) mm Hg (range 32 - 51 mm Hg) and was significantly (p< 0. 04) reduced to 18. 0  (4. 2) mm Hg (12 - 22 mm Hg) after 6  months, representing an absolute decrease in IOP of 22. 7  mm Hg and a mean decrease in IOP of 56 %. Clinically significant hyphaema occurred in one eye, caused by iatrogenic trauma to a prominent chamber angle vessel. In three eyes a minor reflux of blood occurred at the treatment site. However, no hypotony, choroidal effusion, flattened anterior chamber, or <b>cyclodialysis</b> were observed in these patients.  CONCLUSION—Morphological analysis of treated postmortem eyes confirmed that goniocurettage completely removed the trabecular meshwork and opened Schlemm's canal, ensuring direct access into the anterior chamber. In a small number of patients over a limited period of time this new surgical procedure resulted in a clinically significant pressure reduction. However, longer term follow up and a greater number of patients are warranted before this experimental procedure is applicable to eyes that would do well with conventional surgery. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Ultrasound {{biomicroscopy}} (UBM) is a {{non-invasive procedure}} to visualise {{the structures of}} the anterior segment using high frequency ultrasound. Any abnormalities in the structures like the iris, ciliary body and zonules can be easily detected. In case of corneal oedema, the Descemet’s membrane can be detected with UBM than the slit-lamp biomicroscopy. It plays a useful diagnostic tool in glaucoma. It differentiates between open and closed angle closure. It also helps in the diagnosis of plateau iris configuration and malignant glaucoma. Bleb status and tenon’s cyst can be visualized by the UBM. It {{plays a major role}} to rule out angle recession or <b>cyclodialysis</b> cleft in cases of trauma. Zonular dialysis and iridodialysis as well as the integrity of the posterior capsule can be assessed with UBM. It is the only modality which can easily diagnose pars plannits or cyclitic membranes noninvasively.

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{curative}} effect of treating small-incision cataract extraction by intraocular lens implantation combined with trabeculectomy for primary angle-closure glaucoma with cataract. METHODS: Totally 44 cases(52 eyes) of primary angle-closure glaucoma combined with cataract {{were selected to}} undergo the combined surgery, in order to observe the patients' pre- and postoperative eyesights, intraocular pressures and the postoperative complications. RESULTS: The postoperative eyesight was improved significantly {{as compared with the}} preoperative eyesight. The intraocular pressure was declined dramatically. The result was of statistical significance(P 0. 05). All the 52 cases' surgeries were performed by the same surgeon. The surgeries were processed smoothly, with 6 postoperative eyes of anterior chamber inflammation cell response, 3 eyes of anterior chamber fibrinoid exudate, 2 eyes of shallow anterior chamber through mydriasis and treatment with glucocorticoids and non-steroidal eyedrops before absorption, and no complications like malignant glaucoma, <b>cyclodialysis,</b> etc. were reported through mydriasis and pressure bandaging before recovery.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the use of}} high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) {{in the assessment of}} hypotony and in particular to {{determine the}} proportion of cases for which UBM contributed significant additional hitherto unaccessible information. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ultrasound biomicroscopy was performed in a standard manner, using a Humphrey UBM 840 system (Humphrey Instruments, Inc., San Leandro, CA). UBM findings were analysed and the clinical relevance of UBM information was determined for the whole collective. RESULTS: Twelve patients with hypotony were examined. UBM findings contributed essential information that allowed to reach a diagnosis or that determined the therapeutic attitude in 10 of the 12 hypotonic patients. In two cases the cause of hypotony was tractional ciliary body detachment, in 5 cases it was post-inflammatory atrophy of the ciliary body, in 3 cases it was post-traumatic irido and <b>cyclodialysis,</b> in one case it was supraciliary and suprachoroidal effusion and in the last case it was due to uveal effusion syndrome. Based on these findings we established a schematic approach for hypotony. CONCLUSIONS: This procedure enabled us to assess the morphological changes found in patients with hypotony. In a majority of cases UBM was useful either to orient therapeutic intervention or to establish a diagnosis. On the base of our findings a schematic approach for hypotony, using UBM, was established...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Early {{elevated}} {{intraocular pressure}} (IOP) following pars plana vitrectomy {{is a common}} complication of vitreoretinal surgery and severe pressure elevation may result in visual loss. To investigate the mechanism of IOP elevation following pars plana vitrectomy, a retrospective review of 119 patients (132 eyes) who had undergone vitreoretinal surgery was performed. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) was used to observe {{the changes in the}} structure of the anterior segment following vitrectomy and to compare various parameters pre- and postsurgery. The UBM examination revealed inflammation within the anterior chamber and hyphema with increased IOP. In certain patients, the iris had adhered to the trabecular meshwork and the anterior chamber angle was closed. <b>Cyclodialysis</b> involving the pars plicata and iris was also observed. Furthermore, silicone oil emulsification in the anterior chamber angle and posterior chamber presurgery were noted in certain cases. Edema and forward rotation of the ciliary body resulted in the closure of the anterior chamber angle. The measured parameters indicated that the anterior chamber became shallower and that the anterior chamber angle was narrowed in phakic eyes with elevated IOP. Eyes with elevated IOP and intraocular lenses were not observed to be different from phakic eyes with elevated IOP. This may be due to the fact that an eye with an intraocular lens is thinner than a phakic eye. This study suggests that UBM examination is useful for investigating the pathogenesis of elevated IOP following vitrectomy, and provides a theoretical basis...|$|E
40|$|HYPERTONIC {{solutions}} {{have been}} used to reduce the intra-ocular pressure in glaucoma since Cantonnet (1904) first used hypertonic salt solution. The effect of different substances was extensively studied by Hertel (1914), who administered many different solutions, including urea, to rabbits, and measured the resulting fall in intra-ocular pressure. Substances used in clinical practice include sucrose, dextrose, and sorbitol, which act by in-creasing the osmotic pressure of the blood; hence it is their concentration in molecules and not their weight in grammes that is significant. The dis-advantages of sucrose are that it has a large molecular weight so that large amounts of it have to be given to exert sufficient osmotic pressure, and that it is also nephrotoxic and diffuses rapidly in the tissues. Dextrose and saline also diffuse in the tissues too rapidly to produce an effect of sufficent duration so that a rebound of intra-ocular pressure quickly occurs. The efficiency of sorbitol is doubtful and it is also said to be nephrotoxic. Bellows, Puntenney, and Cowen (1938) found its effect to be greatest 24 hours after administration, which could not have been due to its osmotic effect. Urea {{has been used as a}} diuretic in cases of oedema and also for reducing the intracranial pressure from various causes (Stubbs and Pennybacker, 1960). The need for an osmotic agent for reducing intra-ocular pressure has been much less since the introduction of carbonic anhydrase inhibitory drugs, but a few patients become resistant or intolerant to these drugs. Urea can be used to reduce the pressure before operation on glaucomatous eyes. The dangers of operating on eyes in which the intra-ocular pressure is raised include haemorrhage, prolapse of iris, lens, and vitreous, and expulsive haemorrhage. It obviates the need for a posterior sclerotomy when operating on cases of malignant glaucoma, before <b>cyclodialysis</b> and injection of air into the anterior chamber. Techniqu...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Since {{the first}} attempt at {{glaucoma}} surgery in 1830 many surgical procedures have been devised and adopted depending on {{the understanding of the}} aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease. Trabeculectomy, the most recent drainage procedure for glaucoma, has become a widely used, effective, and safe method, particularly for chronic simple glaucoma. Up to 4 years ' follow-up of 66 eyes (55 patients) is reported. The findings at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years were in agreement with previous reports by other authors. The main postoperative complication was transient hyphaema. Of the total number of eyes, 7 needed miotic drops and 5 required further surgical procedures to control the intraocular pressure. Since Cairns described trabeculectomy,l it has been adopted by many ophthalmic surgeons, as it is a relatively effective and safe drainage procedure, particularly for chronic simple glaucoma. The previously described drainage procedures of anterior sclerotomy, partial sclerotomy and iridec-tomy, <b>cyclodialysis,</b> iridencleisis, corneoscleral tre-phine and iridectomy, and sclerocautery have all been found to be unsatisfactory for some reason or other, among which the following are the com-monest. (1) Loss ofanterior chamber. The anterior chamber was lost or became very shallow during surgery or postoperatively, with resulting complications such as anterior synechiae formation, secondary glau-coma, and cataract. (2) Infection. Owing to the superficial situation of the bleb (being covered only by the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule) infection was the most feared complication. Some eyes were lost as a result of intraocular spread of the infection, resulting in panophthalmitis. (3) Large bleb. In some eyes the bleb became so large that it not only became cosmetically embarras-sing but also covered the cornea and the pupil, causing visual disturbance. (4) Malignant glaucoma. Some eyes developed malignant glaucoma soon after surgery. This was due to the forward displacement of the vitreous and the iris-lens diaphragm obstructing the pupil and the outflow of the aqueous humour...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic <b>cyclodialysis</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} by several authors {{during the last decade}} (Sedan, I 966; Turut, Constantinides, and Asseman, I 971). Romem and Singer (1973) described a case of traumatic aniridia without prolapse of iris through an external wound. Trobe and Keeney (1974) reported three cases of traumatic aniridia all of which were accompanied by perforating wounds involving the cornea. This is a report of a case of traumatic cyclo-dialysis with extrusion of most of the iris through a scleral perforation. Case report A 25 -year-old White female agricultural worker was admitted to the ophthalmic department of the Barzilai Medical Centre, Ashkelon, after an injury to her left eye caused by a screwdriver (Figure). The injury had been accidentally self-inflicted two hours earlier as she had been trying to repair a tubing of metal in the cow-shed. The visual acuity in the right eye was 6 / 6, and examination of that eye including the fundus revealed nothing abnormal. The visual acuity in the left eye was hand movements with good perception of light. The upper lid was swollen with ecchymoses and abrasions of the skin. There was conjunctival injection. On the medial side about 4 mm from the limbus, a brown oval mass could be seen under the abraded conjunctiva. The cornea was clear and did not show any signs of per-foration. The anterior chamber was filled with blood and it was impossible to see any further details. The eye was hypotonic, tension by Schiotz tonometry was 5 - 5 /I 6. It was decided to proceed with exploration of the ocular injury under general anaesthesia. An operation was performed on the day of admission. On exposure of the sclera medially, a mass of soft brown tissue was seen within the scleral wound which extended along a course roughly parallel to the limbus from 7. 0 o'clock 3 mm from the limbus to io. o o'clock 9 mm from the limbus. It was necessary to separate the medial rectus from its insertion to obtain adequate exposure of the scleral wound. The brown mass was identified as prolapsed iris and it was excised level with the sclera. After the excision the intact ciliary body was seen in th...|$|E
