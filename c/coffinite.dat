40|$|New mineralogical {{data are}} {{presented}} for shear-zone hosted uranium mineralisation from selected uranium deposits {{that occur in}} the Bohemian Massif. The uranium mineralisation is in high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Moldanubian Zone and/or in granitic rocks of the Moldanubian batholith and Bor pluton as complex uraninite–coffinite and uraninite–coffinite–brannerite assemblages. For analysed <b>coffinites</b> and brannerites, anomalous enrichment of Y (up to 3. 4 wt % Y 2 O 3) and Zr (up to 13. 8 wt % ZrO 2) is significant. The microprobe data indicate that <b>coffinites</b> from the Rožná and Okrouhlá Radouň uranium deposits contain variable PbO (0 – 4. 3 wt %), FeO (0 – 2. 5 wt %), Al 2 O 3 (0 – 3. 5 wt %), P 2 O 5 (0 – 1. 8 wt %), and CaO (0. 7 – 3. 5 wt %). Brannerite is present in unaltered and altered grains with variable concentrations of U 4 + (0 – 0. 5 apfu), U 6 + (0. 06 – 0. 49 apfu), Ti (0. 90 – 2. 63 apfu), Ca (0. 09 – 0. 41 apfu), and low concentrations of Al (0 – 0. 19 apfu), Th (0 – 0. 04 apfu), Y (0 – 0. 08 apfu), Zr (0 – 0. 13 apfu) and REE (0 – 0. 14 apfu) ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Coffinite</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in sedimentary uranium deposits in the Colorado Plateau region, but {{has also been}} discovered in sedimentary uranium deposits and hydrothermal veins in many other locations. [...] Samples of <b>coffinite</b> from the Colorado Plateau were found with black fine-grained low-valence vanadium minerals, uraninite and finely dispersed black organic material. [...] Other materials associated with later finds from the same region were clay and quartz. [...] In vein deposits of the Copper King Mine in Colorado, <b>coffinite</b> was also found to occur with uraninite and pitchblende. [...] <b>Coffinite</b> is metastable compared to uraninite and quartz, thus formation of <b>coffinite</b> requires a uranium source in reducing conditions, {{as evidenced by the}} associated presence of low-valence vanadium minerals. [...] Silica-rich solution provides such a reducing condition in cases where <b>coffinite</b> results as an alteration product of uraninite. [...] Hansley and Fitzpatrick also noted that the brownish color of their <b>coffinite</b> samples was caused by organic material, leading them to conclude that <b>coffinite</b> can also form in low temperature conditions if organic carbon is present. [...] This finding is consistent with the <b>coffinite</b> samples of the Colorado Plateau, which included fossilized wood. [...] In China, <b>coffinite</b> can be found in granite in addition to sandstone. [...] Hansley and Fitzpatrick concluded that coarse-grained <b>coffinite</b> most likely forms in high temperature environments.

5000|$|A large {{percentage}} of the Earth’s uranium supply is contained in <b>coffinite</b> deposits, which is significant because of uranium’s uses in nuclear energy and weaponry applications.

[...] Researchers at Harvard University, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and several other institutions attempted unsuccessfully to synthesize <b>coffinite</b> in the mid-1950s after its initial discovery.

[...] The central uranium site of <b>coffinite</b> is surrounded by eight SiO4 tetrahedra. The lattice dimensions of naturally-occurring and synthetic <b>coffinite</b> are similar, with a naturally-occurring sample from Arrowhead Mine, Mesa County, Colorado having a=6.93kx, c=6.30kx, and a sample synthesized by Hoekstra and Fuchs having a=6.977kx and c=6.307kx.|$|E

5000|$|Coffinite's {{chemical}} formula is U(SiO4)1−x(OH)4x. [...] X-ray powder patterns from samples of <b>coffinite</b> allowed geologists to classify it {{as a new}} mineral in 1955.

[...] Preliminary chemical analysis indicated that the uranous silicate exhibited hydroxyl substitution. [...] The results of Sherwood’s preliminary chemical analysis were based on samples from three locations. Hydroxyl bonds and silicon-oxygen bonds also proved to exist after infrared absorption spectral analyses were performed. [...] The hydroxyl substitution occurs as (OH)44− for (SiO4)4−. [...] The hydroxyl constituent in <b>coffinite</b> later proved to be nonessential in the formation of a stable synthetic mineral.
