5000|$|The role of cross <b>cousins</b> <b>is</b> {{especially}} important in some cultures. For example, marriage is promoted between them in the [...] Iroquois system. Parallel <b>cousins</b> <b>are</b> occasionally the subject of promoted marriage, such as the preferential marriage of a male to his father's brother's daughter, common among some pastoral peoples. Such a marriage helps keep property within a lineage. On the other hand, parallel cousin unions in some cultures would fall under an incest taboo, since parallel <b>cousins</b> <b>are</b> part of the subject's unilineage whereas cross <b>cousins</b> <b>are</b> not.|$|R
5|$|However, modern {{historians have}} {{challenged}} existing information on Taksony's early life. A nearly-contemporaneous sourceLiudprand of Cremona's Retributionnarrates that Taksony led a plundering raid against Italy in 947, {{which suggests that}} he was born considerably earlier than 931. His father's reign was preserved only in the Gesta Hungarorum; its anonymous author lists Zoltán among the grand princes, and all later Hungarian monarchs were descended from him. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus wrote around 950 that Fajsz, Taksony's <b>cousin,</b> <b>was</b> grand prince of the Hungarians at that time.|$|E

Jacz Transportation bought a truck {{three days after the}} city sold it to a Franklin Park dealership and then leased it back to the city. Gyrion was accused of failing to disclose his mother-in-law's role in the Hired Truck Program and the transfer of the truck.

About 35% of the 70 firms in the program were suspended or referred to the city's Inspector General. The program was overhauled in 2004, and phased out in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Abdullah was {{succeeded by}} his son Talal, who would soon abdicate due to illness in favour of his eldest son Hussein. Talal {{established}} the country's modern constitution in 1952. Hussein ascended to the throne in 1953 {{at the age of}} 18. Jordan witnessed great political uncertainty in the following period. The 1950s were a period of political upheaval, as Nasserism and Pan-Arabism swept the Arab World. On 1 March 1956, King Hussein Arabized the command of the Army by dismissing a number of senior British officers, an act made to remove remaining foreign influence in the country. In 1958, Jordan and neighbouring Hashemite Iraq formed the Arab Federation {{as a response to the}} formation of the rival United Arab Republic between Nasser's Egypt and Syria.

5000|$|In many [...] "classificatory" [...] {{systems of}} kinship terminology, {{relatives}} far beyond genealogical first <b>cousins</b> <b>are</b> referred {{to using the}} terms for parallel and cross cousins. And in many societies, parallel cousins (but not cross <b>cousins)</b> <b>are</b> also referred to by the same terms that are used for siblings. For instance, it is characteristic of the [...] "Iroquois" [...] system of kinship terminology, its variants the [...] "Crow" [...] and [...] "Omaha", and most Australian Aboriginal systems, that a male parallel <b>cousin</b> <b>is</b> referred to as [...] "brother", and a female parallel <b>cousin</b> <b>is</b> [...] "sister". In an Iroquois type of terminology, if the terms {{used to refer to}} cross <b>cousins</b> <b>are</b> assimilated to those for other relatives, it is generally in-laws (since marriage with cross-cousins is often preferentially favored), so that the terms for [...] "male cross-cousin" [...] and [...] "brother-in-law" [...] are the same, as are the terms for [...] "female cross cousin" [...] and [...] "sister-in-law".|$|R
