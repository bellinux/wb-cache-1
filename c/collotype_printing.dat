50|$|His work first {{appeared}} for a wider public in 1888 in the publication In den Kedaton te Jogjåkartå by Isaäc Groneman. The book included 16 <b>collotype</b> <b>prints</b> {{of the art}} of Hindu Javanese dances. Groneman wished to generate interest in this culture in the Netherlands and requested permission from Sultan Hamengkubuwana VII for Cephas to photograph the dance scenes. The publication was originally prepared by the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, but the high cost of <b>collotype</b> <b>prints</b> forced the institute to abandon it. In keeping with the technological advances of photography, Cephas bought a new camera in 1886 which enabled him to capture pictures in 1/400th of a second. This allowed the subjects to be photographed more quickly rather than having to remain still for several moments. These pictures were often presented as farewell presents to European elites when they left Yogyakarta to return to Europe and to Dutch civil servants.|$|R

40|$|Historically the {{producers}} of <b>collotype</b> <b>printing</b> have been secretive and taken a proprietary attitude toward the production of collotype prints. Therefore, knowledge about and information on {{the growth of the}} collotype industry has been minimal. Although the collotype process produces prints that are amoung the most beautiful and delicate of any graphic arts medium, collotypes presently are rarely produced commercially or even as an artistic medium. Eventually, the making of collotypes will be a lost art. The primary objective of this thesis was to produce a portfolio of photographic images which illustrates all of the production steps in the making of a collotype print. Included with the photographic essay is a condensed history of collotype, a technical review of the <b>collotype</b> <b>printing</b> process, and analysis of the present state of <b>collotype</b> <b>printing.</b> This thesis endeavors to ensure that the techniques used to produce collotype prints are accurately documented. In addition, the thesis presents an illustrated record of the contemporary <b>collotype</b> <b>printing</b> process. To ensure the proper procedures and techniques necessary to produce a quality collotype print, a collaboration with an expert collotype printer was initiated. Thus, the <b>collotype</b> <b>printing</b> and subsequent photographic documentation was done with Kent Kirby at his Light-print Press in Alma, Michigan. Kirby {{is one of a handful}} of individuals working in collotype today, and his studio is one of the last remaining collotype studios in the world. He is an expert collotype printmaker and the author of Studio Collotype, (1988) the most comprehensive manual on <b>collotype</b> <b>printing.</b> Though his book contains extensive information about collotype, it lacks a visual narrative of the collotype process. In addition to the photographic documentation, there is a written description of the <b>collotype</b> <b>printing</b> process. This includes sections on the press, plate preparation, plate exposure, substrate information, printing techniques, ink and its application, and dampening solutions. This thesis project also includes a historical background of the process and an analysis concerning the state of contemporary collotype for commercial and artistic applications. The research includes information gathered during interviews with expert contemporary collotype printers such as Kent Rush of the University of Texas, San Antonio, James Hajicek of Arizona State University and Kent Kirby. In addition, interviews were conducted with Michael Intrator of Black Box Collotype, Andre DePolo of Alinari Archive, Florence, Italy, Ms. Leibiger of Lichtdruck Grafisches Zentrum fur Druckkunst, Dresden, Germany, and Tom Reardon, formerly with The Jaffe Heliochrome Press, New York as to their insight into the demise of the commercial collotype. The backbone of this thesis project is a portfolio of eighteen original black-and-white matted and mounted silver prints that photographically document the collotype process. In addition to the documentary photographs, the portfolio also contains an original photograph and an original collotype reproduction. These two images enable the reader to compare the original silver print photograph and a photomechanical reproduction of it...|$|E

The design of textual databases to act as archives or information repositories is dependant {{on a number of}} contributory factors which this paper aims to address. The primary consideration is how the information is to be viewed and interrogated by the end user, as this affects both the information collation and the structure of the archive. In order to plan this successfully {{there are a number of}} different agencies; and issues arising from how these agencies interact, to be taken into consideration. The agencies involved include both human and non-human factors which interact forming a single network. The two main non-human factors are the information content, primarily text and images, and the software used in the construction. The methods used in designing and constructing the database will decide the number of human agencies involved, whether the different stages are undertaken by the same individual / group or whether each stage is the responsibility of a different agency. Design in this sense refers to both the aesthetic or visual representation of the user interface and the architecture of the database. This paper will look at the design and construction of a digital archive using the collotype database, designed by the Centre for Fine Print Research, U. W. E. as a case study. This archive holds a variety of technical and contextual historical data relating to the 19 th Century photo-mechanical <b>collotype</b> <b>printing</b> process. Strategies of interaction are built into the architecture of the database to enable the end user to retrieve information. In order for this to occur successfully the data has to be collated and broken down into various sets. Relationships between these sets then have to be mapped to allow access to this content from various routes as different narrative paths are followed...|$|E
40|$|Thirkell's {{research}} into collotype has investigated {{a new area}} of image-making {{in the field of}} fine art print. Through adapting what has historically been a highly specialized reproductive medium, a fusion of old and new has been brought to the creation and output of digitally mediated print. Collotype is a unique medium in that it renders images in continuous tone rather than the ubiquitous and cruder halftone method. The Centre for Fine Print Research's work into this process for rendering digitally mediated artists prints generated two large AHRB research grants between September 2001 - March 2004. The project led to a number of innovations, namely the adaption of digital output to produce continuous tone pre-press negatives {{and the development of a}} digital method for creating the non-standard, extended colour separation method common to traditional analogue collotype. The paper outlined a number of the project's findings; these included the production of collotype compatible digital negatives, methods for making customized colour separations using digital technology and the production of traditional high quality collotype inks. The significance of collotype and the characteristics of its inks were discussed in an interview with Thirkell on Material World, BBC Radio 4, 13 June 2002.

40|$|Curated by Dr Paul Thirkell this {{exhibition}} features prints and print-related artefacts resulting {{from some of}} the Centre’s many research projects. It includes artworks that explore the possibilities of several almost forgotten high quality nineteenth century printing processes through to the latest cutting- edge digital printing techniques. One of the over-arching themes of much of its research involves the integration of the best of the old with the advances of the present to facilitate new and increasingly comprehensive means of expression for artists. As well as work exploring the possibilities of combining digital imaging techniques with rare old processes such as <b>collotype,</b> <b>printed</b> enamels and an obscure photo ceramic printing technique, the exhibition aims to reveal the potential of some of the newer imaging technologies that have recently emerged. Through its research activities, the Centre has attracted collaborative ventures with a number of internationally important artists. One such artist, Richard Hamilton (the founding father of the British Pop art movement), produced a major work ‘The Typo Topography of Marcel Duchamp’s Large Glas’s in collaboration with the Centre in 2003. Besides work from its diverse projects and collaborations, {{this exhibition}} features prints commissioned by the CFPR from five artists especially for this show. Working in conjunction with researchers from the Centre, the five artists: Susan Collins, Charlotte Hodes, Paul Hodgson and Neeta Madahar and Jo Lansley - selected for their innovative work with new forms of digital imaging - all produced a series of ambitious prints that, along with the other pieces in the exhibition, reveal some of the exciting new horizons in print currently being explored by contemporary artists. ‘Committed to Print' review of exhibition, in Printmaking Today Vol 16 No 3 (2007) p 5 Dates: 3 June - 22 July 2007, Sharples and Winterstokes Galleries, The Royal West of England Academy, Bristol 22 August – 25 October 2008, Northern Print Gallery, Stepney Bank, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE 1 2 NP 21 November 2008 – 31 January 2009 London Print Studio, 425 Harrow Rd, London W 10 4 RE 16 th September – Saturday 19 th September 2009 FBlock Gallery, Faculty of Creative Arts, University of the West of England as part of the IMPACT Multi-disciplinary Printmaking Conference...|$|R
40|$|CREASING INSTABILITY OF HYDROGELS AND ELASTOMERS MAY 2014 DAYONG CHEN, B. S., TIANJIN UNIVERISTY M. S., TIANJIN UNIVERSITY M. S., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Ph. D., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Professor Ryan C. Hayward Soft {{polymers}} {{placed under}} compressive stress can undergo an elastic creasing instability in which sharp folds spontaneously {{form on the}} free surfaces. This process may {{play an important role}} in contexts as diverse as brain morphogenesis, failure of tires, and electrical breakdown of soft polymer actuators. While the creasing instability has been used for <b>collotype</b> <b>printing</b> since as early as the 1850 s, the scientific appreciation of this instability has become popular only recently and our understanding of this instability is still quite limited. In chapter 2, we describe a simple experimental system to study creasing of thin elastomer films under uniaxial compression. The equilibrium depths, spacings and shapes of creases are characterized and found to show excellent agreements with numerical results. Further, we use this system to explore the important roles played by surface energy. Creases have been found to form in a nucleation and growth fashion, with surface energy providing a barrier in both processes. While this process may {{play an important role in}} a variety of materials failures, it can also be harnessed to fabricate dynamic chemical patterns and as a new method for lithography. To understand the role of creasing in materials failures or to engineer it for applications, the study of hysteresis in creasing is of vital importance. In Chapter 3, we review that different degrees of hysteresis have been observed in different systems. By changing the interface energy, we for the first time show that it is the self-adhesion at the folding region rather than plastic deformation that gives rise to hysteresis. We design a soft elastic bilayer that can snap between the flat and creased states repeatedly, with hysteresis. The strains at which the creases form and disappear are highly reproducible, and are tunable over a large range, through variations in the level of pre-compression applied to the substrate and the relative thickness of the film. The introduction of bistable flat and creased states and hysteretic switching is an important step to enable applications of this type of instability. In chapter 4, we design experiments to show that creases can also form on the interface of two soft hydrogels. In comparison with surface creases, which form self-contact, interfacial creases take on a singular non-self-contacting 2 ̆ 2 V 2 ̆ 2 shape. Interfacial creases form at higher strain than surface creases, but always form prior to interface wrinkles. In chapter 5, we show how the morphology and onset of creases depend on materials properties, geometry, loading history, as well as stress states. While several results are promising, we also propose better experimental setups to facilitate future studies and better control crease morphology. In chapter 6, we introduce an application of the creasing instability, where we utilize creased hydrogels as a dynamic platform to apply tensile strain on cells. We have demonstrated that using temperature as a stimulus, cultured muscle cells can be mechanically deformed with different strain states and amplitudes. This experiment also, for the first time, achieves local actuation of creasing instability with pneumatic/hydraulic pressure. Creases actuated by microfluidics offer potential for realization of high-throughput cell stretching devices on single cell level, through which different strain states, amplitudes, as well as loading rate and frequency could be modulated to mimic the mechanical environment cells experience in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{researchers}} at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR) have been reappraising 19 th Century print processes for {{the last fifteen years}} and Hoskins has published on the continuous tone properties of Woodburytype and its relation to other 19 thC processes such as photo-ceramics in previous papers to the IS&T PICT (1) and EI in 2003 (2). Since the invention of Walter Bentley Woodbury’s ‘Woodburytype process in 1865 (3), it has been possible to autographically print a true continuous tone black and white photographic image. New research at CFPR builds upon previous research to combining 19 th Century Photomechanical techniques with digital technology to reappraise the potential of these processes CNC milled relief printing blocks from which casts are taken will enable a physical and tactile surface quality that more closely resembles the autographic surface of the Woodburytype and the three colour carbon printing processes. Therefore this latest research aims to explore the potential of creating coloured pictorial imagery from a continuous tone relief surface. The specific context for the research is to create a surface quality and visual appearance that retains the character of the earlier autographic processes, such as letterpress and screen printing, which are undergoing a revival, This is happening for two reasons, one, for their hand crafted content, and secondly, because they create a physical and tactile surface that has a subjective quality, hard to define using standard testing methodologies. To prove the potential the research team have been using CNC milled images where the height of the relief image is dictated by creating a tone curve and then milling this curve into a series of relief blocks from which the image is cast in a silicone ink. A translucent image is cast from each of the colour matrices and each colour is assembled - one on top of another - resulting is a colour continuous tone print, where colour tone is created by physical depth of colour. A number of factors have come together to enable a reappraisal of continuous tone printing. Software is now readily available that will split a photographic image into a bump map image where the Z-axis corresponds to a set of height steps on a tonal step wedge from black to white. This software is easily transcribed to either a DXF for processing in G Code to CNC (Computer Numeric control) in order mill an image. In addition new silicone materials have become more readily available that can be precisely coloured. The aim is to create a digitally initiated, physical tactile surface that retains the qualities of arlier autographic process which is capable of being transferred to a range of substrates and demonstrates the potential for future research into new methods of continuous tone printing. This research {{is part of a larger}} parallel research project to investigate the potential of creating a physically printed relief surface that better represents the autographic mark making requirements of visual artists and designers.

40|$|Visual {{history is}} gaining respect as a portal to the past, and one {{individual}} who {{stands out in}} depicting life on the northern Great Plains of the American West is Laton Alton Huffman. This book is a splendid celebration of Huffman 2 ̆ 7 s life work, first as post photographer at Fort Keogh in 1879 where he made portraits of Indians {{near the end of}} the Indian Wars, and later as a professional photographer in Miles City, Montana, where he recorded life on the frontier, including buffalo, cattle ranching, hunting, small town life, western personalities, reservation life, and the beginning of the end of the old West with the arrival of the railroad, farmers, and fences. Huffman inspired several of the great western painters including Ed Borein, Frederick Remington, and his good friend Charley Russell. His photographs were also used for many years by authors and editors to illustrate magazines, books, pamphlets, and calenders, among them Harper 2 ̆ 7 s Weekly, Roycroft publications, and Century Magazine. The book addresses one of the difficult issues surrounding the authorship of nineteenth- century photography, since it was customary then to print a photographer 2 ̆ 7 s work under another photographer 2 ̆ 7 s imprint. For example, Huffman published Stanley Morrow 2 ̆ 7 s views of the Custer battlefield under his own name, while William Hook published Huffman 2 ̆ 7 s images under the Hook imprint. Huffman used many formats of photography and image reproduction in carrying out his business, leaving to today 2 ̆ 7 s collector and researcher a rich and varied archive of albumen prints made with the wet plate process, dry plate silver prints, and rich photomechanical <b>collotype</b> <b>prints</b> and postcards, many of which were hand colored. Stereoviews, postcards, cabinet cards, panoramas, and a wide variety of larger prints are reproduced in the book from the impressive collection of rare book dealers Gene and Bev Allen. To explain fully the power of this presentation of Huffman 2 ̆ 7 s body of work, one notes that no cost was spared in printing the illustrations in full color on a heavy, coated paper that brings out the detail and charm of the images and formats of expression Huffman used to share his experience and vision of life on the Great Plains.
