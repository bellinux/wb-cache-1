40|$|Microfluidics is {{a rapidly}} growing field of {{biomedical}} engineering with numerous applications such as diagnostic testing, therapeutics, and research preparation. Cell enrichment for automated diagnostic is often assayed through measurement of biochemical and biophysical markers. Although biochemical markers have been widely used, intrinsic biophysical markers, such as, Shear migration, Lift force, Dean force, and many other label-free techniques, are advantageous since they don’t require costly labeling or sample preparation. However, current passive techniques for enrichment had limited adoption in clinical and cell biology research applications. They generally require low flow rate and low cell volume fraction for high efficiency. The <b>Control</b> <b>increment</b> filtration, T-shaped microfluidic device, and spiral-shaped microfluidic devices will be studied for single-cell separation from aggregates. <b>Control</b> <b>increment</b> filtration works like the tangential filter; however, cells are separated based off of same amount of flow rate passing through large space gaps. Main microchannel of T-Shaped is connected to two perpendicular side channels. Based off Shear-modulated inertial migration, this device will enable selective enrichment of cells. The spiral shaped microfluidic device depends on different Dean and lift forces acting on cells to separate them based off different sizes. The spiral geometry of the microchannel will enable dominant inertial forces and the Dean Rotation force to cause larger cells to migrate to the inner side of the microchannel. Because manipulation of microchannel dimensions correlates {{to the degree of}} cell separation, versatility in design exists. Cell mixture samples will contain cells of different sizes and therefore design strategies could be utilized to maximize the effectiveness of single-cell separation...|$|E

The testing was conducted in the 7 - by 10 -Foot Transonic Tunnel at the David Taylor Research Center and the Langley 7 - by 10 -Foot High-Speed Tunnel. The principal objectives of the testing were {{to determine the effects}} of the Mach number and the strake plan form on the strake yaw control effectiveness and the corresponding strake vortex induced flow field. The wind tunnel model configurations simulated an actuated conformal strake deployed for maximum yaw control at high angles of attack. The test data included six-component forces and moments on the complete model, surface static pressure distributions on the forebody and wing leading-edge extensions, and on-surface and off-surface flow visualizations. The results from these studies show that the strake produces large yaw <b>control</b> <b>increments</b> at high angles of attack that exceed the effect of conventional rudders at low angles of attack. The strake yaw <b>control</b> <b>increments</b> diminish with increasing Mach number but continue to exceed the effect of rudder deflection at angles of attack greater than 30 degrees. The character of the strake vortex induced flow field is similar at subsonic and transonic speeds.

Such atelectasis and airways closure lead to gas exchange and lung mechanics impairment and {{has the potential to}} develop an inflammatory response in the lungs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of two psychophysical experiments designed to investigate the effects of size, location, blur, and contrast on the perceived visual interest of objects within images. In the first experiment, digital composting was used to create images containing objects (humans, animals, and non-living objects) which varied in <b>controlled</b> <b>increments</b> of size, location, blur, and contrast. Ratings of perceived interest were then measured for each object. We found that: (1) As object size increases, perceived interest increases but exhibits diminished gains for larger sizes; (2) As an object moves {{from the center of the}} image toward the image’s edge, perceived interest decreases nearly linearly with distance; (3) Blurring imposes a substantial initial decrease in perceived interest, but this drop is relatively lessened for highly blurred objects; (4) As an object’s RMS contrast is increased, perceived interest increases nearly linearly. Furthermore, these trends were quite similar for all three categories (human, animal, non-living object). To determine whether these data can predict the perceived interest of objects in real, non-composited images, a second experiment was performed in which subjects rated the visual interest of each of 562 objects in 150 images.

40|$|T {{cell receptors}} (TCRs) {{are key to}} antigen-specific {{immunity}} and are increasingly being explored as therapeutics, most visibly in cancer immunotherapy. As TCRs typically possess only low-to-moderate affinity for their peptide/MHC (pMHC) ligands, there is a recognized need to develop affinity-enhanced TCR variants. Previous in vitro engineering efforts have yielded remarkable improvements in TCR affinity, yet concerns exist about the maintenance of peptide specificity and the biological impacts of ultra-high affinity. As opposed to in vitro engineering, computational design can directly address these issues, in theory permitting the rational control of peptide specificity together with relatively <b>controlled</b> <b>increments</b> in affinity.

40|$|A {{new member}} of the family of {{long-range}} predictive controllers is shown to be suitable for the adaptive control of processes with varying parameters, dead-time and model-order. Key Words [...] Adaptive control; predictive control; LQ control; self-tuning control; nonminimum-phase plant. Akstraet [...] Current self-tuning algorithms lack robustness to prior choices of either dead-time or model order. A novel method [...] generalized predictive control or GPC [...] is developed which is shown by simulation studies to be superior to accepted techniques uch as generalized minimum-variance and pole-placement. This receding-horizon method epends on predicting the plant's output over several steps based on assumptions about future control actions. One assumption [...] that there is a "control horizon " beyond which all <b>control</b> <b>increments</b> become zero [...] is shown to be beneficial both in terms of robustness and for providing simplified calculations. Choosing particular values of the output and control horizons produces as subsets of the method various useful algorithms uch as GMV, EPSAC, Peterka's predictive controller (1984, Automatica, 20, 39 - 50) and Ydstie's extended-horizon design (1984, IFAC 9 th World Congress, Budapest, Hungary). Hence GPC can be used either to control a "simple " plant (e. g. open-loop stable) with little prior knowledge or a more complex plant such as nonminimum-phase, open-loop unstable and having variable dead-time. In particular GPC seems to be unaffected (unlike pole-placement strategies) if the plant model is overparameterized. Furthermore, as offsets are eliminated by the consequence of assuming a CARIMA plant model, GPC is a contender for general self-tuning applications. This is verified by a comparative simulation study. 1...|$|R

We investigated the effects of externally applied downsizing on the observed in-plane forces and valvular dimensions. MethodsFive animals were included in an acute porcine study.

The annulus was downsized with the sutures in <b>controlled</b> <b>increments</b> while measuring the tension force in the sutures. Downsizing percentages ranged from a 2 % to 32 % reduction of the T-P distances. Sonomicrometry {{was used to measure}} the resulting valvular dimensions. ResultsNo difference in force was found between the P 1, P 2, and P 3 segments across all levels of downsizing. The peak forces at 32 % downsizing were 1. 2 ± 0. 9 N, 1. 5 ± 1. 0 N, and 0. 8 ± 0. 2 N for the T-P 1, T-P 2, and T-P 3 segments, respectively. The maximum total suture forces in the mitral plane during downsizing increased from 0. 12 ± 0. 03 N to 3. 5 ± 1. 3 N (P < . 005).

We investigated childhood growth patterns in relation to blood pressure and insulin sensitivity, measured by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, in young adults. We compared 29 subjects born preterm appropriate for gestational age, 28 subjects born preterm small for gestational age, and 30 subjects born at term with a normal birth weight. RESULTS. Insulin sensitivity expressed as Mi value (glucose disposal mg/kg/min (insulin levels pmol/l) × 100) was lower in infants in the POPS-AGA (18. 2) and POPS-SGA (15. 2) groups than in the CON group (24. 7). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) were higher in infants in the POPS-AGA (132 / 72) and POPS-SGA (127 / 71) groups than in the CON group (118 / 65). The preterm-born subjects, in lowest insulin sensitivity quartile had a higher height standard deviation score at ages 1, 2, and 5 years and a higher weight SD score at ages 2, 5, 10, 19, and 21 years than did those in the lowest insulin sensitivity quartile. The infants in the highest systolic blood pressure quartile had a higher height SD score at 3 months of age and at ages 2, 5, 10, 19, and 21 years and a higher weight SD score at ages 1, 2, 5, 10, 19, and 21 years than those in the lowest systolic blood pressure quartile.
