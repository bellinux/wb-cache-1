The scant values of Nb concentrations in freshwaters published include many values which are very close, or directly below, the detection limit of the technique used; when low values are reported, the techniques used often include solid phase extraction preconcentration; with the associated difficulty in obtaining low blanks and risk of incomplete resin desorption.

The new sorbent exhibits optimal sorption efficiency within pH 5. 6 and 7. 5. A portion of the sorbent may be used repeatedly for not less than 100 sorptiondesorption cycles. The sorbent indicates high sorption and elution effectiveness of ca. 96 and 99 %, respectively.

For example, the validity dates of a self-signed certificate might not be trusted because the entity could always create and sign a new certificate that contained a valid date range. The values in a self-signed certificate can be trusted when the following conditions are true: the values were (out-of-band) verified when the self-signed was formally trusted, {{and there is a}} method to verify the self-signed certificate has not changed after it was trusted.

30|$|As {{the method}} of how {{applications}} are made anonymous is crucial, the implementation of anonymous job applications may be easier—and less costly—in countries where applications include less information. International differences in this respect are substantial. For example, Shackleton and Newell (1994) investigate management selection methods in several European countries and conclude that a country’s culture, tradition and habits influence the methods of selection in a given company. This suggests first, that (national) recruitment cultures exist, and second, {{that it might be}} difficult to reform these historically developed cultures. One crucial factor in this regard is the amount of information in applications that is usually provided by the candidates and the amount of information that is required by firms. On the one hand, for example in Germany, application documents contain a lot of information of the applicant. These documents typically include a cover letter and a CV, usually covering personal characteristics such as the name, contact details, date and place of birth as well as a picture of the applicant. In particular, including a picture in the application seems to be culturally determined and, for example, specific to German recruitment habits. Moreover, it can consciously or unconsciously lead to good or bad impressions of the applicant, which in turn do not necessarily reflect a correct assessment of the applicant. It may therefore {{come as no surprise that}} removing the picture from the applications during the German experiment led to positive assessments of the recruiters. Besides a cover letter and a CV, applicants also include copies of the most important <b>certificates</b> and <b>references.</b> Whereas this practice provides a rather comprehensive impression of the applicant, standards are different in other countries. For example, the information that is provided by applicants in the United States is rather limited. Due to a fear of getting sued for discrimination, most firms do not even ask for detailed personal characteristics. Suing employers for discrimination is rather common in the United States and it can thus be seen as part of the recruitment culture. Explicitly asking for a certain race or gender has been illegal since the 1960 s (Darity and Mason, 1998).|$|R
