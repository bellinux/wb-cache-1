50|$|Following {{experimental}} research into NHE-activation {{and its effects}} on myocardial injury, <b>cariporide</b> was proposed for a Phase I trial to test whether inhibition of the NHE approves myocardial function in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA). Results of this trial were published in 2000. A group of 100 individuals were placed in two trial groups. The first group was given a 40-mg intravaneous bolus dose of <b>cariporide</b> prior to reperfusion. A second group was given a placebo. 21 days post-injection, patients in the <b>cariporide</b> group showed a number of improvements over the placebo group. This trial proved NHE inhibition with <b>cariporide</b> may be an effective way to aid recovery post-PCTA.|$|E
50|$|In all {{clinical}} trials, <b>cariporide</b> {{was given}} was an intravenous injection. Early clinical trials (see Phase I) showed significant improvements over a placebo at a 40-mg dose prior to arterial surgery. Both Phase III clinical trials for <b>cariporide</b> conclude {{that it is}} highly dose-dependent. While earlier trials showed that high doses of <b>cariporide</b> (120-mg, three times daily) may increase efficacy, the EXPEDITION trial found an increased rate of mortality associated with these higher doses.|$|E
50|$|Despite this result, <b>cariporide</b> showed {{promise in}} the post-coronary artery bypass {{grafting}} (CABG) sub-group of patients. Here, {{there was a}} 25% reduction in post-surgery mortality or MI, suggesting that high-doses and prolonged releases of <b>cariporide</b> may be efficacious for high-risk patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cariporide</b> {{targets and}} {{inhibits}} the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) isoform 1, which is ubiquitously expressed {{and involved in}} pH regulation of the myocardium. During myocardial ischemia, NHE activation leads to an influx of Na+ and, upon reperfusion, reverses the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and results in an overload of intracellular Ca2+. By inhibiting the NHE1, <b>cariporide</b> limits the early influx of Na+ and lends a cardioprotective effect upon ischemia/reperfusion. Additionally, <b>cariporide</b> slows the normalization of cellular pH following an H+ efflux during reperfusion triggered by ischemia-induced acidosis.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{findings}} of the EXPEDITION trial in 2003, research into <b>cariporide</b> has slowed. The increased risk of mortality associated with high concentrations and the lack of efficacy at low concentration make it unlikely that <b>cariporide</b> will reach market as a cardioprotective agent during ischaemia and reperfusion.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{goals of}} the GUARDIAN trial were to assess (1) the rate of death or {{myocardial}} infarction at day 36 in the four trial groups and (2) the large-scale safety and side effects associated with <b>cariporide.</b> Results showed that 20- and 80-mg doses were statistically similar to the placebo group, while the 120-mg group showed a 10% relative risk reduction and similar mortality rates. While <b>cariporide</b> showed efficacy for certain sub-groups of patients at varying drug concentrations, overall the GUARDIAN trial showed that <b>cariporide</b> did not significantly reduce patient risk of myocardial infarction or mortality.|$|E
50|$|However, {{more recent}} {{research}} has been conducted into <b>cariporide</b> as an anti-cancer treatment.

40|$|Background/Aims: Na+/H+ {{exchanger}} 1 (NHE 1) is {{an important}} regulator of intracellular pH (pHi). High pHi is required for cell proliferation and differentiation. Our previous study has proven that the pHi of mesenchymal stem cells is {{higher than that of}} normal differentiated cells and similar to tumor cells. NHE 1 is highly expressed in both mesenchymal stem cells and tumor cells. Targeted inhibition of NHE 1 could induce differentiation of K 562 leukemia cells. In the present paper we explored whether inhibition of NHE 1 could induce differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Methods: MSCs were obtained from human umbilical cord and both the surface phenotype and functional characteristics were analyzed. Selective NHE 1 inhibitor <b>cariporide</b> was used to treat human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs). The pHi and the differentiation of hUC-MSCs were compared upon <b>cariporide</b> treatment. The putative signaling pathway involved was also explored. Results: The pHi of hUC-MSCs was decreased upon <b>cariporide</b> treatment. <b>Cariporide</b> up-regulated the osteogenic differentiation of hUC-MSCs while the adipogenic differentiation was not affected.

40|$|Reperfusion therapy, though {{inevitable}} {{in case of}} myocardial infarction, may worsen myocardial tissue damage by reperfusion injury. One putative mechanism involves activation of the NHX-exchanger during ischemia/reperfusion and secondary to that activation of the Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger, which may induce cytosolic calcium overload and hypercontracture. Ischemia/Reperfusion can also activate the adhesion cascade and the subsequent inflammatory response. <b>Cariporide</b> is a NHX-exchanger inhibitor which reduced myocardial reperfusion injury and the inflammatory response in pre-clinical studies. In our study we aimed {{to answer the following}} questions: 1. Is the anti-inflammatory action of <b>cariporide</b> mediated by reduced endothelial expression of the adhesion moleculesICAM- 1 and E-Selectin? 2. Is this effect of <b>cariporide</b> associated with a reduction ofthe cytosolic calcium concentration? To examine the first question, HUVECS (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) were incubated with eitherCariporide or the solvent DMSO. We stimulated HUVECS with TNF-alpha (up from 0 to 100 U/mL). Incubation timewas 24 hours to detect ICAM- 1 and 5 hours to detect E-selectin expression. After staining with a fluorescent antibody, measurements were performed using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). TNF-alpha induced a significant rise of the fluorescence for ICAM- 1 and E-selectine (p < 0, 001). After pre-treatment of the HUVECS with <b>Cariporide</b> this increase in adhesion molecule expression was completely suppressed. To examine the second question, HUVES were loaded with the calcium sensitive fluorescent dye Fluo- 4. Cells had been cultured in calcium free or calcium-containing buffer. HUVECS were then incubated with <b>Cariporide</b> or DMSOand stimulated with a sub-maximal dose of TNF-alpha. <b>Cariporide</b> decreased the cytosolic calcium concentrationof cells cultured in calcium-containing medium nearly as much as culture in calcium-free medium. TNF-alpha had no influence on the cytosolic calcium concentration. <b>Cariporide</b> inhibits the expression of the pro-inflammatory adhesion molecules ICAM- 1 and E-selectin induced by TNF-alpha. Although calcium is not directly involved as second messenger in the signal cascade of the TNF-alpha-receptor, the reduction of the cytosolic calcium concentration to sub-normal values by <b>Cariporide</b> may be involved in this effect...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Activation of the sodium-hydrogen ion {{exchange}} mechanism results in accumulation of intracellular calcium through the sodium-calcium ion antiport mechanism. Administration of a sodium-hydrogen {{ion exchange}} inhibitor before or during ischemia attenuates myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. However, the cardioprotection exerted by sodium-hydrogen ion exchange inhibitors as adjuncts to cardioplegia without perioperative {{administration has not}} been tested in a model of surgical reperfusion of acute coronary occlusion with cardiopulmonary bypass. This study tested the hypothesis that sodium-hydrogen ion exchange inhibitor-supplemented blood cardioplegia would reduce postcardioplegia injury after severe regional ischemia. Methods: In anesthetized open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 75 minutes, after which total cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated. After crossclamping, cold (4 °C) antegrade blood cardioplegia was delivered every 20 minutes {{for a total of}} 60 minutes of cardioplegic arrest. In 8 dogs, the blood cardioplegic solution was unsupplemented (vehicle group), whereas in 8 others the solution was supplemented with the sodium-hydrogen ion exchange inhibitor <b>cariporide</b> (10 μmol/L, <b>cariporide</b> group). Results: In the in vitro studies, the direct effects of <b>cariporide</b> on neutrophil function were determined. Isolated canine neutrophils were stimulated by platelet activating factor. <b>Cariporide</b> attenuated superoxide anion production in a concentration-dependent manner, with no appreciable effect at 10 μmol/L (the concentration used in blood cardioplegia) and a peak effect at 100 μmol/L. In the in vivo cardiopulmonary bypass model, infarct size was significantly (P <. 05) smaller in the <b>cariporide</b> group than in the vehicle group (22. 4 % ± 3. 5 % vs 40. 1 % ± 5. 1 % of area at risk), although there were no group differences in postischemic regional wall motion after 2 hours of reperfusion (0. 1 % ± 0. 9 % vs − 0. 2 % ± 0. 3 % systolic shortening). Transmural myocardial edema in the area at risk was significantly decreased in the <b>cariporide</b> group (80. 6 % ± 0. 5 %) relative to the vehicle group (83. 1 % ± 0. 6 %). Myeloperoxidase activity in the area at risk, an index of neutrophil accumulation, was significantly lower in the <b>cariporide</b> group than in the vehicle group (4. 7 ± 0. 9 absorbence units/[min · g tissue] vs 10. 3 ± 2. 3 absorbence units/[min · g tissue]). In isolated postischemic left anterior descending coronary artery rings, maximum relaxation in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine was significantly greater in the <b>cariporide</b> group than in the vehicle group (77. 5 % ± 7. 4 % vs 51. 4 % ± 8. 0 %), whereas smooth muscle relaxation in response to nitroprusside was comparable between groups. Conclusion: In this canine model, supplementation of blood cardioplegia with <b>cariporide,</b> a sodium-hydrogen ion exchange inhibitor, reduced infarct size, attenuated neutrophil accumulation in the area at risk, and reduced postischemic coronary artery endothelial dysfunction without directly inhibiting neutrophil activity. <b>Cariporide</b> as an adjunct to blood cardioplegia without perioperative administration attenuated surgical ischemia-reperfusion injury in jeopardized myocardium.

Methods: Sixteen Yorkshire-Duroc pigs (27 - 34 kg) receiving cardiopulmonary bypass underwent either cardiopulmonary bypass alone (control, n = 4) or 30 minutes of normothermic ischemia, followed by 30 minutes of blood reperfusion (n = 12). Six hearts were treated with 5 mg/kg <b>cariporide</b> administered intravenously 15 minutes before ischemia. Results: Cardiopulmonary bypass alone caused no changes. Conversely, 30 minutes of global normothermic ischemia caused 33 % mortality and, in survivors, depression of left ventricular function to 22 % ± 6 % of baseline preload recruitable stroke work and increased creatine kinase MB by 406 % (88 ± 13 U/L), conjugated dienes by 17 % (161 ± 0. 2 AU/mL), and myeloperoxidase activity by 297 % (0. 036 ± 0. 005 U/g). Myocardial edema developed (3. 5 % water gain). Coronary sinus endothelin 1 increased by 111 % (2. 05 ± 0. 38 pg/mL), and nitric oxide production decreased by 10 %. These adverse effects were limited by pretreatment with <b>cariporide,</b> which allowed complete survival and restored preload recruitable stroke work to 78 % ± 11 %.

This study evaluated the role for NHE- 1 in diabetic cataract formation and retinal oxidative stress and apoptosis. Control and streptozotocin-diabetic rats were maintained with or without treatment with the NHE- 1 inhibitor <b>cariporide</b> (Sanofi-Aventis, 10 mgkg- 1 d- 1) for 3. 5 months.

A several-fold increase of the by-product of glycolysis, α-glycerophosphate, indicative of activation of {{the upper part of}} glycolysis, was present in both rat lens and retina at an early (1 -month) stage of streptozotocin-diabetes. <b>Cariporide</b> did not affect diabetic hyperglycemia and counteracted lens oxidative-nitrative stress and p 38 MAPK activation, without affecting glucose or sorbitol pathway intermediate accumulation.

The number of TUNEL-positive cells per flat-mounted retina was increased 4. 4 -fold in diabetic rats (101 ± 17 vs. 23 ± 8 in controls, P< 0. 01), and this increase was attenuated by <b>cariporide</b> (45 ± 12, P< 0. 01). Nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP-ribose) fluorescence and percentage of TUNEL-positive cells were increased in pericytes and endothelial cells cultured in 30 mM glucose, and these changes were at least partially prevented by <b>cariporide.</b> In conclusion, NHE- 1 contributes to diabetic cataract formation, and retinal oxidative-nitrative stress and apoptosis. The findings identify a new therapeutic target for diabetic ocular complications...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCariporide, an Na/H {{exchanger}} inhibitor, {{is a drug}} with cardioprotective properties. However, chronic {{treatment with}} <b>cariporide</b> may modify the protein phenotype of the cardiomyocytes. Disruption of the equilibrium between a cariporide-modified phenotype and the supply of <b>cariporide</b> could be deleterious. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the effects of this equilibrium rupture (EqR) on cardiac function at baseline and acute ischemia reperfusion. Rats were chronically treated with <b>cariporide</b> (2. 5 mg*kg*d) or with placebo for 21 days, after which isolated Langendorff-mode heart perfusion experiments utilized cariporide-free buffer. During this type of perfusion, the drug is rapidly cleared from the cellular environment. After 30 minutes of stabilization, the hearts were subjected to global zero-flow ischemia (25 minutes) followed by reperfusion (45 minutes). Measures of mechanical function, oxygen consumption, lactate plus pyruvate, CO 2 and proton release into the coronary effluent were determined. The gene and protein expression of proton extruders was also evaluated. Chronic <b>cariporide</b> administration followed by EqR reduced the expression of the Na/H exchanger, increased the expression of the HCO 3 or Na exchanger, decreased monocarboxylate/H carrier expression, reduced the lactate plus pyruvate release but did not change the glucose oxidation rate and mechanical function compared with baseline conditions. The resulting low glycolytic rate was associated with a stronger contracture during ischemia. During reperfusion, the early release of acidic forms was higher and redirected toward the use of the Na/H and HCO 3 /Na exchangers to the detriment of the safe monocarboxylate/H carrier. Both phenomena were assumed to increase the Na uptake and activate the Na/Ca exchanger, resulting in Na and Ca overload and further cellular damage. This explains the impaired recovery of the contractile function observed in the EqR group during reperfusion. In conclusion, although <b>cariporide</b> is usually cardioprotective, a disruption of its chronic treatment followed by an ischemia/reperfusion event can become deleterious...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the single vs the combined long-term inhibition of Na+–H+ exchanger- 1 (NHE- 1) and ACE in rats with {{congestive heart failure}} induced by myocardial infarction (MI). Rats with MI were randomized to receive either placebo, <b>cariporide</b> (3000 [*]p. p. m. via chow), ramipril (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1 via drinking water) or their combination for 18 weeks starting on day 3 after surgery. Cardiac morphology and function was assessed by echocardiography and {{by means of a}} 2. 0 [*]F conductance catheter to determine left ventricular (LV) pressure volume relationships. MI for 18 weeks resulted in an increase in LV end-diastolic diameter (LVDed) in the placebo-treated group when compared to sham (placebo: 1. 1 ± 0. 04 [*]cm; sham: 0. 86 ± 0. 01; P< 0. 05). Combined inhibition of NHE- 1 and ACE, but not the monotherapies, significantly reduced LVDed (1. 02 ± 0. 02 [*]cm). Preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW), dp/dtmax (parameter of systolic function) and end-diastolic pressure volume relationship (EDPVR, diastolic function) were significantly impaired in placebo-treated MI group (PRSW: 39 ± 7 [*]mmHg; dp/dtmax: 5185 ± 363 [*]mmHg[*]s− 1; EDPVR: 0. 042 ± 0. 001 [*]mmHg[*]μl− 1; all P< 0. 05). <b>Cariporide</b> treatment significantly improved PRSW (64 ± 7 [*]mmHg), dp/dtmax (8077 ± 525 [*]mmHg[*]s− 1) and EDPVR (0. 026 ± 0. 014 [*]mmHg[*]μl− 1), and reduced cardiac hypertrophy in rats with MI. Combined inhibition of NHE- 1 and ACE had even a more pronounced effect on PRSW (72 ± 5 [*]mmHg) and EDPVR (0. 026 ± 0. 014 [*]mmHg[*]μl− 1), as well as cardiac hypertrophy that, however, did not reach statistical significance compared to <b>cariporide</b> treatment alone. The NHE- 1 inhibitor <b>cariporide</b> significantly improved LV remodeling and function in rats with congestive heart failure induced by MI. The effect of <b>cariporide</b> was comparable or tended to be stronger (e. g. systolic function) compared to ramipril.

40|$|<b>Cariporide</b> − a {{selective}} inhibitor of the sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform- 1 − given during closed-chest resuscitation enables generation of viable perfusion pressures with less depth of compression. We hypothesized that such effect results from greater blood flows generated {{for a given}} depth of compression. Two series of 14 rats each underwent 10 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation followed by 8 minutes of chest compression before attempting defibrillation. Compression depth was adjusted to maintain an aortic diastolic pressure (ADP) between 26 and 28 mm Hg in the first series and between 36 and 38 mm Hg in the second series. Within each series, rats were randomized to receive <b>cariporide</b> (3 -mg/kg) or NaCl 0. 9 % (control) before starting chest compression.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Minimally {{invasive}} {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting (CABG), carried out on the warm beating heart, does not allow conventional myocardial protection. The objective {{was to investigate the}} possibility of enhancing tolerance to ischemia during short episodes of coronary artery occlusion, based on a pharmacological approach using a selective Na(+) /H(+) -exchange inhibitor (<b>cariporide)</b> or a serine protease inhibitor (aprotinin). METHODS: Four groups (n= 6 in each group) of sheep were subjected to 20 min of normothermic regional ischemia (first lateral branch of the circumflex artery occlusion) followed by 1 h of reperfusion. Regional wall thickening was measured using sonomicrometry, and expressed as the percentage of thickening fraction compared with baseline. Group I was the control with no treatment, group II received <b>cariporide</b> (1 mg/kg administered over 2 min prior to ischemia), group III was treated with aprotinin (2. 10 (6) kallikrein inactivation units (KIU) load followed by 500. 000 KIU/h). Group IV was treated with a combination of <b>cariporide</b> and aprotinin at the same concentrations as in groups II and III, respectively. RESULTS: Wall thickening measurements showed that, compared with control, <b>cariporide</b> was largely able to suppress secondary loss of wall thickening after initial recovery during early reperfusion. Wall thickening in the ischemic/reperfused myocardial area improved from 10 +/- 31 to 51 +/- 17 % at 1 h of reperfusion (P= 0. 002). Aprotinin improved wall thickening at the end of 1 h of reperfusion to 70 +/- 13 % (P= 0. 0001). However, in this group, there was a transient loss of regional contractility similar in amplitude and time course to the one observed in the control group. A combination of <b>cariporide</b> and aprotinin suppressed transient contractile loss and resulted in improved wall thickening at the end of 1 h of reperfusion (65 +/- 22 %, P= 0. 0002 vs. control). This value was not significantly different from the <b>cariporide</b> (P= 0. 263) or aprotinin (P= 0. 704) group. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that both Na(+) /H(+) -exchange inhibition and aprotinin administration are promising tools for cardioprotection during minimally invasive CABG. A combination of both treatments is able to adequately suppress loss of contractility during early reperfusion as a consequence of reperfusion injury, and results in significantly improved wall thickening at the end of 1 h of reperfusion. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose:Increased {{activity}} of the Na(+) /H(+) -exchanger (NHE- 1) in heart failure underlies raised [Na(+) ](i) causing disturbances of calcium handling. Inhibition of NHE- 1, initiated {{at the onset of}} pressure/volume overload, prevents development of hypertrophy, heart failure and remodelling. We hypothesized that chronic inhibition of NHE- 1, initiated at a later stage, would induce regression of hypertrophy, heart failure, and ionic and electrophysiological remodelling. Experimental approach:Development of heart failure in rabbits was monitored electrocardiographically and echocardiographically, after one or three months. Cardiac myocytes were also isolated. One group of animals were treated with <b>cariporide</b> (inhibitor of NHE- 1) in the diet after one month. Cytoplasmic calcium, sodium and action potentials were measured with fluorescent markers and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium content by rapid cooling. Calcium after-transients were elicited after rapid pacing. Sodium channel current (I(Na)) was measured using patch-clamp techniques. Key results:Hypertrophy and heart failure developed after one month and progressed during the next two months. After one month, dietary treatment with <b>cariporide</b> was initiated. Two months of treatment reduced hypertrophy and heart failure, duration of action potential QT-interval and QRS, and restored sodium and calcium handling and the incidence of calcium after-transients. In cardiac myocytes, parameters of I(Na) were not changed by <b>cariporide.</b> Conclusion and implications:In rabbit hearts with hypertrophy and signs of heart failure one month after induction of pressure/volume overload, two months of dietary treatment with the NHE- 1 inhibitor <b>cariporide</b> caused regression of hypertrophy, heart failure and ionic and electrophysiological remodelling.

40|$|Specific inhibitors of the sarcolemmal Na+/H+ {{exchanger}} (NHE) such as <b>cariporide</b> {{are being}} evaluated for cardioprotective therapy during cardiac surgery. We determined {{the effects of}} moderate hypothermia (25 °C), as occurs during cardiac surgery, on (1) sarcolemmal NHE activity and (2) the NHE-inhibitory potency of <b>cariporide,</b> in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes. As the index of NHE activity, trans-sarcolemmal acid efflux rate (JH) was determined by microepifluorescence in single cells (n= 8 to 11 per group), during recovery from intracellular acidosis in bicarbonate-free conditions. Initially, myocytes were subjected to two consecutive acid pulses; these both occurred at 37 °C in the normothermic control group but the second pulse was at 25 °C in the moderate hypothermia group. JH values obtained after the first pulse were superimposed in both groups, indicating comparable cell populations. However, after the second pulse, JH values in the moderate hypothermia group were approximately 50 % {{of those in the}} normothermic control group over the pHi range 6. 80 [*]–[*] 7. 10. Similar results were obtained in cells subjected to a single acid pulse at 37 or 25 °C, with JH values in the latter group measuring approximately 60 % of those in the former over the pHi range 6. 80 [*]–[*] 7. 10. <b>Cariporide</b> (0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 1, 0. 3, 1. 0 or 3. 0 [*]μM), present during recovery from a single acid pulse, reduced JH in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC 50 values of 150 and 130 [*]nM at 37 and 25 °C, respectively. We conclude that moderate hypothermia produces (1) a significant, but partial, inhibition of sarcolemmal NHE activity, and (2) no significant effect on the NHE-inhibitory potency of <b>cariporide...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abnormalities in {{intracellular}} pH regulation {{have been}} proposed {{to be important in}} type 2 diabetes and the associated cardiomyopathy and hypertension. We have therefore investigated the dependence of insulin-stimulated glucose transport on cytosolic pH in cardiomyocytes. Insulin treatment of cardiomyocytes resulted in a marked alkalinization of the cytoplasm as measured using carboxy-semi-napthorhodofluor- 1. The alkalinizing effect of insulin was blocked by treatment with either <b>cariporide</b> (which inhibits the Na+/H+ exchanger) or by bafilomycin A 1 (which inhibits H+-ATPase activity). After treatments with <b>cariporide</b> or bafilomycin A 1, insulin stimulation of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate- 1 phosphorylation and Akt activity were normal. In contrast, glucose transport activity and the levels of functional GLUT 4 at the plasma membrane (detected using an exofacial photolabel) were reduced by ∼ 50 %. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that insulin treatment caused a translocation of the GLUT 4 from perinuclear structures and increased its co-localization with cell surface syntaxin 4. However, neither <b>cariporide</b> nor bafilomycin A 1 treatment reduced the translocation of immunodetectable GLUT 4 to the sarcolemma region of the cell. It is therefore hypothesized that insulin-stimulated cytosol alkalinization facilitates the final stages of translocation and incorporation of fully functional GLUT 4 at the surface-limiting membrane...|$|E
40|$|Background—The transmembrane sodium/hydrogen {{exchanger}} maintains myocardial cell pH integrity during myocardial ischemia but paradoxically may precipitate cell necrosis. The {{development of}} <b>cariporide,</b> a potent and specific inhibitor of the exchanger, prompted this {{investigation of the}} potential of the drug to prevent myocardial cell necrosis. Methods and Results—A total of 11 590 patients with unstable angina or non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) or undergoing high-risk percutaneous or surgical revascularization were randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 3 doses of <b>cariporide</b> for the period of risk. The trial failed to document benefit of <b>cariporide</b> over placebo on the primary end point of death or MI assessed after 36 days. Doses of 20 and 80 mg every 8 hours had no effect, whereas a dose of 120 mg was associated with a 10 % risk reduction (98 % CI 5. 5 % to 23. 4 %, P 50. 12). With this dose, benefit was limited to patients undergoing bypass surgery (risk reduction 25 %, 95 % CI 3. 1 % to 41. 5 %, P 50. 03) and was maintained after 6 months. No effect was seen on mortality. The rate of Q-wave MI was reduced by 32 % across all entry diagnostic groups (2. 6 % versus 1. 8 %, P 50. 03), but the rate of non–Q-wave MI was reduced only in patients undergoing surgery (7. 1 % versus 3. 8 %, P 50. 005). There were no increases in clinically serious adverse events. Conclusions—No significant benefit of <b>cariporide</b> could be demonstrated across a wide range of clinical situations of risk. The trial documented safety of the drug and suggested that a high degree of inhibition of the exchanger could prevent cell necrosis in settings of ischemia-reperfusion.
