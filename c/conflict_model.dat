40|$|In this work, a {{new method}} to resolve {{conflict}} situations (Mcr) common in collaborative facility design using computer support tools is developed. The method uses traditional human conflict resolution approaches {{that have been}} used successfully by others.

A graph <b>model</b> for <b>conflict</b> resolution is used to facilitate <b>conflict</b> <b>modeling</b> and analysis, one of the incorporated principles for prevention of conflict perpetuation and escalation. The performance of the new method have been validated by implementing its conflict resolution capabilities in the Facility Description Language (FDL), a computer tool for collaborative facility design, and by applying Facility Description Language for Conflict Resolution (FDL-CR), to resolve typical aforementioned conflict situations. The results found in this research are: (1) incorporation of principles for prevention of conflict perpetuation and escalation improved effectiveness; (2) implementation of computer-based learning increased usefulness; and (3) integration of conflict detection and resolution resulted in increased effectiveness of the facility design process.

In a summary of the historiography of the conflict thesis, Colin A. Russell, the former President of Christians in Science, said that [...] "Draper takes such liberty with history, perpetuating legends as fact that he is rightly avoided today in serious historical study. The same is nearly as true of White, though his prominent apparatus of prolific footnotes may create a misleading impression of meticulous scholarship".|$|E
40|$|Courts in the United Kingdom {{currently}} {{employ a}} <b>conflict</b> <b>model</b> of adjudicating maternal / foetal issues. This thesis aims {{to expose the}} inadequacy of the current model, to evaluate alternative approaches, and ultimately to propose a property-based model of adjudicating pregnancy. I begin by surveying some of the case-law under the <b>conflict</b> <b>model</b> and discussing the model's shortcomings. On the practical level, the <b>conflict</b> <b>model</b> leads to negative perceptions of pregnant women, fails to reflect the realities of pregnancy, and embodies legal and logical inconsistencies. On the theoretical level, problems arise from the model's necessary characterisation of the foetus as a 'sentient non-person'. This is problematic for two reasons, which are explored in chapters two and three respectively: first, because the sentience of the foetus {{is a matter of}} controversy second, because the concept of personhood is deeply flawed and is anyway incapable of functioning as a determinant of moral status. Later I review an alternative to the <b>conflict</b> <b>model</b> which has been proposed by Eileen L McDonagh: her 'consent model' of pregnancy which characterises pregnancy as an 'intrusion' by the foetus upon the body of the mother and views the right to terminate pregnancy as a right of 'self-defence' against this intrusion. I conclude that McDonagh's thesis fails, ultimately, to provide a satisfactory alternative to the <b>conflict</b> <b>model.</b> My own alternative to the <b>conflict</b> <b>model,</b> developed in chapter five, proposes a departure from the metaphysical language of personhood and moral status, and a focus on the legal framework of property as a method of adjudicating maternal / foetal issues.

40|$|Work-family {{conflict}} is when work demands interfere {{with family and}} family demands interfere with work. Both work-family conflict and family-to-work conflict can be experienced and are linked with adverse consequences for employees. This study expands {{the literature on the}} predictors of work-family conflict by investigating the role of sense of coherence (SOC). The first two models examine the extent to which SOC predicts work-tofamily <b>conflict</b> (<b>Model</b> 1) and family-to-work <b>conflict</b> (<b>Model</b> 2) over and above known predictors such as demographics, work-related factors, and psychological adjustment. Model 3 tests the hypothesis that psychological-adjustment will mediate the relationship between SOC and work-to-family conflict. A cross-sectional survey design was employed using a sample of convenience consisting of employees working at least 2 days per week. In total 413 participants completed the online survey. Results indicated that while demographics, work demands, supervisor support, and psychological-adjustment predicted work-family <b>conflict</b> (<b>Model</b> 1) and family-work <b>conflict</b> (<b>Model</b> 2), contrary to hypothesis SOC did not have an effect over and above these variables.
