40|$|AbstractUsing {{dark-field}} microscopy, we {{have found}} that certain sugars <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> normal-to-curly helical transition of bacterial flagella. Titration of flagella isolated from Salmonella typhimwium with 16 different carbohydrates showed that: (i) only certain sugars <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> transition. There is no obvious relationship between the simple physico-chemical properties of the sugar and whether <b>the</b> sugar <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> transition or not; (ii) the efficacies of sugars that do <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> transition differ markedly. For these sugars there is a relationship between efficacy and molecular size. These results suggest that the specific, though weak, binding of sugars to sites on flagella <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> morphological transition...|$|R

5|$|An {{approaching}} trough {{over the}} central United States induced high wind shear over Sandy as it traversed the Bahamas, <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> hurricane to weaken to {{a tropical storm}} while turning more northeastward. The {{southern part of the}} trough detached, <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> shear to decrease late on October28 and allowing Sandy to regain strength. It attained a secondary peak of Category2 strength the following day, and later turned toward the west. During this change in direction, Sandy began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, a process it completed before making landfall near Brigantine, New Jersey, late on October29. The extratropical remnants weakened gradually overland, and the center of circulation was declared indistinguishable over western Pennsylvania two days later. In addition to becoming the largest Atlantic hurricane, Sandy broke records for the lowest pressures ever observed in many cities across the Northeastern United States.|$|E

5|$|Ancestors of {{contemporary}} salamanders were likely able to disperse and migrate into habitats of the Rocky Mountains and surrounding areas by the Eocene. Mesic forests {{were established in}} western North America by the mid Eocene and attained their contemporary range distributions by the early Pliocene. The temperate forest valleys and montane environments of these time periods (Paleogene to Neogene) would have provided the physiographic and ecological features supporting analogs {{of contemporary}} Ambystoma macrodactylum habitats. The Cascade Range rose during the mid Pliocene and created a rain shadow effect <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> xerification of the Columbia Basin and also altered ranges of temperate mesic ecosystems at higher elevations. The rise of the Cascades <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> xerification of the Columbia Basin is a major biogeographic feature of western North America that divided many species, including A.macrodactylum, into coastal and inland lineages.|$|E
