5|$|In March 2004, {{there was}} {{controversy}} in the Dáil surrounding a definition of 'spouse' when it was claimed that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Mary Coughlan was seeking to exclude non-married partners from social welfare legislation. The exclusion was a government response to a finding by the Equality Tribunal that a same-sex <b>couple</b> <b>was</b> discriminated against in travel privileges.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the 7s {{electrons}} are relativistically stabilized, so that in reducing conditions, only the 7p1/2 or 6d electron would be ionized, leading to the monovalent Lr+ ion. However, all experiments to reduce Lr3+ to Lr2+ or Lr+ in aqueous solution were unsuccessful, similarly to lutetium. On the basis of this, the standard electrode potential of the E°(Lr3+→Lr+) <b>couple</b> <b>was</b> calculated {{to be less than}} −1.56V, indicating that the existence of Lr+ ions in aqueous solution was unlikely. The upper limit for the E°(Lr3+→Lr2+) <b>couple</b> <b>was</b> predicted to be −0.44V: the values for E°(Lr3+→Lr) and E°(Lr4+→Lr3+) are predicted to be −2.06V and +7.9V. The stability of the group oxidation state in the 6d transition series decreases as RfIV > DbV > SgVI, and lawrencium continues the trend with LrIII being more stable than RfIV.|$|E

The proper design of the gear <b>couple</b> <b>is</b> particularly important {{for the production of}} internal gear pumps with good performances. In this paper, equations of fillet of internal gear <b>couple</b> <b>are</b> derived according to the given shape of rack-cutter fillet. With the help of Ansys Workbench, FEA analysis on meshing strength of the gear <b>couple</b> <b>is</b> implemented and effects of rack-cutter fillet on meshing strength are concluded in the end...|$|R

5|$|Many {{of those}} killed were tortured, beaten using chains and burned. Most {{of the victims were}} killed by gunshots, but the cause of death proved hard to {{establish}} for eight victims whose bodies were severely burned. A <b>couple</b> <b>was</b> bound with chains and burned alive, two women were killed using axes or similar sharp objects, one of them by several axe blows to her head. Another <b>couple</b> <b>was</b> beheaded and their heads were placed in bags. One victim was cut by a chain saw while still alive, and another died trapped in her house which was torched by the paramilitaries. The Serb civilian who attempted to protect the others was also beaten, tortured using lighted cigarettes and heated chains, and then flayed.|$|E

The <b>couple</b> <b>was</b> presented as supposed family members of the administrator; however, he later indicated that they were not his family, and that the criminal organization had either confused them or simply targeted a random family to pressure to administrator to close the page. Valor por Tamaulipas responded by sending a message to the authorities in Tamaulipas and blamed them for the death of a person who died of a cardiac arrest after the <b>couple</b> <b>was</b> kidnapped; the administrator also accused the Tamaulipas authorities of protecting Los Zetas drug cartel.|$|E
