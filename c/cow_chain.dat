Free style housing {{is where the}} cow is free to walk around and {{interact}} with its environment {{and other members of}} the herd. Tie stall housing is when the <b>cow</b> is <b>chained</b> to a stantion stall with the milking units and feed coming to them.|$|R

40|$|Supply chain {{restructuring}} {{and its impact}} on farmers’ situation have become the subject of vast interest among agricultural economists. However, there have been relatively few studies trying to quantitatively asses this issue. This paper analyses the impact of supply chain modernisation on dairy farmers in Poland. It is shown that joining the modern marketing channel positively affects farmers’ incomes. The decision to enter the modern channel is crucially dependent on access to funds and facilitated by having larger <b>cow</b> herds. supply <b>chain</b> restructuring, dairy sector, Poland, Agricultural Finance, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

By detailed descriptions of the implementation and systematic evaluations of the performance of the software on different types of systems, I show that the COW 14 architecture is capable of handling the creation of corpora of up to at least 100 billion tokens. I also introduce our running demo system which currently serves corpora of up to roughly 20 billion tokens in Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish, and Swedis...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{papillomavirus}} type 8 (BPV- 8) {{was first}} detected and described in teat warts {{as well as}} in healthy teat skin from cattle raised in Japan. The entire viral genome was sequenced in 2007. Additionally, a variant of BPV- 8, BPV- 8 -EB, was also identified from papillomatous lesions of a European bison in Slovakia. In Brazil, despite the relatively common occurrence of BPV infections, the identification and determination of viral types present in cattle is still sporadic. The aim {{of this study is to}} report the occurrence of the recently described BPV- 8 in Brazil. The virus was identified in a skin warts obtained from a beef cattle herd located in Parana state, southern Brazil. The papilloma had a macular, non-verrucous gross aspect and was located on the dorsal thorax of a <b>cow.</b> Polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction (PCR) was performed using generic primers for partial amplification of L 1 gene. The obtained amplicon (480 bp) was cloned and two selected clones were sequenced. The nucleotide sequence was compared to existing papillomaviral genomic sequences, identifying the virus as BPV type 8. This study represents the first report of BPV- 8 occurrence in Brazil, what suggests its presence among Brazilian cattle...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acid binding {{proteins}} (FABPs) bind long-chain {{fatty acids}} and {{are involved in}} their intracellular transport. Of the known bovine FABP genes, FABP 4 has been mapped to a region on chromosome 14 that contains quantitative trait loci for milk traits. This study investigated the association of FABP 4 haplotypes with milk production traits in 719 Holstein-Friesian × Jersey <b>cows.</b> Polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis of a variable region of the gene revealed three haplotypes (A, B and C). Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified: two in exon 3 and three in intron 3. A was associated (P = 0. 032) with increased milk protein percentage (present: 4. 00 ± 0. 02 %; absent: 3. 95 ± 0. 02 %) and B was associated (P = 0. 009) with increased milk yield (present: 23. 81 ± 0. 23 kg/d; absent: 23. 06 ± 0. 21 kg/d), but tended {{to be associated with}} a decrease in protein percentage and an increase in protein yield. Cows with genotypes AA, AB and AC produced less milk, but with a higher protein percentage than BC cows. This suggest that FABP 4 affects milk yield and milk protein content, both economically important traits, and that further study of this gene is warranted...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Heat stress {{produces}} {{oxidative stress}} and affects the alternation of plasma K+ and Na+. Since Na+,K+-ATPase {{is sensitive to}} oxidative stress and critical for maintaining the homeostasis of these two ions, we examined the genetic polymorphism of the ATP 1 A 1 gene in 160 Holstein <b>cows</b> using polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction low ionic strength single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods. G to A at position- 14103 in exon 14 and C to T at position- 14242 in intron 14 of the bovine ATP 1 A 1 gene were identified, but the former single nucleotide polymorphism was silent {{with respect to the}} amino acid sequence of the protein. However, we found significant correlations between ATP 1 A 1 gene polymorphism and the coefficient of heat tolerance (P < 0. 01) and with respiratory rate (P < 0. 01). Genotype AC was the most favorable genotype for heat tolerance. This polymorphism site has potential as a genetic marker for heat tolerance traits in dairy cattle breeding...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterium}} Listeria monocytogenes {{can cause}} the disease listeriosis in both humans and animals. For humans, the infection is mainly foodborne.

Different methods for visualising the genetic diversity among strains of L. monocytogenes were used in this thesis. L. monocytogenes can be established in food processing plants for long periods. Investigation of genetic diversity among strains isolated from a dairy during several years by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed indistinguishable restriction patterns.

Upon encountering one particular stand in which there were three pale honey coloured cows (with little room for themselves), some straw, a bucket of water, and Paul, a farmer‟s assistant. Two cows were lying down whilst the one in the middle stood and shuffled. Each <b>cow</b> sported a <b>chain</b> around her neck with her name on it. The one in the middle was named „Erica. ‟ Above the stand was a banner that read, „Most farmers prefer Blondes, ‟ a reference to the name given to this particular breed, the Blonde D‟Aquitaine. The following conversation took place: Erika: What‟s special about this breed? Why should farmers prefer them? Paul: Oh, they‟re easy to handle, docile really, they don‟t get the hump and decide to do their own thing. They also look nice, quite a nice shape, well proportioned. The colour‟s attractive too.

40|$|The Dutch Smart Dairy Farming (SDF) {{consortium}} {{works on}} {{proof of concept}} and on development of sensors, IT infrastructure, decision models and work instructions designed to support dairy farmers and farm advisors in extending the lifespan of their <b>cows.</b> Various companies (<b>chain</b> partners Friesland Campina, CRV and Agrifirm), IT companies and SMEs, knowledge institutions (WUR, TNO, UU, VHL) and dairy farmers are working together {{on the development of}} these innovative tools in the area of animal health, fertility and nutrition. For successful development of these tools, a platform is required to make real-time sensor data from different farms available to model developers. The data must be made available via a standard interface on an open platform in real time at the individual animal level. The concept of an InfoBroker is considered a breakthrough {{when it comes to making}} data stored in diverse places available in an efficient manner. The InfoBroker is capable of retrieving individual cow data from an unlimited number of sources while at the same time serving a large number of models on-demand. In the InfoBroker, the data which may be released are specified for each farm. This means that the farmer always stays in control. This consortium has already been working together for 4 years. This paper describes cooperation throughout the chain and the approach taken, pointing out that this is a critical factor in the uptake of smart farming...|$|R
