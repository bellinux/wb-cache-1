25|$|The {{church is}} {{rectangular}} in plan with an entrance foyer in the north-west corner, {{linked to a}} brick and concrete bell tower by a covered walkway. The main elevation {{of the church is}} asymmetrical, with the end walls of the wings flanking the central arch being constructed of different materials. The concrete parabolic arch is in-filled with a timber framed glazed wall, with a reinforced concrete <b>cross</b> <b>forming</b> the central spine and a raised brick garden bed running along the base. A series of horizontal ridges on {{the outer edge of the}} parabolic arch are remnants of the original roof cladding system. To the side of the arch is the end wall of the eastern aisle, which features small, cross-shaped openings in the brickwork, in-filled with glass. A plaque commemorating the laying of the foundation stone is located here. The entrance foyer on the western side is fully glazed with timber framing and a low brick garden bed along the north side.|$|E
40|$|Babesia microti, a hemoprotozoan {{parasite}} of rodents, is {{also important}} as a zoonotic agent of human babesiosis. The Maltese <b>cross</b> <b>form,</b> which consists of four masses in an erythrocyte, is characteristic of the developmental stage of B. microti. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2 - 1 E, which specifically recognizes the Maltese <b>cross</b> <b>form</b> of B. microti, has been described previously. In the present study, we examined {{the roles of the}} Maltese <b>cross</b> <b>form</b> during the infectious course of B. microti in mice. The number of the Maltese <b>cross</b> <b>form</b> increased in the peripheral blood of infected mice prior to the peak of parasitemia. With confocal laser scanning microscopy, MAb 2 - 1 E was found to be reactive with the ring form, with the parasites undergoing transformation to the Maltese <b>cross</b> <b>form</b> and subsequent division, and also with extracellular merozoites. Furthermore, the Maltese cross form-related antigen (MRA) gene was isolated from a B. microti cDNA library by immunoscreening with MAb 2 - 1 E, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. Genomic analyses indicated that the MRA gene exists as a single-copy gene in B. microti. Immunization of mice with recombinant MRA induced significant protective immunity against B. microti infection. These findings indicate that the Maltese <b>cross</b> <b>form</b> plays important roles in both the development of parasitemia and the protective response against the infection...|$|R

50|$|These {{fundraising}} initiatives were furthered in 1957, {{when the}} Community Fund partnered with the Mid-America Chapter of the American Red <b>Cross,</b> <b>forming</b> the Community Fund-Red Cross Joint Appeal.
