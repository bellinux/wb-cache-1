In a socialist society, <b>cooperative</b> <b>ownership</b> of property was considered a [...] "lower" [...] form of public ownership than state ownership. Khrushchev's proposal to expand <b>cooperative</b> <b>ownership</b> ran contrary to the Marxist theory as interpreted by Stalin. Suslov, who supported Stalin's economic policy, regarded Khrushchev's proposal as unacceptable on ideological grounds. In an election speech to the Supreme Soviet in March 1958, Suslov refused to recognise the ideological significance of Khrushchev's reform, preferring instead {{to focus on the}} reform's practical benefits in improving productivity.

2500|$|The Laurel {{apartment}} building on 82nd Street at Northern Boulevard {{was the first}} of the Queensboro Corporation buildings in Jackson Heights, completed in 1914. The building included a small courtyard. The Greystones on 80th Street between 35th and 37th Avenues were completed in 1918. The architect George H. Wells designed the Greystones, for which the Queensboro Corporation coined the name [...] "garden apartment" [...] to convey the concept of apartments surrounded by a green environment. With abundant land available, all unused space was used for parks and gardens, or for recreational areas that included a golf course. This was used in initial marketing efforts, although later much of the land was built upon. In 1919 the Corporation introduced the concept of <b>cooperative</b> <b>ownership</b> to strengthen the sense of community.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Hughes {{was born}} in Uffington, Oxfordshire, England in 1822. [...] In the 1830s, he {{attended}} the Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, where he was greatly influenced by the school's progressive headmaster, Thomas Arnold. [...] Both Rugby School and Arnold figured prominently in Hughes's 1857 novel, Tom Brown's School Days, and the school would eventually be the namesake for Hughes's utopian colony in Tennessee. [...] In Tom Brown's School Days, Hughes espoused the ideals of Christian socialism, namely the <b>cooperative</b> <b>ownership</b> of community businesses. [...] By the 1860s, Hughes had grown disenchanted with the materialism of late Victorian England. [...] He was disheartened {{by the fact that}} the talents of many of England's younger sons were wasted due to an economic recession and the medieval system of primogeniture, in which the oldest son inherited all of the family's land.|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} strategy of General Velasco's government {{was shaped by}} a conception frequently advocated in Latin America but rarely put into practice. The idea {{was to find a}} [...] "third way" [...] between capitalism and socialism, with a corporatist society much more inclusionary than that possible under capitalism but without rejecting private ownership or adopting any of the compulsory methods identified with communism. Under this strategy, land reform was designed to override existing property interests in order to establish <b>cooperative</b> <b>ownership,</b> rejecting both individual private farming and state farms. Promoting worker participation in ownership and management was intended to reshape labor relations. Foreign influences were reduced through tight restrictions on foreign investment and nationalization of some of the largest foreign firms. On a more fundamental plane, the Velasco government saw its mission as one of eliminating class conflict and reconciling differences among interest groups within its own vision of a cooperative society.|$|E

40|$|In modern economies, {{large-scale}} enterprise {{exhibits a}} variety of ownership forms. Most common and familiar is ownership by those persons [...] individuals or organizations [...] that supply the firm with financial capital. Other forms of ownership are important as well, however, including employee ownership (as in partnerships of professionals), ownership by suppliers of other factors of production (as in farm marketing <b>cooperatives),</b> <b>ownership</b> by customers (as in consumer-owned utilities, mutual insurance and banking companies, condominium housing, and business-owned wholesale, supply, and service cooperatives), nonprofit firms, and governmental enterprise. This essay briefly explores three questions raised by such a diverse pattern of ownership: First, {{to what extent do}} underlying economic factors account for variation in ownership forms across industries, across societies, and across time? Second, what is the influence of law upon these patterns? Third, to what extent has law, and particularly organizational law, adapted to facilitate the formation and management of the forms of ownership that have evolved?...|$|R
40|$|Cook’s (1995) {{life cycle}} theory of cooperatives predicts a {{rise and fall}} of cooperatives over time. He argues that cooperatives arise as a response, by {{producers}} or consumers, to some form of inefficiency in a market structure, for example an oligopoly. In such a market, the cooperative can thrive by replacing the ineffective firms until other firms or institutions or technology come along and deliver even better service. When this happens, the <b>cooperative’s</b> <b>ownership</b> and control features may hamper its ability to grow and compete. According to Cook, the cooperative will eventually need to change in order to accommodate investors, or it will be forced to exit the market. This article considers the case of Australia’s grain market within Cook’s framework to see if it has behaved as predicted and where it is heading in terms of responding {{to the needs of the}} agents in the market chain. In the 1980 s Australia’s grain cooperatives and institutions faced challenges from deregulation and changing market structure that exposed extensive inefficiency in th...|$|R

50|$|Cohousing {{communities}} in the U.S. currently rely on one of two existing legal forms of real estate ownership: individually titled houses with common areas owned by a homeowner association(condominium)s or a housing <b>cooperative.</b> Condo <b>ownership</b> is most common because it fits financial institutions' and cities' models for multi-unit owner-occupied housing development.

40|$|We are {{concerned}} with the design of a constitution for a firm - an ex ante contract which assigns residual rights of control (and possibly residual income rights) without reference to the issue to be decided. We focus attention on two polar constitutions: non-profit <b>cooperatives</b> and outside <b>ownership.</b> In the former, ownership is shared among a group of consumers on a one member, one vote basis. In the latter, all control rights and rights to residual income are allocated to an outsider. Ex post, agents are assumed to have asymmetric information, which rules out recontracting. We have two main results. First, in the case of perfect competition, an outside owner achieves the first-best; a cooperative typically does not, because the rent from any cost advantage relative to the market is used to shield members from competitive pressure, and the median voter's preferences may not reflect average preferences. Second, in the case where the members of a cooperative have common preference orderings they unanimously vote for the first-best; an outsider owner typically makes inefficient decisions, tailored to the marginal rather than to the average consumer. <b>Cooperatives,</b> firms, <b>ownership,</b> property right. ...|$|R

5000|$|Economic {{systems are}} {{commonly}} segmented by their property rights regime for {{the means of}} production and by their dominant resource allocation mechanism. Economies that combine private ownership with market allocation are called [...] "market capitalism", and economies that combine private ownership with economic planning are labelled [...] "command capitalism" [...] or dirigisme.

Some perspectives build upon this basic nomenclature to take other variables into account, such as class processes within an economy. This leads some economists to categorize, for example, the Soviet Union's economy as state capitalism based on the analysis that the working class was exploited by the party leadership. Instead of looking at nominal ownership, this perspective takes into account the organizational form within economic enterprises.|$|E
