40|$|In Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person, Harry Frankfurt {{put forward}} a theory that what is {{essential}} {{to be a person}} is second-order volition. The notion of second-order volition {{can be used as a}} key conceptual tool in understanding the <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> desires. By means of the notion, this paper argues that the <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> desires in our minds lies in the <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> second-order volitions, other than the <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> first-order desires. Based on this claim, this paper suggests that, due to the misunderstanding of the nature of the <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> desires, the analysis of unwilling addict and wanton addict given by Frankfurt is thus wrong, and in his follow-up articles he made wrong description of the phenomenon concerning the <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> desires...|$|R
