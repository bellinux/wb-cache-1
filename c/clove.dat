40|$|The {{effect of}} {{selected}} spices {{included in the}} recipe of rye-buckwheat cakes on sensory quality, nutritional value, and Maillard reaction (MR) products formation was addressed in this study. The cakes with <b>cloves,</b> nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, vanilla, and spice mix addition revealed the highest overall quality values. Cakes enriched with <b>cloves,</b> allspice, and spice mix showed the highest rutin content and almost threefold higher available lysine contents whereas cakes enhanced with mix, <b>cloves,</b> and cinnamon were the richest source of phenolic compounds. The highest antioxidant capacity showed cakes with <b>cloves</b> and spice mix. The furosine, a marker of early stage of MR, was decreased in cakes with <b>cloves,</b> allspice, spice mix, and vanilla whereas fluorescent intermediatory compounds were reduced in cakes enhanced with <b>cloves,</b> allspice, and cinnamon. In contrast, browning index was increased as compared to cakes without spices. The FAST index was significantly lowered in all cakes enriched with spices, especially with <b>cloves,</b> allspice, and mix addition. The presence of <b>cloves,</b> allspice, and vanilla in cake formula was the most efficient in acrylamide strategy. It can be suggested that <b>cloves,</b> allspice, and vanilla might be used for production of safety and good quality cakes...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cloves</b> are the {{aromatic}} flower buds {{of a tree}} in {{the family}} Myrtaceae, Syzygium aromaticum.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Kangchu system {{dates back to the}} mid-18th century, when early Chinese {{settlers}} in Penang experimented in cash crop plantations with various types of crops, including pepper, gambier, betelnut and <b>clove.</b> The plantations were abandoned by the late 18th-century, as Penang experienced wars from Buginese seafarers that resulted in many gambier plantations being destroyed; contributing to the decline in plantations was the growing popularity of the spice trade that reaped much greater profits. At the beginning of the 19th century, these Chinese settlers began to look south to Malacca and Singapore, where gambier and pepper plantations had also been established.|$|E
5|$|The renewed {{blockade}} of Île de France was lifted in December 1795, and Elphinstone deployed {{most of his}} forces in the continued {{blockade of}} Colombo. In February a small squadron under Captain Alan Gardner attacked city and secured the total surrender of the remaining Batavian garrison on the island. In March word arrived at Madras of the Batavian attempt to recapture the Cape Colony and Elphinstone returned westwards with Monarch, followed by Stately, Echo and Rattlesnake. In the east, Rainier's force had some success, seizing the considerable <b>clove</b> stores at Amboyna on 16 February 1796 and the nutmeg and mace supplies of Banda Neira on 8 March. The value of these captures was significant: the captains involved each received £15,000. However, these successes were offset by the complicated political position Rainier discovered in the Dutch East Indies; he spent {{the entirety of the}} remainder of the year diffusing or defeating a series of uprisings by local rajahs and did not return to India until February 1797.|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} ridge, furrow and flat planting methods on performance of three cultivars of garlic. Plant height was significantly affected and plants on ridges had the maximum height. Individual bulb weight, bulb diameter and 100 <b>cloves</b> weight were significantly higher in ridge method compared with other two methods. While, the number of <b>cloves</b> per bulb was higher in furrow method. The higher individual bulb weight, bulb diameter and 100 <b>cloves</b> weight of the plants grown in ridges gave a corresponding higher yield of garlic. Among the cultivars, cv. Faridpur had significantly higher individual bulb weight, bulb diameter, 100 <b>cloves</b> weight and a corresponding higher yield. However, it had few <b>cloves</b> per bulb compared with other two cultivars. Planting in ridges has potential application for the yield improvement of garlic...|$|R

5|$|In 1698, Zanzibar {{became part}} of the {{overseas}} holdings of Oman, falling {{under the control of the}} Sultan of Oman. In 1832, or 1840 (the date varies among sources), Said bin Sultan moved his capital from Muscat in Oman to Stone Town. He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of <b>clove</b> plantations, using the island's slave labour. Zanzibar's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent, whom Said encouraged to settle on the island. After his death in 1856, two of his sons, Majid bin Said and Thuwaini bin Said, struggled over the succession, so Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate principalities; Thuwaini became the Sultan of Oman while Majid became the first Sultan of Zanzibar. During his 14-year reign as Sultan, Majid consolidated his power around the East African slave trade. His successor, Barghash bin Said, helped abolish the slave trade in Zanzibar and largely developed the country's infrastructure. The third Sultan, Khalifa bin Said, also furthered the country's progress toward abolishing slavery.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the plans}} for a Nanuet–Haverstraw freeway were scrapped, NY304 was {{ultimately}} moved onto a new, mostly at-grade highway between the two locations in the mid-1960s. The new alignment utilized the pre-existing Long <b>Clove</b> Road near {{the northern tip of}} DeForest Lake and a newly built road bypassing New City to the east and running generally northeasterly to the junction of Ridge and Long <b>Clove</b> roads. The northernmost part of NY304 was realigned in the 1980s to follow a new highway paralleling Long <b>Clove</b> Road to the south.|$|E

25|$|Garlic {{is easy to}} {{grow and}} can be grown year-round in mild climates.

25|$|In 1913, the New York State Legislature created Route5-c, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending through}} Kaaterskill <b>Clove</b> from Palenville to Haines Falls. The route did not connect {{to any other}} route in the legislative route system, and was removed on March1, 1921, {{as part of a}} partial renumbering of the system. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, NY23 was assigned to an alignment extending from Oneonta to the Massachusetts state line west of Great Barrington by way of Catskill Park. The new route bypassed Kaaterskill <b>Clove</b> to the north, however, in favor of an alignment serving the hamlets of Windham and Cairo. Within two years, the Kaaterskill <b>Clove</b> road was designated as part of NY23A, an alternate route of NY23 between Prattsville and Catskill through Hunter. The routing of NY23A has remained the same since.|$|E

25|$|NY214 {{dates back}} to a road {{constructed}} in the late 1840s by Colonel Charles Edwards, a tanner from Hunter.

The road constructed by Edwards and first used by Amos Connolly by 1849 for the first wagon use was upgraded in 1873 upon state approval of the Stoney <b>Clove</b> Turnpike, which occurred by the New York State Legislature on April 30. The road's design used has been speculated {{that there was a}} significant issue with erosion {{when it comes to the}} road through Stony <b>Clove</b> Notch, even into the 1940s.
