5|$|Several diseases, like Rat <b>Coronavirus</b> Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} {{simply because}} their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem with}} the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. It should be noted, however, that MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is a viral {{infection}} of the upper respiratory tract. The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human <b>coronavirus</b> (≈15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds.|$|E
40|$|Diverse <b>coronaviruses</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} in bats from several continents but not from Africa. We identified group 1 and 2 <b>coronaviruses</b> in bats in Kenya, including SARS-related <b>coronaviruses.</b> The sequence diversity suggests that bats are well-established reservoirs for and likely sources of <b>coronaviruses</b> for many species, including humans...|$|R
50|$|<b>Coronaviruses</b> are {{believed}} to cause {{a significant percentage of}} all common colds in human adults. <b>Coronaviruses</b> cause colds in humans primarily in the winter and early spring seasons. The significance and economic impact of <b>coronaviruses</b> as causative agents of the common cold are hard to assess because, unlike rhinoviruses (another common cold virus), human <b>coronaviruses</b> are difficult to grow in the laboratory. <b>Coronaviruses</b> can cause pneumonia, either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia, and bronchitis, either direct viral bronchitis or a secondary bacterial bronchitis.|$|R
50|$|SARS is {{most closely}} related to group 2 <b>coronaviruses,</b> {{but it does not}} {{segregate}} into any of the other three groups of <b>coronaviruses.</b> A theory has been proposed that bat <b>coronaviruses</b> have been coevolved with their hosts for a long time then jumped species from bats to humans. The closest outgroup to the <b>coronaviruses</b> are the toroviruses, with which it has homology in the ORF 1b replicase and the two viron proteins of S and M. SARS was determined to be an early split off from the group 2 <b>coronaviruses</b> based on a set of conserved domains that it shares with group 2.|$|R
5|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is caused}} by a new type of <b>coronavirus.</b> Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear. The fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{seroepidemiological study}} (a study {{investigating}} the patterns, {{causes and effects}} of a disease on a specific population {{on the basis of}} serologic tests) in Egypt was the first to show the dromedary might be a host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome <b>coronavirus</b> (MERS-CoV). A 2013–14 study of dromedaries in Saudi Arabia concluded the unusual genetic stability of MERS-CoV coupled with its high seroprevalence in the dromedary makes this camel a highly probable host for the virus. The full genome sequence of MERS-CoV from dromedaries in this study showed a 99.9% match to the genomes of human clade B MERS-CoV. Another study in Saudi Arabia showed the presence of MERS-CoV in 90% of the evaluated dromedaries and suggested that camels could be the animal source of MERS-CoV.|$|E
5|$|In adults, viruses {{account for}} {{approximately}} {{a third and}} in children for about 15% of pneumonia cases. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. Herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as: newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with significant burns. People following organ transplantation or those otherwise-immunocompromised present high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae, particularly when other health problems are present. Different viruses predominate at different periods of the year; during influenza season, for example, influenza may account for over half of all viral cases. Outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur, including hantaviruses and <b>coronavirus.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Coronaviruses</b> are {{species of}} virus {{belonging}} to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae, in the order Nidovirales. <b>Coronaviruses</b> are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genomic size of <b>coronaviruses</b> ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, the largest for an RNA virus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coronaviruses</b> bind to host cells {{primarily}} through interactions between viral spike glycoproteins and specific host cell surface glycoproteins. Some <b>coronaviruses</b> also bind to sialic acids on glycoproteins and glycolipids via their spike and/or hemaglutinin esterase glycoproteins. The interactions between <b>coronaviruses</b> and host cell receptors are critical determinants of species-specificity, tissue tropism, and virulence.|$|R

25|$|Feline <b>coronavirus</b> (FCoV) is a positive-stranded RNA {{virus that}} is {{infectious}} to cats worldwide. This virus {{is part of}} the Alphacoronavirus 1 species of the Alphacoronavirus genus belonging to the Coronaviridae family of viruses. Alphacoronavirus 1 also includes the canine <b>coronavirus</b> (CCoV) and the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis <b>coronavirus</b> (TGEV). It has two different forms; the FECV (feline enteric <b>coronavirus)</b> that infects the intestines and the FIPV (feline infectious peritonitis virus) that causes the disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).|$|E
25|$|Middle East {{respiratory}} {{syndrome is}} caused by the newly identified MERS <b>coronavirus</b> (MERS-CoV), a species with single-stranded RNA belonging to the genus betacoronavirus which is distinct from SARS <b>coronavirus</b> and the common-cold <b>coronavirus.</b> Its genomes are phylogenetically classified into two clades, Clades A and B. Early cases of MERS were of Clade A clusters (EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012) while new cases are genetically different in general (Clade B). The virus grows readily on Vero cells and LLC-MK2 cells.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{data also}} shows that {{processes}} using sialic acid are {{directly involved in the}} interaction with the receptor's lectins. It has also been demonstrated that swine enteric <b>coronavirus</b> (group 1) fusion to the enterocyte is accomplished via binding to the APN {{in the presence of the}} sialic acid.

40|$|<b>Coronaviruses</b> are {{important}} human pathogens {{and have the}} potential to severely impact public health on an international scale. The emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV highlight the need for research to identify antivirals and vaccines against <b>coronaviruses.</b> To develop therapeutics against current and potentially emergent <b>coronaviruses,</b> I utilized two approaches targeting the proteases encoded within all <b>coronaviruses.</b> The papain-like protease and 3 C-like protease of <b>coronaviruses</b> are responsible for cleaving viral polyproteins early during infection, and this step is required for viral replication. To quantitatively assess the inhibition by small-molecule compounds on MERS-CoV protease activity, I developed a luciferase-based biosensor to monitor protease cleavage within cells. Using this assay, I demonstrated that an inhibitor that is efficacious against SARS-CoV had activity against the 3 C-like protease of MERS-CoV. In the second approach, I investigated the multifunctional papain-like protease of SARS-CoV, which has been implicated in pathogenesis by acting as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme and blocking host immune responses. To determine if PLpro DUB activity is responsible for innate immune antagonism, I mutated residues predicted to interact with ubiquitin and discovered that when this interaction was interrupted, PLpro was unable to antagonize innate immune pathways. Engineering these mutations into SARS-COV may generate an attenuated virus that could stimulate a protective immune response in the absence of disease...|$|R
