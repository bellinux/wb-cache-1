25|$|Sedimentary {{rocks are}} {{laid down in}} layers called beds or strata. A bed {{is defined as a}} layer of rock that has a uniform {{lithology}} and texture. Beds form by the deposition of layers of sediment on top of each other. The sequence of beds that characterizes sedimentary rocks is called bedding. Single beds can be a couple of centimetres to several meters thick. Finer, less pronounced layers are called laminae, and the structure it forms in a rock is called lamination. Laminae are usually less than a few centimetres thick. Though bedding and lamination are often originally horizontal in nature, this is not always the case. In some environments, beds are deposited at a (usually small) angle. Sometimes multiple sets of layers with different orientations exist in the same rock, a structure called <b>cross-bedding.</b> <b>Cross-bedding</b> forms when small-scale erosion occurs during deposition, cutting off part of the beds. Newer beds then form at an angle to older ones.|$|E
25|$|The sand {{was washed}} from Broken Hill, and {{laid down in}} a bed that is about 200 metres thick. Currents washed through it, {{leaching}} {{out most of the}} minerals and leaving a very poor rock that made an insipid soil. They washed out channels in some places, while in others, the currents formed sand banks that show a characteristic current bedding or <b>cross-bedding</b> that can often be seen in cuttings.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, {{the cloud}} {{collapsed}} as the gases densified and lost their capability {{to support their}} solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum, not Pompeii. Additional explosions reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Vesuvian and Peléan six times. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii. Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and <b>cross-bedding</b> formations, which are not produced by fallout.|$|E
50|$|The {{direction}} of motion of the <b>cross-beds</b> can show ancient flow or wind directions (called paleocurrents). The foresets are deposited at the angle of repose (~34 degrees from the horizontal), so geologists are able to measure dip {{direction of}} the cross-bedded sediments and calculate the paleoflow direction. However, most <b>cross-beds</b> are not tabular, they are troughs. Since troughs can give a 180 degree variation of the dip of foresets, false paleocurrents can be taken by blindly measuring foresets. In this case, true paleocurrent direction {{is determined by the}} axis of the trough. Paleocurrent direction is important in reconstructing past climate and drainage patterns: sand dunes preserve the prevalent wind directions, and current ripples show the direction rivers were moving.|$|R
40|$|Some <b>cross-beds</b> incoarse-grained {{sandstone}} and pebble conglomerate of the Coso Formation (lower Pleistocene) {{are inclined}} against he direction of flow of depositing currents. Textural gradation, min-eralogical changes, and structural considerations {{show that the}} depositing currents flowed westward. About one half the <b>cross-beds</b> are inclined to the east, {{and the others are}} inclined to the west. The diametrically opposed irections do not fit the pattern expected of meandering streams. The eastward-inclined <b>cross-beds</b> are called backset beds. Backset beds are the planar (inclined) type and make an angle of 25 ° or less with the normal bedding planes. Cross-laminations are long tapered wedges with the wide part of the wedge at the base. Ma-terial within the wedge is coarse near the bottom and grades to finer material at the top. Normal foreset laminations are either the inclined or festoon (trough) type, and material within each lamina-tion is well sorted and not graded. The baekset beds are believed to have formed during the antidune phase of sediment transport described by G. K. Gilbert. The factors contributing to the antidane phase of sediment transport are high load, high velocity, high resistance, and shallow depth of water. Inasmuch as the deposits were probably deposited in a manner analogous to the heavily overloaded streams of the Basin and Range province today, all these factors could well have been present...|$|R
5000|$|Hummocky cross-{{stratification}}: This stratification {{is made up}} of undulating sets of cross-laminae {{that are}} concave-up (swales) and convex-up (hummocks). These <b>cross-beds</b> gently cut into each other with curved erosional surfaces. They form in shallow-water, storm-dominated environments. Strong storm-wave action erodes the seabed into low hummocks and swales that lack a specific orientation.|$|R
25|$|The {{opposite}} of <b>cross-bedding</b> is parallel lamination, where all sedimentary layering is parallel. Differences in laminations are generally caused by cyclic {{changes in the}} sediment supply, caused, for example, by seasonal changes in rainfall, temperature or biochemical activity. Laminae that represent seasonal changes (similar to tree rings) are called varves. Any sedimentary rock composed of millimeter or finer scale layers can be named with the general term laminite. When sedimentary rocks have no lamination at all, their structural character is called massive bedding.|$|E

2500|$|Manten (1966) deduces {{that the}} Burgsvik beds were formed fairly {{close to the}} {{shoreline}} on a beach [...] "faintly sloping towards the open sea", {{and that they were}} extensively reworked by the action of tides and storms. [...] Evidence from <b>cross-bedding</b> and ripple marks is taken to imply a subaquaeous origin; rounded oolite pebbles and slightly rounded, size-sorted fossils are evidence of a high-energy environment. [...] The presence of certain species of lamellibranch molluscs suggest a marine setting, and the thick shells present are also indicative of that type of environment.

40|$|Exposures of {{the middle}} Cambrian Potsdam Group of {{northern}} New York, including the type section, represent a suite of interfingering eolian dune and aquatic deposits that record the activities of early land-going arthropods. Quartz arenites at these exposures are dominantly fine to medium grained, well sorted, and have hematite-coated well-rounded, high-sphericity quartz grains characterized by secondary optically continuous quartz cement overgrowths. Eolian beds are laminated and dominated by m- to dm-scale foresets characterized by large-scale, laterally extensive <b>cross-beds</b> that dip., 156 – 346 and contain reverse-graded lamination, en-echelon microfaulted slumps, adhesion structures, and very high ripple-index asymmetric ripples that lie on the foresets with crests that trend downdip. Lower parts of foresets are interpreted as toesets, and contain unusual Diplichnites and Protichnites trackways, which record the uphill, downhill, crest-parallel, and switchback-style movement of arthropods in dry or damp sand. Trackways that ascend dune faces do not possess a medial tail drag, whereas trackways that descend do, and turns of trackways often have deep continuous medial impressions; these features suggest arthropods leaned into the slope when turning downhill in dry sand. More shallowly dipping (, 46 – 156) <b>cross-beds</b> are interpreted as bottomsets. Like nearby intertidal Potsdam deposits, these beds contain Protichnites trackways and Arenicolites burrows. Paleocurrent analyses imply a coastline in which offshore and mixed-direction winds moved dunes seaward.
