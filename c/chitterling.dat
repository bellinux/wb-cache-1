6000|$|Now stooping {{over the}} well, {{that he might}} have sight of his own face, was a most wretched man. He was pale and very meagre; he had black rings under his eyes, and his hair was long, limp, and greasy, falling over his shoulders. He was clad {{somewhat}} after the manner of the old Greeks, but his raiment was wofully ill-made and ill-girt upon him, nor did he ever seem at his ease. As soon as I beheld his sallow face I knew him for one I had seen and mocked at {{in the world of the}} living. He was a certain Figgins, and he had been honestly apprenticed to a photographer; but, being a weak and vain young fellow, he had picked up modern notions about art, the nude, plasticity, and the like, in the photographer's workroom, whereby he became a weariness to the photographer and to them that sat unto him. Being dismissed from his honest employment, this <b>chitterling</b> must needs become a model to some painters that were near as ignorant as himself. They talked to him about the Greeks, about the antique, about Paganism, about the Renaissance, till they made him as much the child of folly as themselves. And they painted him as Antinous, as Eros, as Sleep, and I know not what, but whatever name they called him he was always the same lank-haired, dowdy, effeminate, pasty-faced photographer's young man. Then he must needs take to writing poems all about Greece, and the free ways of the old Greeks, and Lais, and Phryne, and therein he made [...] "Aeolus" [...] rhyme to [...] "control us." [...] For of Greek this fellow knew not a word, and any Greek that met him had called him a [Greek text], and bidden him begone to the crows for a cursed fellow, and one that made false quantities in every Greek name he uttered. But his little poems were much liked by young men of his own sort, and by some of the young women. Now death had come to Figgins, and here he was in the Fortunate Islands, the very paradise of those Greeks about whom he had always been prating while he was alive. And yet he was not happy. A little lyre lay beside him in the grass, and now and again he twanged on it dolorously, and he tried to weave himself garlands from the flowers that grew around him; but he knew not the art, and ever and anon he felt for his button-hole, wherein to stick a lily or the like. But he had no button-hole. Then he would look at himself in the well, and yawn and wish himself back in his friends' studios in London. I almost pitied the wretch, and, going up to him, I asked him how he did. He said he had never been more wretched. [...] "Why," [...] I asked, [...] "was your mouth not always full of the 'Greek spirit,' and did you not mock the Christians and their religion? And, as to their heaven, did you not say that it was a tedious place, full of pious old ladies and Philistines? And are you not got to the paradise of the Greeks? What, then, ails you with your lot?" [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "to be plain with you, I do not understand a word these fellows about me say, and I feel as I did the first time I went to Paris, before I knew enough French to read the Master's poems. {128} Again, every one here is mirthful and gay, and there is no man with a divinely passionate potentiality of pain. When I first came here they were always asking me to run with them or jump against them, and one fellow insisted I should box with him, and hurt me very much. My potentiality of pain is considerable. Or they would have me drive with them in these dangerous open chariots,--me, that never rode in a hansom cab without feeling nervous. And after dinner they sing songs of which I do not catch the meaning of one syllable, and the music is like nothing I ever heard in my life. And they are all abominably active and healthy. And such of their poets as I admired--in Bohn's cribs, of course--the poets of the Anthology, are not here at all, and the poets who are here are tremendous proud toffs" [...] (here Figgins relapsed into his natural style as it was before he became a Neopagan poet), [...] "and won't say a word to a cove. And I'm sick of the Greeks, and the Fortunate Islands are a blooming fraud, and oh, for paradise, give me Pentonville." [...] With these words, perhaps the only unaffected expression of genuine sentiment poor Figgins had ever uttered, he relapsed into a gloomy silence. I advised him to cultivate the society of the authors whose selected works are in the Greek Delectus, and to try to make friends with Xenophon, whose Greek is about as easy as that of any ancient. But I fear that Figgins, like the Rev. Peter McSnadden, is really suffering a kind of punishment in the disguise of a reward, and all through having accidentally found his way into what he foolishly thought would be the right paradise for him.|$|E

While he played at chess, he took snuffs in such profusion that his <b>chitterling</b> frill was literally saturated with stray particles of the powder, and he was, moreover, in the habit of enlivening the company during the progress of the game, by a variety of remarks, which every body admired for their brilliancy, and which struck me perhaps the more forcibly, as I was at that time but indifferently acquainted with the French tongue.|$|E

40|$|Yersinia enterocolitica {{is a major}} enteric {{pathogen}} associated {{with a wide variety}} of clinical and immunologic manifestations, including transfusion-associated disease, from which there is a high mortality. Although previously rare in the United States, in the late 1980 s Y. enterocolitica O: 3 emerged as the predominant serotype in the United States, as it has been in Canada, Europe, and Japan. Epidemiologic investigation of this serogroup has been hampered by the limited availability of a phage typing system and the fact that Y. enterocolitica harbors few plasmids that are useful as strain markers. We therefore analyzed whole-cell DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms of rRNA genes (ribotyping) to study a group of 61 (50 human, 11 porcine) Y. enterocolitica isolates. Initially, 20 different restriction enzymes were used: NciI appeared to give the best discrimination of hybridization banding patterns (ribotypes) within Y. enterocolitica O: 3. Ribotyping distinguished seven clones among all the study isolates and four clones within Y. enterocolitica O: 3 (53 isolates studied) and clearly differentiated Y. enterocolitica O: 3 from Y. enterocolitica O: 9; O: 1, 2, 3; O: 20; and O: 5, 27. Most serogroup O: 3 isolates belonged to two clones, ribotypes I and II, including 23 of 24 Y. enterocolitica O: 3 (13 human, 11 porcine <b>chitterling)</b> isolates recovered from a recent outbreak of Y. enterocolitica in children in Atlanta associated with <b>chitterling</b> preparation and 3 transfusion-associated O: 3 isolates from the United States. Y. enterocolitica O: 3 ribotypes I and II were also isolated in Japan, ribotypes II and IV were isolated in Belgium, and ribotype I was isolated in Canada. Ribotype patterns I and II corresponded to phage types 9 b and 8, respectively. Ribotyping was able to distinguish individual strains of Y. enterocolitica O: 3, but suggests that a limited number of clones have disseminated within the United States and globally. The finding of identical ribotype patterns in <b>chitterling</b> and human specimens from the Atlanta outbreak supports epidemiologic evidence that swine were the source of infection and major reservoir for Y. enterocolitica O: 3...|$|E

Decontamination of chitterlings before sale with methods such as irradiation should be strongly considered. Yersinia enterocolitica is an uncommon cause of illness outbreaks in the United States. Of 7, 390 foodborne disease outbreaks reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1990 through 1999, 5 (< 0. 1 %) were reported to be caused by Yersinia (1). It is also a relatively uncommon cause of sporadic disease, accounting for < 0. 3 % of all foodborne illness in the United States (2). Y. enterocolitica has been isolated from a variety of animal reservoirs, and outbreaks have been attributed to contaminated water, milk, bean sprouts, and pork intestines (3). We investigated an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in black infants in Tennessee. The Study Case-patients were defined as residents of Tennessee < 1 year of age with culture-confirmed Y. enterocolitica infection occurring from November 15, 2001 to February 15, 2002. A case-control study was performed to define risk factors for infection. Controls were randomly selected from a list of black patients < 1 year of age who were evaluated in the emergency department of the large urban children’s hospital where the outbreak was initially identified, with any diagnoses other than Yersinia gastroenteritis during the outbreak period.
