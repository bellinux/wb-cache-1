25|$|Currently, {{the first}} {{generation}} processes {{for the production of}} ethanol from corn use {{only a small part of}} the corn plant: the <b>corn</b> <b>kernels</b> are taken from the corn plant and only the starch, which represents about 50% of the dry kernel mass, is transformed into ethanol. Two types of second generation processes are under development. The first type uses enzymes and yeast fermentation to convert the plant cellulose into ethanol while the second type uses pyrolysis to convert the whole plant to either a liquid bio-oil or a syngas. Second generation processes can also be used with plants such as grasses, wood or agricultural waste material such as straw.|$|E
25|$|A very {{different}} method of popcorn-making {{can still be}} seen on the streets of some Chinese cities and Korea today. The un-popped <b>corn</b> <b>kernels</b> are poured into a large cast-iron canister — sometimes called a 'popcorn hammer' — that is then sealed with a heavy lid and slowly turned over a curbside fire in rotisserie fashion. When a pressure gauge on the canister reaches a certain level, the canister is removed from the fire, a large canvas sack is put over the lid and the seal is released. With a huge boom, all of the popcorn explodes at once and is poured into the sack. This method {{is believed to have been}} developed, during the Song dynasty, originally for puffing rice.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{demand for}} ethanol as a fuel {{additive}} {{has resulted in}} dramatic growth in ethanol production. Ethanol is produced from corn by either wet milling or dry-grind processing. In wet milling, the <b>corn</b> <b>kernel</b> is fraction-ated into different components, resulting in several coproducts. Wet-milling plants are capital intensive because of equipment requirements; they pro-duce large volumes of ethanol and are corporate owned. In dry-grind pro-cessing, the <b>corn</b> <b>kernel</b> is not fractionated and only one coproduct, distillers’ dried grains with solubles (DDGS), is generated. Dry-grind plants require less equipment and capital than wet mills. They generate smaller volumes of ethanol, are producer owned, and add direct benefits to rural economies. Most {{of the increase in}} ethanol production during the past decade is attrib-uted to growth in the dry-grind industry. The marketing of coproducts pro-vides income to offset processing costs.

Experiment 1 utilized 10 wethers in a replicated 5 × 5 Latin square design to evaluate the digestibility of dry matter, fiber, fat, and crude protein in diets containing T-WDG or C-WDG. In experiment 2, 168 crossbred steers were used in a randomized complete block design to determine the impact of T-WDG or C-WDG in finishing diets on performance and carcass characteristics. Although digestibility of T-WDG and C-WDG slightly varied at moderate inclusions in the diet, performance and carcass characteristics of steers fed 30 % T-WDG were similar to steers fed 30 % C-WDG.
