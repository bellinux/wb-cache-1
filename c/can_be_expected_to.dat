Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E

However, these hybrids are less well adapted to the peculiar ecological conditions of Laysan Island than the local ducks, and thus have lower fitness. These ducks were found throughout the Hawaiian archipelago before 400AD, after which they suffered a rapid decline during the Polynesian colonisation. Now, their range includes only Laysan Island.

5|$|Notably, {{both the}} highest and lowest judges' scores are omitted to cancel out any discrepancy, giving a maximum of 60 style points. A perfect jump on a K200 hill would {{therefore}} garner a minimum of 180 points (120 distance points + 60 style points) or more, depending on bonus points. However, such a scenario is only an example and not representative of the highly variable nature of the sport. Gaining one or more scores of 20 is very rare, and five is extremely rare. Generally, a good to excellent jump <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> receive judges' scores of 18 to 19.5.

5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail {{has a low}} basal {{metabolic}} rate (BMR), measured in 1989 at around 60–68% the rate expected for a bird of its weight. The scientists responsible for the study speculated that the low BMR was not {{as a result of}} flightlessness, which does not have this effect in other bird species, but was instead the result of the rail's island lifestyle. The island lacks predators and other competitors, and as such <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be at full carrying capacity for rails. This in turn would favour energy conservation by the rails, resulting in small body size, low BMR and flightlessness. A comparison of flighted and flightless rails, including the Inaccessible Island rail, found that rails that lose the ability to fly also have low BMRs.|$|E
5|$|The results {{indicated}} that nuclei of unbinilium were produced at high (~70MeV) excitation energy which underwent fission with measurable half-lives just over 10−18 s. Although very short (indeed, insufficient for the element to be considered by IUPAC to exist, because a compound nucleus has no internal structure and its nucleons have not been arranged into shells until it has survived for 10−14s, upon which it forms an electronic cloud), the ability to measure such a process indicates a strong shell effect at Z=120. At lower excitation energy (see neutron evaporation), {{the effect of the}} shell will be enhanced and ground-state nuclei <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have relatively long half-lives. This result could partially explain the relatively long half-life of 294Og measured in experiments at Dubna. Similar experiments have indicated a similar phenomenon at element 124 but not for flerovium, suggesting that the next proton shell does in fact lie beyond element 120. In September 2007, the team at RIKEN began a program utilizing 248Cm targets and have indicated future experiments to probe the possibility of 120 being the next proton magic number (and 184 being the next neutron magic number) using the aforementioned nuclear reactions to form 302Ubn, as well as 248Cm+54Cr. They also planned to further chart the region by investigating the nearby compound nuclei 296Og, 298Og, 306Ubb, and 308Ubb.|$|E
