50|$|The organic {{composition}} of capital (OCC) {{is a concept}} created by Karl Marx in his critique of political economy and used in Marxian economics as a theoretical alternative to neo-classical concepts of factors of production, production functions, <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> and capital-output ratios. It is normally defined as the ratio of constant capital (capital invested in plant, equipment and materials) to variable capital (capital invested in the labour-costs involved in hiring employees). The concept {{does not apply to}} all capital assets, only to capital invested in production (i.e. production capital). The neoclassical concept synonymous to increasing organic {{composition of}} capital is capital deepening.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{there is}} belief held by some that social {{inequality}} often creates political conflict and growing consensus that political structures determine the solution for such conflicts. Under {{this line of}} thinking, adequately designed social and political institutions are seen as ensuring the smooth functioning of economic markets such that there is political stability, which improves the long-term outlook, enhances labour and <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> and so stimulates economic growth. With higher economic growth, net gains are positive across all levels and political reforms are easier to sustain. This may explain why, over time, in more egalitarian societies fiscal performance is better, stimulating greater accumulation of capital and higher growth.|$|E

50|$|One basic {{assumption}} of ecological modernization relates to environmental readaptation {{of economic growth}} and industrial development. On the basis of enlightened self-interest, economy and ecology can be favourably combined: Environmental productivity, i.e. productive use {{of natural resources and}} environmental media (air, water, soil, ecosystems), can be a source of future growth and development {{in the same way as}} labour productivity and <b>capital</b> <b>productivity.</b> This includes increases in energy and resource efficiency as well as product and process innovations such as environmental management and sustainable supply chain management, clean technologies, benign substitution of hazardous substances, and product design for environment. Radical innovations in these fields can not only reduce quantities of resource turnover and emissions, but also change the quality or structure of the industrial metabolism. In the co-evolution of humans and nature, and in order to upgrade the environment’s carrying capacity, ecological modernization gives humans an active role to play, which may entail conflicts with nature conservation.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{analyzing}} the <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> in Brazil, its historical behavior and {{influence on the}} future development of the country. In what concerns Brazil, the <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> has decreased considerably, reaching the average level observed in the OECD countries, {{in spite of the}} fact that the average output per worker in Brazil is one third of the value in those countries. After removing from the Brazilian capital/product ratio series (inverse of the <b>capital</b> <b>productivity)</b> the influence of variations on the installed capacity, it was verified that, with a smaller <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> level, Brazil has a limited capacity of convergence to the same income level of the developed countries as well as of remunerating the capital, which might cause the present low investment level in the country.

40|$|Does {{the world}} {{experience}} a secular decline in <b>capital</b> <b>productivity?</b> Due to the long-run downward trend in interest rates, some economists do think so. However, this reasoning equates <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> with interest, {{which is a}} critical assumption. This paper presents a new proxy {{that can be used}} to estimate <b>capital</b> <b>productivity.</b> It is based on weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which are employed by firms in their investment appraisals as a benchmark return. The paper uses an original WACC data set for many OECD countries and for the time period 2000 - 2015. Data are adjusted for tax distortions and expected inflation. The principle finding is that the data do not indicate a long-run decline in <b>capital</b> <b>productivity...</b>|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} few decades, the {{construction}} industry has experienced a series of changes including the innovation of construction technologies and the enhancement of management strategies.

This paper aims to develop an analysis procedure to measure <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> changes and to reasonably quantify factors affecting productivity levels in the construction industry. Based on the data envelopment analysis method, this research has developed a novel model measuring <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> and has applied it to the Australian construction industry. The numerical results indicate that the average annual <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> levels of the construction industry are slowly growing in all the Australian states and territories except for Queensland and Western Australia.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{productivity}} of public infrastructure in a general equilibrium context. In our model, infrastructure lowers costs in a manufacturing sector characterized by both firm-level returns to scale and industry-level external returns to variety. Infrastructure alters factor prices, intermediate prices and the allocation of factors across sectors. The effect on manufacturing or aggregate output, however, is indeterminate. In particular, our theory suggests {{that the degree of}} monopoly power influences public <b>capital's</b> <b>productivity</b> effect. We test the model using state-level panel data. We confirm the absence of direct effects on output, but find suggestive evidence of a positive impact of public capital on manufacturing variety as measured by the number of manufacturing establishments.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that human <b>capital</b> increases <b>productivity</b> is tested {{using data from}} a sample of low value-added microenterprises. A special attribute {{of this paper is}} the join treatment of formal learning or training in education institutions, and informal training by experience of the owner in the firm management. Following previous studies, the relation between human <b>capital</b> and <b>productivity</b> is determined by estimating production functions with the inclusion of dummy variables to control for formal education and informal training by experience. Evidence of the linkage of human <b>capital</b> and <b>productivity</b> is reported. It is also reported that both types of investment in human capital have asymmetrical contribution to productivity, where the impact of experience is predominant. This allows concluding that the long-run existence of the firms in the sample is explained by the accumulation of experience in the management. Returns to education occur primarily for technical education and are lower than those generated by experiential learning in the firm management. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{measures}} <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> in West Germany, Japan and the United States {{and links}} <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> to financial performance. We show that West Germany and Japan have significantly {{lower levels of}} <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> than the United States, mainly due to lower capital utilization but also because less productive capacity was created per unit of physical assets. On {{a higher level of}} causality, we show that this mainly comes from less pressure from product market competition and weaker corporate governance in West Germany and Japan. While external factors such as government ownership and regulation were important, {{more than half of the}} productivity gap could in principle have been closed by managerial action. The lower level of <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> in West Germany and Japan explains a large part of the difference in per capita income between these two countries and the U. S. Moreover, the high level of <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> in the U. S. generated financial returns that created more new wealth than in West Germany and Japan in spite of the well-known low U.

The major flaws with traditional <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> measures, particularly the problems inherent in valuing the 'capital ' employed in a given industry or sector, are discussed and the model is developed to meet the objections. The notion of <b>capital</b> <b>productivity</b> employed in the model, while in computational terms similar to the traditional approach, is different in philosophical terms. Thus instead of than attempting to 'value ' the capital employed in the productive process, the cost of capital 'sunk ' is valued making allowance for notional depreciation based on the balance of the different types of assets employed.
