5|$|Historians have {{disagreed}} {{about its}} age, {{and the existence}} of an older <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same site. The tower has been dated by its architecture to between 1230 and 1240, but other historians question this date and suggest the tower and the body of the church both date to the 14thcentury. The porch appears to be a 17thcentury addition. There is a tomb of Margaret deCamois in the nave. It has been suggested that its location there, rather than the chancel as would be expected for the family of the lord of the manor (which her surname suggests she was), may indicate that the church was built on the site of an earlier, smaller, church and the tomb was in the chancel of that church. Local historian Roger Chatterton-Newman disagrees, saying there would be no need for a <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site any earlier.|$|E

5|$|All Saints' Church, Shuart , in the north-west of the Isle of Thanet, Kent, in the {{south-east}} of England, {{was established}} in the Anglo-Saxon period as a chapel of ease for the parish of St Mary's Church, Reculver, which was centred on the north-eastern corner of mainland Kent, adjacent to the island. The Isle of Thanet was then separated from the mainland by the sea, which formed a strait known as the Wantsum Channel.

5|$|Louise was {{the most}} artistically talented of Queen Victoria's daughters. As well as being an able actress, pianist and dancer, she was a {{prolific}} artist and sculptor. When Louise sculpted a statue of the Queen, portraying her in Coronation robes, the press claimed that her tutor, Sir Edgar Boehm, was the true creator of the work. The claim was denied by Louise's friends, who asserted her effort and independence. The work {{was intended to be}} exhibited in 1887, but production was delayed until 1893. A memorial to her brother-in-law, Prince Henry of Battenberg, and a memorial to the Colonial soldiers who fell during the Boer War, reside at Whippingham <b>Church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Wight, and another statue of Queen Victoria remains at McGill University in Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Poulton-le-Fylde is {{a market}} town in the Wyre {{district}} of Lancashire, England, situated on a coastal plain called the Fylde. There are fifteen buildings and structures in the town which have been listed by the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance. One is classified as Grade II*, and the rest as Grade II; Poulton-le-Fylde has no Grade I listed buildings. The Grade II* designation is for St Chad's Church. There is written evidence of a <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site since 1094, although {{it may have been}} built earlier. It became the Anglican parish church {{at the time of the}} Reformation and was largely rebuilt in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Several 18th-century {{buildings}} {{still stand}} in Sisimiut, {{among them the}} 1725 Gammelhuset ("Old House") and the 1775 Bethel-kirken ("Bethel Church") or Blå Kirke ("Blue Church"), the oldest surviving church in Greenland. The buildings were moved from the former site of the settlement at Ukiivik (Holsteinsborg) together {{with the rest of}} the settlement. The new <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rocky pedestal was built in 1926, further extended in 1984. The entrance to the yard with the old church and other protected historical buildings is decorated with a unique gate made of whale jawbone. In 1801, a smallpox epidemic decimated the population of Sisimiut and other coastal settlements, although the population growth quickly resumed due to plentiful marine life on the coast.|$|E
5|$|St Fflewin's Church, Llanfflewin (sometimes {{referred}} to as St Fflewyn's Church, Llanfflewyn) is a small rural church, situated by a farm in Anglesey, north Wales. The first <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site {{is said to have}} been built by St Fflewin in 630, but the present building has no structural features dating from before the 18th century, although the church has a font from the 14th or 15th century and part of an inscribed medieval gravestone has been reused in a window sill.|$|E
5|$|St Gallgo's Church {{is a small}} church {{near the}} village of Llanallgo, on the east coast of Anglesey, north Wales. The chancel and transepts, which are the oldest {{features}} of the present building, date from the late 15th century, but there has been a <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site since the 6th or early 7th century, {{making it one of the}} oldest Christian sites in Anglesey. Some restoration and enlargement took place during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|St Mihangel's Church in {{the village}} of Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn is a former parish church now used as the chapel for RAF Valley in Anglesey, north Wales. The date of the first <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site is uncertain, but in 1862 the {{then-existing}} church was rebuilt. St Mihangel's became the chapel for the nearby Royal Air Force base in 1998, after the Church in Wales had ceased using it for services. It was then extended by dismantling and reassembling another Anglesey church, St Enghenedl's, at the west end of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} {{began in}} 1181. The monastic quarters {{and the church}} were built over the following three decades. The central cloister was bordered on the north by the <b>church,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west by a barrel-vaulted great nave, on the east by the sacristy, the priory cell, and the chapter house, and on the south by the kitchen, the pantry and the refectory (dining hall). Some of the buildings were given seven-foot-thick (2m) walls with slit windows, {{to serve as a}} refuge in case the Moors returned to the area. The church was built {{in the shape of a}} Latin cross with a nave divided into four sections, and a sanctuary with three square apses. Its presbytery had a central square topped by a pentagon.|$|E
5|$|The parish of Wormshill was {{originally}} appended {{to the village}} and parish of Boughton Malherbe, since both had the same patron; the patron of a parish was the land-owner who often built the <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> estate and who had the right (known as advowson) to appoint the parish priest. The first recorded patron of Wormshill was Robert de Gatton, who owned the Manor of Wormsell {{during the reign of}} Henry III (120772). From the Gatton family, the village passed by marriage in the 13th century to Sir Simon de Northwood, whose family crest appears in the stained glass of St Giles, the village's only church, and whose name (Norwood) is given to the farm at the north of the village.|$|E
5|$|There are two Grade I listed {{churches in}} Tameside, St Anne's Church, in Haughton, {{was built in}} 1881 in the Gothic Revival style by J Medland Taylor. St Michael and All Angels' Church in Ashton-under-Lyne is a 15th-century parish church which was {{virtually}} rebuilt in the 19th century. A <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site dates back to at least 1262. St Lawrence's Church, in Denton, is a Grade II* listed building and a timber framed church. It was remodelled by J Medland Taylor in 1872.|$|E
5|$|There has {{probably}} been a <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of the present St Chad's since before the Norman conquest of England in 1066, and there is written evidence of one from 1094. The Domesday Book of 1086 mentioned three churches in the hundred of Amounderness, although they were not named. Later documentary evidence suggests that they were probably the churches at Poulton, Kirkham and St Michael's on Wyre. The dedication of Poulton's church to 7th century Anglo-Saxon saint Chad of Mercia lends weight to its pre-conquest foundation, although {{it is possible that}} it was built between 1086 and 1094.|$|E
5|$|Time {{spent in}} {{religious}} gatherings interfered seriously with the practical routines of the island. Old ladies {{and children who}} made noise in church were lectured at length and warned of dire punishments in the afterworld. During a period of food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had {{to spend the day}} preparing for <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.|$|E
5|$|While at Yale, Lawrence met Mary Kimberly (Molly) Blumer, {{the eldest}} of four daughters of George Blumer, {{the dean of the}} Yale School of Medicine. They first met in 1926 and became engaged in 1931, and were married on May 14, 1932, at Trinity <b>Church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Green in New Haven, Connecticut. They had six children: Eric, Margaret, Mary, Robert, Barbara, and Susan. Lawrence named his son Robert after {{theoretical}} physicist Robert Oppenheimer, his closest friend in Berkeley. In 1941, Molly's sister Elsie married Edwin McMillan, who would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951.|$|E
5|$|William Heaven was {{succeeded by}} his son the Reverend Hudson Grosset Heaven who, thanks to a legacy from Sarah Langworthy (née Heaven), was able to fulfill his life's {{ambition}} of building a stone <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island. St Helen's was completed in 1896, and stands today as a lasting memorial to the Heaven period. It has been designated by English Heritage a Grade II listed building. He {{is said to have}} been able to afford either a church or a new harbour. His choice of the church was not however in the best financial interests of the island. The unavailability of the money for re-establishing the family's financial soundness, coupled with disastrous investment and speculation in the early 20th century, caused severe financial hardship.|$|E
5|$|Kajaani Church {{was built}} in 1896 in the Neo-Gothic style by {{architect}} Jac Ahrenberg. It replaced an earlier <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot which was originally built in 1656 and destroyed by the Russians in 1716 {{at the time when}} Kajaani castle was destroyed. The second church was built 1734-35 which served the parish for 160 years until replaced with Ahrenberg's new church. The church, built from wood, has three naves and features a delicate, slender bell tower. It is decorated with English Gothic style carvings. Kajaani Orthodox Church (Kajaanin ortodoksinen seurakunta), which has a regional membership of about 1880 members is centred at Christ Church of the Transfiguration in Kajaani. The church was completed in 1959 to designs by Ilmari Ahonen. It contains murals painted by Petros Sasaki and Alkiviadis Kepolas. In the suburb of Paltaniemi is a church, originally built in 1599, and considered to be the regional centre for the Lutheran Church.|$|E
5|$|Knox's {{powers as}} a preacher {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the chaplain of the garrison, John Rough. While Rough was preaching in the parish <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Protestant principle of the popular election of a pastor, he proposed Knox to the congregation for that office. Knox did not relish the idea. According to his own account, he burst into tears and fled to his room. Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, John Major. He expounded on the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel, comparing the Pope with the Antichrist. His sermon was marked by his consideration of the Bible as his sole authority and the doctrine of justification by faith alone, two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life. A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the Mass, Purgatory, and prayers for the dead.|$|E
5|$|The Baptists {{established}} the oldest extant churches in Hampshire County. After {{the end of}} the American Revolutionary War, Baptist preachers continued their attempt to gain a foothold in what is now the Eastern Panhandle region. During the Baptists' early growth in Hampshire County, the best known Baptist ministers were John Monroe (1750–1824) and Benjamin Stone (1743–1842). Monroe preached at the North River, Crooked Run, and Patterson's Creek churches during the early 19th century. According to historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher in History of Hampshire County, West Virginia (1897), Monroe was a minister for Primitive Baptists, who were adherent to a strict interpretation of the Calvinist theology of the Ketocton Association. Monroe probably established a Baptist <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of the present-day Capon Chapel, where he is buried in the church's cemetery. However, other sources claim that a Baptist congregation began gathering at the Capon Chapel site as early as 1756.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' last {{concert was}} at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, on 29 August 1966, but Evans {{continued}} {{to work for them}} in the studio, and to run errands. After recording Revolver in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge <b>church</b> (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). At exactly the pre-arranged time of one o'clock, Evans was standing under the church clock when McCartney arrived. They then drove to Madrid together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{site was}} named All Hallows, and {{was constructed in}} medieval times on land granted by the monarch at the time, Henry II, to the monks of St. Denys Priory. This building fell into disrepair and in the 1790s a new church building was constructed and the church renamed to All Saints. The old church was demolished in 1791 and the new building was completed in 1795, following two acts of Parliament allowing trustees {{of the church to}} raise funds from rates on property and rents in the parish. The All Hallows catacombs were incorporated into the All Saints building, and a separate graveyard was established. The church was regularly attended by author Jane Austen while she lived in Southampton and painter Sir John Everett Millais was baptised there. A new organ was installed in the church in 1861 and a substantial refurbishment programme took place in 1872. All Saints was heavily damaged in the Southampton Blitz and was subsequently demolished.|$|E
