Thus it greatly improves the reaction speed, shorten the braking time, and is more easily to be integrated in the electric vehicle central control unit. It improves the braking performance by optimizing the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> tire <b>adhesion</b> to the ground to in order obtain Maximum braking force. This paper examines an integrated controller of the ABS using Simulink/Stateflow module of Matlab, which consists of a traditional continuous PID and logic limits controller based on finite state machine theory. The two controllers regulate slip ratio and deceleration simultaneously, which can effectively optimize the braking characteristics and further improve the safety of ABS. The ABS parameters including Vehicle velocity, wheel rotational speed, braking displacement, pressure state and slip ratio are investigated to reveal the performance of ABS. This method is simple and suitable for all electric ABS. More importantly, it could solve braking problem under complex road condition and a sudden change of road condition.

The main drawback of this technique, however, is the formation of macrodroplets (MDs) during deposition, resulting in films with rougher morphology.
