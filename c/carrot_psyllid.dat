40|$|The <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid</b> (Trioza apicalis) is {{a serious}} pest in carrot-growing areas in {{northern}} and parts of central Europe. The psyllids overwinter as adults on conifers and during summer feed and lay eggs on carrot plants (Daucus carota ssp. sativus), thereby destroying the crop. To investigate the migratory capabilities and preferences for different shelter plant species of the <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid,</b> we made an inventory study of its winter habitats in three carrot-growing regions in southern Sweden. Norway spruce (Picea abies) was the preferred conifer over Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and juniper (Juniperus communis). We found psyllids on trees up to 1 km from the carrot fields, which was the largest distance sampled. The regression of catch numbers over distance was non-significant, however all samples containing more than seven psyllids were collected within 250 m distance from the fields. There was no obvious pattern between catch directions and the prevailing wind directions of the preceding migratory period. Our study did not show any differences {{between males and females}} with respect to migration or shelter species preferences...|$|E
40|$|The {{results suggest}} that a one-week trap {{replacement}} period, which is the current practise in <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid</b> monitoring, is too long at the early growth stages of carrot. Regardless of the oviposition (laying of eggs) preference for a certain carrot cultivars, {{the possibility of a}} functional push-pull control strategy based on limonene seems unlikely, since the repellent effect of limonene could not be verified. Further field studies with possible repellent compounds, such as winter host volatiles, will be needed to develop an efficient ecological control method for this species...|$|E
40|$|The Autumn gum moth, Mnesampela privata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is an endemic Australian moth whose larvae {{feed upon}} species of Eucalyptus. The moths {{favorite}} host plants are E. globulus and E. nitens {{which are the}} most important species used in commercial plantations of the Australian pulpwood industry. The autumn gum moth {{has become one of the}} most significant outbreak insects of eucalyptus plantations throughout Australia. As a consequence great financial losses to the forest industry occur. Today insecticides such as pyrethroids are used for control of eucalyptus defoliators as M. privata. The <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid,</b> Trioza apicalis (Homoptera: Psylloidea), is one of the major pests of carrot (Daucus carota) in northern Europe. The psyllid causes curling of the carrot leafs and reduction of plant growth. Today the carrot crops are protected with the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin, which is toxic to aquatic organisms and is, from 2010, prohibited for use in Sweden by the Swedish Chemicals Inspectorate. An alternative to insecticides is to protect the seedlings with semiochemicals, a chemical substance or mixture of them that carries a message. This thesis describes the identification and the syntheses of semiochemicals from the above mentioned insect species. From analysis of abdominal tip extracts of M. privata females from Tasmania a blend of (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -nonadecatriene and (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -heneicosatriene was identified as the sex pheromone of this species. The identification of the C 19 - and C 21 -trienes was confirmed by synthesis. In the analysis of carrot leaf extracts we found a compound, α-cis-bergamotene, that induces antennal response in the <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid.</b> This is just the beginning of the studies of trying to manipulate this psyllid with semiochemicals instead of insecticides...|$|E
40|$|Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (Lso) is a phloem-limited {{bacterium}} that severely affects important Solanaceae and Apiaceae crops, including potato, tomato, pepper, tobacco, {{carrot and}} celery. This bacterium is transmitted to solanaceous species by potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli, and to Apiaceae by <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllids,</b> including Trioza apicalis and Bactericera trigonica. Five haplotypes of Lso {{have so far}} been described, two are associated with solanaceous species and potato psyllids, whereas the other three are associated with carrot and celery crops and <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllids.</b> Little is known about cross-transmission of Lso to <b>carrot</b> by potato <b>psyllids</b> or to potato by <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllids.</b> Thus, the present study assessed whether potato psyllid can transmit Lso to carrot and whether Lso haplotypes infecting solanaceous species can also infect carrot and lead to disease symptom development. In addition, the stylet probing behavior of potato <b>psyllid</b> on <b>carrot</b> was assessed using electropenetrography (EPG) technology to further elucidate potential Lso transmission to Apiaceae by this potato insect pest. Results showed that, while potato <b>psyllids</b> survived on <b>carrot</b> for several weeks when confined on the plants under controlled laboratory and field conditions, the insects generally failed to infect carrot plants with Lso. Only three of the 200 carrot plants assayed became infected with Lso and developed characteristic disease symptoms. Lso infection in the symptomatic carrot plants was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction assay and Lso in the carrots {{was determined to be}} of the haplotype B, which is associated with solanaceous species. EPG results further revealed that potato psyllids readily feed on carrot xylem but rarely probe into the phloem tissue, explaining why little to no Lso infection occurred during the controlled laboratory and field cage transmission trials. Results of our laboratory and field transmission studies, combined with our EPG results, suggest that the risk of Lso infection and spread between psyllid-infested solanaceous and Apiaceae crops is likely to be negligible under normal field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Haplotypes A and B of 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (CLso) are {{associated}} with diseases of solanaceous plants, especially Zebra chip disease of potato, and haplotypes C, D and E {{are associated}} with symptoms on apiaceous plants. To date, one complete genome of haplotype B and two high quality draft genomes of haplotype A have been obtained for these unculturable bacteria using metagenomics from the psyllid vector Bactericera cockerelli. Here, we present the first genomic sequences obtained for the carrot-associated CLso. These two genomic sequences of haplotype C, FIN 114 (1. 24 Mbp) and FIN 111 (1. 20 Mbp), were obtained from <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllids</b> (Trioza apicalis) harboring CLso. Genomic comparisons between the haplotypes A, B and C revealed that the genome organization differs between these haplotypes, due to large inversions and other recombinations. Comparison of protein-coding genes indicated that the core genome of CLso consists of 885 ortholog groups, with the pan-genome consisting of 1327 ortholog groups. Twenty-seven ortholog groups are unique to CLso haplotype C, whilst 11 ortholog groups shared by the haplotypes A and B, are {{not found in the}} haplotype C. Some of these ortholog groups that {{are not part of the}} core genome may encode functions related to interactions with the different host plant and psyllid species...|$|R
40|$|GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF ‘CANDIDATUS LIBERIBACTER SOLANACEARUM’ STRAINS INFECTING CARROT PSYLLIDS IN SOUTHWESTERN FRANCE B. Bergey, S. Eveillard, X. Foissac UMR 1332 Fruit Biology and Pathology, INRA and University of Bordeaux, CS 20032, F- 33882 Villenave d’Ornon, France. E-mail: sandrine. eveillard@inra. fr. The phloem-limited bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum (CaLsol), is {{responsible}} of several diseases on Solanaceae (USA, New-Zealand) and Apiaceae such as carrots in several European countries (Spain, France Scandinavia, Germany). This bacterium is vectored by psyllids, Bactericera cokerelli to potatoes, or B. trigonica and Trioza apicalis to carrots. In France, since the 1970 s, proliferation of carrot {{was shown to}} be associated with a psyllid-transmitted, phloem limited bacterium. In order to reassess disease impact and better characterize the bacterium involved, five organic or non-organic carrot fields were surveyed in 2016 for CaLsol and psyllids in three production areas of Southwestern France. Psyllids were present at spring and summer only in an organic experimental field, but could be captured from September in all fields. The highest level of psyllid populations was reached in October when up to 350 specimens were collected upon 100 sweeps. <b>Psyllids</b> collected on <b>carrots</b> were most probably Bactericera trigonica. CaLsol could be detected by Taqman real-time PCR (Teresani et al., 2014) in psyllids as well as in carrots exhibiting stem proliferation and stunting. CaLsol detection ranged from 0 to 18 % in individual psyllids and from 0 to 9 % in carrots. In Europe, the two ribosomal CaLsol haplotypes D and E have been characterized based on the 16 S rDNA and the 16 S- 23 S spacer sequences. In the present survey, haplotype E was identified in both <b>carrot</b> and <b>psyllids,</b> as well as haplotype D 2, a new haplotype differing from the haplotype D by two SNPs. Genotyping using the five most variable gene markers described by Glynn and collaborators (2012) showed that the two haplotypes differed for all five markers dnaG, metG, recA, mutS and adk, with mutS being the most discriminant with 8 SNPs between haplotype E and D 2.

40|$|With only; 50 {{olfactory}} receptor neurons (ORNs), the <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid</b> Trioza apicalis (Homoptera: Psylloidea) {{may have}} the smallest olfactory system described in adult Neopteran insects. Using single sensillum recordings (SSR) and gas chromatograph–linked SSR, we characterized 4 olfactory sensilla forming a distinct morphological type, which together house; 25 % of all ORNs. We recorded responses to extracts and single constituents from Daucus carota ssp. sativus, from the conifers Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, and Juniperus communis, as well as frommale and female T. apicalis. Receptor neurons were highly selective; only 9 compounds in total elicited repeatable responses, and each neuron responded to at most 3 individual compounds. Chemical profiles of carrot and conifers showed significant overlap, with 4 out of 9 electrophysiologically active compounds occurring {{in more than one}} type of extract, but a carrot-specific compound elicited themost repeated responses. We identified 4 tentative neuron classes and found a rather high degree of neuronal redundancy, with 1 neuron class present in 3 and another present in all 4 of the sensilla, respectively.

40|$|Intercropping, {{or the use}} of {{different}} aspects of the interaction between organisms in ecosystems, can be classified as an ecological method that limits harmful human interference in the environment, especially the consumption of chemicals. The impact of intercropping carrot with coriander Coriandrum sativum L. and summer savory Satureja hortensis L. on the occurrence of select carrot pests was estimated in the years 2010 - 2011. Intercropping had a significant effect on the decrease of the number of roots damaged by carrot rust fly Psila rosae. During harvest, the least number of damaged roots was observed in combination with summer savory S. hortensis L. The number of <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid</b> Trioza viridula Zett. and aphids on carrot leaves and roots damaged by nematodes was significantly lower on plots where carrot was intercropped. Intercropping both herbs had a positive influence on the number of beneficial insects. In all of the years of the study, the highest number of Coccinellidae and Syrphidae were observed on plots where carrot was intercropped with coriander...|$|E
40|$|Three haplotypes of the {{recently}} discovered bacterium species “Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum” are described and related to geographic ranges. The first two are associated with Zebra Chip/Psyllid Yellows of potatoes and other solanaceous plants, vectored by the tomato/potato psyllid Bactericera cockerelli in North and Central America and New Zealand. The third is associated with diseased carrots in Finland and vectored by the <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid</b> Trioza apicalis. The haplotypes are described by SNPs on the 16 s rRNA, 16 s/ 23 s ISR and 50 s rplJ and rplL ribosomal protein genes. These SNPs are inherited as a package across the three genes. Haplotype “a” has been found primarily from Honduras and Guatemala through western Mexico to Arizona and California, and in New Zealand. Haplotype “b” is currently known from eastern Mexico and northwards through Texas to south central Washington. These haplotypes show some range overlap in Texas, Kansas and Nebraska. The haplotypes are not yet known to elicit biological differences in the plant or insect hosts. These apparently stable haplotypes suggest separate bacterial populations of long standing...|$|E
40|$|Insect-vectored plant {{bacterial}} pathogens {{are gaining}} attention {{in recent years}} due to crop threatening outbreaks around the world. Candidatus Liberibacter spp. are infecting crops of different botanical families: Solanaceae, Rutaceae, and Apiaceae and are vectored by psyllids. Five genetic haplotypes (A-E) have been described thus far for the species Ca. Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso). Haplotypes A and B infecting solanaceous plants, haplotypes C-E infecting Apiaceae crops. To better understand the genetic basis that governs host specificity of Lso haplotypes, we sequenced the genome of haplotype D (LsoD). The LsoD genome size is 1. 23 Mbp, with a GC content of 34. 8 % and 1167 predicted genes. Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers were assigned using the JGI software tool and 358 ECs were identified. ECs were mapped to metabolic pathways and compared with other sequenced Liberibacters. Phylogenetic analysis based on ECs and assigned metabolic pathways shows that LsoD groups together with Lso haplotypes (A and B) and is clearly different than Liberibacter species infecting citrus. Differences between LsoD and LsoA/B haplotypes were also found, hinting on host specific enzymes. The LsoD genome was also scanned to identify putatively secreted proteins using the SignalP tool. Thirty-one putative genes were identified, most of them with unknown function. While some genes have homologous in other Lso haplotypes, some were unique to LsoD. By quantitative-PCR we examined {{the expression of the}} putatively secreted proteins in the different hosts; the psyllid vector Bactericera trigonica, and carrot. Several genes with significantly higher expression levels in <b>carrot</b> compared with <b>psyllid</b> and vice versa were identified. These genes may have host specific functions. Overall, our analyses reveal genetic and metabolic elements differentiating the carrot-infecting Lso from Lso haplotypes infecting potato/tomato. Research is underway to identify the function of these elements...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the morphological basis for olfactory reception in the <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid</b> (Trioza apicalis) we used scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Our study reveals a very sparse sensillar setup. We identify and describe several {{different types of}} single-walled sensilla {{likely to have an}} olfactory function, as well as mechanosensory hairs and intracuticular sensilla. A T. apicalis antenna is about 0. 6 mm long and has 10 segments. Apically on the flagellum there are two conspicuous multi-porous single-walled bristles. There are six cuticular cavities on the flagellum; two smaller on the apical flagellomere, and four larger located on the lateral side of the antenna on flagellomeres 2, 4, 6 and 7. Each cavity contains two sensilla and there are three varieties of cavity sensilla. Mechano- and chemosensory hairs appear in low numbers on all segments but the third. Carrot psyllids most likely use olfactory cues to locate their rather strongly smelling host plants, and we argue that the low number of olfactory sensilla found in this insect may accommodate high concentrations of odour stimuli. There is no sexual dimorphism in the sensillar setup. In concordance with this, no sex pheromones have been described in the Psylloidea so far...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of {{different}} light gradient regimes on host-plant selection of the <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid,</b> Trioza apicalis Forster. In both a strong and a weak light gradient, carrot psyllids preferred a carrot leaf placed in higher light intensity. When the choice was between the host (carrot Daucus carota L.) and a non-host (barley Hordeum vulgare L.) virgin adults settled significantly more often on non-host in higher light intensity than on carrot in lower light intensity. In a weak light gradient, none of the gravid females settled on a non-host. In an experiment without light gradient, gravid females showed a preference for carrot, whereas virgin females settled approximately equally on Norway spruce Picea abies Karst. (winter shelter plant) and carrot. Our results show that virgin and gravid individuals have different host-plant selection behaviour, {{and that they are}} sensitive to small differences in light intensity. Both factors can create a source of variation in behavioural assays, and should be taken into consideration in future experiments with this and probably also related species. Our results suggest that carrot psyllids can utilize visual cues (light intensity or wavelength) in host-plant selection, and the role of visual cues should be more thoroughly studied...|$|E
40|$|Intercropping {{combines}} {{different aspects}} of the interaction between organisms in ecosystems and may be classified as a pro-ecological method of plant cultivation limiting the harmful human interference in the environment, especially the use of chemicals. It also allows high yield, good quality, and economic productivity to be achieved. The aim of the present study, conducted in the years 2003 – 2004 in Mydlniki near Kraków, was to determine the effect of intercropping carrot Nardin F 1 with French marigold (Tagetes patula nana L.) 'Kolombina' and pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) 'Promyk' on carrot yield, its quality, and the occurrence of pests. On average in both years of the study, intercropping did not reduce total or marketable carrot yield. In 2003 intercropping contributed to a significant increase in marketable yield compared with yield from sole cropping. In 2004 the dry matter content was higher in the roots of carrots grown with pot marigold. The treatments intercropped with both French and pot marigold were characterized by an increased content of sugars in carrot roots and in 2004 year – of carotenoids. Intercropping had a significant effect on the number of roots damaged by the carrot rust fly, Psila rosae, (the best in this respect was the combination with Tagetes) and by nematodes (the best in this respect was the combination with Calendula). The number of larvae of <b>carrot</b> <b>psyllid,</b> Trioza viridula, was significantly lower in the plots where carrot was intercropped. The study did not find intercropping to {{have a positive effect on}} reducing the occurrence of the root aphid...|$|E
