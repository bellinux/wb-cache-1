500|$|Dylan {{was only}} 21 {{years old when}} he wrote one of his most complex songs, [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall", often {{referred}} to as [...] "Hard Rain". Dylan is said to have premiered [...] "Hard Rain" [...] at the Gaslight Cafe, where Village performer Peter Blankfield recalled: [...] "He put out these pieces of loose-leaf paper ripped out of a spiral notebook. And he starts singing ... He finished singing it, and no one <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> The length of it, the episodic sense of it. Every line kept building and bursting". Dylan performed [...] "Hard Rain" [...] days later at Carnegie Hall on September 22, 1962, as part of a concert organized by Pete Seeger. The song gained added resonance during the Cuban Missile Crisis, just one month after Dylan's first performance of [...] "Hard Rain", when U.S. President John F. Kennedy gave his warning to the Soviet Union over their deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba, [...] Critics have interpreted the lyric 'hard rain' as a reference to nuclear fallout, but Dylan resisted the specificity of this interpretation. In a radio interview with Studs Terkel in 1963, Dylan said, [...] "No, it's not atomic rain, it's just a hard rain. It isn't the fallout rain. I mean some sort of end that's just gotta happen … In the last verse, when I say, 'the pellets of poison are flooding the waters', that means all the lies that people get told on their radios and in their newspapers." ...|$|E
