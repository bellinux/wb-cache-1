40|$|The River Kennet in {{southern}} England has exhibited excessive benthic algal growth and associated ecological problems, such as loss of macrophytes and invertebrates, since the 1980 s. These ecological problems {{were attributed to}} regular peaks in phosphorus concentration, which were widely attributed to intermittent failures of the Marlborough sewage treatment works (STW). This study deployed highfrequency phosphorus auto-analysers to monitor the total reactive phosphorus (TRP) concentrations of Marlborough STW final effluent and the downstream River Kennet at hourly and 30 minute resolution respectively, between 2008 and 2009. This monitoring confirmed that the Marlborough STW was operating well within its 1000 mg l-� 1 annual mean total phosphorus <b>consent</b> <b>limit,</b> with mean total P and soluble reactive P concentrations of 675 and 345 mg l-� 1 respectively. There were two occasions where effluent TRP concentration exceeded 1000 mg l-� 1, and {{only one of these}} resulted in a peak in TRP concentration of over 100 mg l-� 1 in the River Kennet at Mildenhall. The other nine peaks of over 100 mg l-� 1 in the River Kennet during the monitoring period were associated with storm events, indicating that diffuse-source inputs and remobilisation of stored within-channel phosphorus were the cause of the peaks in river concentration, rather than Marlborough STW. The value of high-frequency environmental monitoring and the problems associated with using nutrient auto-analysers in the field are discussed. Seasonal phosphorus consents for STWs could provide a useful and cost effective means to improve both water quality and river ecology in the upper River Kennet...|$|E

40|$|Following {{apparent}} {{increase in}} population {{and with a}} corresponding increase in solid waste generation in Ikere Ekiti, Ekiti State of Nigeria, this study was initiated to assess the level of environmental pollution and potential impact of wastes. Health risk assessment was determined by a survey of existing facilities for solid waste management. Microbiological and physicochemical analyses of decomposing waste, soil, and well water were carried out using standard procedures. Prevalent bacteria besides fungi isolated from solid waste, soil, and well water were Staphylococcus 36 (25. 85 %), Escherichia 49 (19. 61 %), Pseudomonas 40 (34. 11 %) and each of Shigella/Salmonella 32 (21. 82 %), respectively. Solid waste followed by soil, had the highest count at 5 % level of probability.

40|$|AbstractElevated sulfate {{concentrations}} in industrial effluent {{can lead to}} a number of significant problems, the most serious of which is the corrosion of concrete sewers as a result of hydrogen sulfide induced biogenic sulfuric acid attack; hydrogen sulfide can also create odor nuisance problems. The most common treatment process for sulfate removal from wastewaters is to precipitate it as gypsum using lime addition. Nevertheless, meeting discharge <b>consent</b> <b>limits</b> for sulfate can often present practical challenges due to the solubility of gypsum and so {{there is a need to}} investigate technological solutions that might provide for more consistent sulfate removal. This paper reports on the application of ultrasound during the sulfate precipitation process. We show that with as little as 10 s sonication at 24 kHz, significant increases in the rate of sulfate precipitation are observed. Particle size analysis, pH profiles and SEM micrographs, suggest that the likely mode of action is disaggregation of the calcium hydroxide particles, giving a greater solid–liquid interface, thus resulting in a faster dissolution rate and more readily available calcium ions. A range of experimental variables are studied, including the duration and power of sonication, as well as initial sulfate concentration and the effect of changing the time at which sonication is applied. For both sonicated and non-sonicated samples, precipitation commences almost immediately that the lime is added and so induction time is not an issue in this system...|$|R

The objective of this article is to critically analyze the provisions of “capacity to consent” in Mental Health Care Bill (MHC Bill 2013), under the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities (UNCRPD 2006). This article also attempts to offer a practical legal framework and some concrete suggestions, for psychiatrists operating in an ethically and legally challenging area of mental capacity. Some of the highlights include attempts to translate aspirations of the UNCRPD into MHC Bill 2013, which were out of context given the available resources, the family structure of our society, and inadequate research inputs. However, there is a need to introduce the capacity to consent to the MHC Bill 2013 after comprehensive research and to study the impact of such a revolutionary idea on the family aspects of our society. There is an urgent need to formulate and validate a capacity assessment tool for our population. The MHC Bill needs to consider the repercussion and impact of capacity to consent, thereby making room for the compulsory community treatment order empowering affected family members in providing much needed treatment for persons with mental illness...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the sediments and ecology of the dump ground was conducted in March 1995. The {{primary purpose of the}} investigation was to analyse factors which may be affecting the benthic biota on the dump ground. These include heavy metal content of the sediments, grain size characteristics of the sediments, and population distribution of the benthic biota on and surrounding the dump ground. It was intended that information obtained could be utilised in future investigations on the ecology of the dump ground, noting changes that have occurred over time. Heavy metal analysis of Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Mercury, Lead, and Zinc from the dump ground, turning basin, and inner harbour area indicate that concentrations of all heavy metals were all very low and well within resource <b>consent</b> <b>limits.</b> Sediment and ecological samples from 25 sites on and surrounding the dump ground were taken. Two other sites were also surveyed, one from the turning basin, another from the inner harbour area (dredged material). Examination of the sediments has shown that although the dredged material consists solely of mud sized particles the sediments of the dump ground are mainly sand sized sediments. This suggests that during the dumping process dispersion of mud occurs. Mud is transported off the dump ground in a southeasterly direction. Ecological evaluation indicates benthic species diversity and abundance of macrofauna is high, with no species in particular dominating the species assemblage. Comparison between this study and a 1993 survey shows increased diversity over the dump ground. Increased population abundance was evident and larger sized bivalves are indicative of an ageing population. Field experiments examining the kelp beds indicate a decline in the population of Ecklonia radiata from 1993 to 1996. It is thought that this decline may be due to suspended sediment load from the Turanganui River, as the kelp beds are situated in the direction of discharge from the River...|$|R

40|$|Background: Autopsy {{examination}} {{has been}} the bedrock of western medicine. With {{the decline in the}} autopsy rate secondary to the negative psychological impact to the deceased's relatives, the benefits of autopsy have been undermined. Minimally invasive autopsy has been introduced but has not been widely adopted {{as an alternative to the}} 'traditional' open approach. This technique not only provides information on the cause of death abut also minimizes the disfigurement induced to the deceased. Our study aims to explore the feasibility and evaluate the accuracy of this technique. Methods: A series of coroner cases ordered for autopsy were examined by a group including an experienced forensic pathologist and two experienced laparoscopic surgeons using thoracoscopic, laparoscopic, endoluminal or endovascular approaches. The procedure was video-recorded and the provisional diagnoses and causes of death were made based on the findings. These findings were subsequently correlated with the full autopsy examination. A few limited clinical post-mortem examinations were also performed with consent from relatives. Results: A total of 22 cases of minimally invasive autopsies were performed from November 2007 to March 2008. The median duration of the procedures was 78. 3 ± 20. 7 min. Thoracoscopies and laparoscopies were performed in 18 patients while additional arterioscopic examination with endoscope was performed in two patients with suspected aortic diseases. Four <b>consented</b> <b>limited</b> clinical autopsies were also performed: two of them involved thoracoscopic biopsies of lung tissues, one was a para-mortem upper endoscopy for the investigation of pathology of the stomach and the other one was laparoscopy for a patient, who died of unexplained acidosis. Comparison with full autopsies showed that the accuracy of the diagnosis was 94. 4 %, the sensitivity was 90 %, the specificity was 100 %, the positive predictive value was 100 % and the negative predictive value was 88. 9 %. Conclusion: Minimally invasive autopsy is a feasible approach, yielding accurate findings when compared with conventional autopsies. The former can be a valuable tool for obtaining more valuable information in situations when the next-of-kin of the deceased does not consent to a conventional autopsy. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
