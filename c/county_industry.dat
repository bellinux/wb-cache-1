As a result of the end of Department of Energy Defense Programs mission production on September 30, 1994, considerable changes at the Pinellas Plant occurred.

40|$|Industry in Osijek-Baranja County has {{suffered}} from multiple direct and indirect consequences from the defensive war. It is estimated 60 per cent reduction in production capacities. Difficult situation was even worse as {{at the same time}} serious reduction of business activities, closing off its largest export markets, Former Yugoslavia, privatization process, and impossibility for facing foreign competition, occurred. Old technology, indifference to technical science with young people, brain drain to more perspective counties and states, and lack of financial sources, have only increased the existing problems that industry in Osijek-Baranja County is facing. In these conditions, it was hard to keep in step with global production trends and with orientation of traditional industry into “new industry” based on development and application of scientific and research work results. Industry is changing. It is changing in the way that it is becoming based on knowledge, innovation, creativity, sustainable development and new technology application in all business spheres. Because of that, industry has an influence on developing new businesses, most common non-production ones. From the moment of signing Stabilization and Association Agreement, the Republic of Croatia has possibilities to use financial resources from the European Union pre-accession instruments and funds.

40|$|Jo Ann Baumgartner {{directs the}} Wild Farm Alliance, based in Watsonville, California. WFA’s mission, as {{described}} on the organization’s website, is “to promote agriculture that helps to protect and restore wild Nature. ” Through research, publications, presentations, events, policy work, and consulting, the organization works to “connect food systems with ecosystems. ” Sam Earnshaw is Central Coast regional coordinator of the Community Alliance with Family Farmers. Working with CAFF’s farmscaping program, he helps farmers plant hedgerows and create grass waterways, improving production while increasing biodiversity and wildlife habitat on their lands. In 2009 Earnshaw was awarded the North American Pollinator Protection Campaign’s Pollinator Advocate Award {{as part of an}} international effort to promote public awareness of bees, bats, butterflies, beetles, and other animals that enable the reproduction of over seventy-five percent of flowering plants. In 2008 Earnshaw and Baumgartner received the Stewards of Sustainable Agriculture (Sustie) award from the Ecological Farming Association. Baumgartner and Earnshaw met in the early 1980 s while working on a five-year research project using reclaimed wastewater for crop irrigation in the Salinas Valley. Alarmed by the toxicity of the conventional agricultural environment, the couple became interested in organic production; when they left the research project in the mid- 1980 s, they started their own organic Neptune Farms, in Santa Cruz County. During this period they were involved with the development of California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) and with {{the early days of the}} Ecological Farming Association (EFA). In the early 1990 s, Earnshaw began working for CAFF’s predecessor, California Action Network, with its newly founded Lighthouse Farm Network, organizing breakfasts for farmers to share ideas and strategies for sustainable production. In the mid-to-late 1990 s, Earnshaw and Baumgartner both worked with the Campaign to Save Pajaro Valley Farmlands and Wetlands, ultimately creating a 25 -year urban growth boundary in the area. Sarah Rabkin conducted this interview with Baumgartner and Earnshaw at the WFA offices on Monday, May 18, 2009. At the time, both were giving considerable attention to issues related to food safety—a pressing concern in the wake of recent events. In the fall of 2006, an outbreak of food-borne illness caused by the pathogen E. coli 0157 :H 7 had sickened about 200 people and killed three; the outbreak was traced to bagged fresh spinach grown in San Benito <b>County.</b> <b>Industry</b> and government leaders were calling for the elimination of farm hedgerows and other non-crop vegetation in order to create “clean” or “sterile” growing environments, despite compelling evidence that the pathogen originated elsewhere. Baumgartner and Earnshaw were working hard to educate farmers, industry and government representatives, and the general public—explaining the benefits of farm biodiversity for soil and water conservation and ecological health, and promoting best practices for keeping the food supply safe...|$|E
