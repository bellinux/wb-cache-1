25|$|Because of this, {{zero coupon}} bonds subject to U.S. {{taxation}} should generally {{be held in}} tax-deferred retirement accounts, to avoid paying taxes on future income. Alternatively, when purchasing a zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bond</b> issued by a U.S. state or local government entity, the imputed interest is free of U.S. federal taxes, and in most cases, state and local taxes, too.|$|E
25|$|These {{equations}} {{are frequently}} combined for particular uses. For example, bonds {{can be readily}} priced using these equations. A typical <b>coupon</b> <b>bond</b> is composed of two types of payments: a stream of coupon payments similar to an annuity, and a lump-sum return of capital {{at the end of}} the bond's maturity—that is, a future payment. The two formulas can be combined to determine the present value of the bond.|$|E
2500|$|Zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> have a {{duration}} {{equal to}} the bond's time to maturity, which makes them sensitive to any changes in the interest rates. Investment banks or dealers may separate coupons from the principal of <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds,</b> which {{is known as the}} residue, so that different investors may receive the principal and each of the coupon payments. [...] This creates a supply of new zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Note {{that any}} of the bonds could be zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds,</b> meaning they do not pay any coupon interest. It would be easy to build a {{dedicated}} portfolio consisting entirely of zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds,</b> but their yields can often be lower than <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> Another problem with “zeros” is that taxes must be paid each year on the increase in value of a zero-coupon bond (assuming it is held in a taxable account), even though no interest was actually received.|$|R
25|$|Some zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> are {{inflation}} indexed, so {{the amount}} of money that will be paid to the bond holder is calculated to have a set amount of purchasing power rather than a set amount of money, but the majority of zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> pay a set amount of money known as the face value of the bond.|$|R

2500|$|A {{zero-coupon bond}} (also {{discount}} bond or deep discount bond) is a bond {{bought at a}} price lower than its face value, with the face value repaid {{at the time of}} maturity. Note that this definition assumes a positive time value of money. It does not make periodic interest payments, or have so-called [...] "coupons", hence the term zero-coupon bond. When the bond reaches maturity, its investor receives its par (or face) value. Examples of zero-coupon bonds include U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. savings bonds, long-term zero-coupon bonds, and any type of <b>coupon</b> <b>bond</b> that has been stripped of its coupons.|$|E
40|$|Debt financing, such as {{bonds and}} notes payable, {{comes with an}} {{interest}} cost that is incurred by the borrower and paid to the lender providing compensation {{for the use of}} funds. When zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> are issued, interest is included in the principal amount or face value of the <b>bonds.</b> Although <b>coupon</b> payments are not made during the life of the bonds, the company accrues interest expense on them, which is paid when the bonds are repurchased or redeemed at maturity. Hence, when a company repurchases or redeems zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds,</b> it should classify the cash outflow for the repayment of principal amount received from bondholders as a financing use of cash and the amount paid in excess of the principal as operating use of cash. This study examines the cash flow reporting practices of companies that repurchase or redeem zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> We also evaluate the impact these practices have on the reported cash flows from operating activities. Our results indicate that most companies classify the cash paid towards interest on zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> as a financing use of cash. The mean reduction in reported operating cash flow that would be caused by inclusion of interest paid on zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> averaged approximately 11 %...|$|R
50|$|Zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> may be long {{or short}} term investments. Long-term zero coupon {{maturity}} dates typically start at {{ten to fifteen}} years.

The U.S. Treasury bill market is the most active and liquid debt market in the world.|$|R

2500|$|Arbitrage {{arguments}} ("Rational pricing") apply {{when the}} deliverable asset exists in plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created. Here, the forward price represents the expected future value of the underlying discounted at the risk free rate—as any deviation from the theoretical price will afford investors a riskless profit opportunity and should be arbitraged away. We define the forward price to be the strike K such that the contract has 0 value at the present time. Assuming interest rates are constant the forward price of the futures {{is equal to the}} forward price of the forward contract with the same strike and maturity. It is also the same if the underlying asset is uncorrelated with interest rates. Otherwise the difference between the forward price on the futures (futures price) and forward price on the asset, is proportional to the covariance between the underlying asset price and interest rates. For example, a futures on a zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bond</b> will have a futures price lower than the forward price. This is called the futures [...] "convexity correction." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{connection}} with a troubled debt restructuring, a debtor, with the creditor's approval, sells the collateral, which has a fair value less than the creditor's net investment in the related loan, and invests the proceeds {{in a series of}} zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> that are received and held by the creditor as collateral for the newly restructured loan. The bonds will mature at a value equal to each year's debt service requirement under the newly restructured terms. The issue is whether the sale of collateral, the purchase of the zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds,</b> and their receipt by the creditor as collateral require the creditor to recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the net investment in the loan exceeds the fair value of the zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> Copyright © 2010, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistributio...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{stochastic}} model to hedge {{the present value}} of cash flows against interest-rate risk with fixed-income products, in particular, with zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> In our approach, the dynamics of the interest rate is driven by a mean-reverting stochastic diffusion process. The model stresses the concepts of money duration and money convexity in interest-rate risk management.

5000|$|One {{possible}} approach, and {{one that}} is gaining increasing attention, is the use of replicating portfolios or hedge portfolios.
