Mgr Pavel Javorský, Dr., Department of Condensed Matter Physics Abstract: Thanks to {{presence of}} only one electron in 4 f shell of cerium ion, Ce based compounds reveal wide range of exceptional magnetic properties like valence fluctuations, magnetic ordering or spin glass behavior. In present thesis we mainly focus on tetragonal CeCuxAl 4 -x system and its magnetic behavior. Former results of inelastic neutron experiments opened discussion about energy levels of cerium ions in CeCuAl 3. Except two crystal field excitations also one additional energy level was present, phenomenon of vibron quasi-bound state was proposed to explain observed energy structure. Measurement and analysis of specific heat and neutron inelastic scattering on compounds with various Cu content should help to understand phenomenon of vibron state and also its development with Cu/Al concentration. Another two types of <b>cerium</b> <b>compounds</b> will be investigated in means of specific heat and resistivity measurement, polycrystalline sample of CePt 4 Al and single crystal of Ce 3 Ru 4 Al 12.

CeRu_ 2 Al_ 10 is an exceptional <b>cerium</b> <b>compound</b> with an unusually high Neel temperature of 27 K. Here we study {{the stability of the}} unusual magnetic order by means of controlled doping, and we uncover further surprising attributes of this phase transition. The heat capacity, resistivity and μSR measurements reveal an onset of magnetic ordering below 23 K, while a broad peak at 31 K (i. e. above T_N), has been observed in the temperature dependent susceptibility, indicating an opening of a spin gap above T_N. Our important finding, from the neutron diffraction, is that the compound orders antiferromagnetically with a propagation vector k = (1 0 0) and the ordered state moment is 0. 20 (1) μ_B along the b-axis. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} undoped compound, which shows AFM ordering at 27 K with the ordered moment of 0. 39 (3) μ_B along the c-axis. Similar to CeRu_ 2 Al_ 10 our inelastic neutron scattering study on the Re doped shows a sharp spin gap-type excitation near 8 meV at 5 K, but with slightly reduced intensity compared to the undoped compound. Further the excitation broadens and shifts to lower energy (< 4 meV) near 35 K.

40|$|Ce 3 Bi 4 Pt 3 is a <b>cerium</b> <b>compound</b> that {{exhibits}} a hybridization gap and concomitant semiconducting {{behavior in the}} coherent ground state. Using neutron powder diffraction, we have determined the variation of the lattice constant with temperature at two pressures (P= 10 - 3 and 17. 7 kbar), and determined the bulk modulus and atomic mean-square displacements for Ce 3 Bi 4 Pt 3 and its normal analog, La 3 Bi 4 Pt 3. The thermal expansion Δβ in Ce 3 Bi 4 Pt 3 {{exhibits a}} maximum at Tmax= 50 K at ambient pressure. Below 50 K, the bulk modulus ΔB is proportional to TΔβ. We apply a Grüneisen analysis, {{under the assumption that}} the free energy exhibits T/T 0 (V) scaling. The Grüneisen parameter deduced from the ratio ΔB/TΔβ is consistent with the value Ω= 36 deduced from the pressure variation of Tmax. The analysis allows us to predict the temperature dependence of the 4 f specific heat (ΔCΔβ/Ω), which thus has a maximum at 50 K and a high-temperature entropy nearly equal the expected value R ln 6. We argue that the maximum at 50 K reflects an (indirect) hybridization gap of order 100 K. We show further that the lattice constant anomaly Δa 0 is proportional to the effective moment Tχ; this suggests that a relationship known to be valid for antiferromagnets, namely (Tχ) /TΔC where ΔC is the specific heat, may be valid for Ce 3 Bi 4 Pt 3. Finally, we show that the temperature dependence of the mean-square atomic displacements is nearly identical for Ce 3 Bi 4 Pt 3 and La 3 Bi 4 Pt 3 and can be fitted by a simple Debye-Waller model; hence the expansion anomaly does not affect the average lattice dynamics. © 1992 The American Physical Society...|$|R
