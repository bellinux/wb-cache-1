40|$|<b>Cartap</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> a nereistoxin analog, is a {{commonly}} used low toxicity insecticide. We describe {{a patient who}} presented to the emergency department with alleged history of ingestion of <b>Cartap</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{as an act of}} deliberate self-harm. The patient was managed conservatively. To our knowledge this is the first case report of <b>Cartap</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> suicidal poisoning. Cartap toxicity has been considered to be minimal, but a number of animal models have shown significant neuromuscular toxicity resulting in respiratory failure. It is hypothesized that the primary effect of <b>Cartap</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is through inhibition of the [3 H]-ryanodine binding to the Ca 2 + release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in a dose-dependent manner and promotion of extracellular Ca 2 + influx and induction of internal Ca 2 + release. This results in tonic diaphragmatic contraction rather than paralysis. This is the basis of the clinical presentation of acute Cartap poisoning as well as the treatment with chelators namely British Anti Lewisite and sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate...|$|E

40|$|Rice is {{the staple}} food of {{over half the}} world's {{population}} and occupies almost one-fifth of the global cropland under cereals. The rice root weevil, Echinocnemus oryzae Marshall, (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) has posed a problem in paddy cultivation areas in India. The damage by this root weevil results in {{a significant decrease in}} root and shoot biomass and ultimately the yield of rice plants. Studies were conducted to test the effective management practices of rice root weevil using a seedling treatment with chlorpyriphos alone and in combination with a soil application of chlorpyriphos, fipronil and <b>cartap</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> during 2013 and 2014. The benefit:cost (B:C) ratio was also determined from the marketable yield and cost of treatments incurred in the technology to justify the economic viability of the appropriate technology management against E.  oryzae. Reductions in tillers/hill (35. 2 % and 26. 27 %) and, in panicles/hill (44. 0 % and 31. 96 %) were observed during 2013 and 2014, respectively. The least number of root weevils (3. 67 and 3. 13) were observed in comparison to no root weevil management practice (23. 53 and 32. 53) during 2013 and 2014, respectively, from the treatment of seedlings prior to transplanting with chlorpyriphos at 3  mL/L of water followed by soil application with <b>cartap</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> at 20  kg/ha. The highest numbers of tillers/hill (25. 00 and 23. 60), numbers of panicles/hill (20. 00 and 19. 40), yield (5. 41  t/ha and 4. 57  t/ha) and B:C ratio (1. 75 and 1. 48) were also observed from the same treatment during 2013 and 2014, respectively...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe predatory bug Orius insidiosus is an {{important}} biological control agent of several insect pests, {{and is one of}} the most commonly used species in biological control programs worldwide. This study assessed the lethal and sublethal effects of insecticides on this species through life table, and classified the insecticides according to the definitions of toxicity given by the International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control of Noxious Animals and Plants (IOBC). A bioassay was carried out using a completely randomized design with eight treatments and 40 replicates. Eggs of O. insidiosus laid naturally in plant stems were immersed in aqueous solutions of the chemical products. Egg viability, duration of the embryonic period, survival of nymphs, and duration of the nymphal period were assessed daily. Insects that reached adulthood were paired and their reproduction assessed. The number of eggs produced and the survival of adults were assessed daily. The insecticides abamectin, <b>cartap</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> spirotetramat+imidacloprid, and flubendiamid were classified as harmful. Pyriproxyfen and rynaxypyr were categorized as harmless and pymetrozine was classified as slightly harmful.

40|$|In agriculture, {{the use of}} {{pesticide}} has been the dominant form of pest management since the 1950 s to kill pest organisms including insects, weeds, fungi and nematodes. In recent times, use {{of pesticide}}s in rice farming has increased rapidly and this scenario contributes significantly towards adverse effects on human health and environment. This study investigated types of pesticide and identified their hazards and potential risks used by rice farmers {{in the village of}} Permatang Keriang, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. Pesticide use, pesticide formulation, groups, classes, major pests as well as pesticide risks and toxicity were examined. Forty selected rice farmers which represent 33 % of the total rice farmer population were interviewed based on 40 questions. From the survey, eight pesticide formulations including Actara (85 %), Karate (93 %), Nurelle 505 (73 %), Nominee 100 SC (83 %), Tapisan (65 %) and Yasodion (62 %) were found commonly used by the farmers in rice farming activities to control several major pests including plant diseases, fungi, insects and rodents. Major active ingredients of the pesticides found in this study were cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, lambda-cyhalothrin, difenoconazole, bispyribac-sodium, isoprothiolane and <b>cartap</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> From the study, it was observed that both high and low toxicity pesticides were used. Hazard identification and evaluation of potential risks which takes into account pesticide use and toxicity conducted in this study can help prioritise pesticides of greatest health risk to rice farming communities. In addition, this study could provide a fundamental baseline of a further study on a detailed risk assessment of pesticides amongst ric...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effects of different systemic insecticides in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum var. Diamante). The study also assessed different systemic insecticides used in other plants in their effectiveness and suitability to tomato by evaluating the carotenoid content and antibacterial activity of each insecticide. Morphological characteristics such as the weight, the number and the circumference of tomato fruits and the height of the plant were also observed. Moreover, the cost effectiveness was computed. Treatments were designated as follows: Treatment 1 - plants sprayed with active ingredient (a. i.) cartap hydrochloride; Treatment 2 - plants sprayed with a. i. indoxacarb; Treatment 3 - plants sprayed with a. i. chlorantraniliprole and thiamethoxam; Treatment 4 - plants sprayed with a. i. dinotefuran (positive control); and Treatment 5 - no insecticide applied. The experimental design used was Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. The first three systemic insecticides with such active ingredient were not yet registered for tomato plant. Statistical analyses show that there were no significant differences among the weight, the number and the circumference of tomato fruits and the height of the plant for each treatment. Results showed that treatments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 extracts have 49. 74, 44. 16, 48. 19, 52. 57 and 50. 60 μg/g of total carotenoids (TC), respectively. Statistical analysis shows that there no significant differences in the TC content of each treatment. The antibacterial activity of each plant sample showed no significant differences among treatments. Thin layer chromatographic analysis revealed that there were equal numbers of spots for all the plant samples. The study concluded that systemic insecticide with a. i. <b>cartap</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> be introduced to the farmers as insecticide for tomato plant since it shows comparable effect with the registered insecticide (T 4) based on the morphological characteristics, total carotenoid content, antibacterial activity and found to be the most cost-effective...|$|E
