But, though the Institute of Mechanical Engineers would certainly not own me, I am not sure that I have not all along been a sort of mechanical engineer in partibus infidelium.[6] I am now occasionally horrified to think how very little I ever knew or cared about medicine as the art of healing. The only part of my professional course which really and deeply interested me was physiology, which is the mechanical engineering of living machines; and, notwithstanding that natural science has been my proper business, I am afraid there is very little of the genuine naturalist in me. I never collected anything, and species work was always a burden to me; what I cared for was the architectural and engineering part of the business, the working out of the wonderful unity of plan in the thousands and thousands of diverse living constructions, and the modifications of similar apparatuses to serve diverse ends. The extraordinary attraction I felt towards the study of the intricacies of living structure nearly proved fatal to me at the outset. I was a mere boy--I think between thirteen and fourteen years of age--when I was taken by some older student friends of mine to the first post-mortem examination I ever attended. All my life I have been most unfortunately sensitive to the disagreeables which attend anatomical pursuits, but on this occasion my curiosity overpowered all other feelings, and I spent two or three hours in gratifying it. I did not cut myself, and none of the ordinary symptoms of dissection-poison supervened, but poisoned I was somehow, and I remember sinking into a strange state of apathy. By way of a last chance, I was sent to the care of some good, kind people, friends of my father's, who lived in a farmhouse in the heart of Warwickshire. I remember staggering from my bed to the window on the bright spring morning after my arrival, and throwing open the casement. Life seemed to come back on the wings of the breeze, and to this day the faint odor of wood-smoke, like that which floated across the farm-yard in the early morning, is as good to me as the [...] "sweet south upon a bed of violets."[7] I soon recovered, but for years I suffered from occasional paroxysms of internal pain, and from that time my constant friend, hypochondriacal dyspepsia, commenced his half century of <b>co-tenancy</b> of my fleshly tabernacle.|$|E
50|$|The Company {{was founded}} by Joseph Rank in 1875 as flour milling {{business}} when he rented a small windmill. He initially lost money and therefore took a <b>co-tenancy</b> at West's Holderness Corn Mill. In 1885 he built a mechanically-driven flour mill in Hull in order to beat competition from abroad. He used steel rollers instead of mill stones thereby producing six sacks of flour an hour instead of one and a half. In 1888 he built another steel-roller plant in Lincolnshire, and soon after, built a more modern plant, producing 20 sacks of flour an hour.|$|E
50|$|A {{concurrent}} estate or <b>co-tenancy</b> {{is a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize tenancies in common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a tenancy in common.|$|E
50|$|West Melbourne and North Melbourne were {{considered}} to be a stronger chance of gaining admission to the League as an amalgamated entity than as separate clubs, but in reality there were other drivers which would likely have seen the clubs merged for 1908 even without the opportunity to join the League. North Melbourne was struggling on the field, and West Melbourne was struggling financially. Furthermore, after years of sharing the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve as a home ground, West Melbourne had brokered a deal to play at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, sharing it with the Essendon (League) Football Club in 1907; but, this deal was cancelled when University entered the League and assumed the <b>co-tenancy</b> of the ground, leaving West Melbourne homeless once again. North Melbourne and West Melbourne did share a strong history of collaboration as a result of proximity and sharing the same ground, and were seen as a natural fit for an amalgamation.|$|E
50|$|On September 30, 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger vetoed AB 2567, {{which would}} have {{declared}} May 22 as Harvey Milk State Holiday (non-fiscal) and designate that date as having special significance in public schools and educational institutions and encourage those entities to conduct suitable commemorative exercises on that date. Also that same day, he signed AB 2654 into law, which conforms statutory code provisions prohibiting discrimination in specific government and business operations to those characteristics already covered by non-discrimination laws of general application to government operations and business establishments. Also that same day, he signed AB 3015 into law, which requires additional subject matter coverage in mandatory trainings of foster care providers and licensing personnel to include basic instruction on existing laws regarding the safety of foster youth at school, including the California Student Safety and Violence Prevention Act of 2000. Also that same day, he vetoed SB 153, {{which would have}} excluded a transfer of <b>co-tenancy</b> interest in a principal residence from property tax reassessment if the principal residence was owned by two individuals and was transferred {{to one of those}} individuals upon the death of the other, with the survivor obtaining sole ownership of that property. Also that same day, he vetoed SB 1661, which would have provided that an individual shall be deemed to have left his or her most recent work with good cause if the individual's employment is terminated {{as a result of the}} individual's taking a qualifying leave under the family temporary disability insurance program.|$|E
40|$|Given {{the current}} {{financial}} crisis, we explore {{the impact that}} tenant bankruptcies have on the risk and return performance of their publicly traded landlord. We focus on retail REITs since the contracting mechanism associated with retail leases has several options such as percentage rents and <b>co-tenancy</b> provisions that are not found in leases for other property types. Ex-ante, we argue that {{the performance of a}} landlord will depend on which option dominates given that a departure of an anchor or key tenant from a center affords the landlord with a growth option, the opportunity to adjust rents to market. Utilizing an event study approach, we find significant abnormal negative returns follow the bankruptcy of a tenant in general which is consistent with the market perceiving that tenants will take advantage of the <b>co-tenancy</b> option. However, we also find that there are some situations where the growth option is in the money and thus abnormal returns are positive particularly in markets that have a more diversified economic base...|$|E
30|$|The {{reference}} to “co-residence” or (<b>co-tenancy)</b> implies that multiple independent customers {{share the same}} physical infrastructure [22]. This fact results in a scheme where Virtual Machines owned by different customers may {{be placed in the}} same physical machine. There are several methods that can achieve the discovery of neighbouring Virtual Machines in a Cloud infrastructure. There are also other methods who wish to counter this specific attack.|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{economic}} dependence and financial market feedback effects among firms with economic linkages, notably landlord-tenant when shocks occur to the system. In particular, we examine 157 major tenant bankruptcy announcements of retail real estate firms over the 2000 to 2010 period. The contracting mechanism associated with retail leases provides several unique {{features such as}} percentage rents and <b>co-tenancy</b> clauses that are absent in other type of leases. We find that in a good economy, a tenant bankruptcy has a less negative or more positive effect on a landlord 2 ̆ 7 s stock return, {{which is consistent with}} the growth option hypothesis. We also find that landlords who have properties located in markets with a highly diversified economic base are more likely to exercise the growth option given a tenant departure and thus realize higher stock returns...|$|E
40|$|Feather- {{associated}} {{bacteria are}} widespread inhabitants of avian plumage. However, {{the determinants of}} the between-individual variation in plumage bacterial loads are less well understood. Infection intensities can be determined by ecological factors, such as breeding habitat, and can be actively regulated by hosts via preening. Preening, yet, is a resource intensive activity, and thus might be traded-off against reproductive investment in breeding birds. Here, we studied barn swallows Hirundo rustica to assess the bacterial cost of reproduction in relation to nesting site micro-habitats. Barn swallows prefer to breed {{in the company of}} large-sized farm animals, although the presence of mammalian livestock in barns assures a warm and humid micro-climate that favours bacterial proliferation. Thus, we experimentally manipulated brood sizes of birds breeding in barns with, or without, farm animals and measured total cultivable bacteria (TCB) and feather-degrading bacteria (FDB) from the plumage. We found that the abundance of feather-associated bacteria (i. e. both TCB and FDB) in females, but not males, breeding in barns with livestock were significantly higher than in conspecifics breeding in empty barns. Plumage bacterial loads, however, were not affected by brood size manipulations in either sex. In addition, we report a negative relationship between both TCB and FDB and hatching date in females, and several sex and seasonal differences in plumage bacterial abundances. Our study is the first to show that breeding micro-habitat (i. e. livestock <b>co-tenancy)</b> has consequences for the abundance of feather-associated bacteria...|$|E
