40|$|ABSTRACT: Upstream {{constructed}} tailings dams {{represent a}} significant {{challenge to the}} geotechnical engineer in terms of analysis of their stability, {{in large part because}} the shear strength of the loose sands and fine grained or “slimes ” components of such structures is open to considerable uncertainty. In particular, it is critical that the behavior of the tailings under shear (<b>contractant</b> or dilatant, failure under drained or undrained conditions) be understood, and that this understanding be incorporated into stability analyses. The continued development of critical state soil mechanics has served to focus attention on this issue, but this focus has generally been directed towards problems involving seismic liquefaction. However, <b>contractant</b> versus dilatant behavior in shear is equally important in terms of static stability, particularly for upstream tailings dams which so often are constructed of primarily <b>contractant,</b> potentially liquefiable materials. This paper presents a review of drained versus undrained methods of static stability analysis of upstream tailings dams, and how these relate to dilatant versus <b>contractant</b> behavior. The authors support the view that for upstream dams constructed of <b>contractant,</b> potentially liquefiable tailings, both undrained strength analysis and steady state strength analysis should be considered, and that effective stress analysis for such structures can be fundamentally incorrect and unsafe. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{plasticity}} type {{model is}} here {{considered for the}} flow of a dry granular material such as grain or sand. The physical and kinematic basis for the model is briefly summarised and the equations governing the model are presented {{in terms of the}} components of the deformation-rate, spin and stress tensors. The equations comprise a set of six first order partial differential equations of hyperbolic type for which there are five distinct characteristic directions. An idealised application to a hopper is considered for the flow {{in the vicinity of the}} upper free surface. A simple analytic solution is given in which (a) the velocity field is linear in the space coordinates and represents a dilatant or <b>contractant</b> shear, (b) two possible stress fields are proposed, one linear and one exponential in space, which satisfy the stress equilibrium equations, the yield condition and the traction-free condition at the free surface, (c) the density is homogeneous in space and exponential in time. Finally, a method is proposed for defining an intrinsic time-scale for the deformation, which enables a physically realistic density field to be obtained via a sequence of dilatant and <b>contractant</b> shearing motions. Full advantage is taken of the hyperbolic nature of the governing equations to allow the solution to have discontinuities in the field variables, or their derivatives, in crossing characteristic lines. 1...|$|E
40|$|A multi-scale {{approach}} is proposed {{as an attempt}} to assess internal erosion induced effects on the mechanical properties of a granular medium. In this first analysis, the degradation of a granular assembly is simulated through the progressive removal of its smallest particles for both isotropic and anisotropic stress states. A discrete element model as well as a micromechanical constitutive relation is used to compare induced deformations and mechanical properties changes along the extraction process. The shear strength and flow properties appear to be strongly modified by this degradation: both models highlight the occurrence of failure during degradation process for stress states beyond the characteristic state; and, for unfailed samples, a change from a typical dilatant to a typical <b>contractant</b> behavior after degradation...|$|E
40|$|It is {{traditionally}} accepted that {{the basis of}} contractual liability is either consensus, that is the actual {{meeting of the minds}} of the <b>contractants,</b> or the reasonable belief by one <b>contractants</b> that there is consensus. In this paper the various approaches to contractual liability are examined. The conclusion that is reached is that the direct application of reliance protecti~n can -effectively serve as the basis of contractual liability in our law today. It is submitted that the elements to found contractual liability are representation or conduct, unducement; a reasonable reliance upon consensus, and detriment or prejudice. It is forcefully argued that although blameworthiness (fault) may play a substantial role in determining whether reliance upon consensus should be protected, it is not the decisive element to the enquiry: rather regard should be had to all the surrounding circumstances relating to the contractual relationship.

40|$|Phase {{microscopy}} of toad {{urinary bladder}} {{has demonstrated that}} vasopressin can cause an enlargement of the epithelial intercellular spaces under conditions of no net transfer of water or sodium. The suggestion that this phenomenon {{is linked to the}} hormone's action as a smooth muscle relaxant has been tested and verified with the use of other agents effecting smooth muscle: atropine and adenine compounds (relaxants), K+ and acetylcholine (<b>contractants).</b> Furthermore, it was possible to reduce the size and number of intercellular spaces, relative to a control, while increasing the rate of osmotic water flow. A method for quantifying these results has been developed and shows that they are, indeed, significant. It is concluded, therefore, that the configuration of intercellular spaces is not a reliable index of water flow across this epithelium and that such a morphologic-physiologic relationship is tenuous in any epithelium supported by a submucosa rich in smooth muscle...|$|R

To the Low Countries, the British sent the son of King George II, the 24-year-old Duke of Cumberland, as the new captain general of Britain's army, while Maria Theresa sent the experienced Count Königsegg to command Austrian forces. The trio of generals was completed by Prince Waldeck, commander of the Dutch contingent in theatre. They hoped to gain the initiative by the establishment of forward magazines and an early opening of the campaign season. Major supply and ammunition depot magazines were set up for the British by General Ligonier at Ghent, Oudenarde and Tournai, while the Dutch general, Vander – Duyn, placed theirs at Mons, Charleroi and Tournai.|$|R

The laboratory testing programme consisted of standard drained and undrained triaxial compression tests, at increasing values of cell pressure. One-dimensional compression tests were also carried out in oedometers with reduced cross-section.

Recently, we reported the discovery of GnRH-type and CRZ-type signaling systems in an echinoderm, the starfish Asterias rubens, demonstrating that the evolutionary origin of paralogous GnRH-type and CRZ-type neuropeptides {{can be traced back to}} the common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes. Here, we have investigated the physiological roles of the GnRH-type (ArGnRH) and the CRZ-type (ArCRZ) neuropeptides in A. rubens, using mRNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and in vitro pharmacology. ArGnRH precursor (ArGnRHP) -expressing cells and ArGnRH-immunoreactive cells and/or processes are present in the radial nerve cords, circumoral nerve ring, digestive system (e. g., cardiac stomach and pyloric stomach), body wall-associated muscle (apical muscle), and appendages (tube feet, terminal tentacle). The general distribution of ArCRZ precursor (ArCRZP) -expressing cells is similar to that of ArGnRHP, but with specific local differences. For example, cells expressing ArGnRHP are present in both the ectoneural and hyponeural regions of the radial nerve cords and circumoral nerve ring, whereas cells expressing ArCRZP were only observed in the ectoneural region. In vitro pharmacological experiments revealed that both ArGnRH and ArCRZ cause contraction of cardiac stomach, apical muscle, and tube foot preparations. However, ArGnRH was more potent/effective than ArCRZ as a <b>contractant</b> of the cardiac stomach, whereas ArCRZ was more potent/effective than ArGnRH as a <b>contractant</b> of the apical muscle. These findings demonstrate that both ArGnRH and ArCRZ are myoexcitatory neuropeptides in starfish, but differences in their expression patterns and pharmacological activities are indicative of distinct physiological roles. This is the first study to investigate the physiological roles of both GnRH-type and CRZ-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome, providing new insights into the evolution and comparative physiology of these paralogous neuropeptide signaling systems in the Bilateria...|$|E

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{contribution}} of ion channels to membrane potential, the ion channels expressed in myometrium, {{and the effect of}} ion channel activity on the control of myometrial intracellularfree calcium. Plasma membranes constitute barriers to permeability that establish concentration gradients of ions inside versus outside the cell. Na+, Ca 2 +, and Cl- are normally in higher concentration outside than inside cells, whereas K+ is higher inside. In myometrium, Ca 2 + entry into cells mediates myometrial membrane potential changes and serves as the internal signal for contraction. K+ ef/lux is thought to promote repolarization after an action potential and to participate in setting the resting membrane potential. Ions cross the cell membrane through channels that have different regulated properties and selectivities. Ion movement has been measured by a number of techniques, including radiolabeled ionflux, use of intracellular indicators, and patch-clamp methodology. A number of myometrial Ca 2 + channels have been described, including voltage-regulated L-type channels and Ca 2 + entry in response to intracellular Ca 2 + store depletion. Fast Na+ channels may contribute to cation entry late in pregnancy. K+ channels in myometrium include 2 ± 2 Ca-activated channels, a delayed rectifier, and an inward rectifier. A Ca 2 -activated Cl channel is also present in myometrium. In addition to being regulated by Ca 2 +, the activity of a number of these channels can be regulated by uterine <b>contractants</b> and relaxants. Regulation of ion channel activity can affec...|$|R

In gastric cells, SS {{had no effect on}} carbachol-induced contraction, whereas in colonic cells it caused inhibition. In colonic muscle cells, SS- 28 caused > 85 % inhibition of contraction by cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK- 8), bombesin, 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate, and ionomycin, whereas it had no effect on contraction by these agents in gastric cells. In gastric cells, SS inhibited relaxation. Three synthetic SS analogs had different relative affinities for causing effects in gastric and colonic cells. Pertussis toxin inhibited the action of SS- 28 in each muscle cell type by 50 - 75 %. SS- 28 alone had a small contractile effect on cells from the circular layer of the colon. SS- 28 inhibited carbachol-induced contraction in colonic cells from both the longitudinal and circular layers. These results demonstrate that the action of SS differs in colonic and gastric smooth muscle cells. SS inhibits <b>contractants</b> in colonic cells and relaxants in gastric cells. In colonic cells, SS has a weak contractile effect due to an effect on circular muscle cells and an inhibitory effect on cells from both longitudinal and circular layers.

To formalize this combination, we define a generic two-step constraint processing technique based on an extension of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem, called Extended Constraint Satisfaction Problem (ECSP). The first step is a rewriting step, in which the initial ECSP is symbolically transformed. The second step, called approximation step, is based on a local consistency notion, called weak arc-consistency, defined over ECSPs in terms of fixed point of <b>contractant</b> monotone operators.

40|$|The {{influence}} of discontinuity roughness on the shear strength and deformation behavior of rock joint is analyzed. The study {{is divided into}} three parts: laboratory direct shear test on rock samples having different roughness characteristics, characterization of roughness profiles using variogram and probability density distribution and the application of dynamical systems theory to analyze the stability condition of the sliding motion. The relative motion along the rough joint is erratic particularly at a low normal load. A steady motion develops as the normal load increases. The kinematics of translational motion has two distinct characteristics: the translation occurs {{as a result of a}} gross and uniform motion (sliding) and/or through localized inhomogeneous motion (slipping). Three modes of volumetric changes are observed during the tangential motion: a dilatant-contractant behavior with the overall volumetric change being strictly dilatant, a dilatant-contractant behavior with the overall volumetric change varying from dilatant to <b>contractant</b> and the strictly <b>contractant</b> behavior. The size of the sheared zones is a function of the distribution of the asperities and of the interface strength. The coefficient of friction decreases as the normal load increases. It may or may not increase when the normal load is decreased. The probability density distribution of the height of the interface asperities is not always Gaussian. The variation of the experimental distribution (histogram) indicates that the asperities are not necessarily sheared off in order of decreasing height but rather on the basis of the condition underlying the existence of contact. The slope of the initial portion of the variogram and the sill, when it exists, are used to characterize the surface morphology of the discontinuity. The lower the slope, the smoother the surface. Two types of anisotropy are observed: geometic anisotropy (elliptic shape) and zonal anisotropy. The rate of collapse of the boundary of the loop describing the roughness of the interface describes the deformation of the discontinuity. The location of the orbit with respect to the stagnation line depends on the normalized stiffness. As the normalized shear stiffness increases, the orbit tends to collapse towards the stagnation axis...|$|E
40|$|Basophils and {{mast cells}} are {{important}} effector cells of inflammation {{and in particular}} of acute allergic reactions. Basophils can be activated to release inflammatory mediators by IgE-dependent and IgE-independent stimuli (1 - 4). The mediator profile produced by basophils strongly depends upon the agonist used to activate the cells (4 a). For example, crosslinking of high-affinity IgE-receptors by an antigen, anti-IgE or anti-receptor antibodies leads {{to the release of}} preformed mediators from granule stores, like histamine and proteolytic enzymes, and also results in the activation of enzymes (phospholipase[s] and 5 -lipoxygenase) responsible for the generation of leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4), ' a very potent lipid mediator and smooth muscle <b>contractant</b> (6). Conversely, the anaphylatoxin C 5 a, which at low concentrations is a potent inducer of basophil degranulation, does not activate basophils to produce bioactive lipids.

40|$|Regulation of uterine {{quiescence}} {{involves the}} integration of the signaling pathways regulating uterine contraction and relaxation. Uterine <b>contractants</b> increase intracellular calcium through receptor/GαqPLC coupling, resulting in contraction of the myometrium. Elevation of cAMP concentration has been correlated with relaxation of the myometrium. However, the mechanism of cAMP action in the uterus is unclear. ^ Both endogenous and exogenous increases in cAMP inhibited oxytocin-stimulated phosphatidylinositide turnover in an immortalized pregnant human myometrial cell line (PHM 1 - 41). This inhibition was reversed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of PKA. cAMP inhibited phosphatidyinositide turnover stimulated by different agonists in different cell lines. These data suggest that the cAMP inhibitory mechanism is neither cell nor receptor dependent, and inhibits Gαq/PLCβ 1 and PLCβ 3 coupling. ^ The subcellular localization of PKA occurs via PKA binding to A-Kinase-Anchoring-Proteins (AKAP), and peptides that inhibit this association have been developed (S-Ht 31). S-Ht 31 blocked cAMP-stimulated PKA activity and decreased PKA concentration in PHM 1 - 41 cell plasma membranes. S-Ht 31 reversed the ability of CPT-cAMP, forskolin and relaxin to inhibit phosphatidylinositide turnover in PHM 1 - 41 cells. Overlay analysis of both PHM 1 - 41 cell and nonpregnant rat myometrium found an AKAPs of 86 kDa and 150 kDa associated with the plasma membrane, respectively. These data suggest that PKA anchored to the plasma membrane via AKAP 150 /PKA anchoring is involved in the cAMP inhibitory mechanism. ^ CPT-cAMP and isoproterenol inhibited phosphatidylinositide turnover in rat myometrium from days 12 through 20 of gestation. In contrast, neither agent was effective in the 21 day pregnant rat myometrium. The decrease in the cAMP inhibitory mechanism was correlated with a decrease in PKA and an increase in protein phosphatase 2 B (PP 2 B) concentration in rat myometrial plasma membranes on day 21 of gestation. In myometrial total cell homogenates, both PKA and PP 2 B concentration increased on day 21. S-Ht 31 inhibited cAMP inhibition of phosphatidylinositide turnover in day 19 pregnant rat myometrium. Both PKA and PP 2 B coimmunoprecipitated with an AKAP 150 in a gestational dependent manner, suggesting this AKAP localizes PKA and PP 2 B to the plasma membrane. ^ These data presented demonstrate the importance of the cAMP inhibitory mechanism in regulating uterine contractility. ...|$|R

To examine this issue, rules and principles taken from the Quebec and French legal systems, {{as well as from}} international texts dealing with the topic, were compared. This comparative perspective revealed certain similarities, {{as well as a number}} of differences among Quebec, French, and international norms. Investigation of both similarities and differences is essential to any debate on cyberspace, which must be as universal as possible. The investigation also highlighted the principal technical characteristics of the virtual world, which in turn exposed certain difficulties that may be generated vis-à-vis the institution of the private contract. The attempt to apply traditional rules related to jurisdiction and applicable law to sales in cyberspace led to a conclusion that, although not all of these rules are entirely satisfactory, rules relating to the residence or establishment of cyberspace users better fulfill the function of connecting factors than those linked to the localization of the conclusion or performance of the contract. The latter simply lack utility for relations in cyberspace. More specifically, connecting factors arising from liberty of contract would appear to be the most effective for cyberspace sales. However, the principle according to which liberty of contract must be restricted in order to protect the consumer must be set aside since, inter alia, the «cyberconsumer» does not exist. Rather, there is a need for the elaboration of rules and principles that will protect any adhering party, irrespective of whether such party has any connection to traditional notions of a consumer...|$|R

In this paper, we present a new model for unsaturated soils based on an existing model developed originally for saturated soils. It comprises a minimum number of constitutive parameters. The extension to unsaturated state is achieved by following a general methodology previously developed in our laboratory. The capacities of this simple model are tested. With only 13 parameters, it can reproduce the basic behaviour of unsaturated soils such as rebound or collapse upon wetting, depending on the stress levels. It can also reproduce post-peak softening and transition from <b>contractant</b> to dilatant volumetric behaviour during undrained shear.

Analysis {{of the mechanical}} properties of these Tertiary mudrocks is generally hampered {{by the lack of}} suitable core material. This study represents an attempt to study the geomechanical behaviour of mudrocks by triaxial tests of side-wall cores obtained from the borehole wall. The tests performed include measuring the changes in pore pressure during shearing and undrained shear strength in specimens initially consolidated to in situ effective stress levels. The coefficients of permeability (kf), estimated from the consolidation time behaviour range from 2. 6 x 10 -n to 2. 4 x 10 - 12 m/s. The tested cores behaved like slightly overconsolidated to normally consolidated materials with an initial near constant volume (elastic behaviour) for low deviatoric load followed by an increasingly <b>contractant</b> behaviour approaching failure. Compared with results from onshore analogues, the strength properties of the investigated mudrocks appear to be related to their content of expandable clay minerals. A wellbore stability chart o forecast adequate drilling fluid pressures for future wells has been developed by the use of linear (Mohr-Coulomb) failure criteria based on the peak strength data. It is demonstrated that side-walt cores can provide satisfactory test materials for rock mechanical nalysis, and their use ma...|$|E
40|$|In normal {{conscious}} rats {{investigated by}} continuous cystometry, intravesically instilled prostaglandin (PG) E 2 facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure. The effect was attenuated {{by both the}} NK 1 receptor selective antagonist RP 67, 580 and the NK 2 receptor selective antagonist SR 48, 968, given intra-arterially, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK 1 and NK 2 receptors. Intra-arterially given PGE 2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex, indicating that the PG had a direct <b>contractant</b> effect on the detrusor smooth muscle. The effect of intra-arterial PGE 2 could not be blocked by intra-arterial RP 67, 580 or SR 48, 968, which opens {{the possibility that the}} micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial PGE 2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically. The present results thus suggest that intra-arterial PGE 2, given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor. However, when given intravesically, PGE 2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and/or immediately below the urothelium. These tachykinins, in turn, initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK 1 and NK 2 receptors. Prostanoids may, via release of tachykinins, contribute to both urge and bladder hyperactivity seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} association ofprotein kinase A (PKA) with purfied myometrial plasma membrane declined {{at the end of}} pregnancy in the rat. This study was designed to determine if a similar decline in PKA occurred in pregnant human myometrium. METHODS: Myometrial plasma membranes were isolated from lower uterine segment tissues from not-in-labor (NIL) and in-labor (IL) patients undergoing cesarean delivery. Membrane proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis to detect PKA-catalytic (PKA-cat) and PKA-regulatory (PKA-reg) subunits, the PKA 4 binding protein A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP 79), protein phosphatase 2 B (PP 2 B), and Gotq, a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) -binding protein. Protein levels were expressed relative to caveolin- 1, which was invariant between the two groups. RESULTS: The amount of PKA-cat, PKA-reg, AKAP 79, and PP 2 B in plasma membranes fiom myometrium of women in early labor decreased signficantly compared with that in tissuesfrom women not in labor. In contrast, Gaq did not change. All proteins were localized to myometrial smooth muscle cells by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of PKA, PP 2 B, and AKAP 79 is consistent with the presence of a fiunctional AKAP-mediated signaling complex in pregnant human myometrial membranes. A small but significant decrease in PKA, AKAP 79, and PP 2 B in myometrial tissues from women in labor may contribute to a decrease in negative feedback on and enhancement of <b>contractant</b> signals at term.

40|$|Peptides {{that cause}} muscle {{relaxation}} or contraction or that modulate electrically-induced muscle contraction {{have been discovered}} in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Phylum Echinodermata; Class Holothuroidea). By analysing transcriptome sequence data, here the protein precursors of six of these myoactive peptides (the SALMFamides Sticho-MFamide- 1 and - 2, NGIWYamide, stichopin, GN- 19 and GLRFA) have been identified, providing novel insights on neuropeptide and endocrine-type signalling systems in echinoderms. The A. japonicus SALMFamide precursor comprises eight putative neuropeptides including both L-type and F-type SALMFamides, which contrasts with previous findings from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus where L-type and F-type SALMFamides are encoded by different genes. The NGIWYamide precursor contains five copies of NGIWYamide but, unlike other NG peptide-type neuropeptide precursors in deuterostomian invertebrates, the NGIWYamide precursor {{does not have a}} C-terminal neurophysin domain, indicating loss of this character in holothurians. NGIWYamide was originally discovered as a muscle <b>contractant,</b> but it also causes stiffening of mutable connective tissue in the body wall of A. japonicus, whilst holokinins (PLGYMFR and derivative peptides) cause softening of the body wall. However, the mechanisms by which these peptides affect the stiffness of body wall connective tissue are unknown. Interestingly, analysis of the A. japonicus transcriptome reveals that the only protein containing the holokinin sequence PLGYMFR is an alpha- 5 type collagen. This suggests that proteolysis of collagen may generate peptides (holokinins) that affect body wall stiffness in sea cucumbers, providing a novel perspective on mechanisms of mutable connective tissue in echinoderms...|$|E
40|$|Recent and {{historic}} landslides in sensitive clays {{caused by an}} external disturbance point {{to the importance of}} understanding the acting failure processes. This includes the global slope behaviour and the local material response. Sensitive clay is a brittle material {{in the sense that it}} displays strain-softening behaviour under undrained shear deformation. In turn, strain-softening may lead to a progressive failure development in a slope. While traditional methods for slope stability assessments are based on limit equilibrium and rely on input on a strain independent soil strength, the understanding and modelling of progressive failure relies also on the soil stiffness, the rate of strain-softening and the residual resistance. These aspects have been exemplified and quantified in the present work. In particular, the initial stress state of a slope is identified as governing when considering the safety margin and potential failure extent. On the local material level, strain-softening holds the potential to cause strain localization and shear band formation. Two experimental setups have been utilized to examine the shear response of quick clay; a modified triaxial device where shear band formation is allowed and a field shear vane with over-coring of the sheared soil element. Strain localization and shear band formation was seen to initiate close to the undrained peak shear resistance. A clear effect of the displacement rate on the post-peak properties of sensitive clay is observed. Increasing the displacement rate increases the brittleness, both in terms of higher rate of strainsoftening and lower ultimate end-of-test resistance. The underlying mechanisms are argued to be related to the <b>contractant</b> behaviour of sensitive clay at failure and the corresponding generation of excess pore pressure. This situation can cause internal gradients of pore pressure and local drainage in the vicinity of the shear band. This hypothesis is supported by coherence between numerical simulations of local drainage and the experimental results as well as microscopy analyses which reveal a reduction in porosity in the shear band. The latter is a direct observation of <b>contractant</b> material behaviour and implies migration of water. The microscopy analyses have shown a mm-scale shear band as a non-smooth feature with complex inner systems of minor shears (μm size). The width of the shear band is a function of the applied displacement rate, presumably through processes of internal drainage of excess pore pressure. Higher rate yields a thinner band. The width of the minor shears is given by the microstructure. The strong brittleness of sensitive clay at high displacement rates under shear band formation motivates a recommendation to use a design approach close to a first yield criterion if the construction situation might include such high rates. The thesis provides insight for understanding slope and material failure in sensitive clays. It highlights and treats aspects needed for further work in the direction of an improved and unified methodology for slope stability assessments in these clays. In the extension of the work it is suggested to focus on the initial stress state of slopes as well as a study of the relation between material behaviour in laboratory experiments and full scale slopes.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether b-adrenergic receptors (b-AR) reg-ulate the phospholipase C (PLC) {{system in}} midpregnant rat myo-metrium. PLCb isoforms were characterized, {{and the effect}} of isoproterenol (b-adrenergic agonist) was tested on myometrial inositol phosphate (InsP) production and uterine contraction. Using specific antibodies, we showed that rat myometrium ex-presses PLCb 1, PLCb 3, and PLCb 4, and to a lesser degree PLCb 2. Quantitative analysis revealed that PLCb isoforms are differentially expressed during pregnancy. Indeed, the amount of PLCb 4 is increased at midpregnancy, whereas PLCb 1, PLCb 2, and PLCb 3 are up-regulated at term. At midpregnancy, pretreat-ment of myometrial strips with isoproterenol significantly re-duced basal and agonist-stimulated InsP production. Forskolin, a diterpene that increases cAMP accumulation by directly acti-vating adenylyl cyclases, had no effect on InsP production. In contrast, two global potassium (K 1) channel inhibitors, tetraeth-ylammonium (TEA) and 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP), prevented at-tenuation of InsP production by isoproterenol. Isoproterenol also significantly decreased spontaneous and agonist-induced contraction of the longitudinal layer of midpregnant rat myo-metrium. Preincubation of uterine strips with TEA plus 4 -AP pri-or to b-AR activation blocked only partial uterine relaxation, whereas Forskolin was as potent as isoproterenol. This indicates that b-AR operate through both K 1 channels and cAMP to in-duce uterine relaxation. In conclusion, we show {{for the first time that}} three myometrial PLCb isoforms (PLCb 1, PLCb 2, and PLCb 3) are down-regulated at midpregnancy. At this period, b-AR reduce basal and agonist-stimulated InsP production through activation of K 1 channels. Altogether, these mechanisms could act to decrease responsiveness of the longitudinal layer of myo-metrium to <b>contractant</b> factors. catecholamines, pregnancy, signal transduction, uteru...|$|E
40|$|Norepinephrine (NE) {{is thought}} to mediate its effects through G-protein coupled receptors. However, {{previous}} {{studies have shown that}} NE and another primary amine, serotonin, also have the ability to exert effects in a receptor-independent manner. We hypothesized that the enzyme transglutaminase II (TG II) has the ability to modify proteins with NE and that this modification is physiologically relevant. As our model we used rat aortic and vena cava tissues, two tissues that depend on NE to modulate vascular tone. Immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical staining showed that NE and TG II are present in smooth muscle cells of these tissues. Western analysis shows aorta and vena cava homogenate proteins are recognized by an antibody raised against NE conjugated to bovine serum albumin (NE-BSA). NE and α-actin colocalize in cultured aorta and vena cava smooth muscle cells. Freshly dissociated smooth muscle cells from these vessels were able to take up NE-biotin. In isolated tissue baths, inhibition of TG II with cystamine (0. 5 [*]mM) completely abolished NE-induced contraction in the aorta but only attenuated the receptor-independent <b>contractant</b> KCl (max contraction to 100 [*]mM KCl in cystamine treated = 88. 8 ± 7. 0 % of vehicle treated, p < 0. 05). In the vena cava, contraction to NE was abolished with 0. 1 [*]mM cystamine and KCl contraction was attenuated (max contraction to 100 [*]mM KCl in cystamine treated = 54. 8 ± 7. 0 % of vehicle treated, p < 0. 05). Taken together, these results show that vascular smooth muscle cells take up and utilize NE for the modification of proteins, and that this modification may {{play an important role in}} vascular contraction...|$|E
40|$|TR 4979, an {{analogue}} of prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) {{was evaluated}} on respiratory and non-respiratory isolated tissues known to contain heterogeneous or homogeneous {{populations of the}} two classes of prostanoid (prostaglandins and thromboxanes) receptors. These receptors are classified as 'chi' the contractant/stimulant receptor with 'chi 1, 2, 3 ' being three subdivisions and 'psi' the relaxant/inhibitory receptor(s). On a respiratory tissue (cat trachea) containing predominantly 'psi'-receptors, TR 4979 was 26 times less potent than PGE 1 or PGE 2. On other respiratory tissues known to contain mixtures of the 'chi 1, 2, 3 '- and 'psi'-receptors (guinea-pig trachea and lung strip, cat lung strip and human bronchial muscle), TR 4979 consistently acted as a potent relaxant whereas PGE 2 {{and to a lesser}} extent PGE 1 had significant <b>contractant</b> activities. Human pregnant uterus, guinea-pig and rat pseudo-pregnant uteri, rat colon and fundic strips and chick ileum are known to contain one or more of the three subclasses of the 'chi'-receptor. TR 4979 (10 (- 9) - 10 (- 5) M) was inactive on all these tissues whereas all of the reference prostanoids were contractants of varying potencies. PGE 1 and histamine-induced contractions of the guinea-pig isolated ileum were both non-competitively antagonized by increasing concentrations of TR 4979 suggesting that 'psi'-receptors also exist on this tissue. TR 4979 is a highly selective agonist of prostanoid 'psi' (relaxant/inhibitory) -receptors which at present have been demonstrated to exist mainly in the lung. This prostaglandin analogue is a useful new selective pharmacological tool for revealing as yet unidentified prostanoid 'psi'-receptors and actions in a wide range of non-respiratory tissues/organs such as the guinea-pig ileum...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} Bay K 8644, a {{dihydropyridine}} which increases calcium flux through the potential-operated channels were studied on the contractions induced by histamine, acetylcholine, KCl and Ca 2 + on human isolated bronchial strips {{and the results}} were compared to those obtained on guinea-pig isolated tracheal spirals. Subsequently the <b>contractant</b> effects of Bay K 8644 in K+-enriched medium and in the presence of Ca 2 + 0. 03 mM were investigated. In Krebs normal calcium medium, Bay K 8644 did not significantly modify the EC 50 of acetylcholine or histamine on the human bronchus, but in concentrations of 10 (- 7) - 10 (- 6) M it potentiated the effects of KCl on that preparation. It did not modify the EC 50 of acetylcholine, histamine or KCl on the guinea-pig trachea. In Ca 2 +-free Krebs medium with additional K+ (30 mM), Ca 2 + concentration-response curves were displaced to the left by Bay K 8644 in the two preparations. Shifts were 0. 52 +/- 0. 11 and 0. 72 +/- 0. 16 log units respectively with Bay K 8644 10 (- 8) and 10 (- 7) M on human bronchus (n = 4) and 0. 67 +/- 0. 16 and 1. 06 +/- 0. 19 log units respectively with Bay K 8644 10 (- 7) and 10 (- 6) M on the guinea-pig trachea (n = 5).

40|$|Introduction Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is {{considered}} the third endogenous gas transmitter besides nitric oxide and carbon monoxide [1]. It is produced from L-cysteine or L-methionine via the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). H 2 S {{is involved in the}} control of vascular homeostasis, having either relaxant or <b>contractant</b> effect on smooth muscle cells. The H 2 S involvement in rat and human intrauterine tissues has also been shown [2]. Objectives The aim of our study was to investigate the L-cysteine/ H 2 S pathway in rat and human placenta in hypertensive state. Methods Placental samples were collected from spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive rat (Wistar Kyoto; WKY). In parallel, placental samples were collected from 10 pre-eclamptic women and 5 controls after caesarean sections. Pre-eclamptic women were divided into two subgroups: Group 1 (women who developed Early Preeclampsia, n = 4); Group 2 (women who developed Late Preeclampsia, n = 6). The expression of CBS and CSE was evaluated in sample tissues by Western blotting analysis. The enzymatic activity was assessed in basal and stimulated (L- cysteine) condiction by a colorimetric assay. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student’s t test. P < 0, 05 was considered as statistically significant. Results The expression of CBS and CSE in placenta of SHR rats were significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) compared to WKY. The H 2 S production resulted significantly (p < 0, 05) lower in SHR than WKY rats. In human placenta, the basal H 2 S production was similar in the three groups; interestingly the H 2 S production by adding L-cysteine, was higher in Late Preeclampsia compared to control group. Conclusion H 2 S was produced in rat and human placenta. CBS and CSE, the enzymes involved in the production of H 2 S, were down-regulated in SHR rats and, as a consequence the H 2 S production was significantly reduced. Starting from these data, we tried to analyze the role of hydrogen sulfide in preeclampsia to assess the contribute of this gas transmitter in the development of this condition. Unexpectedly, preliminary data demonstrated that in women developing Late Preeclampsia there was an higher production of H 2 S after stimulation with L-cysteine, not revealed in Early Preeclampsia or in healthy control group. Our results indicated that the L-cysteine/H 2 S pathway could {{contribute to the development of}} preeclampsia condition...|$|E
40|$|Doctor Legum - LLDThis thesis {{concerns}} {{the tension that}} exists between the principles of certainty and freedom of contract (which includes the notion of contractual discretionary powers) and how this tension impacts on the requirement that agreement must be reached on the price and rental in contracts of sale and lease, respectively. The matter at issue is whether South African law should recognise the validity of contracts of sale {{at a reasonable price}} and lease and rental respectively, and/or at a unilaterally determined price or rental as suggested in an obiter dictum of the Supreme Court of Appeal in NBS Boland Bank v One Berg River Drive and Others; Deeb and Another v ABSA Bank Ltd; Friedman v Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd 1999 (4) SA 928 (SCA) and in an obiter dictum of the then Appellate Division in Genac Properties JHB (Pty) Ltd v NBC Administrators CC 1992 (1) SA 566 (AD). Currently, the law requires that the price (in the case of sale) or the rental (in the case of lease) must be certain, {{in the sense that it}} is either ascertained or objectively ascertainable. The price is ascertainable if there is agreement between the contractants on an external standard in light of which the price may be ascertained objectively without further reference to the contractants: Westinghouse Brake & Equipment (Pty) Ltd v Bilger Engineering (Pty) Ltd 1986 (2) SA 555 (A). The obiter dicta in the One Berg River and Genac cases suggest that an agreement to a reasonable price or rental or to unilaterally determined price or rental meets this requirement. The basis for both obiter dicta can be found in the principles of freedom and sanctity of contract that form the cornerstones of the South African law of contract. The conceptual framework of public policy forms the outer limits of both freedom and sanctity of contract. The thesis considers whether a development in South African law that recognises the validity of a contract of sale or lease at a price or rental determined unilaterally by a <b>contractant</b> or at a reasonable price or rental, respectively, is contrary to public policy as informed by the values embodied in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1996 iv and whether it would promote consensus and certainty, which are foundational principles of South African law of contract. Consideration is also be given to the question whether such a development is defensible in law, and desirable as a matter of policy and practice...|$|E
