40|$|International audienceConventional {{high-temperature}} reactions {{limit the}} control of coordination polyhedra in transition-metal oxides to those obtainable {{within the bounds of}} known coordination geometries for a given transition metal 1. For example, iron atoms are almost exclusively coordinated by three-dimensional polyhedra such as tetrahedra and octahedra. However, recent works have shown that binary metal hydrides act as reducing agents at low temperatures, allowing access to unprecedented structures 2, 3, 4. Here we show the reaction of a perovskite SrFeO 3 with CaH 2 to yield SrFeO 2, a new compound bearing a square-planar oxygen coordination around Fe 2 +. SrFeO 2 is isostructural with 'infinite layer' <b>cupric</b> <b>oxides</b> 5, 6, 7, 8, and exhibits a magnetic order far above room temperature in spite of the two-dimensional structure, indicating strong in-layer magnetic interactions due to strong Fe d to O p hybridization. Surprisingly, SrFeO 2 remains free from the structural instability that might well be expected at low temperatures owing to twofold orbital degeneracy in the Fe 2 + ground state with D 4 h point symmetry. The reduction and the oxidation between SrFeO 2 and SrFeO 3 proceed via the brownmillerite-type intermediate SrFeO 2. 5, and start at the relatively low temperature of ~ 400 [*]K, making the material appealing for a variety of applications, including oxygen ion conduction, oxygen gas absorption and catalysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} and corrosion {{of metals}} are fundamental problems in materials {{science and technology}} that have been studied using a large variety of experimental and computational techniques. Here we review {{some of the recent}} studies that have led to significant advances in our atomic-level understanding of copper oxide, one of the most studied and best understood metal oxides. We show that a good atomistic understanding of the physical characteristics of cuprous (Cu$_ 2 $O) and <b>cupric</b> (CuO) <b>oxide</b> and of some key processes of their formation has been obtained. Indeed, the growth of the oxide {{has been shown to be}} epitaxial with the surface and to proceed, in most cases, through the formation of oxide nano-islands which, with continuous oxygen exposure, grow and eventually coalesce. We also show how electronic structure calculations have become increasingly useful in helping to characterise the structures and energetics of various Cu oxide surfaces. However a number of challenges remain. For example, it is not clear under which conditions the oxidation of copper in air at room temperature (known as native oxidation) leads to the formation of a cuprous oxide film only, or also of a cupric overlayer. Moreover, the atomistic details of the nucleation of the oxide islands are still unknown. We close our review with a brief perspective on future work and discuss how recent advances in experimental techniques, bringing greater temporal and spatial resolution, along with improvements in the accuracy, realism and timescales achievable with computational approaches make it possible for these questions to be answered in the near future.

30|$|In recent times, {{the union}} between {{nanotechnology}} and biology has shaped a new ground of nanobiotechnology that integrates {{the use of}} biological bodies (i.e., bacteria, fungi, viruses, yeasts and plants) {{in a number of}} chemical and physical processes [1 – 4]. Green synthesis of nanomaterials using plant extract has emerged as a facile and viable route to traditional (chemical and physical) methods [1 – 3, 5]. Syntheses of nanoparticles (NPs) through nanobiotechnology processes have a significant potential to boost NPs production without the use of harsh, toxic, and expensive chemicals [2, 5, 6]. Studies have established that biomolecules identified from biological organisms can be used to control the nucleation and development of the inorganic nanostructures [3, 4, 7]. Metal oxide nanocomposites have shown great interest in many scientific fields [5 – 8]. Among others, copper and zinc oxide nanocomposites have attracted more attention due to their unique properties [6, 9 – 14]. In this view, novel Punica granatum L- binary (Cu/Cu 2 O) and ternary (Cu/Cu 2 O/CuO/ZnO) nanoscale materials in one dimension such as nanocubes, nanorods and nanoplatelets have been prepared via the green route. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an important n-type semiconductor with a bandgap energy of 3.37  eV, and it also has interesting chemical, acoustic, optical and electrical properties [9, 10, 15 – 17] whereas the p-type cuprous (I) oxide (Cu 2 O—band gap of ~ 1.2  eV) and <b>cupric</b> (II) <b>oxide</b> (CuO—band gap of ~ 1.7  eV) have shown massive significance in the fields of gas sensing, optoelectronics, catalysis and solar cells and exhibit good photoconductive, photovoltaic and in many other fields [6, 10, 18, 19]. The production of copper and zinc nanocomposite with controllable sizes, shapes and surface properties is vital for exploring copper-zinc-based nano-oxides for different applications. There are numerous reports on chemically and physically prepared nanocrystalline copper-zinc based oxides [1, 10, 15, 20]. Deraz et al. reported the synthesis and characterisation of new copper-based nanocomposite using glycine-assisted combustion method [7] while in his paper (Habibi et al.) [21] fabricated and characterised ternary CuO-ZnO-Cu 2 O nanocomposites by Sol-Gel Route at different temperatures [22]. Meanwhile, Sasmal and other produced ternary Cu 2 O-Cu-CuO nanocatalyst with astonishing activities for 4 -nitrophenol reduction in aqueous solution and synthesised catalytic Cu/Cu 2 O NPs prepared in aqueous medium [23, 24]. However, as far as we know, there are no green prepared binary/ternary copper-zinc oxide nanocomposites which have been reported. Therefore, the first-time green synthesised Cu/Cu 2 O and Cu/Cu 2 O/CuO/ZnO nanocomposite reveals a new route of synthesising the binary and ternary metal oxides relative to the chemical/physically modified routes. In this work, the nanocomposite will be used as a potential transducer for various applications, i.e., energy storage devices and catalysis. Further, the investigation will dwell much on the structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of the prepared Cu/Cu 2 O/CuO/ZnO system. Lastly, it will include the determination of a plausible mechanism of interaction between the biological entities and the nanocomposites.|$|R

However, these nineteenth-century [...] "equivalents" [...] were not equivalents in the original or modern sense of the term.
