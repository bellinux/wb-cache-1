Our experiments reveal that <b>comments</b> on textual ob-jects are indeed descriptive: 10 <b>comments</b> suffice to expect a high similarity between the <b>comments</b> and the <b>commented</b> text; 100 - 500 <b>comments</b> suffice to replace the <b>commented</b> text in a ranking task, and to measure the contribution of the commenters beyond the <b>commented</b> text...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} for diversifying user <b>comments</b> on news articles. In our proposed framework, we analyse user <b>comments</b> w. r. t. four different criteria {{in order to}} extract the respective diversification dimensions {{in the form of}} feature vectors. These criteria involve content similarity, sentiment expressed within <b>comments,</b> article’s named entities also found within <b>comments</b> and <b>commenting</b> behavior of the respective users. Then, we apply diversification on <b>comments,</b> utilizing the extracted features vectors. The outcome of this process is a subset of the initial <b>comments</b> that contains heterogeneous <b>comments,</b> representing different aspects of the news article, different sentiments expressed, as well as different user categories, w. r. t. their <b>commenting</b> behavior. We perform a preliminary qualitative analysis showing that the diversity criteria we introduce result in distinctively diverse subsets of <b>comments,</b> as opposed to a baseline of diversifying <b>comments</b> only w. r. t. to their content (textual similarity). We also present a prototype system that implements our diversification framework on news articles <b>comments.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Comments</b> {{are special}} types of {{publications}} whose {{aim is to}} correct or criticize previously published papers. For this reason, <b>comments</b> are believed to make <b>commented</b> papers less worthy or trusty to {{the eyes of the}} scientific community, and thus predestined to have low scientific impact. Here, we show that such belief is not supported by empirical evidence. We consider thirteen major publication outlets in science, and perform systematic comparisons between the citations accumulated by <b>commented</b> and non <b>commented</b> articles. We find that (i) <b>commented</b> papers are, on average, much more cited than non <b>commented</b> papers, and (ii) <b>commented</b> papers {{are more likely to be}} among the most cited papers of a journal. Since <b>comments</b> are published soon after criticized papers, <b>comments</b> should be viewed as early indicators of the future impact of criticized papers.

40|$|We {{analysed}} written <b>comments</b> on clerkship evaluation {{forms to}} determine if they furthered our understanding of students' professional behaviour. Methods  We transcribed all written <b>comments</b> related to professional behaviour for 1 medical school class in 4 major clerkships, then categorised the <b>comments.</b> <b>Comments</b> were coded into categories by two raters. They were also coded as positive, negative or equivocal. The 3 types of <b>comments</b> were each correlated with a Likert-type score for professionalism for each student in these same clerkships. Results  Most <b>comments</b> covered initiative, working well with others, patient skills and working hard. Of the 1845 <b>comments,</b> 1721 were positive, 106 were negative and 18 were equivocal, neither wholly positive nor wholly negative. The total number of positive <b>comments</b> correlated with the students' numerical professionalism score (r[*]= [*] 0. 29, P [*]<[*] 0. 001); negative <b>comments</b> correlated negatively with the numerical professionalism score (r[*]=[*]− 0. 44, P [*]<[*] 0. 001). Equivocal <b>comments</b> were significantly negative (r[*]= − 0. 25, P [*]=[*] 0. 002). Qualitative analysis revealed that equivocal <b>comments</b> were focused on maturity, initiative and teamwork. Conclusions  Written <b>comments</b> contain unique indicators of students' professional behaviour and are largely positive in nature; negative <b>comments</b> stand out by their rarity and intensity. There is a set of negative <b>comments</b> masked by evaluators in language that appears neutral or even partly positive that statistically resemble negative <b>comments</b> and should be regarded as such by students who receive this type of <b>comments.</b> Evaluators should be encouraged and trained to express their qualitative views of students...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Weight <b>comments</b> are {{commonly}} received by adolescents, but {{the accuracy of}} the <b>comments</b> and their effects on weight misperception are unclear. We assessed the prevalence and accuracy of weight <b>comments</b> received by Chinese adolescents from different sources and their relation to weight misperception. Methods In the Hong Kong Student Obesity Surveillance (HKSOS) project 2006 – 07, 22612 students aged 11 – 18 (41. 5 % boys) completed a questionnaire on obesity. Students responded if family members, peers and professionals had seriously <b>commented</b> over the past 30 days that they were "too fat" or "too thin" in two separate questions. The accuracy of the <b>comments</b> was judged against the actual weight status derived from self-reported height and weight. Self-perceived weight status was also reported and any discordance with the actual weight status denoted weight misperception. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odd ratios for weight misperception by the type of weight <b>comments</b> received. Results One in three students received weight <b>comments,</b> and the mother was the most common source of weight <b>comments.</b> Health professional was the most accurate source of weight <b>comments,</b> yet less than half the <b>comments</b> were correct. Adolescents receiving incorrect <b>comments</b> had increased risk of having weight misperception in all weight status groups. Receiving conflicting <b>comments</b> was positively associated with weight misperception among normal weight adolescents. In contrast, underweight and overweight/obese adolescents receiving correct weight <b>comments</b> were less likely to have weight misperception. Conclusion Weight <b>comments,</b> mostly incorrect, were commonly received by Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong, and such incorrect <b>comments</b> were associated with weight misperception. </p...|$|R
