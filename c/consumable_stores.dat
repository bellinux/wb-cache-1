40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 85 - 98) The {{need for}} a business park in low earth orbit may be generated as manufacturers discover and implement the benefits of operating in space to produce cheaper and create new products. What configuration should this Low Earth Orbit Business Center have, what sort of environment should it offer and {{how long will it}} take to become operational? These questions are addressed and results presented in this paper. Comparisons are made for various gravity-oriented configurations to determine what shape is best suited for the living areas. Artificial gravity and associated problems are discussed as is atmospheric composition and pressure. An interior design for the living area is presented. The Low Earth Orbit Business Center offers a 0. 5 earth gravity environment in a toroidal structure with a standard sea level atmosphere. Inside the torus are living quarters, recreational facilities, and office and laboratory areas. A large hub provides for low-g laboratory areas, mechanical equipment and <b>consumable</b> <b>stores</b> location. Estimates based on structural panel sizing, thickness estimates and STS launch capabilities indicate that the Low Earth Orbit Business Center can be placed into orbit over a period of 20 years...|$|E
50|$|The stores {{focus on}} three of Walmart's major sales categories: {{groceries}}, {{which account for}} about 55 percent of the company's revenue; pharmacy; and, at some stores, fuel. For groceries and <b>consumables,</b> the <b>stores</b> sell fresh produce, deli and bakery items, prepared foods, meat, dairy, organic, general grocery and frozen foods, in addition to cleaning products and pet supplies. Some stores offer wine and beer sales and drive-through pharmacies. Some stores, such as one at Midtown Center in Bentonville, Arkansas, offer made-to-order pizza as well as tables and seating. Customers can also use Walmart's site-to-store operation and pick up online orders at Walmart Neighborhood Market stores.|$|R

Historical demand generated by ships deployed to the Sixth Fleet is used to develop two models, the Lognormal Model and the Point Estimate Model. Improvement is achieved by considering each item's variance in demand. The Lognormal Model computes sample standard deviations for each item and provides the more accurate results. The Point Estimate Model uses regression to estimate a standard deviation for groups of items. Although the Point Estimate Model is easier for hands-on users to understand it is no easier to implement. The two models are compared against current procedures using {{a second set of}} actual Sixth Fleet data to simulate six months of inventory activity. Satisfied customer demands are improved by five percentage points (from 93 % to 98 %) and end of the month contingency inventory reserves are improved by 30 percentage points (from 65 % to 95 %).

40|$|Regenerative {{life support}} systems have been {{identified}} as one of the critical enabling technologies for future human exploration of space. This discipline encompasses processes and subsystems which regenerate the air, water, solid waste, and food streams typical of human habitation so as to minimize the mass and volume of <b>stored</b> <b>consumables</b> which must accompany the humans on a mission. A number of key technology challenges within this broad discipline are described, ranging from the development of new physical, chemical, and biological processes for regenerating the air, water, solid waste, and food streams to the development of improved techniques for monitoring and controlling microbial and trace constituent contamination. A continuing challenge overarching the development of these new technologies is the need to minimize the mass, volume, and electrical power consumption of the flight hardware. More important for long duration exploration missions, however, is the development of highly reliable, long-lived, self- sufficient systems which absolutely minimize the logistics resupply and operational maintenance requirements of the life support system and which ensure human safety through their robust, reliable operating characteristics...|$|R
