40|$|This paper {{examines}} if {{the level}} of voluntary disclosure affects the association between <b>current</b> <b>returns</b> and future earnings. Economic theory suggests that firms might find it advantageous to provide additional pieces of information (i. e., voluntary disclosure) to investors and analysts (Verrecchia 1983). Our results indicate that more voluntary disclosure does not improve the association between <b>current</b> <b>returns</b> and future earnings; i. e. <b>current</b> <b>returns</b> do not reflect more future earnings news. This finding raises the question whether voluntary information in the annual report contains value relevant information about future earnings or if investors are simply not capable of incorporating voluntary information in the firm value estimates.

The composite fuselage cannot comply with the required functionalities, as the aluminium skin does, due to its heating and conductive natural limitations. The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose some solutions for the design and the optimisation of the <b>current</b> <b>return</b> path in this new aeronautical environment, using a complex modelling method (PEEC-AMLFMM) coupled with, firstly, a path finding algorithm followed by an optimization process, secondly, with a global routing tool followed by an optimisation process and, thirdly, with a multi-agent system approach. A comparison between these methods is made.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the existence of}} an empirical linkage between the nominal financial networks and the underlying economic fundamentals across countries. We construct the nominal <b>return</b> correlation <b>networks</b> from daily data to encapsulate sector-level dynamics and figure the relative importance of the sectors in the nominal network through a measure of centrality and clustering algorithms. The eigenvector centrality robustly identifies the backbone of the minimum spanning tree defined on the <b>return</b> <b>networks</b> as well as the primary cluster in the multidimensional scaling map. We show that the sectors that are relatively large in size, defined with the metrics market capitalization, revenue and number of employees, constitute the core of the <b>return</b> <b>networks,</b> whereas the periphery is mostly populated by relatively smaller sectors. Therefore, sector-level nominal return dynamics is anchored to the real size effect, which ultimately shapes the optimal portfolios for risk management.

The Hope case settled on a compromise for asset valuation. With respect to debt capital, Hope accepted the original historic cost as reasonable for valuating the debt portion of the asset rate base and allowing the historically agreed upon interest rate as its rate of return. However, with respect to equity capital, Hope determined that the <b>current</b> <b>return</b> value would be acceptable.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in asset return modeling have shown evidence for time-variation {{not only in}} conditional variance, but also especially in conditional skewness and leverage effects. We develop a discrete time affine multifactor latent variable model of asset returns which allows for both stochastic volatility and stochastic skewness (SVS model). Importantly, we disentangle the dynamics of conditional volatility and conditional skewness in a coherent way. Our approach allows the distribution of <b>current</b> daily <b>returns</b> conditional on <b>current</b> volatility to be asymmetric. In our model, time-varying conditional skewness {{is driven by the}} conditional leverage effect and the asymmetry of the distribution of <b>current</b> <b>returns</b> conditional on <b>current</b> volatility. We derive analytical formulas for various moment conditions that we use for GMM inference. Applying our approach to several equity and index daily returns, we show that the conditional distribution of <b>current</b> daily <b>returns,</b> conditional on <b>current</b> volatility, is positively skewed and helps to match sample return skewness as well as negative cross-correlations between returns and squared returns. The conditional leverage effect is significant and negative. The conditional skewness is positive, implying that the asymmetry of the distribution of <b>current</b> <b>returns</b> conditional on <b>current</b> volatility dominates the leverage effect in determining the conditional skewness...|$|R
