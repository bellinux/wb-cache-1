50|$|The aerotropolis {{encompasses}} aviation-dependent {{businesses and}} the commercial facilities that support {{them and the}} multitude of air travelers who pass through the airport annually. Airport-linked businesses include, among others, time-sensitive manufacturing, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment; high-value perishables and biomeds; retail, sports, and entertainment complexes; hotels; <b>conference,</b> <b>trade,</b> and exhibition centers; and offices for businesspeople who travel frequently by air or engage in global commerce. Clusters of business parks, logistics parks, industrial parks, distribution centers, information technology complexes and wholesale merchandise marts locate around the airport and along the transportation corridors radiating from them. As increasing numbers of aviation-oriented firms and commercial service providers cluster around airports, the aerotropolis is becoming a major urban destination where air travelers and locals alike work, shop, meet, exchange knowledge, conduct business, eat, sleep, and are entertained often without going more than 15 minutes from the airport.|$|E
5000|$|During the interwar years, the White Hart {{continued}} to accommodate general {{as well as}} spa visitors, and also developed business from the growing <b>conference</b> <b>trade.</b> Sir Arnold Bax was among the celebrated names that stayed at the White Hart during the 1929 Festival of Music. Visitors of {{a very different kind}} gathered on the Stray in front of the White Hart in 1936 when the Jarrow Crusade arrived in town, to a reception generally kind and sympathetic.The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 saw many of Harrogate's hotels requisitioned by the government, with the White Hart being occupied by both the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Works. Within months of the finish of the war, the White Hart was acquired by the county council of the West Riding of Yorkshire. For a short time, the authority considered using the hotel as an art school, but this changed with the birth of the new National Health Service. Minister of Health Aneurin Bevan visited Harrogate, which was intended to become the British Empire’s principal centre for rheumatism research and treatment, and inspected the White Hart, leading to the recommendation that it, along with the neighbouring Crown Hotel, be purchased by the state to become annexe hospitals for the Royal Baths. The very scale of the plan was responsible for its eventual abandonment, and in 1949, the White Hart passed {{into the hands of the}} Leeds Regional Hospital Board. The White Hart served as the National Health Service's only conference venue, catering to all the areas of the NHS until it was acquired by the University of York in 1988. It became a listed building in 1971.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (International Commerce)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{strategies}} used by investment promotion agencies (IPAs) to attract {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) differ between countries. This {{seems to be the}} case among the provincial IPAs of South Africa and the provincial IPAs of developed countries and their best practices. South Africa has a lower investment inflow than developed countries and this is unsurprising. It is pointed out that the goal of the study is to compare the investment promotion {{strategies used}} by the provincial IPAs of South Africa and compare them with best practices like BW–I and FIT. The results of this comparison will contribute to the improvement of the investment policy framework of South Africa. One of the ways to improve our investment promotion strategies used to attract FDI is by learning from the best. It should be kept in mind that the goal of the investment promotion strategies is to market a country?s investment opportunities and more importantly, of the province. By using the following variables: perception building, targeting investors, the structure of the IPA and incentive and policies; the study intends to point out the gaps in those strategies followed by provincial IPAs of South Africa. It should also be taken into account that the study wants to establish the origin of certain gaps in the strategies followed by South Africa to improve investment inflow. In order to complete the goals of the study a questionnaire was conducted to gain the primary data from the IPAs needed for the comparison. The questionnaires were distributed to the different IPAs for purposes of comparison and where possible interviews were conducted. The following sources were used for secondary data: United Nations <b>Conference</b> <b>Trade</b> and Development (UNCTAD), Financial Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Investment Map and World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies (WAIPA). The study finds that there are gaps like targeting the investor, the education level of the IPA staff and the annual budget (Table 28) in the investment promotion strategies used by the provincial IPAs of South Africa. The study could not fully answer one of the research questions because it was not possible to find out how regularly these IPAs were interacting with each other. Further studies are therefore necessary to establish how regularly the provincial IPAs of South Africa interact in terms of meetings and forums to determine whether these IPAs consider cooperation as a high priority rather than being in competition with each other.
