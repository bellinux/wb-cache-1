40|$|The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) was amended in 1988 to {{accelerate}} the reregistration of products with active ingredients registered prior to November 1, 1984. The amended Act called for the development and submission of data to support the reregistration of an active ingredient, {{as well as a}} review of all submitted data by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (referred to as EPA or the Agency) to assess the <b>current</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Reregistration involves a thorough review of the scientific database underlying a pesticide’s registration.

On August 3, 1996, the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) was signed into law. FQPA amends FIFRA to require tolerance reassessment during reregistration. In addition, FQPA requires that all active ingredients first registered after 1984 would also be reevaluated to reassess their <b>current</b> <b>tolerances,</b> by 2006.

40|$|The {{performance}} of flexible pavements {{relies heavily on}} the final quality of the hot-mix asphalt concrete (HMAC) as it is produced {{and placed in the}} field. To account for production and construction variability while ensuring the quality of the HMAC, TxDOT has established a set of relevant operational tolerances, which are incorporated into the 2004 Standard Specifications for Construction and Maintenance of Highways, Streets and Bridges. In particular, Items 340 / 341, 342, 344, and 346 provide acceptance criteria for all HMA mixes used by the Department. The operational tolerances for a series of key control variables that affect performance are given as a guideline in QC/QA practices. However, the relationship between these tolerance levels and mixture performance is not well known. This research project will establish this relationship: how do the operational tolerances affect the expected {{performance of}} the HMAC?

40|$|The {{temperature}} tolerances {{of individuals}} in geographically separated populations of a single species {{can be used as}} indicators of each population 2 ̆ 7 s potential to persist or become extinct in response to climate change. We evaluated the population-level variation in temperature tolerance in populations of several marine invertebrate taxa, including bryozoans, tunicates, bivalves, and gastropods, separated by distances of 3 ̆c 200 km to 3 ̆e 5000 km. We then combined physiological thermotolerance data with current temperature data and climate change predictions to predict which of these populations may be most vulnerable to future changes. In a trans-continental comparison of four subtidal epibenthic species, we show that populations on the east coast of the United States, which experienced higher habitat temperatures than those on the west coast, had higher thermal tolerances but lived closer to individuals 2 ̆ 7 tolerance limits. Similarly, temperature tolerances varied between western and eastern Atlantic populations of the mussel Mytilus edulis; however, these differences only emerged after repeated exposures to high temperatures. Furthermore, the less thermotolerant M. edulis population in the western Atlantic was more susceptible to temperature increases, as evidenced by a recent range contraction. Thus, for both the subtidal epibenthic and intertidal mussel species, we identified the western Atlantic as a ‘hot spot’ of populations susceptible to climate change compared to those in the eastern Pacific and eastern Atlantic, respectively. Finally, because <b>current</b> <b>tolerances</b> are not the sole indicators of individuals 2 ̆ 7 abilities to cope with temperature increases, we also assessed the possibility for acclimatization to facilitate the persistence of populations via the buffering of temperature effects. We show that, for four populations of intertidal Littorina snail species in the northwest Atlantic, most populations were able to overcome geographic differences in temperature tolerance via acclimation. When acclimation capacity is low, the potential for “rescue” may depend on the particular species 2 ̆ 7 life-history strategy and dispersal ability. For example, although individuals from the coldest-adapted population of Littorina littorea were unable to acclimate as quickly as those from more southern populations, this species has a pelagic larval stage and, thus, the greatest dispersal potential of these littorines. Together, these studies highlight the importance of considering variation in temperature tolerance between populations within species to improve the forecasting of changes in the abundances and distributions of species in response to climate warming...|$|E

One of N wavelength channels can be selected with log 2 N switching cells, allowing a sub-linear scaling for electrode number with channel number. Each filter cell {{is based on the}} sequence of an amplifying Mach-Zehnder interferometer and an optical switch. Fine wavelength tuning and digital wavelength selection are demonstrated in a loss-compensating circuit, which allows the fast tuning of the filter pass-bands to select channels.

To this end, we propose a group-aware network configuration method that "clusters" along the same path sensor nodes that belong to the same group. The second idea involves imposing a hierarchy of output filters on the sensor network with the goal of both reducing the size of transmitted data and minimizing the number of transmitted messages.

40|$|In {{multi-station}} manufacturing systems, {{the quality}} of final products is significantly affected by both product design as well as process variables. Historically, however, tolerance research has primarily focused on allocating tolerances based on the product design characteristics of each component. Currently, there are no analytical approaches to optimally allocate tolerances to integrate product and process variables in multi-station manufacturing processes at minimum costs. The concept of process-oriented <b>tolerancing</b> expands the <b>current</b> <b>tolerancing</b> practices, which bound errors related to product variables, to explicitly include process variables. The resulting methodology extends the concept of “part interchangeability” into “process interchangeability,” which is critical due to increasing requirements related to the selection of suppliers and benchmarking. The proposed methodology {{is based on the}} development and integration of three models: (i) the tolerance-variation relation; (ii) variation propagation; and (iii) process degradation. The tolerance-variation model is based on a pin-hole fixture mechanism in multi-station assembly processes. The variation propagation model utilizes a state space representation but uses a station index instead of a time index. Dynamic process effects such as tool wear are also incorporated into the framework of process-oriented tolerancing, which provides the capability to design tolerances for the whole life-cycle of a production system. The tolerances of process variables are optimally allocated through solving a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. An industry case study is used to illustrate the proposed approach...|$|R

In this paper, a loss threshold desaturation control method is studied to improve the output characteristics of the single-phase PWM converter with a low switching frequency. The gate desaturation control characteristics of the RC-IGBT’s diode are studied. A proper current limit is set to avoid the ineffective infliction of the desaturation pulse, while the bridge arm current crosses zero. The expectation of optimized loss decrease is obtained, and the better performance for the RC-IGBTs of the single-phase PWM converter is achieved through the optimized desaturation pulse distribution. Finally, the improved predictive current control algorithm that is applied to the PWM converter with RC-IGBTs is simulated, and is operated and tested on the scaled reduced power platform.

Although MF, but not HF, was found to amplify EPCs count, this {{may be related to}} the sample size, since no interaction effect was observed. Another confounding factor might also be the distribution of sedated and awake patients in the NMES protocol subgroups, resulting in differences related to <b>current</b> <b>tolerance</b> and evoked muscle contraction. In a previous study of our group employing similar NMES protocols, both currents were equally effective in improving thenar oxygen consumption rate, endothelial reactivity and vascular reserve as well as oxygen consumption, demand and supply at the stimulated muscle, measures of systemic and local microcirculation, respectively. These improvements were well correlated to the strength of contraction [16]. Interestingly in another study, oxygen consumption in the biceps brachii during isometric contraction—which could be considered to reflect the magnitude of hypoxic stimuli of the working muscle—increased in proportion to the force developed [39]. In this study, although muscle strength contraction was not systematically recorded, some patients were hardly responded to NMES (no contraction at all or just palpable contraction), as previously observed [40]; however, all patients, ‘responders’ and ‘non-responders,’ were included in the analysis, which, in turn, might be related to the marked variability observed among patients. The optimal NMES characteristics to apply in ICU patients are still under investigation [8]. Future studies should further explore the role of NMES to mobilize progenitor cells in relation to strength contraction of the stimulated muscle.|$|R
