50|$|A fully rated {{converter}} {{can either}} be an induction generator or a permanent magnet generator. Unlike the DFIG, the FRC can employ a squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> in the generator; {{an example of this}} is the Siemens SWT 3.6-107, which is termed the industry workhorse. An example of a permanent magnet generator is the Siemens SWT-2.3-113. A disadvantage of a permanent magnet generator is the cost of materials that need to be included.|$|E
50|$|A DFIG {{generator}} draws {{reactive power}} from the transmission system; this can increase the vulnerability of a transmission system {{in the event of}} a failure. A DFIG configuration will require the generator to be a wound rotor; squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>rotors</b> cannot be used for such a configuration.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dynamical}} modeling of squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>rotors</b> in induction motors. A simple mathematical model is presented in order to analytically identify the torsional eigenfrequencies, based on the estimation of the effective length of the bar overhang. A satisfactory agreement between experimental results and theoretical estimations is achieved...|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{squirrel}} <b>cage</b> <b>rotors,</b> {{wound rotor}} motors are expensive and require {{maintenance of the}} slip rings and brushes, but they were the standard form for variable speed control {{before the advent of}} compact power electronic devices. Transistorized inverters with variable-frequency drive can now be used for speed control, and wound rotor motors are becoming less common.|$|R
50|$|Polyphase motors have rotor bars {{shaped to}} give {{different}} speed-torque characteristics. The current distribution within the rotor bars {{varies depending on}} {{the frequency of the}} induced current. At standstill, the rotor current is the same frequency as the stator current, and tends to travel at the outermost parts of the <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> bars (by skin effect). The different bar shapes can give usefully different speed-torque characteristics as well as some control over the inrush current at startup.|$|E
50|$|To {{demonstrate}} how the <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> works, the stator of a single-phase motor and a copper pipe (as rotor) may be used. If adequate AC power {{is applied to}} the stator, an alternating magnetic field will revolve around within the stator. If the copper pipe is inserted inside the stator, there will be an induced current in the pipe, and this current will produce a magnetic field in the pipe. The interaction between the stator's revolving magnetic field and the copper-pipe-rotor's induced magnetic field produces a torque and thus rotation.|$|E
50|$|A blocked rotor test is {{conducted}} on an induction motor. It {{is also known}} as short circuit test, locked rotor test or stalled torque test. From this test, short circuit current at normal voltage, power factor on short circuit, total leakage reactance, and starting torque of the motor can be found. The test {{is conducted}} at low voltage because if the applied voltage was normal voltage then the current through the stator windings would be high enough to overheat the windings and damage them. The blocked rotor torque test is not performed on wound-rotor motors because the starting torque can be varied as desired. However, a blocked rotor current test is conducted on squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> motors.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a novel electrical machine. The {{purpose of the}} machine is to provide torque to the driving wheels of an electric vehicle. It thus contains two rotors mounted on separate but coaxial shafts and which can rotate at different speeds. Both the stator and the two rotors are of the disc configuration, the stator being sandwiched between the two rotors. The machine is excited by a three phase stator winding and the <b>rotors</b> are squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>rotors.</b> The cores are designed so that the two rotors do not act independantly but interact {{in such a way}} as to give optimum torque distribution between the two rotors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an efficient axial flux {{arrangement of the}} four quadrant rotary converter for hybrid electric vehicles. The design of the axial flux wound stator and both axial flux squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>rotors</b> {{is based on the}} arrangement of radial air gap induction motor and permanent magnet synchronous motor. The method of constant magnetic circuit volume is utilized for dimensions conversion, which results into basic dimensions of stator and rotor discs in axial flux conception. This allows the creation of real 3 D models in the CAD application. Finally, the finite element simulations of electromagnetic induction in the axial flux stator pack are presented in the concluding part of this paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{squirrel}} <b>cage</b> <b>rotors</b> of induction {{machines with}} unconventional end region structure, the three-dimensional {{effects can be}} more pronounced as compared to conventional induction machines. As a result, the rotor impedance and machine power factor {{are affected by the}} design of the end ring and its supporting structure. To be able to account for this effect, three-dimensional finite element (3 D FE) analysis is required. In this paper, the steady state 3 D FE analyses are employed to identify the equivalent circuit parameters. Further, the internal power factor and the rotor bar and end ring impedances are investigated. It is further presented how the findings of the 3 D FE study can be implemented in two-dimensional (2 D) FE model in the distributed circuit...|$|R
50|$|Like a {{shaded pole}} {{induction}} motor, they use field coils with additional copper shading coils (see the illustration) {{to produce a}} weakly rotating magnetic field. But unlike a shaded pole induction motor (which uses a squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>rotor),</b> the synchronous version of this motor uses a magnetized rotor. This rotor rotates synchronously with the rotating magnetic field: if the rotor begins to lag behind the rotating field, driving torque increases and the rotor speeds up slightly until the rotor's position within the rotating field is a point where torque = drag; similarly, if {{the rotation of the}} field slows down, the rotor will advance relative to the field, torque will decline, or even become negative, slowing the speed of the rotor until it again reaches a position relative to the field where torque = drag.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{generating}} electrical power using reluctance generator {{is yet to}} be fully exploited, which will necessitate its development into industrial standard. This research aims to facilitate the development through a comparative evaluation of the performance of caged and cageless reluctance generators. A three-phase synchronous reluctance generator was modeled using existing information and its performance with or without a <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> was analyzed. Evaluation of the machines’ performance was carried out at both steady and dynamic states using MATLAB. The results show that a self-excited <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> synchronous reluctance generator yielded a power of 0. 25 p. u compared to the cage-less rotor that yielded 0. 2 p. u at an excitation of 62 μF; while on further excitation using capacitance of 110 µF, the <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> yielded a higher power of 0. 9 p. u whereas the cageless rotor could not excite beyond 62 μF. This implies that the <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> generator has the ability to excite at capacitance values high enough to circulate rotor current in the machine windings due to the existence of remnant flux, magnetic saturation and rotor geometry. The removal of damper cage of a synchronous reluctance machine allows for more modifications of the rotor geometry which include reduction in the quadrature axis flux path and hence the quadrature axis reactance which ultimately improves the machine performance. This shows that a <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> generator can be deployed where higher power is required...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{factors and}} parameters {{that affect the}} additional losses produced in the <b>rotor</b> <b>cage</b> of an induction motor during a no-load test at synchronous speed.

40|$|Abstract – Brushless doubly-fed machine (BDFM) doesn’t use {{brush and}} slip ring, and has {{advantages}} {{such as high}} system reliability, small capacity of its frequency converter, low system cost, adjustable power factor and speed, etc. At the same time, it has good applicable potentials on the variable frequency motors and the variable speed constant frequency generators. However, due to the complicacy and particularity of BDFM in the structure and operating mechanism, the effect of magnetic field modulation directly influences the operating efficiency of BDFM. To study the effect of different <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> structures on the magnetic field modulation of BDFM, the rotor magnetomotive force (MMF) of BDFM with <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> is studied by the analytical method. The components and features of rotor harmonic MMFs are discussed. At the same time, the method to weaken the higher harmonics is analyzed by the theoretic formulae. Furthermore, the magnetic field modulation mechanism is expounded on in detail {{and the relationship between}} the magnetic field modulation effect and the operating efficiency of BDFM is established. And then, a new method for estimating the magnetic field modulation effect is proposed. At last, the magnetic field modulation effects of four BDFM prototypes with different <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> structures are compared by the MMF analysis and the efficiency data of electromagnetic design. The results verify the effectiveness of the new method for estimating the magnetic field modulation effect of BDFM with <b>cage</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|E
40|$|Double cage {{induction}} motors {{are typically}} employed in applications that require high starting torque for frequent, loaded starts. This makes the starting (outer) cage susceptible to fatigue failure since it must withstand the large thermo-mechanical stress {{associated with the}} high starting current and long acceleration time. Conventional FFT-based spectrum analysis techniques are insensitive to outer cage faults due to the small outer cage current under steady state operation, and the fault indicators and thresholds applied to single cage rotors cannot be used. Therefore, {{there is a strong}} industrial need for research and development of analysis techniques and advanced fault detection algorithms for double cage machines. However, {{there are only a few}} publications that investigate double <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> faults. In this paper, a dynamic model for rotor cage faults in double cage motors, which is the first step towards double <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> fault research, is derived. A 7. 5 Hp separate end ring fabricated copper double <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> is built for experimental verification of the proposed fault model (copper inner cage/brass outer cage). The tests performed under startup and steady state operation show that the proposed fault model can provide sufficient accuracy and can be used as the basis for interpretation of FFT results and development of advanced fault detection algorithms...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 1 - The {{electromagnetic}} force acts between the rotor and stator of an induction motor, when the rotor is performing cylindrical circular whirling motion {{with respect to}} the stator. The non-symmetric flux distribution due to the eccentricity in-duces circulating currents in the <b>rotor</b> <b>cage</b> and parallel branches of the stator winding. These currents tend to equalize the flux distribution, and by doing this, reduce the electromag-netic force and change the direction of the force from the direc-tion of the shortest air gap. Impulse method is utilized in the finite element analysis to calculate the frequency response of the force and the eccentricity harmonics of the flux density in the air gap and the circulating currents. The frequency responses were calculated for the test motors with different stator connections and with and without <b>rotor</b> <b>cage.</b> The frequency response function of the force is calculated for two induction motors with different geometry, one with open and another one with closed rotor slots. The results show that the equalizing currents in both parallel branches in the stator winding and <b>rotor</b> <b>cage</b> damp strongly the amplitude of the force. The damping effects depend on the whirling frequency, loading condition and the geometry of the machine. I...|$|R
40|$|Three-phase {{induction}} motor can be operated as a three-phase induction generator. The tendency to use induction generators (<b>rotor</b> <b>cage)</b> as subtitute of a synchronous generator is also increasing, especially for small MHP with lighting load (resistive). Its {{because of the}} dificulty, hard {{to find in the}} market, and high cost,induction generator self-excitation has many advantages than synchronous generator. However, the induction generator offers low voltage regulation and its value depends on the driving speed, capacitors, and the load.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the use of {{asynchronous}} machine in industrial and traction applications has been widespread also aided {{by the development of}} electrical drives and control techniques.

40|$|The {{concept of}} bearingless motors, which combine both {{motoring}} and rotor bearing capabilities, is appealing especially in high speed and high power machine applications. Although extensive {{research has been}} carried out on permanent magnet and reluctance types of bearingless motors, studies on the induction motor type are less successful. This thesis addresses the bearingless induction motor based on the concept of dual-pole windings, one controlling the motor torque and the other the generated radial forces. A modelling approach is undertaken to investigate the effect of induction machine design on radial force generation and motor levitation under both steady state and transient conditions. The simulation is based on the dynamic reluctance mesh model embedded in vector control systems for the decoupled control of torque, flux and radial force. This is achieved through modification of a previously developed computer software for modelling induction motors in order to model the control of bearingless induction motors. Both the squirrel <b>cage</b> and wound <b>rotor</b> induction motors are investigated and their suitability for generating controlled bearing relief forces assessed. Vector control schemes for the bearingless <b>cage</b> and wound <b>rotor</b> induction motors were also designed and simulated. A mixed field oriented vector control scheme, which incorporates the simple rotor field orientation for motoring control and an airgap field orientation for rotor levitation control, is introduced and found to be advantageous in bearingless induction motor control. Apart from investigating totally bearingless conditions, the study also investigates bearing relief capabilities for a vector controlled <b>cage</b> and wound <b>rotor</b> induction motor in which the rotor movement is restricted by bearings but with the bearing load cancelled by suitably directed radial force. The effects of real winding topologies, stator and rotor slotting and iron saturation on the performance of bearing relief and bearingless induction motors are also presented. Finally, suggestions for future work is included In order to further investigate bearingless induction motors and its applications. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is twofold: to examine the {{validity}} of the rotating-field and cross-field theories of the single-phase induction motor when applied to a <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> machine; and to examine the extent to which skin effect is likely to modify the characteristics of a <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> machine. A mathematical analysis is presented for a single-phase induction motor in which the rotor parameters are modified by skin effect. Although this is based on the usual type of ideal machine, a new form of model rotor allows approximations for skin effect phenomena to be included {{as an integral part of}} the analysis. Performance equations appropriate to the rotating-field and cross-field theories are deduced, and the corresponding explanations for the steady-state mode of operation are critically examined. The evaluation of the winding currents and developed torque is simplified by the introduction of new dimensionless factors which are functions of the resistance/reactance ratios of the rotor and the speed. Tables of the factors are included for selected numerical values of the parameter ratios, and these are used to deduce typical operating characteristics for both cage and wound rotor machines. It is shown that a qualitative explanation of the mode of operation of a <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> machine is obtained from either theory; but the operating characteristics must be deduced from the performance equations of the rotating-field theory, because of the restrictions on the values of the rotor parameters imposed by skin effect...|$|E
