50|$|The use of bungees for upper <b>cylinder</b> <b>attachment</b> {{and trim}} is a quintessential {{identifier}} of sidemount configuration. The bungee {{is attached to}} the rear upper harness/BCD and routes under the diver's armpits to the front shoulder webbing. Appropriate length and thickness bungees are critical to ensure that the sidemount cylinders remain in trim horizontally along the diver's side torso with the valves under the armpits. The cylinder/s should neither rise above, or drop below, the diver when they are in flat, horizontal trim position. The cylinder is secured by wrapping, or routing, the bungees around the cylinder valve handle, stem and/or cylinder neck. In addition to providing the desired cylinder positioning and trim, the bungees also provide the capacity to secure the cylinder top end to the diver while the cylinders are detached at the bottom and maneuvered into a forward position.|$|E
40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of pulsed electric field (PEF) processed and thermally pasteurised mango nectar (Mangifera indica) was evaluated using controlled stress rheometer. The mango nectar {{was subjected to}} pulsed electric field (PEF) as well as thermal processing. The rheological parameter shear stress was measured up to the shear rate of 750 s- 1 using co-axial <b>cylinder</b> <b>attachment</b> at wide range of temperatures from 10 to 70 °C. The investigation showed that pulsed electric field (PEF) processed and thermally pasteurised mango nectar behaved like a pseudo plastic (shear thinning) fluid and obeyed Herschel-Bulkley model (0. 9780 0. 893, p < 0. 05) and flow activation energy (Ea) was significantly (p < 0. 05) affected by processing conditions. The {{results indicated that the}} pulsed electric field (PEF) and thermal processing condition has affected the rheological properties of mango nectar. The combined equation relating to shear stress (τ) with temperature and shear rate of mango nectar was established...|$|E
40|$|A {{market demand}} for a launch and {{recovery}} system for remotely operated vehicles, ROV, is identified and current thesis describes {{the development of a}} conceptual system, involving both concept generation as well as verification with calculations. The suggested solution operates the remotely operated vehicle from the hangar of the vessel, out over the ship side, lowering it to the operational depth and then recovers it back into the hangar. Launch and recovery systems must be adaptable {{to a wide variety of}} vessels and the environment is different on each vessel. A calculation tool is presented that can quickly give the main dimensions of a product at an early stage of the development process. This tool that makes it possible to input the build-in dimensions of the system and the desired classification society. The tool gives the main dimensions such as the size, weight, hydraulic cylinder dimensions and reaction forces. Secondary output such as relative positions of <b>cylinder</b> <b>attachment</b> points etc. is also available. Calculations are primarily made in MATLAB, and geometric models are created in Autodesk Inventor. To provide an easy way of inputting variable parameters, an input sheet is constructed in Microsoft Excel. The developed concept in combination with the calculation tool provides a concept that can be installed on a wide variety of vessels by only changing a small number of input variables...|$|E

Widespread popularity of sidemount diving systems did not truly emerge until the mid-2010s, when the growing popularity of technical and cave diving became exposed to sidemount proponents on the internet who were offering an alternative approach that matched the minimalism and functionality of the popular 'DIR/Hogarthian' back-mounted systems, whilst offering advantages in flexibility, comfort, accessibility and - highly debated online - safety.|$|R
40|$|Closed-form Green's {{function}} (CFGF) representations for cylindrically stratified {{media are}} developed {{and used in}} conjunction with a Galerkin method of moments (MoM) in the space domain for the analysis of microstrip antennas on multilayered circular <b>cylinders.</b> An <b>attachment</b> mode is used in the MoM solution procedure to accurately model the feeding of probe-fed microstrip antennas. The developed CFGF representations are modified in the source region (where two current modes can partially or fully overlap with each other during the MoM procedure) so that singularities can be treated analytically and hence, the proposed CFGF representations can be safely used in this region. Furthermore, accurate CFGF representations for the probe-related components (necessary for probe type excitations including the attachment mode) are obtained when the radial distance between the source and field points is electrically small or zero. Numerical results in the form of input impedance of various microstrip antennas and the mutual coupling between two antennas are presented showing good agreement when compared to the available published results as well as the results obtained from CST Microwave Studio. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Laparoscopic {{procedures}} utilize a pneumoperitoneum to distend {{and separate}} the abdominal wall from the intra-abdominal structures. Carbon dioxide {{is commonly used}} for this purpose, although this study is inclusive of any gas used for abdominal distention. The gas is delivered from cylinders through a gas insufflation delivery system. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine if laparoscopic gas delivery systems composed of gas cylinders and insufflators used for laparoscopy have microbes present. Methods: Gas delivery systems were evaluated for the presence of microbial growth using standard techniques. External connection sites, gas cylinders and the internal conduit tubing of insufflators were cultured. Fifty two (52) insufflators and sixty (60) gas cylinders were evaluated. Results: Twelve (12) of the sixty cylinders (20 %) and fifty four (54) of the sixty insufflators (92. 3 %) were culture positive. The organisms identified are significant and a varied spectrum. Conclusions: Recognition that gas <b>cylinders,</b> insufflation <b>attachments</b> and internal components of insufflators quantitatively contain microbes is demonstrated. Reduction of microbial exposure from insufflation apparatus is achieved by cleansing external ports and use of a 0. 3 micron filter for abdominal pneumoperitoneum...|$|R
40|$|Root climbers such as English ivy (Hedera helix) rely on {{specialized}} adventitious roots for attachment, {{enabling the}} plants to climb {{on a wide}} range of natural and artificial substrates. Despite their importance for the climbing habit, the biomechanical properties of these specialized adventitious roots compared with standard roots and their performance in the attachment to different host species or inert substrates have not been studied. Here organs and tissues involved in the attachment are characterized and their significance in regard to a broader functional and ecological aspect is discussed. Depending on the substrate, the root clusters show different types of failure modes at various frequencies, demonstrating the close interaction between the climber and its substrates. With a Young’s Modulus of 109. 2 [*]MPa, the attachment roots are relatively stiff for non-woody roots. The central <b>cylinders</b> of the <b>attachment</b> roots show a high tensile strength of 38 [*]MPa and a very high extensibility of 34 %. In host trees naturally co-distributed with English ivy, a ‘balanced’ occurrence of failure of the attachment system of the climber and the bark of the host is found, suggesting a co-evolution of climber and host. Maximum loads of root clusters normalized by the number of roots match those of individually tested attachment roots. In comparison with most subterranean roots the properties and structure of the attachment roots of English ivy show distinct differences. There exist similarities to the properties found for roots of Galium aparine, suggesting a trend in not fully self-supporting plants towards a higher extensibility...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis show an experimental study about {{the enhancement of}} energy conversion efficiency of a vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) based energy generation system. Firstly, there is {{a discussion about the}} recent scenario of energy demand on the world and the necessity of development of renewable energy generation systems {{in order to reduce the}} CO 2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels and also reduce the dependency of this kind of fuel because it is a limited source of power. The generation system used in this study is constituted by a cylinder, which oscillates when submitted to a constant fluid flow, and a leverage system, responsible to transmit the translational motion of the cylinder to the translational motion of a magnetic bar inside a coil, generating electricity. This generation system was already tested previously to this work and achieved a maximum conversion efficiency of 4. 5 %. To enhance the system efficiency a pair of tripping rods were attached to the cylinder symmetrically positioned in relation to the stagnation point. Tripping rods also are cylinder, but with much small diameters than the main <b>cylinder.</b> Their <b>attachment</b> changes the flow pattern around the cylinder and can produce since reduction to increase of hydrodynamic forces and amplitude of VIV, according to their angular positions. The experiments were divided in three cases, starting from the simplest case and adding complexity. The first experiments consisted of a stationary cylinder submitted to a constant flow and was carried out to measure the drag and lift forces acting on the cylinder in function oftripping rods angular position, which varied from 15 o to 165 o, with a 7. 5 o interval. The second set of experiments was conducted with a free-oscillating cylinder without energy generation system. This system had small mass and damping ratios, 6. 13 and 0. 016 respectively. Tripping rods were positioned at 60 o, 75 o, 105 o and 120 o in order to observe the changes on VIV amplitude imposed by their presence. The third and last set of experiments consisted of free-oscillating cylinder with the generating system attached. This experimental setup had larger mass and damping ratios due de inclusion of the generating system, achieving a mass ratio of 12. 34 and an average damping ratio of 0. 048. The stationary cylinder experiments were carried out at constant Reynolds number of 7. 48 × 103. It was observed during these experiments that when placing tripping rods at angular positions ranging from 22. 5 o to 52. 5 o and from 97. 5 o to 165 o a reduction of the forces acting on the cylinder occurred, achieving a maximum reduction of 67 % on lift and 20 % on drag forces. An increase on lift and drag forces was observed when placing tripping rods between 52. 5 o and 90 o, achieving a maximum increase of 68 % on lift and 40 % on drag forces. On free-oscillating tests without generator, Reynolds number varied from 3. 45 × 103 to 2. 04 × 104 and the reduced velocity from 2 to 12. When tripping rods were positioned at 60 o and 75 o significant changes occurred, with an monotonically increase of oscillation amplitudes, starting at reduced velocity 7 and continuing until 12, with a maximum amplitude 56 % larger than the obtained with the smooth cylinder. When tripping rods were placed behind the cylinder, at 105 o and 120 o, the opposite occurred, and the amplitudes were reduced significantly, achieving an almost complete VIV suppression at 120 o. Finally, the free-oscillating experiments with the generator showed that even with larger mass and damping ratios the presence of tripping rods can bring lots of benefits for energy generation using VIV, especially when they were placed at 75 o. The system efficiency during smooth cylinder tests achieved a maximum of 2. 8 %, while the efficiency with tripping rods at 75 o achieved a maximum of 12. 47 %, representing a 342 % increase. But the increase on efficiency was not the only benefit brought by tripping rods. Their presence also increased the lock-in range and maintained the power generation almost constant at reduced velocities between 6. 5 and 8. 5, meaning that the system can maintain the generation even with flow speed variations inside this range. The results showed up that the attachment of tripping rods have a great potential on the improvement of energy harvesting using VIV phenomena. This research covered only a small number of combinations of mass ratio, damping ratio, Reynolds number and diameter of tripping rods in relation to the diameter the main cylinder. It means that further research can be made as an extension of the current work, opening the opportunity for other researchers to investigate manners of increase even more the efficiency of energy conversion. この博士論文は、渦励振を利用した発電システムのエネルギー変換効率を向上させるための実験的研究について記したものである。最初に、世界におけるエネルギー需要に関する最近の動向、および再生可能エネルギー技術を開発することの必要性について述べる。この必要性は、化石燃料消費に伴う二酸化炭素排出量の削減のため、および、賦存量が限られている資源への依存性を削減するためという目的に起因している。 本研究で用いる発電システムは一本の円柱を有する。この円柱は流れの中に置かれた時に振動する。また、本システムはてこ機構を含み、この機構は円柱の並進運動を、コイル内部における磁石の並進運動に伝達させる役割をもつ。この磁石の運動により電力を発生させる。この発電システムを用いた発電試験は過去に行われており、その際のエネルギー変換効率は最大で 4. 5 ％であった。 発電効率を向上させるために本研究では、小直径の円柱（トリッピングロッド）を２つ、前方よどみ点に関して対称に円柱表面に付加することを試みた。この付加により円柱表面付近における流れを変化させ、円柱に作用する流体力、渦励振の振幅を増大させる効果を期待できる。円柱中心と前方よどみ点とを結ぶ線分と、円柱中心とトリッピングロッド取り付け位置とを結ぶ線分とがなす角度（以下、取り付け角度）によって、この効果に大小が変化することが予想された。 三種類の実験を実施した。一つ目は、円柱を固定した状態で支持し、一定流速の流れの中に置き、円柱に作用する抗力と揚力の計測である。取り付け角度は 15 度から 165 度まで 7. 5 度刻みで変化させた。レイノルズ数は 7. 48 × 103 である。 二つ目は、円柱をばね支持し、発電機を外した状態での計測である。質量比は 6. 13 、減衰比は 0. 016 である。取り付け角度は 60 度、 75 度、 105 度、 120 度の 4 か所とした。レイノルズ数は 3. 45 × 103 から 2. 04 × 104 までの領域であり、この領域は換算流速 2 から 12 までの領域に相当する。 三つ目は、円柱をばね支持し、発電機を付けた状態での計測である。質量比は 12. 34 、減衰比は 0. 048 である。 一つ目の固定円柱試験の結果、取り付け角度が 22. 5 o から 52. 5 oまでの領域および 97. 5 o から 165 oまでの領域のとき、流体力が低下することが示された。トリッピングロッドの付加なしの場合に比べて揚力は最大で 67 ％、抗力は最大で 20 ％低下した。取り付け角度が 52. 5 o から 90 oまでの領域のとき、揚力、抗力ともに増加し、トリッピングロッドの付加なしの場合に比べて揚力は最大で 68 %、抗力は最大で 40 ％増加した。 二つ目の振動円柱試験（発電機なし）では、取り付け角度が 60 度および 75 度のとき、顕著な効果が検出された。換算流速が 7 以上になると振動振幅が単調に増加し、この傾向は換算流速 12 まで続いた。トリッピングロッドなしの場合に比べて振幅が最大で 56 ％増加した。一方で、トリッピングロッドを円柱後方に付加（取り付け角度 105 度、 120 度）したときは、振幅は大幅に減少し、 120 度の場合では振動はほぼ完全に消失した。三つ目の振動円柱試験（発電機あり）では、質量比と減衰比が比較的に大きいにもかかわらず、トリッピングロッドの付加は、エネルギー変換効率の向上をもたらすことが示された。このことは取り付け角度が 75 度の場合に特に顕著であった。付加なしの場合では、変換効率は 2. 8 ％に過ぎなかったのに対して、付加ありの場合では最大で 12. 47 %（ 3. 42 倍に相当）にまで高まった。また本実験により、トリッピングロッドの付加による効果には、変換効率を向上させるという点だけではなく、自励振動の同期領域を拡大させるという点もあることが見出された。付加ありの場合、換算流速 6. 5 から 8. 5 までの領域では、発生電力が一定に維持され、このことは流速がこの範囲内で変化しても発生電力が安定に保たれることを意味する。 以上の実験結果から、トリッピングロッドの付加は、渦励振を利用する発電システムのエネルギー変換効率を向上させる効果をもつことが示された。本研究では、質量比、減衰比、レイノルズ数、トリッピングロッドと振動円柱との直径比に関して数個の場合のみ実験を行った。これらのパラメーターをさらに変化させ、エネルギー変換の大小を調べることが次の課題として挙げられる...|$|R
