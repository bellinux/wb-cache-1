40|$|With the {{implementation}} of more strict national environmental protection laws, energy conservation, emission reduction and clean production will present higher requirements for sulfur recovery tail gas processing techniques and <b>catalyzers.</b> As for Claus tail gas, conventional hydrogenation <b>catalyzers</b> are gradually being replaced by low-temperature hydrogenation <b>catalyzers.</b> This paper concentrates {{on the development of}} technologies for low-temperature hydrogenation hydrolysis <b>catalyzers,</b> preparation of such <b>catalyzers</b> and their industrial application. In view of the specific features of SO 2 hydrogenation and organic sulfur hydrolysis during low-temperature hydrogenation, a new technical process involving joint application of hydrogenation <b>catalyzers</b> and hydrolysis <b>catalyzers</b> was proposed. In addition, low-temperature hydrogenation <b>catalyzers</b> and low-temperature hydrolysis <b>catalyzers</b> suitable for low-temperature conditions were developed. Joint application of these two kinds of <b>catalyzers</b> may reduce the inlet temperatures in the conventional hydrogenation reactors from 280  °C to 220  °C, at the same time, hydrogenation conversion rates of SO 2 can be enhanced to over 99 %. To further accelerate the hydrolysis rate of organic sulfur, the <b>catalyzers</b> for hydrolysis of low-temperature organic sulfur were developed. In lab tests, the volume ratio of the total sulfur content in tail gas can be as low as 131  ×  10 − 6 when these two kinds of <b>catalyzers</b> were used in a proportion of 5 : 5 in volumes. Industrial application of these <b>catalyzers</b> was implemented in 17 sulfur recovery tail gas processing facilities of 15 companies. As a result, Sinopec Jinling Petrochemical Company had outstanding application performances with a tail gas discharging rate lower than 77. 9  mg/m 3 and a total sulfur recovery of 99. 97 %...|$|R

After four years of work and measurements together with Rossi, Focardi concluded that nuclear fusion reactions happen inside the Energy <b>Catalyzer.</b> Focardi states that the nuclear process is facilitated by a secret additive, known only by Rossi and not by him.

Considering that at any particular scale, the system is actually a sub-system, the cross-scale effects have a great significance in the dynamics of CAS. Meanwhile, the chosen Catalysts plays a tremendous role in the IMM. From the selection of one layer as horizontal <b>catalyzer</b> and one key category, as vertical <b>catalyzer</b> {{the reaction of the}} system starts, driving the local modification and activating the system's transformation. It is clear that the choice of the catalysts depends on the investigation phase.The Horizontal Catalyst, which could be any of the basic layers, Volume, Void, Transportation and Function, initiates the system’s reaction; whilst, the Vertical Catalyst {{will be one of the}} KCs. The catalyzers choice as a first driver of the transformation is the main goal of this phase, assigning respectively to the selected subsystem and key category the catalyst role and to the others the reactants one.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} two carbon analyzer <b>catalyzers,</b> one with high sensitivity and another with regular sensitivity, used in the determination of carbon concentration in a total organic carbon analyzer – TOC. Its applicability was then evaluated in an environmental monitoring study. They have been constructed two calibration curves with 5 points each, first in the interval of 2 mgL- 1 at 10 mgL- 1 and the second in the interval of 10 mgL- 1 at 100 mgL- 1. Both calibration curves showed {{a high level of}} linearity that can be observed by R 2 values that were 0. 9996 for the concentration range of 2 mgL- 1 to 10 mgL- 1, 0. 9999 for the concentration range of 10 mgL- 1 to 100 mgL- 1, and 0. 9999 for the concentration range of 100 mgL- 1 to 1. 000 mgL- 1. The limits of detection and quantification for inorganic carbon were, respectively, 0. 003 mgL- 1 and 0. 009 mgL- 1. The limits of detection and quantification for the different <b>catalyzers</b> were also evaluated and showed the following values: regular sensitivity: 0. 015 mgL- 1 and 0. 050 mgL- 1, respectively, and high sensitivity; 0. 004 mgL- 1 and 0. 013 mgL- 1, respectively. The environmental monitoring was performed in two points (PB 1 and PB 2) in the Garcia stream. Carbon concentrations were monitored during 24 hours with 2 -hour intervals between sampling. It was observed that the concentrations of carbon remained constant throughout the experiment, {{with the exception of the}} period between 10 : 00 am and 04 : 00 pm, probably due to the input of carbonates and bicarbonates derived from textile companies in the region or still had to the launching of urban sewers. Comparing the average carbon concentration, values of point PB 2 were always higher than those observed at point PB 1.
