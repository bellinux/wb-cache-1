40|$|A seal is a {{component}} {{used in a}} turbomachine to reduce internal leakage of the working fluid and to increase the machine's efficiency. The stability of a turbomachine partially depends upon the rotodynamic <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> the seal. The integral control volume based rotodynamic coefficient prediction programs are no more accurate than {{the accuracy of the}} leakage mass flow rate estimation. Thus an accurate prediction of the mass flow rate through seals is extremely important, especially for rotodynamic analysis of turbomachinery. For labyrinth seals, which are widely used, the energy dissipation is achieved by a series of constrictions and cavities. When the fluid flows through the constriction (under each tooth), a part of the pressure head is converted into kinetic energy, which is dissipated through small scale turbulence-viscosity interaction in the cavity that follows. Therefore, a leakage flow rate prediction equation can be developed by comparing the seal to a series of orifices and cavities. Using this analogy, the mass flow rate is modeled as a function <b>of</b> the flow <b>coefficient</b> under each tooth and the carry over coefficient, which accounts for the turbulent dissipation of kinetic energy in a cavity. This work, based upon FLUENT CFD simulations, initially studies the influence of flow parameters, in addition to geometry, on the carry over <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> a cavity, developing a better model for the same. It is found that the Reynolds number and clearance to pitch ratios have a major influence and tooth width has a secondary influence on the carry over coefficient and models for the same were developed for a generic rectangular tooth on stator labyrinth seal. The <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> the labyrinth seal tooth (with the preceding cavity) was found to be a function <b>of</b> the <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> a single tooth (with no preceding cavity) and the carry over <b>coefficient.</b> The <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> a single tooth is established {{as a function of the}} Reynolds number and width to clearance ratio of the tooth and a model for the same is developed. It is also verified that this model describes the <b>discharge</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> the first tooth in the labyrinth seal. By comparing the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> compressible flow to that of incompressible flow at the same Reynolds number, the expansion factor was found to depend only upon the pressure ratio and ratio of specific heats. A model for the same was developed.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The standard orifice plate is used extensively by the natural gas industry for the metering of fuel. Because of the costs associated with errors in flow measurement inherent {{with the use of a}} standard orifice plate, any improvements upon the existing standard orifice plate design would be desirable. Consequently, a new type of orifice plate has been designed. It is termed the "slotted orifice plate". In the slotted orifice plate, the familiar round hole found in the center of standard orifice plates is replaced with a circular array of radially aligned slots. The objective of this project was to compare the performance of the slotted orifice plate to that of the standard orifice plate in order to determine the extent, if any, to which the slotted orifice plate is superior to the standard orifice plate in flow measurement. This was done by investigating pipe-wall pressure distributions and velocity profiles associated with flow through both the standard plate and the slotted plate for a variety of test cases. By using the pressure distribution and velocity profile data, <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> were plotted against the second order radial moments of axial momentum.
