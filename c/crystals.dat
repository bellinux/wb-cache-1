5|$|After World War II {{work on the}} {{synthesis}} of liquid <b>crystals</b> was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. George William Gray, a prominent researcher of liquid <b>crystals,</b> began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed {{a better understanding of}} how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid <b>Crystals</b> became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid <b>crystals</b> was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid <b>crystals,</b> in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world’s top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.|$|E

5|$|One {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events in the game, on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental <b>crystals</b> of light. They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature. This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light <b>crystals</b> not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental <b>crystals.</b> Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark <b>crystals</b> to recapture the power of the light <b>crystals.</b> These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.|$|E

5|$|Burning Rangers is a third-person shooter game {{in which}} players {{complete}} missions involving extinguishing fires and rescuing civilians. The game {{is set in a}} futuristic society in which fire is the only danger, and stars an elite group of firefighters, the Burning Rangers. The player assumes control of one of two apprentice rangers, and completes tasks across the game's four levels. The primary objective is to transport stranded civilians from burning buildings, by collecting energy <b>crystals</b> dropped from extinguished fires. A minimum of five <b>crystals</b> are needed to transport a civilian to safety; the player receives an energy shield if they use ten. The <b>crystals</b> function similarly to rings in Sonic the Hedgehog games: possessing at least one crystal allows a player to survive damage from an enemy or fire. Being hit once scatters the player's <b>crystals</b> and renders them vulnerable to death.|$|E
5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate <b>crystals</b> occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these <b>crystals</b> are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate <b>crystals</b> stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E

5000|$|In angle-resolved photo-emission {{spectroscopy}} (ARPES), irradiating {{light on}} a <b>crystal</b> sample results in the ejection of an electron away from the <b>crystal.</b> Throughout {{the course of the}} interaction, one is allowed to conflate the two concepts of <b>crystal</b> and true momentum and thereby gain direct knowledge of a <b>crystal's</b> band structure. That is to say, an electron's <b>crystal</b> momentum inside the <b>crystal</b> becomes its true momentum after it leaves, and the true momentum may be subsequently inferred from the equationby measuring the angle and kinetic energy at which the electron exits the <b>crystal</b> ( [...] is a single electron's mass). Interestingly, because <b>crystal</b> symmetry in the direction normal to the <b>crystal</b> surface is lost at the <b>crystal</b> boundary, <b>crystal</b> momentum in this direction is not conserved. Consequently, the only directions in which useful ARPES data can be gleaned are directions parallel to the <b>crystal</b> surface.|$|R
5|$|<b>Crystals,</b> though long {{admired for}} their {{regularity}} and symmetry, were not investigated scientifically until the 17th century.
