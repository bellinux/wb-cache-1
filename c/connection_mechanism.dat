40|$|Abstract. In current {{software}} components models, components do not encapsulate control, and are composed by <b>connection</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which pass control from component to component. <b>Connection</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are not hierarchical in general, and therefore current component models {{do not support}} hierarchical system construction. In this paper we argue that control encapsulation by components, together with suitable composition mechanisms, {{can lead to a}} component model that supports hierarchical system construction. We show an example of such a model and present a calculus for its hierarchical composition mechanisms. ...|$|R

We study several alternatives for implementing TCP connection establishment, reviewing approaches taken by existing TCP stacks as well as proposing new mechanisms to improve server throughput and reduce client response times under overload. We implement some of these <b>connection</b> establishment <b>mechanisms</b> in the Linux TCP stack and evaluate their performance in a variety of environments. We also evaluate the cost of supporting half-closed connections at the server and assess the impact of an abortive release of connections by clients on the throughput of an overloaded server. Our evaluation demonstrates that <b>connection</b> establishment <b>mechanisms</b> that eliminate the TCP-level retransmission of connection attempts by clients increase server throughput by up to 40 % and reduce client response times by two orders of magnitude. <b>Connection</b> termination <b>mechanisms</b> that preclude support for half-closed connections additionally improve server throughput by up to 18 %...|$|R

50|$|Quick connect {{fittings}} (push fittings) {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of plumbing, heating, electrical and fire suppression systems. Quick Fitting, Inc., Warwick Rhode Island has been a prolific inventor of innovations in quick connect technologies. Quick Fitting is the original inventor of quick connect for electrical, fire suppression and plumbing technologies, holding over 20 U.S. and foreign patents on quick connection technology. U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Quick connect works by inserting the tubing into a <b>connection</b> <b>mechanism</b> that deploys fastening teeth onto the tubing surface. When opposing force is applied to the union, the teeth are forced deeper into the tubing, preventing separation of the union. Quick connect fittings offer a significant time saving benefit over traditional technologies and require little skill for their usage. There are a large variety of quick connect fittings in the market and they are found in all industries. They are employed many kilometers underwater, in drilling operations, in orbit, for docking spacecraft, and everywhere in between, for a myriad of reasons.|$|E
5000|$|The Lexington was {{commissioned}} by Cornelius Vanderbilt in early 1834. The ship's keel was laid down at the Bishop and Simonson Shipyards in New York in September 1834. Unlike later steamboats, no detailed plans of the ship were made. Instead, a wooden model of the hull was carved and altered according to Vanderbilt's satisfaction. Using the model as a guide, full-sized outlines were then drawn in chalk on the timber {{to be used for}} the hull, which was then cut and assembled by carpenters. The engine of the Lexington was constructed at the West Point Foundry. Making use of a [...] "walking beam" [...] <b>connection</b> <b>mechanism,</b> activated by a 48 in steam cylinder with an 11 ft stroke, the ship's engine {{was one of the most}} efficient of its time.

5000|$|Roombots have {{a hybrid}} architecture. Each module has three degree of freedom, {{two of them}} using the {{diametrical}} axis within a regular cube, and a third (center) axis of rotation connecting the two spherical parts. All three axes are continuously rotatory. The outer Roombots DOF is using the same axis-orientation as Molecubes, the third, central Roombots axis enables the module to rotate its two outer DOF against each other. This novel feature enables a single Roombots module to locomote on flat terrain, but also to climb a wall, or to cross a concave, perpendicular edge. Convex edges require the assembly {{of at least two}} modules into a Roombots [...] "Metamodule". Each module has ten available connector slots, currently two of them are equipped with an active <b>connection</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on mechanical latches.Roombots are designed for two tasks: to eventually shape objects of daily life, e.g. furniture, and to locomote, e.g. as a quadruped or a tripod robot made from multiple modules.More information can be found at Biorobotics Laboratory Roombots webpage.|$|E
