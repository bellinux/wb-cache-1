5|$|The CVP {{also has}} several dams on the San Joaquin River—which has far less average flow than the Sacramento—in order to divert its water to {{southern}} Central Valley aqueducts. The Friant Dam, completed in 1942, {{is the largest}} component of the Friant Division of the CVP. The dam crosses the San Joaquin River where it spills out of the Sierra Nevada, forming Millerton Lake, which provides water storage for San Joaquin Valley irrigators {{as well as providing}} a diversion point for a pair of canals, the Friant-Kern Canal and the Madera Canal. The Friant-Kern Canal sends water southwards through the Tulare Lake area to its terminus at Bakersfield on the Kern River, supplying irrigation water to Tulare, Fresno, and Kern counties. The Madera Canal takes water northwards to Madera County, emptying into the <b>Chowchilla</b> River.|$|E

25|$|Miller and Lux {{were not}} any newer to the San Joaquin Valley {{than had been}} Haggin, but were the driving {{influence}} on valley agribusiness {{until well into the}} early 20th century. The corporation had begun acquiring land in the valley in 1858, eventually holding sway over an enormous swath reaching from the Kern River in the south to the <b>Chowchilla</b> River in the north. Much of the land that Miller and Lux acquired was swamp and marsh, which was considered virtually worthless. However, with their huge capital, they could afford to drain thousands of acres of it, beginning an enormous environmental change that eventually resulted in the loss of over 95 percent of the wetlands adjoining the San Joaquin River and Tulare Basin.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chowchillas,</b> Orthonyx spaldingii, are {{a common}} {{inhabitant}} of the World Heritage-listed Wet Tropics of North Queensland and are confined to the Australian tropical rainforests. They are sedentary and groups of two to five birds defend year-round all-purpose territories. They forage as a group and cooperate in territory defence but {{do not appear to}} breed cooperatively. The main focus {{of this study was to}} investigate what ecological and other factors could be involved in causing <b>Chowchillas</b> to live in groups but not breed cooperatively. I examined patterns of food availability, foraging strategies, territoriality, social behaviour and group structure in <b>Chowchillas.</b> Food availability over time and between sites was measured by sampling the leaf litter fauna. Food availability varied seasonally and from year-to-year but the variation was small. Food availability in patches was predictable on the basis of readily observed characteristics of the leaf litter. <b>Chowchillas</b> ate most types of small animals occurring in the leaf litter. They were found not to search randomly when foraging, instead choosing patches which were likely to contain more food. This strategy probably involved learning the cues which indicated patch quality. Several birds were fitted with radio-transmitters. Home ranges of two groups were mapped over several months and the home ranges of five neighbouring groups were mapped in one period. Home ranges were found to be stable over time and overlapped to some extent. Each group had a core area within their home range which was rarely encroached upon by other groups and this approximated the defended area. Home range size was larger in larger groups and the area per bird also increased with group size. Groups were stable over time. The reproductive rate was estimated at 0. 27 fledged young per group per year and the survival rate was estimated at 86...|$|R
25|$|The Yokuts, who {{comprised}} most of {{the indigenous}} people in the San Joaquin basin, mostly lived in the foothill area of the Sierra along streams, with their territory stretching south from the <b>Chowchilla</b> River to the Kern River. Certain areas above the foothills were occupied by the Chumash and visited by Paiute peoples of the Great Basin for trade. The marshy areas to the west were inhabited by various nomadic groups, and probably had fewer permanent residents {{although it was a}} favored fishing and hunting area. In contrast, the Miwok occupied land deeper within the Sierra Nevada stretching north from the Merced River to the Mokelumne or the American, a tributary of the Sacramento, and west to the Delta region. Most of the Miwok people in the watershed were part of the appropriately named Sierra Miwok group.|$|E

In 1983 and 1984, Hill won the World Series of Drag Boat Racing championship. The series features two races {{in each of the four}} major drag boat racing sanctioning bodies. He won 17 races between 1983 and 1984, and made 29 of 34final rounds. [...] Before he quit boat drag racing, he had an elapsed time of 5.16seconds in the wet quarter mile at Firebird Lake in Chandler, Arizona. The e.t. was quicker than Gary Beck's 5.39-second NHRA Top Fuel dragster record, the first time that the water record was lower than the land record. Hill quit boat racing in October 1984 after a crash at 217miles per hour. [...] "It was a perfect run," [...] Hill recalled.
