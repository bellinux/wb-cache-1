40|$|Fourier {{transform}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} measurements {{have been carried}} out on liquid-encapsulated Czochralski-grown undoped InP wafers, which reproducibly become semi-insulating upon annealing in an ambient of phosphorus at 800 - 900 °C. The measurements reveal a high concentration of hydrogen complexes in the form V InH 4 existing in the material before annealing in agreement with recent experimental studies. It is argued that the dominant and essential process producing the semi-insulating behavior is the compensation produced by an EL 2 -like deep donor phosphorus antisite defect, which is formed by the dissociation of the hydrogen complexes during the process of annealing. The deep donor <b>compensates</b> <b>acceptors,</b> the majority of which are shallow residual acceptor impurities and deep hydrogen associated V In and isolated V In levels, produced at the first stage of the dissociation of the V InH 4 complex. The high concentration of indium vacancies produced by the dissociation are the precursor of the EL 2 -like phosphorus antisite. These results show the importance of hydrogen on the electrical properties of InP and indicate that this largely results from low formation energy of the complex V InH 4 in comparison with that of an isolated V In. © 1998 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

Furthermore, this evolution exhibits significant differences that depend on surface polarity. ROP decreased the predominant 2. 5 eV defect emission related to oxygen vacancies on the O face, while creating a new 2. 1 eV defect emission on the Zn face that increases with ROP time. The surface-located 2. 1 eV emission correlates with carrier profiles from capacitance-voltage measurements and a shift of the E 3 trap to higher binding energy from deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). This result suggests that ROP generates Zn vacancies on the Zn face which act as <b>compensating</b> <b>acceptors</b> at the surface and in the near surface region.

Disorder recovered significantly after annealing at temperatures up to 1500 C, but not completely. From SIMS analysis, oxygen contamination in the AIN capping layer causes oxygen diffusion into the GaN film above 1400 C.

5000|$|Doped {{metal oxides}} {{for use as}} {{transparent}} conducting layers in photovoltaic devices are typically grown on a glass substrate. This glass substrate, apart from providing a support that the oxide can grow on, has the additional benefit of blocking most infrared wavelengths greater than 2 µm for most silicates, and converting it to heat in the glass layer. This in turn helps maintain a low temperature of the active region of the solar cell, which degrades in performance as it heats up. TCO films can be deposited on a substrate through various deposition methods, including metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), metal organic molecular beam deposition (MOMBD), solution deposition, spray pyrolysis, ultrasonic nozzle sprayed graphene oxide and air sprayed Ag Nanowire [...] and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), however conventional fabrication techniques typically involve magnetron sputtering of the film.

The resistivity (r = 32 10 4 V cm for intrinsic tin oxide) shows intriguing characteristics when F concentration nF is increased (r = 6 10 4 V cm for FTO but 25 10 4 V cm for hFTO) whereas the carrier concentration is almost constant at high F concentration (nc 6 1020 cm 3 for FTO and hFTO).

Electron spin resonance (e. s. r.) techniques have proved very useful in this type of investigation in other materials. Since little similar work on CdS has previously been reported, the purpose of the research described in this thesis, has been to examine the usefulness of the technique in studying CdS. Initially it was necessary to construct a sensitive x-band microwave spectrometer, which operates at temperatures down to 1. 5 ºK and has provision for continual. illumination of the samples, Electron spin resonance absorption signals have been detected in undoped single crystals of GdS which can be attributed to four different defect centres. The occurrence of the resonance signals can be correlated with the resistivities and edge luminescence spectra of the samples. This indicates that the centres responsible for the resonance absorption are important in determining the electrical and optical properties of CdS and are those which this work was initiated to study. Tentative models for the various defects have been proposed. The most important feature of the work reported in this thesis is the isolation of an e. s. r. signal which is thought to be associated with the class 2 centres which provide the photo- conductive sensitisation and possibly act as I.

40|$|Vacancy-mediated {{migration}} of Al in single-crystal zinc oxide (ZnO) is investigated using secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) combined with hybrid density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. A thin film of Al-doped ZnO is deposited by sputtering onto the single-crystal bulk material and heat treated at {{temperatures in the}} range of 900 [*]°C– 1300 [*]°C. The {{migration of}} Al is found to be Zn-vacancy mediated. In order to elucidate the physical processes involved, an alternative model based on reactive diffusion is developed. The model includes the time evolution of the concentration of Al atoms on the Zn site (AlZn), Zn vacancies (vZn), and a complex between the two, where the influence of the charge state of vZn on its formation energy is incorporated through the free carrier concentration. The modeling results exhibit close agreement with the experimental data and the AlZnvZn complex is found to diffuse with an activation energy of 2. 6 eV and a preexponential factor of 4 × 10 − 2 [*][*]cm 2 [*]s− 1. The model is supported by the results from hybrid DFT calculations combined with thermodynamical modeling, which also suggest that a complex between AlZn and vZn is promoted in n-doped material. The charge state of this complex is effectively − 1, and it thus acts as a <b>compensating</b> <b>acceptor,</b> limiting full utilization of the shallow AlZn donor. Furthermore, the DFT calculations also predict a high formation energy for both substitutional Al on the O site (AlO) and interstitial Al (Ali), and are therefore of minor importance for Al migration in ZnO. The close coupling between the hybrid DFT calculations and the developed diffusion model enable benchmarking of the accuracy of several parameters extracted from the DFT calculations. Furthermore, since the diffusion model hinges strongly on defect concentrations, it couples directly to results from measurements by other experimental techniques than those used in this paper and provides an opportunity for independent verification of the estimated values by future studies. © 2015 American Physical Societ...|$|R

Surface space-charge calculations indicate that the lowering of the surface Fermi level increases the density of unoccupied donor-type surface states and that these are largely <b>compensated</b> by Mg <b>acceptors</b> in the near-surface hole depletion region rather than by accumulated electrons. This is a significant step towards the realization of InN-based optoelectronic devices. Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|These consist {{essentially}} of a 3-5 mm thick {{silicon junction}} type p-i-n diode (same as PIN diode) with a bias of −1000 V across it. The lithium-drifted centre part forms the non-conducting i-layer, where Li <b>compensates</b> the residual <b>acceptors</b> which would otherwise make the layer p-type. When an X-ray photon passes through, it causes {{a swarm of}} electron-hole pairs to form, and this causes a voltage pulse. To obtain sufficiently low conductivity, the detector must be maintained at low temperature, and liquid-nitrogen cooling must {{be used for the}} best resolution. With some loss of resolution, the much more convenient Peltier cooling can be employed.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of Schottky contact semiconductor radiation detectors fabricated from semi‐insulating GaAs is highly sensitive to charged impurities and defects in the material. The observed behavior of semi‐insulating GaAs Schottky barrier alpha particle detectors {{does not match}} well with models that treat the semi‐insulating material as either perfectly intrinsic or as material with deep donors (EL 2) of constant capture cross section <b>compensated</b> with shallow <b>acceptors.</b> We propose {{an explanation for the}} discrepancy based on enhanced capture of electrons by EL 2 centers at high electric fields and the resulting formation of a quasineutral region in the GaAs. Presented is a simple model including field enhanced electron capture which shows good agreement with experimental alpha particle pulse height measurements...|$|R
