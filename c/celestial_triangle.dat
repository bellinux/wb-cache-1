50|$|It was {{developed}} in 1920 at the Air Ministry Laboratories at Kensington in London and was produced by Henry Hughes & Son Ltd of London until the mid-1930s. It solved the so-called <b>celestial</b> <b>triangle</b> accurately to about one minute of arc and quickly enough for aerial navigation. The solution of the <b>celestial</b> <b>triangle</b> used the John Napier rules for solution of square-angled spherical triangles. The slide rule was constructed as two coaxial tubes with spiral scales, like the Fuller slide rules, with yet another tube on the outside carrying the cursors.|$|E
50|$|The {{geometry}} {{for the sky}} polarization can {{be represented}} by a <b>celestial</b> <b>triangle</b> based on the sun, zenith, and observed pointing (or the point of scattering). In the model, γ is the angular distance between the observed pointing and the sun, Θs is the solar zenith distance (90° - solar altitude), Θ is the angular distance between the observed pointing and the zenith (90° - observed altitude), Φ is the angle between the zenith direction and the solar direction at the observed pointing, and ψ is the angle between the solar direction and the observed pointing at the zenith.|$|E
