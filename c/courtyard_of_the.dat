5|$|Syria {{became part}} of the Ottoman Empire in 1516, and Palmyra was a center of an {{administrative}} district (sanjak). During the Ottoman era, Palmyra was a small village in the <b>courtyard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple of Bel. After 1568 the Ottomans appointed the Lebanese prince Ali bin Musa Harfush as governor of Palmyra's sanjak, dismissing him in 1584 for treason.|$|E

It consisted of eight large iron streetlamps, profusely decorated with plant motifs, friezes, shields and names of battles and Catalan admirals. The same year he participated in the competition {{for the construction of}} the San Sebastián social centre (now town hall), won by Luis Aladrén Mendivi and Adolfo Morales de los Ríos; Gaudí submitted a project that synthesised several of his earlier studies, such as the fountain for the Plaça Catalunya and the <b>courtyard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Provincial Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Stackpole {{delivered}} the William A.

2500|$|Originally, <b>the</b> rear <b>courtyards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} {{were open to}} the gardens through a colonnade, Murdoch's intention being that members and Senators {{should be able to}} use the gardens as an integral part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. [...] Later this intention was lost, as extensions were added to <b>the</b> back part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building to provide more offices.|$|R
50|$|After minarets became {{customary}} at mosques, <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> muezzin {{in cities}} was sometimes {{given to a}} blind man, who could not see down into <b>the</b> inner <b>courtyards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citizens' houses and thus could not violate privacy. Whether factual or not, <b>the</b> blindness <b>of</b> muezzins is claimed as almost universal at certain periods by Jose Saramago in his novel concerning historical epistemology, <b>The</b> History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Siege <b>of</b> Lisbon.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> culture <b>of</b> Bhutan {{is fully}} {{reflected}} in Thimphu {{in respect of}} literature, religion, customs, and national dress code, <b>the</b> monastic practices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monasteries, music, dance, literature and in the media. Tshechu is an important festival when mask dances, popularly known as Cham dances, are performed in <b>the</b> <b>courtyards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tashichho Dzong in Thimphu. It is a four-day festival held every year during autumn (September/October), on dates corresponding to the Bhutanese calendar.|$|R
5|$|The minor inmates at the Castellania {{were the}} ones who took care of the general maintenance, {{cleaning}} and repair works of the building, while guards were responsible for the allocation of tasks and observing their performance. Some historical graffiti made by prisoners {{can be found at the}} <b>courtyard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison. At the underground are the dungeons, which are described as an unpleasant place to stay. By the early 19th century, arrested females awaiting a court decision started to be sent to the women prison at Corradino (now a police station) rather than accommodated at the Castellania.|$|E
5|$|The present main {{entrance}} to the mosque is the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which opens into the white marble-paved courtyard {{at the opposite end}} of the main prayer hall. To the northeast of the Bab al-Muzayinīn, the courtyard is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya; the southwestern end of the courtyard leads to the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya. Directly across the courtyard from the {{entrance to the}} Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay. Through this gate lies the <b>courtyard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prayer hall.|$|E
5|$|To {{recognize}} the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. By tradition, freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench, which is currently located in the <b>courtyard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T neon sign, donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT Stadium.

50|$|Although 19th-century Žižkov is {{regarded}} as a proletarian neighborhood, there was also industry there. The largest factory, producing matches, was founded by French entrepreneurs Sellier and Bellot at Parukářka at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. At <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Republic, there were smaller factories - Papírografie on Vápenka, the Strejc and Nosek precision machine plants, and a number of workshops on Kněžská luka.

50|$|Construction {{began on}} a third capitol {{building}} in 1922. The Willcox designed capitol's foundation settled and the building was structurally unsound. Bertram G. Goodhue was selected in a national competition as its architect. By 1924, <b>the</b> first phase <b>of</b> construction was completed and state offices moved into the new building. In 1925, the Willcox designed capitol building was razed. The Goodhue designed capitol was constructed in four phases, with <b>the</b> completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth phase in 1932 (total completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goodhue design would not be realized until <b>the</b> completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capitol fountains within <b>the</b> four interior <b>courtyards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capitol building, with an estimated completion date of 2017).|$|R

5|$|Just as {{negotiations}} {{were about to}} recommence at around 1:30 pm, chaos broke out as the impatient and angry crowd stormed the outer <b>courtyard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bastille, pushing toward the main gate. Confused firing {{broke out in the}} confined space and chaotic fighting began in earnest between de Launay's forces and the revolutionary crowd as the two sides exchanged fire. At around 3:30 pm, more mutinous royal forces arrived to reinforce the crowd, bringing with them trained infantry officers and several cannons. After discovering that their weapons were too light to damage the main walls of the fortress, the revolutionary crowd began to fire their cannons at the wooden gate of the Bastille. By now around 83 of the crowd had been killed and another 15 mortally wounded; only one of the Invalides had been killed in return.|$|E
5|$|Several old bronze statues {{that line}} the <b>courtyard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple {{have a long history}} as war loot. They were {{originally}} Khmer statues, found at Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and were taken to Ayutthaya in 1431 by the Siamese. In 1564, the Burmese king Bayinnaung conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to Bago (Pegu). In 1599, King Razagri of Mrauk U invaded Bago and brought the statues to Mrauk U. Finally, Thado Minsaw took them to Amarapura in 1785. According to local belief, many more of these statues were brought from Arakan. However, King Thibaw melted many of them to cast cannons for fortification of his palace. Of the thirty statues Bayinnaung brought from Siam, only six remain today, and are displayed in the temple complex. They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities.|$|E
5|$|The Great Palace II (or Gran Palacio II in Spanish) {{is another}} large {{residential}} complex, {{it is located}} on the southeast side of Plaza C. The palace is formed by a large number of small rooms arranged around seven interior courtyards. A large quantity of ceramic remains were recovered from within this palace. The rooms around the northeast courtyard within the Great Palace II may have been the royal apartments of this complex, owing to their position near the central courtyard {{while at the same time}} being closed off from it. The ceramics from this area were of exotic origin and elite nature. The royal apartments may also have included the rooms around the north <b>courtyard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace.|$|E
50|$|Don Antonio Severino Martinez, {{also known}} as Severino Martinez, bought the {{property}} about 2 miles southwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Taos Plaza in 1804, after relocating his family from Abiquiu to Taos that year. At first the building was a four-room dwelling and then it grew as Martinez became more successful. It was made of thick adobe walls, without exterior windows. The hacienda had 2 inner courtyards, or placitas, around which a total of 21 rooms were built. It was constructed as a fortress for protection against attacks by Plains tribes, such as Comanche and Apache raiders. When there was a threat <b>of</b> violence, <b>the</b> livestock were brought into <b>the</b> <b>courtyards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hacienda for safety.|$|R
500|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars, from 1793 to 1804, {{the abbey}} was {{abandoned}} by the monks and the principality extinguished.
