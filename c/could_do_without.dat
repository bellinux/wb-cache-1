5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that the state <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E
5|$|This revival did {{not last}} long. Following the death of Charles of Anjou in 1285 {{and the end of}} the threat of an {{invasion}} from Italy, Michael's successor Andronikos II Palaiologos (1282–1328) assumed that, by relying on the naval strength of his Genoese allies, he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> the maintenance of a fleet, whose particularly heavy expenditure the increasingly cash-strapped treasury could no longer afford. At the same time, Andronikos was less concerned with the West and more with affairs in Asia Minor and his—eventually futile—attempt to stop the Turkish advance there, a policy where the fleet lacked a role. Consequently, the entire fleet was disbanded, its crews dismissed and the ships broken up or left to rot. The results were quick to follow: during Andronikos' long reign, the Turks gradually took permanent possession of the Aegean coasts of Anatolia, with the Empire unable to reverse the situation, while the Venetian fleet was able to attack Constantinople and raid its suburbs at will during the 1296–1302 war.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of the Napoleonic Wars, the East India Company {{arranged}} for letters of marque for its vessels such as the Lord Nelson. This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the Earl of Mornington, an East India Company packet ship of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>without.</b> To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

500|$|It {{was unclear}} if Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) would reprise their {{respective}} roles {{for which they}} won Academy Awards in The Silence of the Lambs (best actress/actor).

The withdrawal of both Foster and Hopkins could possibly have been terminal for the project, however. De Laurentiis confirmed this after the film's release: [...] "First and foremost, I knew we had no movie without Anthony Hopkins." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the {{new book}} were as {{complimentary}} as those for its predecessors. The Times Literary Supplement wrote, [...] "French Provincial Cooking needs to be read rather than referred to quickly. It discourses at some length the type and origin of the dishes popular in various French regions, as well as the culinary terms, herbs and kitchen equipment used in France. But those who can give the extra time to this book will be well repaid by dishes such as La Bourride de Charles Bérot and Cassoulet Colombié." [...] The Observer said that it was difficult to think of any home that <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> the book and called David [...] "a very special kind of genius".|$|E
500|$|Until around 1990, the North Korean state {{required}} every able-bodied male to {{be employed}} by some state enterprise. However, some 30% of married women of working age were allowed {{to stay at home}} as full-time housewives (less than some countries in the same region like South Korean \Japan and Taiwan, more than Soviet Union\Mainland China or Nordic countries like Sweden, about the same as Today's United States).) In the early 1990s, an estimated 600,000-900,000 people perished in the famine, which was largely a product of the North Korean government's unwillingness to reform the economy, and the old system began to fall apart. In some cases women began by selling household items they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> or homemade food. Today at least three-quarters of North Korean market vendors are women. A joke making the rounds in Pyongyang goes: 'What do a husband and a pet dog have in common?'

500|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} given a 15 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification, {{due to a}} minute-long scene where Logue encourages the King to shout profanities, which he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> stuttering. At the London Film Festival, Hooper criticised the decision, questioning how the board could certify the film [...] "15" [...] for bad language but allow films such as Salt (2010) and Casino Royale (2006) to have [...] "12A" [...] ratings, despite their graphic torture scenes. Following Hooper's criticism, the board lowered the rating to [...] "12A", allowing children under 12 years of age to see the film if they are accompanied by an adult. Hooper levelled the same criticism at the Motion Picture Association of America, which gave the film an [...] "R" [...] rating, preventing anyone {{under the age of}} 17 from seeing the film without an adult. In his review, Roger Ebert criticised the [...] "R" [...] rating, calling it [...] "utterly inexplicable", and wrote, [...] "This is an excellent film for teenagers." ...|$|E
500|$|The Norwegian Nobel Committee {{confirmed}} that Mahatma Gandhi {{was nominated for}} the Peace Prize in 1937–39, 1947, {{and a few days}} before he was assassinated in January 1948. Later, members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006, said, [...] "The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> the Nobel Peace prize. Whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question". In 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the grounds that [...] "there was no suitable living candidate" [...] that year. Later, when the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was [...] "in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi." [...] Other high-profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been missed out.

500|$|Gandhi did {{not receive}} the Nobel Peace Prize, {{although}} he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the American Friends Service Committee, though he made the short list only twice, in 1937 and 1947. Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award. Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that [...] "there was no suitable living candidate" [...] and later {{research shows that the}} possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, [...] "The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize.

2500|$|In 1928, Gândirea {{hosted the}} {{inflammatory}} [...] "White Lily" [...] Manifesto. It signaled the Poporanists' confrontation with a [...] "new generation" [...] of anti-rationalists, and Ralea's personal rivalry {{with one of}} the White Lily intellectuals, Petre Pandrea. Pandrea's Manifesto was at once a plea for aestheticism and mysticism, a critique of [...] "that famed social justice" [...] idea, and an explicit denunciation of Ralea, Ibrăileanu, Suchianu and the Sburătorul group as [...] "dry", [...] "barren", all too critical. Ralea answered with half-satirical comments: the country, he noted, <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> [...] "prophets" [...] with [...] "fun and interesting biases", but not without [...] "liberty, paved roads, justice and cleanliness in the streets". In his view, the Manifesto authors were modern-day Rasputins, prone to fanatical vandalism.|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn {{was able}} {{to hit the ball}} to all fields, but liked to hit balls the {{opposite}} way to the left, between third base and shortstop. Gwynn dubbed it the [...] "5.5 hole", since baseball scorekeeping designates third base using a 5 and shortstop with a 6. He preferred an outside pitch, waiting as long as possible and using his strong wrists to quickly hit the ball. He was not considered a home run hitter, reaching double-figures just five times, but he was a gap hitter with power to drive hits between outfielders. Opposing outfielders typically played him deep. Gwynn became a complete hitter after following Ted Willams' advice to drive inside pitches instead of finessing them, which Gwynn learned he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> sacrificing his average. He initially thought that home runs were [...] "boring", and he concentrated on his craft of making contact. However, Williams said Gwynn was [...] "wasting an opportunity", and convinced him to turn on inside fastballs more and capitalize on his strength and power pitchers pitching him inside. Applying Williams' approach, Gwynn employed the entire field, and was no longer satisfied with mostly hitting to left field. His home runs increased, and he drove in more runs. Forty-three of his 135 career home runs were in his final three full seasons (1997–99). Gwynn credited his later improvement to Williams and his book, The Science of Hitting, which he said that he read [...] "four or five times a year". He and Williams became friends, and they often talked for hours about hitting. Gwynn lamented not having met Williams earlier and possibly adjusting his hitting approach sooner.|$|E
