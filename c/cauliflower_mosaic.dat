25|$|Mahyco {{licensed}} {{and used}} the cry1Ac gene obtained from Monsanto and two supporting genes (nptII and aad). The cry1Ac gene is under the transcriptional control of an enhanced <b>cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter, which ensures the gene is expressed in all the brinjal's tissue throughout its complete life cycle. NptII and aad are selectable marker genes, nptII is used to identify transgenic plants from non-transgenic, and aad is used to identify the transformed bacteria used during {{the development of the}} construct. Aad contains a bacterial promoter and is not expressed in the Bt brinjal. The completed construct was inserted into young cotyledons from the brinjal plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated technique. Agrobacterium naturally inserts DNA into plants from its Ti plasmid, and scientists use this to insert genes of interest into various plants. The transformed plants were regenerated and analyzed for the presence of the gene through Southern blotting. The plants' progeny were also analyzed to identify lines segregating in a Mendelian fashion.|$|E

50|$|Caulimovirus is a genus of viruses, in {{the family}} Caulimoviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts.

50|$|The {{construct}} can {{be inserted}} in the plant genome by genetic recombination using the bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes, or by direct methods like the gene gun or microinjection. Using plant viruses to insert genetic constructs into plants is also a possibility, but the technique {{is limited by the}} host range of the virus. For example, <b>Cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus (CaMV) only infects cauliflower and related species. Another limitation of viral vectors is that the virus is not usually passed on the progeny, so every plant has to be inoculated.|$|E
50|$|Plant viruses {{may be used}} as vectors {{since the}} Agrobacterium method does not work for all plants. Examples of plant virus used are the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), potato virus X, and cowpea mosaic virus.

50|$|<b>Cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus {{possesses}} {{a number of}} mechanisms that allow it to counteract host plant cell defenses. While the pregenomic 35S RNA is responsible for genome replication by reverse transcriptase, it also contains a non-coding 600 base pair leader sequence that serves as an important mRNA {{for the production of}} factors involved in viral counter-defense. A number of hosts of CaMV possess small RNA-based viral silencing mechanisms that serve to limit viral infection. The products of the aforementioned 600-bp sequence are viral small RNAs (vsRNA) of 21, 22, and 24 nucleotides in length that serve as decoys, binding and inactivating effectors of host silencing machinery, such as Argonaute 1 (AGO1). As proof-of-principle, experimental overexpression of these vsRNAs allows for increased viral accumulation in infected plants.|$|E
50|$|Ribosome {{shunting}} is {{a mechanism}} of translation initiation in which ribosomes physically bypass, or shunt over, {{parts of the}} 5' untranslated region to reach the initiation codon. This enables viruses to have more information than usual in an mRNA molecule.Some viral RNAs {{have been shown to}} use ribosome shunting as a more efficient form of translation during certain stages of viral life cycle or when translation initiation factors are scarce (e.g. cleavage by viral proteases). Some viruses known to use this mechanism include adenovirus, Sendai virus, human papillomavirus, duck hepatitis B pararetrovirus, rice tungro bacilliform viruses, and <b>cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus. In these viruses the ribosome is directly translocated from the upstream initiation complex to the start codon (AUG) without the need for eIF4A helices activity to unwind RNA secondary structures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus (CaMV) is {{the type}} species of the family Caulimoviridae. This family is grouped {{together}} with Hepadnaviruses into the Pararetrovirus group due to its mode of replication via reverse transcription of a pre-genomic RNA intermediate. CaMV infects mostly plants of the Brassicaceae family (such as cauliflower and turnip) but some CaMV strains (D4 and W260) are also able to infect Solanaceae species of the genera Datura and Nicotiana. CaMV induces a variety of systemic symptoms such as mosaic, necrotic lesions on leaf surfaces, stunted growth, and deformation of the overall plant structure. The symptoms exhibited {{vary depending on the}} viral strain, host ecotype, and environmental conditions. CaMV is transmitted in a non-circulatory manner by aphid species such as Myzus persicae. Once introduced within a plant host cell, virions migrate to the nuclear envelope of the plant cell.|$|E
50|$|These genetically {{modified}} plants with Bt toxin are grown {{on a large}} scale around the world. Monsanto’s corn line MON810 is produced by ballistically transforming another corn line with a plasmid, PV-ZMCT01. This plasmid has a <b>cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus 35S promoter and hsp70 maize intron sequences which drive the expression of the Cry1Ab gene. The gene then codes for delta endotoxins (Cry proteins) which are toxins that are very potent and provoke lesions in the cell membrane causing cell death These produced Bt toxins bind to certain localized sites on the epithelium of the midgut of insects. Proteins need specific receptors on cells in order to form the Cry proteins and become toxic, which is why the toxins are specific for the order Lepidoptera. The receptors are important for binding the toxic protein and starting the signal cascade, but the exact mechanism of these toxins is not well understood.|$|E
50|$|Mahyco {{licensed}} {{and used}} the cry1Ac gene obtained from Monsanto and two supporting genes (nptII and aad). The cry1Ac gene is under the transcriptional control of an enhanced <b>cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter, which ensures the gene is expressed in all the brinjal's tissue throughout its complete life cycle.

50|$|At {{this point}} the new viral genome can either be {{packaged}} into capsids and released from the cell or they can be transported by movement proteins into an adjacent, uninfected cell. The <b>Cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus promoter (CaMV 35S) is used in most transgenic crops to activate foreign genes which have been artificially inserted into the host plant. It is inserted into transgenic plants in a form which {{is different from that}} found when it is present in its natural Brassica plant hosts. This enables it to operate {{in a wide range of}} host-organism environments which would otherwise not be possible. CaMV contains about 8 kb double-strand DNA genome and produces spherical particles. CaMV infections are systemic, and even its DNA is infectious when inoculated on abraded plant surfaces. The CaMV genome has 8 tightly packed genes, of which only two small genes, genes II and VII, are nonessential; as a result, only these two genes can be replaced/deleted without a loss of infectivity. In addition, modified CaMV genomes exceeding the natural genome size (8024 bp) by even a few hundred bp are not packaged into virions. These two factors seriously limit the size of DNA insert clonable in CaMV. The bacterial dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene has been successfully cloned into the CaMV genome, in place of gene II, and has been successfully expressed in plants.|$|E
50|$|Translation of <b>Cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus (CaMV) 35S RNA is {{initiated}} by a ribosome shunt. The 35S RNA of CaMV contains a ~600nt leader sequence which contains 7-9 short open reading frames (sORFs) {{depending on the}} strain. This long leader sequence {{has the potential to}} form an extensive complex stem-loop structure, which is an inhibitory element for expression of following ORFs. However, translation of ORFs downstream of the CaMV 35S RNA leader has been commonly observed. Ribosome shunting model indicates with the collaboration of initiation factors, ribosomes start scanning from capped 5’-end and scans for a short distance until it hits the first sORF. The hairpin structure formed by leader brings the first long ORF into the close spatial vicinity of a 5’-proximal sORF. After read through sORF A, the 80S scanning ribosome disassembles at the stop codon, which is the shunt take-off site. The 40S ribosomal subunits keep combining with RNA, and bypass the strong stem-loop structural element, land at the shunt acceptor site, resume scanning and reinitiate at the first long ORF. 5’-proximal sORF A and the stem-loop structure itself are two essential elements for CaMV shunting 5. sORFs with 2-15 codons, and 5-10 nts between sORF stop codon and the base of the stem structure are optimal for ribosome shunting, while the minimal (start-stop) ORF does not promote shunting.|$|E

Moreover, a point mutation of the proline at position 118 sharply reduced the interaction between the viral protein and DNA.

40|$|The {{translation}} of viral mRNAs by host ribosomes {{is essential for}} infection. Hence, codon usage of virus genes may influence efficiency of infection. In addition, composition of nucleotides in the third position within codons of genes can reflect evolutionary relationships. In this study, third position codon composition was examined for the seven genes of eight <b>Cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus isolates. Genes IV–VII had similar codon composition values and were termed Class 1 genes. Genes I–III possessed corresponding codon composition values and were termed Class 2 genes. The codon composition values of Class 1 and genes differed significantly. Neither Class 1 nor Class 2 genes had codon composition values identical {{to that of the}} host plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. However, Class 1 genes possessed codon composition values closer to those of the host than Class 2 genes. Examination of the genomes of three Rous sarcoma virus isolates indicated that codon composition values were similar for the gag, pol, and env genes but these genes differed significantly from the src genes. Since codon composition values for Rous sarcoma virus distinguished a ‘‘foreign’ ’ gene {{from the rest of the}} viral genome, it is possible that the <b>Cauliflower</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus genome is composed of genes from two different sources.
