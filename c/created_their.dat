50|$|Ramtha's {{claim that}} every person can learn to <b>create</b> <b>their</b> own reality is itself a {{philosophical}} paradox. Julian Baggini, in his book The pig that wants to be eaten, argues that if everyone was capable of <b>creating</b> <b>their</b> own realities with their minds, it would be problematic as one person could then create a reality in which no one was allowed to <b>create</b> <b>their</b> own realities.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, Friday the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have <b>created</b> <b>their</b> own Friday the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with Friday the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in horror and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Farke and {{his colleagues}} in 2014 {{published}} {{a description of a}} new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They <b>created</b> <b>their</b> own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} match the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams, dominating in possession {{and the number of}} chances created. Tottenham <b>created</b> <b>their</b> best chance to score in the first half, but struggled to find a breakthrough in the second half, hardly troubling the Arsenal defence. With neither team able to score after 90 minutes, the match ended in a draw, meaning each team held the trophy for six months each.|$|E

5|$|Folk-stories told in {{the nineteenth}} century about elves are still told in modern Denmark and Sweden, but now feature ethnic {{minorities}} in place of elves in an essentially racist discourse. In an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside, supernatural beings provided the Other through which everyday people <b>created</b> <b>their</b> identities; in cosmopolitan industrial contexts, ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in storytelling to similar effect.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} protection of his patent rights. Even though he lawfully held the only patent on a revolver, scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly in litigation. In {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company's transition to the cartridge system and blocked other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they <b>created</b> <b>their</b> own.|$|E
